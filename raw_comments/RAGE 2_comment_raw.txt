appreciate any and all support you show this video ill be playing this alongside postending days gone and plague tale much love to all of you i love your enthusiasm on this game cause i love it too d but why controller it is kind of a pain in the ass even when watching this looking at bottom whilst slowly spinning gets me kind of motion sick and you cant tell me you do that because you are better on controller than on mouse because that is beginner level mouse movement sry but true the only reason for controller would be a comfortable place on the couch wait minute i didnt know brad lived in georgia or even kennesaw thank god there are only 1 subscriber beggers here watch dogs legion far cry new dawn rage 2 and cyberpunk2077 are the most graphically identical games ever i wonder at what level of difficulty you are playing i love how they completely ignore the female ranger when she dies 1020 biggest attack ever yet takes soldiers off to do mediocre tasks hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm wonder why only 20 survivors personally its the best game ive ever played by far although i wanted to ask does anybody elses glitch like crazy without you trying to glitch it on purpose like mine does i could tell you all kinds of crazy shit it does if somebody elses does to cause im in the same boat im getting this game trw as soon as i saw that giant monster i was like i was meant for this the intro reminds me of transformers for some reason im downloading this game right now is this game still smooth kinda like bulletstorm in a way badass i like how a skull pops up in the crosshairs to let you know the targets dead im so glad they remembered rage theradbrad you said just what i was thinking about cyberpunk being just like ragehere hahaha you a mindreader rb so everything i tried to stop in the other game came back almost everything are in this game micro transactions or not i hope not the rage 2 for ps4 i got got a glitch when walker meets marshall in the bar the girl is not there just her voice does anyone know how to fix the glitch hi i need the xbox rage 2 hey radbrad dont always aim down sights thats the secondary fire thing need this game 550 if he play it at 025 his head disappears 110 ign the character your playing as in this game is the person how voiced spiderman in the amazing spiderman 1 2 video games the heck kinda game is this i bought a copy and some how every enemy npc in the game is always dead when i arrive but seriously someone help i usually play on the hardest difficulty but this is just bullshit on max difficult cuz i cant even get pass the fucking intro thing cuz every fucking enemy is a fucking bullet sponge im loving your accent were are you from i dont watch every play through but i always appreciate how brad acknowledges the community and how he always gives back a little something at the beginning of a series thanks brad why do you play every game like a bitch this game is weird farcry 5 doom rage 2 glad i passed on this game it being 6 month is there still a chance to win the rage 2 game for ps4 how you shoot this thing rage was the best game of 2011 now rage 2 dead rising 2 2 years ago finally female its 35 now love your video i started at the beginning brad i dont even know where to start sorry i dont understand it i dont get what you have to get find or do and you get money on missions i found your channel when i was looking for rage 1 gameplay 10m sub an he still suck at gaming wtf brad all of the bethesda shooters have this same kind of feel they are all super fast 60 frames me an intellectual i guess youve never played on a toaster dude i beat the first rage full game dlc included goty edition but it made it seem like their was more to do good thing they made a second one love to see it played cant wait to play it myself one day when i can afford it lol is it just me or is the first mission just the flood nest from halo 3 dudesrly brad rockslike hell ya love this dude the stars of this game is making me think this is gonna be alot different than rage 1 what difficulty are you on and it feels so fast bc your fov field of view is turned hella up for some reason you gotta turn it down it makes it so you can see more out the sides of your screen peripherals it says why does everyone watch this like hunting ding dong her not just any ranger the jersey he died right way ive been watching your channel since you began i would love to have rage for xbox 1 get yo ass to tha courtyard i died then you are awesome i love your channel it is the best gaming channel i really like your channel so much i found your channel dead rising been here ever since i found your channel when u did askham asylum and been subbed since then keep up the good work almost everyone you have met have a chance to die in this game just got rage 2 today and i am really enjoying the game so much played for 4 hrs and didnt want to stop done a few missions and exploring the map but what a great game cant wait to get back on after work tomorrow wow this looks bad what resolution are you running the intro416 when she said this is the big one i get excitedlol 1103 thats what she said has rage had there auguest update yet the melee is so bad even the supply crates dont die id are the best in fps games no doubt guess who just got 20 missed calls from their ex my ex she did i saw it before launch and seeing it now i still think it looks good but dosent feel too much like a rage game at least based on how rage 1 was but at least it looks like a good game so far i remember playing rage on xbox 360 the nostalgia jumped out 635 pausedthat gui i hope im not too late i found your channel years ago i cant remember the year it was when you did dayz anyways thanks for posting i love id softwares games including the first rage i think the cutscenes are bad female gets killed right at the start main character doesnt give a shit so real to life huh is this game worth getting i just finished rage and decided to watch a game walk through of rage 2 to see if i should get it im like right there at the buy mark sweet thanks for video cant wait for this game peace theres so much buligrint screening that i am going to go deaff i found your channel when you played rage you have helped me a lot through a lot of where the fuck is loosum hagar why does this look like far cry new dawn you were playing

channel bro hey what were your settings etc and sensitivity on for this im on xbox picked up rage 2 today for 2999 im looking forward to the carnival of chaos having only just finished the main story of days gone brad what are your pc specs so if you playing on pc that means you have illegal copy of that game as controls are all for playstation well done pirate i have been subscribed to you chanle since you were at 10 k im just curious what are your pc specs crysis and titanfall merged together awesome portal 2 was my first encounter with you man i would love a third game from them voice of

have been watching for over 7 years i really got into watching you when u came out with the og rage gameplay since call of duty i loved the first rage loved far cry 3 loved the first borderlands but

you ive been watching you for a few years hey like your channel but not a fan of some choice u make but still like the channel and been here since about 2016 to 2017 ok by have a great day was anyone

honestly its not bad far cry rage 2 i love how they just kill npcs like its no big deal i like how they reintroduced the main character from the first game 1105 thats what she said i was here in 2014 1057 sounds like the start of a bad porno i found your channel 2 years ago i found your channel in 2012 and i subscribed when you played far cry 3 have been a fan since then walker texan ranger episode where haley joel osment had aids no one cares that the other character just straight up dies in the begging i found your channel when i was looking for portal vids so awhile ago lmao skyrim og

coming out out of everything here that science tells me is wrong especially the giant and minigiant that should be dying from an internal cave in as those organs or heavy and their muscles heavier kinetic blasting someone off of your bean bayonetish wristblade irks me then most and pushing or pulling someonesomeones corpse of feel more personal and climatic so idk it kinda just felt less

game awesome found your channel about 3 years ago now keep up the awesome work aj found your youtube wen you did uncharted thifs end i watched you when you started walking dead 1828 how small is this guy john marshall john marston rip that chick at the start no one gave shit idk if im to late to win the free copy but i found your channel at 807pm mountain time im on xbox just in case dead rising 2 yeah hey brad youre a massive inspiration ive learnt a lot of things from watching your playthroughs i have been watching you since nightmare house 2 a very long time the 504 dislikes are from muties i always want to call him john marston for some reason thats just the way it is made me think a lot about arthur and the amazing soundtrack to rdr2 i found your channel in 2015 why wasnt marshall voiced by the same guy hes easy to cast female protag gets killed by the door in two seconds after choosing come on man i loved the serious tone of the original hope its still there i also liked the silent protag from the original the first game had a lot of driving as i remember i dont remember any buildings just driving and time trials cyberpunk has changed it isnt what they showed on there trailer they had to make changes because parts were not working right so they had to redue the game now its something different i remember that driving area it was on a timer system which sucked the first game had several timers to complete thats why i dislike the game this game doesnt play into the first game i dont see that it does been here about 2 years i made a cool commentary in my head when ranger jersey died he died with a dumb name pretty cool huh i found your channel around 201516 i found the channel when u had 5k i found you chanal 1 year ago i found your channel when i was looking for gameplay for dying light and i watched the video after watching i ended up getting the game oof game is nothing in line with the first i found your channel back when you started infamous

scarier in the first game hey brad i found your channel way back when you played prototype 2 and have been watching on and off since then how short is the game watched u since evil within 1 or dying light this game looks so beautiful im literally busy with exams and im watching this lol did anyone else even notice the woman in the bigining gets smashed by the door wtf are you using a mouse man to play your aim is just so clean and true one year ago so very sad but inevitable that it seems there is indeed at least some estrogen subtly permeating most aspects of this game but then that is the case these daze with all of society dont u think the fov too close got setting to change that i want to buy hehe found your channel 3 years back in call of duty black ops 3 been a major fan ever since heh dumbass thinks you can see above 60 fps in real life so it would matter in a game also turn autoaim off this is so good i need this game i found your channel about 2 years ago my game version is pc and this video dont help me i found your channel in 2014 im 14 now and have duchennes muscular dystrophy ok so i have a question for people that play on xbox one do you need xbox live to play the game fuck yes dude please do a series on rage i will watch them nope probably fun to play not watch rage one was nothing like this so far dont like it hate the actors character voice it might change over time ow by the way the earth is flat youve been lied to all our lives i was one of them just like you it was hard to know the truth the earth being flat is just one of the many lies as far as i know i dont know whats outside of the dome called firmament i believe more in inner earth now than space if you like a download in truth i will share my knowledge rage one was great looking forward to this i would love this on xbox and i started watching a little over a year ago ive been following since your far cry primal hope i win that xbox copy of rage 2 lol buuuuut i never win the freebies lol

you play dying light at some point but overall just love your gameplays been here for 4 years ooooof i actually found your channel when you did the first game never regretted the decision when i first clicked i was only 8 now im 16 and your videos helped me through a lot of tough times in life even if i dont win i just wanna say thank you for all that youve done for the yt community rage 1 was when i first found your channel brad dude i was iffey about this when i first saw the first one as pretty cool but you make it sooo worth wanting to buy it now who else just finished watching days gone graphics look horrible the dude sounds like the main character from far cry 3 game almost seems like far cry 5 but on da next level i was here when brad was the pro chair thrower in dead rising a long time ago i think in 2013 i found u during ur destiny 1 gameplay hey my name is josh and i found your channel in 2011 when you were playing saints row makes zero sensehow yall let that big nigga sneak up on you like that found your channel when you did batman arkham city love your videos keep it up man found u awhile ago watch u bc i dont have enough money for most of these games i told myself i wasnt going to watch any of this game but i cant help myself been here since the start of prototype 2 and youre the only walkthrough youtuber i ever watch love the content brad edit i wasnt going to watch any of rage 2 in the theory of avoiding any spoilers i absolutely loved the first rage and im sure rage 2 would be no different found your channel in 2013 im still here just on a different account lol btw how is our fav little buddy chubbs hype channel like that u try so many games on here and not just one started watching for dying light and been watching ever since i think the first vid was the god of war series i luv your channel brad so desperate to win sumthing during exam times its interesting to see a fantasy game filled with testosterone intoxicated woman i guess all man died in the previous war except for the gay ones i love your game play new borderlands or this game wonder dat girl in the thumbnail tho what youve been in kennessaw state university nothing can hide cobras pride i mean it u good ive always luved your channel youre more interactive with viewers keep it up from bo3 uve been my fav ps4 hey brad i think ive been watching you since infamous second son its funny to think man but ive basically been watching you for 6 years not religiously or whatever but whenever a new game comes out you always seem to get your hands on it first and i can only imagine a significant portion of your views coming from peoples wishing to get a quick look at the game to judge its quality and thats what you are i have a feeling cyberpunk will play a lot like rage idk but this game is shit radbrad i hope you read this and know that your biggest fan loves watching your videos rage 2 looks awesome keep doing a great job we love you long family funny hearing the voice of donetello and peter parker in rage as a ranger around 2016 did the female character just get bodied by the door wait thats yasuos voice right its like a repeat of watch dogs watch dogs theres gang and i wont rest until there all dead watch dogs 2 man who gives a fuck lets drink theradbrad is great but this game is trash should never be compared to cyberpunk found you through resident evil rc just finished this game 65 out of 10 for me its a good game but repetitive and what you have to do for the last mission is in my eyes pretty stupid anyway have fun playing game looks amazing from a graphics standpoint this reminds me more of doom than wolfenstein damn this game already looks rly good i found this channel just today love your work i found your chanel in 2016 may 5 i found you

is all the first game a meteor called apophis hit earth people predicted it so they hid in capsules called arks under the earth to save themselves unfortunately the calculations of these arks went wrong also one ark was purposefully designed to rise up early and control the new worldthat became the authority bad guys when apophis hit survivors became seperate into gangs and tribes and clansmany of which went mad and had their own views on what apophis had meant there were also mutated freaks in the cities the humans who remained sane set up outposts and homes where they could nicholas raine was the sole survivor of an ark that awoke far later than all the the othersso he had no idea what everything waswho the authority washe was just a confused guy in a wasteland of lunatics the people in the arks were led to believe they would wake to a new day and together would work to a new agewell that needless to say never happened tihs look like far cry 5 on mars i first fount your channel

good at shooting enemiescool do update this one too continue the story i found your channel when u played watch dogs i found your channel in 2013 was really impressed with your content and enthusiasm thats put in your videos found it when u started playing gta v and i needed help i would like it on xbox or ps up 2 u dont game is trash been following since 2009 this game like far cry new dawn minnesota punk 2077 be a little different than that theres going to be some things like that but not too much but summertime is more based off like the witcher series for a good example for a about it but i dont know im not a hundred percent sure in my bacon looks completely different nice play brad found you through a friend about 2 years ago so glad they told me about this channel damn this game is brutal am i the only one that is really tired of shooting violent futuristic gameslike those are some talented developers and the graphics are superb and amazing but the storylines and plain and lacking it does not stick out from the other 1m high tech games even the characters feel the same just better quality watching the game plague tale was it that brad is playing really makes me realize how people have become numb to violence and death before 2009 people would have gone eww at rage 2 especially with such amazing graphics but now its so meh nothing special just another death like walking dead game the first season had great storyline next seasons graphics better but the storylines got so plain plague tale had a good story line i am so glad brad plays it the game deserves some attention developers should try to concentrate on storylines and the relationships between characters rather instead of making games that have been done over 1m times already if they dont have a good writing love the game rage i want the game found you chanel when you began playing the evil whiten 2 found your channel in 2015 i would love this game for my ps4 it looks amazing i found your channel when your were half way through bioshock infinite i only found you recently to be honest during your division 2 play through immediately became a fan of yours always good energy and amazing effort in

you for far cry 3 vids after days gone in rage 2 i think the reactions of the characters are very how to say it poor not good at all for me at least at the start with the dead ranger after that is ok

first video hope you do more played the first game way back and have been waiting for this release i found this channel like 5 years ago and watch all the time my only criticism so far is that it seems like the story is really rushed its seems like a lot of the plot happens in the first hour maybe im wrong as i dont know what the rest of the game has to hold but it seems to me at they could have stretched out the beginning a little bit i love your videos and you impacted me personally i found your channel when you played saints rows the third keep up the great work much love to you found your channel when you started to play fallout 4 it was a great series i found u in titanfall videos just came from watching days gone picked up the game cause of you been watching since you played

fast and awesome gameplay i found your channel during last of us the first video i ever watched of yours was your play through of dying light back when it first came out would love to win this game because i cant afford it right now but if not i keep watching your vids just like days gone i would enjoy further game play walk through of rage 2 i think a lot of us are concerned about and game play progress that is hindered by microtransactions loot boxes etcthat limits enjoyment but from what ive seen here it does look interesting if mtx is limited to cosmetic things then thats not a deal breaker it looks fun please do more with this game im wondering about other side missions and replayability etc also pc specs of those who are playing it especially on the amd side of hardware ive watched some of your videos before borderlands i think always fun to see knowledgeable gamers tactics and hear their comments thanks i found your channel after the far cry primal series if i win id

having a spectacular time watching love your vids keep up the work hey brad nice gameplay brad lets do this yes im early i love your gameplay theradbrad im first oh hey i wish it had online still having a blast tho finished the game andthe shooting felt great with the beginning of the game seeming very promising and fun the color palette was pleasing to the eyes with the forest sections of the map being the best areasbut the world felt very empty the story was average at best not much incentive to go explore except for weapons and some upgrades i found myself driving the main vehicle without the need to obtain others the story also felt short i got tired of doing the repetitive side activities and decided to complete the main story saying to myself itll pick back up itll get better as i go only to realize i was on the last mission since the game doesnt flesh out the characters including the main antagonist i didnt get a feeling of satisfaction when the credits rolled if they plan of doing a rage 3 i wouldnt mind if they took the layoutstory of the first game and combined it with the graphics mechanics gameplay of the second rage 2 is really stupid this game is the best game ive ever played it ticks every box and even boxes i didnt even know i had on my list my review is 1010 five extra gold stars doc sounds like dracula why it feels like im watching far cry new dawn gameplay trailer will you guys review this game fairly or let some nutcake nongamer write another piece inked in feces god had turned his back on humanity long ago who thought that was a good idea to say come on now i wouldnt push anything on anyone so the flipside to that is being respectful this trailer in a trailer xd the speaking head is awesome fucking kill i thought he would say that 121 well i see why hes called walker i preordered a long time ago when the music started i was expecting someone to crack open a beer wasnt big on the first one this one looks better though i might give it a try why the fuck is it called rage 2 this has fukcing nothing to do with the original now there is only one thing left to do fuck some shit up whats this game about greatest intro ever a great looking game where you can just act as insane as you want get ready to rage the last ranger is named walker godchuch norris mode the first e3 trailer is totally epic day one purchase for my xbox one x we asked for this avalanche make a new twisted metal already just finished playing the original rage on ps3 for like the 3rd time its that damn good and if rage 2 is anywhere near the original its gonna be awesome fuck yeah andrew wk rage 1 is better but now different bandits and a different city and where did the bandits find hare color thing i think if they make an update to rage 1 and make thes game al love it will it be a multiplayer one word sick 314 did they seriously feel the fucking need to include an advertisement for their merch in the gameplay trailer disgusting i honestly cant wait for this game better than every fallout except 3 rage is one of my all time favorite games so pumped destiny 3 is here im just a bit nervous that it will be to easy i know its just a trailer but the ai just seems to run right into your bullets the footage ive seen they barely get a shot off before getting blown into pieces they really should show the handing you your ass at least once in these has this got a co op or online reminds me of bioshock but way more gritty just how i like it i love id software cant wait for this one it feels more like doom than rage not necessarily that this is a bad thing as i am a huge doom fan eagerly waiting for the next installment but i would like rage 2 to be more realistic than doom for rage the character feels way too overpowered in doom this doesnt matter on the contrary as the setting is anyway totally scififantastic it wouldve been best if this game had been made with a survival focus like stalkermetro compared to full guns blazing like it is now maybe a good fallout until the 3rd including clone set in the rage universe or something like this anyway not bad but certainly not the best this game look fucking awesome are u hypes for crash team racing nitro fueled oxide edition or what the story is so unlogic that it hurts all is damged but they all have weapons and ammo but from where it comes the cars are more advanced than todays army vehicle but there is no factory wich produce wheels made of oil deep in the earth metal and so the punks have robot arms where is the hospital who implants them the arms this is so unlogic that i cant play this game 100 oh man thats badass looks so so cool good thing id gives gives a fk about games still fallout doom lemme know when the gotye hits 20 for a yfold copy cant wait this looks nuts and much better than the first rage not that it was bad ill most likely buy this its going to be a wonderful year 2019 the apocalypse never was so fun i love rage and cant wait to play rage 2 and this looks better than the first one seven years waiting 354 is that marcus munitions fallout on drugs with a side of vehicles rage is to rage 2 like portal was for portal 2 please tell me they have the wingsticks from rage 1 is this made by id software the devs of mad max and doom teaming up sweet this game looks promising never tried rage but looking forward to this one remaster 1st one aswellllll and id they know how to tune perfectly mouse keyboard gaming looks really good not gonna buy it though ya know i dont all my information leaked to people on the internet call of mad duty max so can i pick up weapons and ammo from a bad guy fresh killed or boooring buy in store rage 1 was so eyecandy kinda boring to me this be co op or anything or just single one thing left to dorage111111 i hope theres coop they are ruining games by making them to futuristic still buying it though so overwatchs hardcore brother the real question is is the single player story and full map on 2 fucking discs this actually looks good believe it or not i dont like that it feels like bulletstorm the weapons look too fancy the original weapons were a combo of old tech and new tech i preferred the look of the old ar shotgun looks fine the abilities idk how to feel if your character is wearing a lightweight exo suit or something itd make sense and be somewhat lore friendly enemies seem dumber the enemies in rage actually made good attempts to dodge your fire the vehicles i love that bit they smashed but the overall combathmmm well have to see also idk if this a bit of a spoiler but one of the locations is called gunbarrel a place that according to vadel at the hagar settlement tells you he went to visit soooooooooo old man dan hagar possibly this is the game engine bethesda should use to replace there creation engine fallout 5 yes bulletstorm is back if nothing else i will buy this for the vehicles with weapons been wanting a good combat racing game just wish the theme was scifi instead of junkyard apocalypse i fucking loved rage i used to play it soooo much on my ps3 back in the days im so sad to see this cause this just looks like a destiny ripoff to me i understand that its in the future but atleast called it a different game cause this has nothing to do with rage whatsoever fallout franchise fucked up with 76 gays but another sun rises now but is looks like destiny 2 and borderlands had a baby this would be an awesome multiplayer game the enemy seem very stupid hope it wont be like this bulletstorm after taking all drugs in existance at once each in a lethal dose for a fucking ozzy osbourne oh and andrew wk is there so insert hellsing meme here or something this game has to be at least 6 different disc the rendering of the video is awfull it looks like a 480p video and they tried to make it 1080p mad max on steroids someone tell me why bethesda arnt using this engine for their next games whats going on here i cant understand anything at all looks like hell want been waiting for rage 2 for so long now but now im not looks goofy really goofy and you have powers yea thanks for another disappointment bethesda another game ruined it wasnt global warming the old one looks better also i wonder if there is gonna be the mutant arena any way to play third person or is it strictly fps this game looks like if doom guy was given free reign to wander about in an open world zombie game lets hope they knock it out the park with this one although i havent personally played the first game from reviews and reputation i hear it had a lot of pitfalls lets hope the second game doesnt fall short aswell i bet rage 2 will be on a switch too thatll be awesome wtf i just saw is there will be a weapon skins 00 omg its not a rage toxic colors borderlands style da fug where is rusty scrapstyle cars oh no what happened to grenades to many effects used in explosions 1st rage was really good vs good plot better than shitty borderlands story seems to be as generic as possible yep halo meets mass effect fallout 5 confirmed is this seriously the second game the other rage coz this is fckin incredible a major step up from the last one first one had an amazing concept i could look past all the negatives but i hope its harder and better then the first i grew playing the first rage game and now when i saw this i was rlly happy cuz i waited all this time for it who the hell is the voice actor its driving me nuts i just hate the neon mohawks its a wasteland why does every have no water or food but endless amounts of hairdye youd think wasteland bandits would want to look badass not like tumblrinas can wait for this game the game is deadass ruined im waiting this for fing 9 years anyone knows the specs of the pc running this demo mad max is that you yes i ve been waiting for 2 its all about the rage in this day and age i bought rage for ps3 at gamestop this weekend 299 i have played about 11 hours so far and i cant believe i missed this game the first time around rage kicks ass this is madmax2 return of single player fuck fallout online nice but downgrade welcome holy shit im slightly turned on fuck i was looking for the cyberpunk gameplay vid this looks like well nothing in comparison who is here after watching cyberpunk 2077 gameplay to compare ill show u a rare artifact looks more like a sequel to doom get a life you bozos at bethseda avalance etc go sell burgers you may be better at that i hope this is better then the first one please man can we create our own band of raiders and be the antagonists just once people are no longer allowed to make open world games without avalanche and id honestly they took to long with rage 2 it was an awesome game that deserved a sequel but i think this is a bit late loved rage 1 cant wait for rage 2 the game play dificultie looks to easy for me this looks slick as shit damn plz make this game multiplayer in story is there any companion system cause i hate travelling alone falloutastroids subscribe my new games channel support me friends is composed of mad maxenvironment just cause red faction driving bulletstormcore game play is there a version where its like just a trailer and no lady talking so is walker basically doomguy but with a voice cooperated by mad max coool oh bethesda why wont you leave my wallet alone you see that mountain y o u c a n d r i v e i t one major issue the enemys all look like bullet sponges one big detail in rage1 i enjoyed was the reaction enemys had when you shot them they would limp or arm would be thrown back etc it added so much to feel and help separate it self from other first person shooters of that time would still today i hope that can be polished in if not ill still love to see what rage 2 is all about 10 000 says the finished game wont even look as good as prealpha rage is my first game at steam 2013 i hope rage 2 can beautiful than rage people are unrealistically bullet spongy whats he shooting bbs this looks intensely like every shooter ive played in the past couple years ill pass loved the first rage yeah its going to be fantastic never played the first one i may need to check that out yup i certainly hope that i can modify the appearance and performance of the car like in mad max imagine an obsidian fallout game made in this engine wishing mick gordon could be involved in the soundtrack wait hes taking down the authority wasnt the ending to rage that you took down the authority edit nvm you just activated the other arks avalanche studios so the same people behind just cause ok this looks fucking awesome ive played through rage a hundred times this new version looks like a killing breakneck explosion fest kids will love it an m esrb means nothing after all i hope there are likable npcs like dan and sally and mick and sarah and kvasir i hope you play as mental as the bad guys they don ruined the game rage 1 forever finally its being made the first one i pulled 2 sick days just to play it and herb out brilliant game the graphics were good but on rage 2 they look intense keep up the good work guys i love how the main character sounds pissed they should add the bulletstorm rank system and grapple hook also im bought sold on amazon well at least the colors are not washed out anymore thats a good sign cool they seem to have put allot of detail into the vehicle combat thats what made the first rage stand out better than fallout 76 bro looki will buy borderlands 3 over this every time but i want this tooooo life isnt fair are they going to give back the defibrillator definitely a game to look forward to it was a fucking asteroid am i the only one that hopes that mini game card game returns to this game i loved it in the first one is aaron paul the voice of the protagonist rage 1 was so disappointing this game has a very low bar to clear i expect at least the post apocaliptic atmosphere from rage 1 im gonna cry rage 2 the first rage was raw as hell damn 2019 here i was hoping this gem would be released soon what the actual fuck this looks insane i bet the open world has a lot of dead wasteland space but still the combat looks sooo much fun too much greenery too much of open space where is that feel of being in an apocalyptic world the rusty environment the claustrophobic greyish and brownish color palette the bandits are looking like young punks driven out of their houses by their parents even the rock structures are different i am not a person who complains about changesbutwhere is rage the way we had seen it a game so very underrated i did not like doom 2016 for similar reasons i have a feeling i will not find rage in this game as well i will just have to play as if it was some other fps game i swear if i have to do a thousand races to buy bullets im moving on whats the name of the song that played at the end mad maxjust cause 4 rage 2 okay i thought rage 1 was extremely boring but this looks cool hope it will run at 60 with 1080 man i thought fallout 3 on the switch would have been released on the switch tf andrew wk makes me want this this is not rage world its a new game with the new world there is nothing from that first real world affter the metheorit falling its tooo cyberpanky im didt seen realistik post apocalyse world its trying to ged copy of cyberpunk or something like that with bulletstorm and borderlands peaces im where realy happy when i hear about rage 2 but now im known tht i will not buy this game cus i love rage but this is not rage at all this game have 4 from that first game that i loved sorry for my bad eng this metro lou2 rdr2 and death stranding got me feeling suicidal looks awesome but wont be like the original one get ready to die get ready to die gotta love 70fov console gameplay for a supposedly intense game the first game was amazing hope this one is to meet my new gf rage 2 this better be much more better that the last one because they barely had guns and it didnt really had an open world rage 1 a 100times better dont know why everybody hates it tbh i am really disappointed wow this was my favorite ps3 game wonder if theyll bring back the mutant bash tv crysis bulletstorm rage 2 shit omg i was waiting for it so many years hell yeaaaaaahhh looks like fallout except stuff is modernseems good but was the first this damn crazy too welcome to mad max but your a wizard as long as the shooting is as good as in the original im down that game has possibly the best gunplay of any fps fuck glory kills eh seems mediocre goes to replay borderlands 2 instead rage is basically doom with more crazy metal its doom but more pink and crazy i like it rage is the best wasteland game in history despite their playful appearance they are very very dangerous proceed to massacre them all holy fuck the first game was good im hyped for this one most of the games people are saying influenced this game came out after the first rage game lol there are noticeable differences but rage 1 was the major influencethe noticeable changes are a result of applying upgradedcurrent animations voice acting and using a new enginelooks sick well time to play the first rage plays too much like doom and not enough like rage but will those bladed boomerang things from the first game be in it will rage 2 feature the rc bomb cars now thats more like it in regards to the vehicles there has to be a way to customize yourself to look like thise guys damn man pastel punk is sick im down for it god turned his back on humanity long ago it wasnt a war it was a global warming it was a fucking asteroid i was born on this shithole parents murdered an orphan of this wasteland an army of mutants killed everyone i ever loved all thats left is hate fear and the need for survival you see part of growing up was watching everything get taken from me and i stood by did nothing and now im the last ranger of this wasteland and theres only one thing left to do walker 2185 fuck ya buddy long as theres no stupid elves mutants running at me with dynamite in both hands dumbest shit ive ever seen from someone like id the game looks amazing i hope i can still craft spider bots and turrets my uncle is a fan of rage 1 im defintly gonna convince him to get a xbox one so he can play this fortnite season 5 circa 2018 i was huge fan of first rage but the sequel is huge disappointment i cant watch is fully is so bad sorry guys you fked this up looks nothing like rage open world made it look worse and it doesnt look like idtech anymore more like just cause 3 or fallout engine i still to this day go back and play the old one like someone else here said its one of the most underrated games truth right there friend i cannot wait for rage 2 to be out its deserved a sequel for a long time now that looks like a cool future hope it comes soon ive been waiting for this game for a long timeand all i really see different is the stomping thing from borderlands and the flying sticky disc thing gastro from destroy all humans despite the disappointing ending i liked the first one but wouldnt you agree that all the guns looked way cooler than the glowingcallofduty shit in this trailer this is the bulletstorm 2 nice shit his name is walker and hes a ranger eh is he from texas as well yes a new doom bethesda needs to pull people from arkane and id to their development team i mean look at the far cry games and games like thisgames arkane as made everyone seems to be able to make a more livable believable world than their dev team maybe its their engine but compare those games and this gameplay to elder scrolls and fallout gameplay it just feels so much more robotic or cardboard or something in their self developed titles i wanna see john goodman return i dont know if its the characters dialog or his voice but if there isnt an option to turn it off ill steer clear of this game i cant listen to that douche commenting for hours meh i already played borderlands mad max and the first rage ill pass i really want this game more than any other game coming out this year but more melee weapons please hype i liked the first one seems way too easy would be nice if enemies fought back this intro holy shit fuck yeah about damn time xd just installed rage again to have some fun in playing it again i wonder if this is before or after rage 1 it sings this looks ace just hope the ending is better than the first rage game see that car over there you can drive it looks like the perfect blend of doom 2016 and crysis a lot of us have been waiting for a sequel to this game hopefully well be seeing some familiar faces from the first game well the story synopsis of this game beats anything bethesda will come up with for fallout whatever the next singleplayer one is remember in rage 1 u got to throw those figet spinners at the bad guys and if u have good aim itll cut their heads off damn you can really go c r e a t i v e why is this upload in 320p quality where is this asteroid that can fck i have an asteroid fetish if doom was open world and mixed with mad max izzat andrew wk i cant hear his music without thinking of hellsing ultimate abridged so there better be an alucard easter egg somewhere im full of rage now kind of feeling like this could be the mad max game we all deserve and hope for tbh even if the real mad max game is pretty good if that is the way you unlock new abilities i fear it could get repetetive is of singleplayer shut up and take my moneeeyyyyy yayahhh omg i loved rage im so excited some different firearms of mass destruction with varied firing modes diversified rounds badass physical acrobatics and other fun toys this would be sweet was i the only one that caught the fact that his name is walker and he is a ranger kvasir still sounds the same glad the old mans still around holy shit yeeesssss more futuristic than i expected please let this not be mad maxdreadful game 60fps on the ps4 pro call me intrigued looks great but most games do in trailersthen you start to play it and it gets old fastits nothing but fetch quests go to this area kill this guy etc etcno rpg elements or immersive story i hope they have the classic buggy from rage 1 it was my fav waitin since ps3 man finally its coming yeah this looks nice they should definitely use this engine for the next fallout it looks insane imo wheres bulletstorm 2 i just hope it actually works on all the advertised systems would be a shame if they completely dropped customer support for it like they did the pc version of rage loved it on console despite the bugs but i still have an unusable copy on my desktop oh well was still fun though keeping fingers crossed since i love car combat and there seems to be a lot in this game but i think i shall wait for the reviews instead of buying it the day it comes out like i did with the old one i want to play this right nooow the final of rage was shit shameless selfadvertisement for the collectors edition to make fun of shameless selfadvertisement for the collectors edition bethesda i approve cant wait for this game loved the original and will love this one too dont know why the first got so much hate tfw you didnt give a shit about rage 2 and then you realize avalanche just cause mad max was involved in the development you better get ready to die i loved rage but ingame scripted cinematics are killing game play hope this isnt the case with rage 2 really i do holy shit yes wingsticks baby that was pathetic and boring developmnets should leave alone this game not impressed it looks like fun but also a little generic this looks like a evolution of serious sam rage 2s car combat has nothing on crossout the new borderlands looks nice i really liked rage but didnt care for the driving sections felt like borderlands where they are fun for about 15 minutes then would just rather they didnt exist it does seem weird to put the publisher as opposed to the developers name on the game though guess its another reason to dislike bethesda along with ruining the fallout franchise i feel like blowing shit up now this game looks like itgets its attitude from doom its driving from mad max its scenery from escape from new york il play it fuck yessss 100 gigabytes to install it on ps4 xd ouuu shiiiit avalanche studs so far theyve done good games i expect huge map seems like just cause mixed with mad max im the only ranger left so the last thing i have to do is save the trees avalanche studios so if the vehicle combat is anything like the mad max game then im buying i feel a lot of brink in this eish thats heavy rage 2011 was awesome game completed it 2 times cant wait to have this part as i was have no hope to see another part after all these years d is that mordecai the voice acting is very out of place this is a very confusing trailer to watch this is realy crazy gameplay so i sure as hell know i didnt ask for this but i am sure as hell not going to complain the first one was to damn short wingsticks are back fuck yeah rage is my alltime favorite game of the past wingsticks are opppp avalanche bethesda mad max preyfallout can iron sights just die already i can just imagine jumping out of the car and punch into the ground like a badass please they add that feature looks way better than the og rage but somehow it doesnt looks like as good as borderlands judging by some minor elements or the lack of them imo but this is just the first time time were seeing it lots of stuff can change and it still looks awesome af this will be so shit was that henry rollins reminds me a bit of the 2015 mad max game reminds me of starhawk also like how the main character said fuck you or some other curse word every time he does anything basically irrigated the psycho so glad their releasing borderlands 2 remastered oh wait this isnt a game from the borderlands series wow such a rip off disappointed fuuuuuuck rage is one of my alltime favorite games fallout meets mad max finally a sequel is coming this looks like everything mad max tried and failed to be gameplay looks really good this is extremely fastpaced its adhd levels of doom this game looks sick i cant wait shameless plug this will be great if its free roam after completion why does the rage 2 logo look like someone drew it in ms paint and whats with the pink doesnt fit at all i hope we can customize protag ala newest far cry and fallout but im still fucking hyped its probably gonna be a glitchier version of doom must play oh hello bulletstorm fancy seeing you here man why why futuristic shit ffs no fuckin way im botta cry im so happy seeing this huh it seems a lot faster paced i dont know if i like that or not the first really has some very tense battles maybe it will be different in the actual game but here it seemed like walker was just invulnerable the absolute lackluster ending of rage is one of the worst in gaming history lets see how this one will end should we show the story gameplay mechanics or explain the world lol nah just fuck shit up add some more guns though look like its the doom engine never heard of this game nor the company why are the e3 recordings done so bad maybe the graphics are good but i cant see it saw a bridge can i drive that its now a doom ripoff noice and i never thought they would do anything with rage again thats the time when you say in your self i need a new graphic card dont like the future stuff i like the look of the combat so far but i hope the enemies are as interesting to fight as rage 1 in rage one the ai was so good and made it exciting to fight them also i hope they have more gadgets to craft from loot like the first one where are the sentry guns or the little spider bots rage was amazing and beautiful and i hope rage 2 expands and has a much better story looking forward to this one i am not thrilled they made it much more like doom and bulletstorm although both great fpss but i am happy they are making a sequel show me some sniper play gameplay looks great but story wise im not sure about the first game had a pretty bad ending i was hoping they we going to continue right from the end of the first game no borderlands 3 at e3 thisll have to do havent played this game series since 2014 does it have a coopmultiplayer feature looks like mad max and rage have a love child this looks to be what rage was supposed to be cant wait rage 2 cocaine drift d im sold im really really sold this looks hilarious and just plain fucking fun this game could have gotten a lot more hype if it wasnt leaked on walmart omg its finally here i have waited so much for another rage game i loved the first one i am sure gonna enjoy this one definitly going to go back and play the first rage before this one comes out it looks fantastic like a combination of bulletstorm borderlands mad max and crisis reminded me a lot of bulletstorm and mad max looks cool this game looks amazing i wish they did co op though so it wasnt alone looks nice but the ai seems to be really bad kind of reminds me of bulletstorm i loved rage 1 now i cant wait for rage 2 yesssssss cant wait i guess this will do until i get borderlands 3 betheda is famous for over hyped and effective big budget marketing however this series is average will they finish the game before releasing it this time i dont know if its just me but this feels like doom 2016 with more talking and driving segments just me i also dont know if thats a bad thing this is the bulletstorm sequel i didnt know i wanted bethesda is really pumping out some serious titles this year i see that totally learned a thing or two from doom thats good giant meteor 2020 end it already never played rage before damn it bethesda keeps getting me interested in different series doom borderlands edition looks great so far okay this is actually pretty fucking good wasnt expecting that mad max bulletstorm borderlands walk into a bar decide theyll have a threesome d looks badass though 3 so hyped for this game cant wait rage was a huge dissapointment hell on earth asteroid apocalypse nuclear fallout whats the next apocalypse fuck yeah i love rage now theres a sequel we get rage 2 a game no one wanted and we dont get darkness 3 too human 2 alpha protocol 2alone in the dark 2 new onimusha or tenchu game i hope you can loot the corpses that was a big part of the last game and i really liked it this looks sick its time to party if you see it you can drive it can i drive the bush tho e3 viewer the need the need for better hairstyles finally new borderlands party till you puke andrew wk im gonna love this me the game play is brutal ps3 i would not be surprised if the game and the ps3 porting this i mean that the trailer is a kind of soap another zero attention span game for the masses bleh ah yes doom with cars you ever play fallout 4 and think wow id sure enjoy this game so much more if it wasnt shit get rage 2 cod for babies god i hate rage aaaaaand welcome back to 2010 it looks good but nothing like the original rage i enjoyed the first game its really cool seeing a sequel on the horizon considering the first game kinda went under the radar glad id saw potential in the title while making some big changes as well definitely going to get this one borderlands with less guns and without comic book style graphics that being said i loved the first one i might be wearing rosetinted glasses here but i remember the first game as looking better than this still surprised we got a sequel id given up the rage franchise as dead this gives me hope for a future dead space game devilboner the video game do enemys shoot rubber bullets or something to be honest this looks like pure shit to me where the hell do working armored vehicles with armed fucking rocket launchers come form in a wasteland on a dead world its not like there was an abundance of stuff just laying around like that before the asteroid hit was it the first one tried to be different visually with the extreme textures and geometry tried to be ahead of its time but failed but had an atmosphere and a better introduction to the overall story and universe with the only and select few to use advanced tech as shelters this looks just like another post apocalyptic future steampunk mad max ripoff also the weapons are high tech right out of 2280 seem like there more than abundant the atmosphere is colorful and light this is supposed to be a dead planet this looks nothing like that you know if in reality we only lost electricity for a month the whole world would fall apart and in a few years it would look much worse than this believe me and we wou daum e3 i can only sell so many organs part madmax and part crysis neither is bad by any means but idk if its rage still look forward to it 1st game was incredible only thing that annoyedconfused me as a 10 year old was the ending and how it wasnt free roam afterwards other than that it was brilliant lets hope this one is even better the sequels announcement came out of nowhere and ive been excited ever since 80 of the world is dead i have a shit load of different guns i can attain new powers i can kill a shit load of worthless fucks my god why cant this be real life yet another hi im rambo game last time you said rage was open world it wasnt and this looks the same some people liked rage i thought the game was bland and uninteresting i couldnt even bring myself to beat the game hopefully this one is as good as it looks i was too scared to finish the other one but im older now so well this is fucking boring unoriginal tripe i feel mixed emotions towards this game but in a good way the first game was visually and emotionally depressing and thats rage was shooting for rage was slower paced as well its interesting to see the more comedic approach to rage 2 but at the same time i am in awe by the emotional beginning it starts off in a very bummer way then quickly moves to full on kickass mode as mentioned earlier theres also the sort of comedy going with the game such as the commercial for the singing mutant head bethesda is taking a far different approach for a game that was unlike theyre more fast paced titles it is strange and interesting all at the same time it looks to be an action packed ass kicking machine but with such an influential story behind my hopes for rage 2 are off the chart and i cannot wait to see what it has to offer this looks very fun i just wonder about the coop and pvp capabilities if i can do coop story mode with 3 other friends and have a fun pvp option too in all in luckily my buddy owns a gaming company and is getting this for us for free so if it is a flop i wont feel like ive wasted money looks sick though seems developers are getting back on track wonder if were going to get a disappointing end and a op boomarang it was a fukin asteroid this guy sounds angry but doom slayer is still a thing this is like doom halo cod and destiny w the driving ad wingsticks from rage looks like it has nothing to do with the first one aaaah those wingsticks this looks really generic i had a dream where i would be playing open world doom its not a dream anymore now ive got a reason to snort cocaine again its like borderlands mad max and doom had a threesomeand yknowfluids exchanged reminds me of bullet storm and serious sam do we have to be walker i wanted to be that one blue mohawk chick in the trailer looks doctored up with trickery too much motion blur eh so many good games coming out ill pass on this one i loved the first rage i pray they can pull this off this is not rage2this is dooms clone why does the audio sound like destiny the enemies dying and the shooting bethesda really knows how to make a kick ass game looks amazing its from the makers of the criminally underrated mad max coringas world so doom in fallout i guess im okay with that xd so basically a fallout copie by the same company wow this game looks like its going to be pure fun looks a bit too easy tbh but still cool rick and morty distopic universe episode this looks really good just wish it was the shooting was a bit less meaty and i hope that the futuristic stuff is more late game like the last entry in the series i thought i wasnt intrested but with no borderlands in sight this will do gameplay loop looks great hopefully there is enough customizable powers and weapons to keep it interesting if you dont think this game looks interesting you probably didnt play doom when did rage go full doom this looks amazing i love the scifimad max athstetic looks like a cheese dream after too much cod to me doom for people with short attention spans so this is falloutdoomfarcryborderlandsmad max sounds amazing id love this game more if they got micheal bean as rex powercolt to play the main hero anyone else disappointed in the whole tone of this reveal im cringing from andrew wk this god awful voice actor and the overly serious attitude of the whole game so far rage was at least a little tongue and cheek but this just looks like generic open world shooter game with very serious man character that does serious things while being angry that his parents were killed so bad sorry not gonna play just cant handle long kill times in fps games anymore it just feels annoying take out the guy with the mohawk they all have mohawks omg that looks bad ass as fuck this looks fucking cool doom except you kill humans looks like doom wasnt violent enough for the modern audience i hope they change the graphic motor with problems to load textures v lol it was a fucking asteroid i dont think ive seen a more intense opening to a video game trailer worst voice acting ever like a cross between mad max doom and bulletstorm all wrapped in a nice rage package wingstick best weapon cant believe this is getting a sequel hahaha good to see they are making a rage less stale and less of a letdown they are coming out with fallout 76 and rage 2 dear e3 thank you for existing also fk you for the pain my wallet is about to go though sincerely a happy customer please dont be multiplayer bethesda knowing what the gamer from now needed and we needed old fucking school shooter games could be a bit more gore imo looks nice and interesting but the ai seems like a bunch of total buffoons so fallout in a nutshell why does the main character sound like jason from farcry 3 fallout on roids speed and lsdfuck me incredible trailer id software andrew wk madmax aesthetic and loud noises bethesda youre killing it whens the graphics downgrade oo please take my money next year whats this in my eyestears this looks great any info about 60fps on consoles is this a cgi trailer disguised as gameplay looks like it think im done with shooters its literally more of the same bloody hell i know most games are looking great nowadays but this made me say wow out loud looks so realistic have never played rage but would give this a bash i am glad that on 8 may 2006 i suggested to make rage second encounter will be ok now first was just little bit rushed and unfinished call of duty post apocalyptic warfare just add the doom formula and theres rage 2 for ya i want this on my switch this game seems to have way too much motion blur borderlands without cell shading it got my attention this game seems great but please dont let the character talk as much as in dishonored 2 dont mean to be a downer but i dont really like the look of thisjust endless shooting which is fun but it doesnt seem challenging more excited for borderlands 3 look too clean and polished to be true please dont let this be a lie id avalanche and bethesda this looks like a hell of a game by this trailer this game already looks 100x better than the last game if that really is aaron paul as the voice actor thatd be so awesome im going to destroy this game looks so good as much as i hate gamepad gameplay videos ill admit this looks extremely cool i think maybe theyve learned from their mistakes with rage 1 a little hyped ammaising doommad max cyber technologies steel with flesh super guns and madness after that fallout seems to me a boring shit although i love it how long have i waited for this mixture whaaaaaaaaa thank you bethesdareallythank you bordelands bulletstorm rage 2 cool this should have made this a full rpg game sounds like its time to party big bulletstorm vibes love it if you havent played bulletstorm i highly recommend it ive been waiting so long cyberpunk still the best trailer i wonder if something surpasses it maybe on the ps conference but fck yeah for elder scrolls 6 tho this is so damn cringy what the fuck is going on walker so we are playing as chuck norris in this game is it time to party i am so happy about this also did the computer say mr president that piques my interest to the story a michael bays game i dont normally say this but if this game releases with scaled down graphics compared to this trailer id be happy because it will give my pc a better chance but my pc will still look better than the console versions introducing a game with a controller is a fucking joke wow that game is trying really really hard to impress always wanted a rage 2 first game was awesome was rage like this too or this is going to be totally a different game wingstick please wasnt rage 2 released in 2011 or am i confusing that with a different rage generic post apocalypse world leave a like if you believe bethesda only make good gamea what happened to our guy from rage 1 bethesda is best gaming company this decade period im fucking tired of american voiced protagonists get some accents man so fucking booooooooooooooooooooooooooring simply shooting everything that moves when you dont have to worry about dying because you are a god feels boring dont know if i like this game lol remember the ending of rage yeah let that sink in bethesda is having such a good streak this e3 right guys if rage can get a sequel so can bulletstorm wheres bulletstorm 2 damn it this is cool but it aint rage oh well on second thought i guess rage is whatever the developer wants it to be ill support them how come the logo looks less menacing than rage 1s buying new pc just for this the tone of the trailer doesnt really match the tone of the gameplay section the game play looks very doomlike oh man this looks incredible edit sigh the ai problems still look intact though why on earth are they just wandering into the line of fire no human does that even if they are crazy enough to sport hair like that the guy who is telling walker his objectives sounds like he is khajiit is that just me inengine does not equal gameplay pls tel me this is multiplayer this looks fun to play already excited for this game which is rare nowadays reminds doom 2016 good anyway you add up to it the narrative and photography of the oldest cinema company in the world danish company and you have a good game good contamination this will do until borderlands 3 reminds doom 2016 good anyway damn i hate having to aim down sights its so fucking slow why didnt they just make it like wolfestein or doom doom and mad max had a baby and i am willing to adopt it i need to experience rage 2 rage scratched me right where i itch rage 1 had the worst ending in gaming history looks more fallout than new fallout it wasnt war it wasnt global warming it was a fucking asteroid sold shit this look fucking great am i the only one who is so hyped for this oh wowpostapocalyptic such a rarity these days first one was terrible why did they bother with another yasssssssssssssssssssssssssss i cant wait why are people comparing this to other games obviously you guys didnt play the first one sick game cant wait i knew it they will release this after the doom reboot i loved the first rage 3 jon berenthal for the win cant fucking wait jesus what is this doom guys son i love it hmm no nostalgia here kinda wish it was more like the original rage ill probably still get it though doesnt look bad this looks pretty neat mad max better be playable oh my god im so pumped for this game im so ready to die cant fucking wait for this hope this runs as well as mad max did one of the best pc ports of all time well song in the and is andrew wk its time to party and this guy plays nintendocore sometime does that mean that rage 2 is coming to switch sweet tech and death my 2 favorit things andrew wk sold me 119 stupid children gamer call of duty pubg fifa and fortnite stupid game game borderlands 2 mad max they just want borderlands to kill them dont they looks better than fallout 76 which isnt hard to accomplish now the game is gonna be more playable becouse its not gonna be running on id tech 5 engine it was really annoying to see loading textures afrer looking behind i like the fast pace do not like a main character or at least stuck with one also kinda not liking the straightfaced approach like a bit more of tank girl and punk and dark humor would be more fun honestly i know it wants to distance itself from borderlands but i feel like this feels much more boring than even the first game lol shatter ability or black ops 2 zombie origin melee upgrade very original thunder fist this looks heads and shoulders and a whole fucking torso ahead of the original tech demo i mean game looks very nice and im even more impressed by the fact that the devs found somebody who is able to play the game great job boyz looks fun for about 2 hours is it like fallout hyped rage was a great game another postapocalyptic shooter if you need me ill be playing berserk on atari 2600 it was a fucking asteroid so many cliches in this trailer where is the blood effect when you shoot its like doom mixed with borderlands i bet my ass this will have br mode i keep waiting for handsome jack to fly out it looks like you get a temporary powerup in which you deal more damage while taking less one might call it rage mode really puts bioware to shame lol if you see it can you destroy it lol nope because that would be too awesome why cant destructible environments be a main element in these games nowadays its not impossible wtf sounds like glados at the intro cakes all round i guess what rage looks much better like fallout 76 stop showing games with controllers smh you got an open world and engage enemies at 5 meters what is this where are frylock master shake and meatwad but where is the ithority normal troopers oh god the end game v8 is even moar op ok this looks way better than in the trailer but plz remove the ironsights your action is fast paced so stop giving us features that tells us to slow down this looks like hl2 gameplay on crack include ways to keep the momentum from the double jumps and dash this really has potential dont fuck it up bookmark this video guysguarantee the game wont look anything like this when its released good to know the ithority and feltrite are still round and new aliens would be awesome if you have some allies during the mayhem xd november has never been so far away serious bullet border doom sam storm lands american wasteland i actually have rage 1 that end game v8 hyper armoured 50 cal turret monted car is fucking op but the main character did kill a giant that was 8 stories tall i see some destiny arkham knight advanced warfareblack ops 3 far cry blood dragon wolfenstein whats up with bethesda and post apocalyptic scenes call of duty rage uhm is that michael pena talking narcos id love a game that includes hand combat with combos also tired of this usual shootout open world gaming its time for something new this really doesnt look like anything special my guess is itll be similar to the first one lacklustre gameplay and a thoroughly uninspired story all rendered in a beautiful and welloptimized engine looks mediocre to me although i hope itll be great doom but on earth i rarely get a boner like that playing that with a liter or two of cafein in my blood shall be pretty fine fuckin bethesda now i want all of your games this would be a place for junkrat from overwatch lul someone please here write here how to fix sound on youtube borderlands had a baby with bulletstorm this shit is literally doom same engine same gameplay rip rage awk 1010 it was a fucking asteroid this is really missing the charm of the first game im not diggin it see this thanos 80 die and people still live like shit thisthis is a game definitely not even close to the first one but im ok with that this one is a little faster than the first and dont have the asmosphere the first one have i still want to use my settler pistol just settler pistol with fat mammas to headshot every single enemy and wingsticked everything so hope they keep that ammunition vaeriety for a minute i was hopeful it would take what rage did well and add some variety and progression which was what it really lacked and needed then i saw the bethesda logo the main theme with bethesdas e3 presentation seems to be postapocalyptic games love it mad max fallout bulletstorm rage 2 will it have multiplayer i just hope the edning is better than rage 1s rip stealth the pseudo open world is what made rage seem limited and the megatexture messed up the feel and gameplay but it was still great it had a certain atmosphere to it and the universe seemed like it was worth exploring this seems like a better game although it kind of lost the feel of the original the lore seems a bit different id software never disappoints this feels like borderlands with some duke nukem and definitely bulletstorm so this is what bulletstorm and mad max love child looks like a postapocalyptic world where hair dye is still abundant rage 2 slogan this was the cringy part of the whole conference and also the vulvastein its feels better than fallout i remember being very hyped for the first one and never playing it if this comes out on pc id like to give it a shot the last ranger is called walker lul i didnt like the 1st rage was ehh to slow not really interesting to me this looks like it could be fun witty things and faced paced apocolypse mixed with some super abilities count me in glad to see a lot of people liking bulletstorm i though i was the only one reminds me of rickmancing the stone hmph rage more like age because this game looks about 10 years late to the party next 1st was sooo good hope this is good too well this was exhausting to watch this game will have some great car combat like mad max did this looks amazing but i hope to god there is a choice in main character walker already sounds like a generic call of duty character rage 2 starring the doom guy why is a khajit talking to me on the radio rage looked way better damn carmichael where you at son prealpha footage captured inengine people do realise that this is not gameplay then right its about as much gameplay as we saw in that first metro exodus trailer or in the original aliens colonial marines gameplay video this is a bunch of cutscenes that have been specifically made for marketing purposes to look like gameplay directed by micheal bay this is gonna make up for the fallout 76 disappointment it feels like wolfenstein doom and rage are all slowly becoming the same game overshadowed by doom 2 was that jon berntal i heard it was a fucking asteroid i am genuinely interested glad something peaked my interest beside anthem i had sooo much fun with the first one felt like a good cross between borderlands and doom i had no expectations at all for this one as ive never played the first one or seen much on it but i love the vibe that this trailer gives off it definitely caught my attention especially the environment and soundtrack ill be checking it out for sure this is more bullet storm than rage rage made you feel weak vulnerable there is no fear here looks boring as fuck ill pass first day purchase looks great i thought i cared about thisbut then i saw doom 2 brb replaying rage so basically fry cry 5 on steriods somehow me like this still looks like a clone of stalker call of pripyat i loved rage for its gameplay if id is still involved and it looks like they are i am ready to fork over for a preorder right now the shooting feels so empty doom and fallout had a baby never really knew what rage is about until this trailer and i can say that i am captivated by its concept holy fuck this looks right up my alley fast paced and frenetic feels like serious sam bulletstorm mad max and the best parts of borderlands had a baby this looks fantastic i loved rage getting a doom gameplay kind of right btw this has fucking sold me im getting it after awhile of course just in case rage im the only one that remembers that game and i dont even remember that game nothing but authority mutantsi wonder did the nanotrites that the authority have get hacked leading to the rest of the authority forces becoming mutants this is fucking awesome it looks gorgeous whats with the halo 5 ground pound no ones got questions about that shit looks like doom2016 meets mad max sign me up considering the fallout 76 multiplayer let down im really excited for this a f u c k i n g a s t e r o i d tilted irl looks cool but i dont like the idea of being a walking powerhouse that cant be killed thits pretty much looks like a superman simulator generic crap mad max doom wolfenstein serious sam lets have one guy kill everyone because hes got super powersno thats not it because he has been trained by a jedi mastermmmm dont think so ah its because hes the last ranger and hes called walker so clearly this guy is chuck fucking norris no wonder he can kick the shit out of everyone bethesda knows what i want im happy they made this more fast paced and not slow like the first one mad max fury road the game i cant hold in my excitement man bethesda is just booting out games they are on a roll lol i liked the pacing of the first game more i hope they got multiplayer too doommad max bulletstorm dishonest borderlands crazy they amount of atmosphere this game has mad max meets crysis im in if i see it i can drive it i see that bush therecan i drive that bush this looks a lot more interesting than the first one im down for it they went way crazier with this one the first one was fun this looks insane where is the blood and gore why do games need to be so pg13 these days i guess they want to overwatch crowd the only bethesda game i actually look forward to cause they didnt make it id kill gale just to play this on jesses xbox cant argue with andrew w k game cant decide if it should take a serious approach or a humourus take on destruction and death i see the struggle i hope it doesnt affect the game a lot looks good but i loved the way the 1st one felt and this 1 feels too fast paced is this game going to be coop id love to play this with my stream id is on this this is gonna be fucking good i pooped my pants sensory overload the game hell yeah count me in if this one has a final boss ill buy it has a doom guy feeling to it i am really trying to be hopeful with this but honestly every bethesda prequel looks better than what they are making now bethesdatake my money this game looks shit graphicallylike it was made 10 years ago edit apparently my phone was on 480p lol this looks good but i feel like ive played this game before ok im not tripping but i know i saw glory kills too eden spark justcause3 anyone fps games with auto aim what is the fucking point its different than rage 1 but it looks really good so far hype looks so freaking epic cant wait this is a complete 180 on the first rage good i have been waiting for years i seriously thought i would never see the day thank you bethesda avalanche and id software rage is a classic in my eyes and its good to see a sequel mad max and doom had a love child and its fucking beautiful pretty damn excited for rage 2 this shooter scene remind me righteous slaughter 7 mind blowing game yuck ironsights im actually a bit disappointed i was hoping nicholas raine would be the main character again oh well it will still most likely be a great game bullet storm mad max rage 2 i gonna fucking buy it shits looks fuckin hypeeeee brilliant will definitely be buying great a mediocre open world game what is this crap destiny 3 they fucked up this game this doesnt look anything like the first rageif they didnt say it was rage 2 i wouldnt even know it was a sequel the first rage game was still to this day one of the most underrated games of all time feels a little like doom though went from not caring about the ip at all to placing this on my watch list i like this kind of surprise the way he said it was a fucking asteroid had me dying looks almost exactly like new doom badass it was a fucking asteroid this is what the game look like if it was an exclusive for pc the first game was awesome i cant wait to play this one looks like mad max on three forms of cocaine so hyped for rage 2 really liked the first one and this looks even better btw does the protagonist sound like a slightly older jason brodyfar cry 3 protagonist to anyone else mad max on steroids looks great looking forward for this game anyone know the song title at the end never played the first rage but this one looks fun as hell its like mad max meets doom and halo im so ready for this i honestly wouldnt care if it wasnt made by avalanche mad max was near perfect nobody asked for this but we needed it it looks awesome this looks terrible not even close to original rage quality this shit looks arcadelike i hope i can customize the weapons this game looks sick soo we get an open world bullet storm really i have the strangest erection i actually liked the first rage i replayed it a lot and im excited for this mad max bulletstorm fallout borderlands if they make it a little bit more interesting than the last time then count me in this voice actor is becoming the nolan north and troy baker of the gaming industry the world of the game is empty cant wait to play it stealthy theres a lot of bulletstorm influence in this one i was expecting more borderlands lootfest but im fine with this doom and sunset overdrive had a child i would rather have another dishonored game this looks amazing the game play looks so good cant wait doom witn no demons yooo this is actually the most badass game ive ever seen in tooooooo hype my guy damn so much for writing our own story in the rage universe ill pass nothing like the first rage disappointed it wasnt a war it wasnt global warming it was a fucking asteroid lmao i cant be dealing with these games playing the god turning his back on the world and throwing the illuminati into the mix and hityall enjoy not i bethesda stop pulling a doom love the bulletstorm vibes another mad max game didnt avalanche do mad max i thought mm was awesome and this vehicular combat looked surprisingly similar day one hell yeah at some points its actually hard to tell whats going on this game is incredibly fast paced avalanche wont disappoint with both rage and jc4 never played rage but this will be cool this actually looks pretty cool still looking for the counter ai movement and intelligence terrible sound not matching characters boring open world fuckin typos in the subtitles means they threw the game together without checking shit im not interested pretty world this game is cool rip to the mannequin whose head went flying xd a little drone controlled by elon musk lol 1533 look so good i want this game beginners are playing at low or normal difficulty normally as enemies die faster u should make another vid on rage 2 they kind of overdid it with all the pink remember fps was on average 5060fps but hes recording playing on 4k and ultra so yeah are you playing on easy difficulty looks like shit very good game it plays well on my 6gb 1060 plenty to see and do good graphics loads of action and some humour also i love this game the story line is goodand the weapon is so cooooool its a shame this hour of gameplay is really only 14 of the whole story mode started playing this game last night really enjoying it tbf how clean was that ark hole should i buy it general cross remind me of warframe the amount of blood sold me on purchasing it that was good what a boring game smfh could you make the next time the fps counter a little smaller do you guys think rtx 2070 ultra 2k settings would do 60 fps this is like farcry and halo put together can you play this game in third person this guy definitely hasnt played rage from ps3 so its a doom 2016 mod not complaining tho p so much to explore not like anthem what he didnt give a shit about the other character who just died by the do in front of him xd first person mad max how the character develop any new armor or skill why are your movements so weird are you using a console literally feels uncomfortable because you dont look around naturally freakin weird i think its because you dont freakin strafe and turn at the same time maybe ugh i dunno but its hard to watch the graphics is good but it is a lackluster in depths of plot and gameplay 1st edit also i prefer to have a silent protagonist like doom 2nd edit i find the crisis situations here is tender and failed to give me the gravity on the situations in the world game looks amazing loved it would love to see more of it great content cheers ill go replay borderlands 2 instead of this retextured doom with a sprinkle of open world sense into it why are you playing on pc like a brokeass more of this jackfrags should play the first rage he missed a ton of stuff including the job board in the first town also talking to people would help find stuff out in the world like ark boxes dumbass he did play a good round and graphics are awesome will buy play more plz good in bethesda you can run fast common difficul normal you shood play nightmare pump up the game when the other protagonist gets killed and no one says a thing lol 56fps thats why you made the counter so tiny this is game reminds me little bit of borderlands 2 it kinda reminds me of doom the writing is so cliche it physically hurts me so boring the arks sound like failsafe from destiny 2 not a fan of all the gore but the game looks cool shes a badass brehshe is the head and intelligence of the movement and standing on top of a rampart on the frontshes a very angry looking demented granny reallya good rocket to the front and the whole movement would be scattering because granny wanted to watch the fireworks xd ar armalite rifle that looks more like a futuristic hk 416 damn you jack you made me want this game game really boring afters some time and annoying bugs d damn id like to see more of this looks like half life 2 what a rubbish game graphics in 2019 sucks mad max on steroids generic and boring there should have been a fallout 4 with such graphics and such physics but wait is the main character played by sam riegel i have zero interest in this game zero how is she picked up by the blade when it is light energy not a physical object the main characters voice is the same voice that acts like almost every npc in fallout new vegas play more mate we would love to see you make a lets play of this game anyone getting some quake vibes from this cringey game this game looks super fun not what i was expecting it looks kind of flat if cyberpunk was made by random company this game is worth free this seems like a great game btw jack dont forget youre a whole different enchilada have you ever wanted mad max and borderlands to have a child i didnt until now its too damn dark at night time i dont have an issue with any other game but this is the one game where its ultra dark at night and they give you no fucking flashlight and you cant adjust gamma on console wow i waited so much for a new quake this game looks awful i have a proper name for this game doogestein got it doogestein doomragewolfenstein really theres no visual difference between those games i know its idtech engine but my god i bought the first game was super over hyped turned out weak as hell i played for like 2 days and gave up had to max out my resolution to max just to see the frame was shit pink is hurting my eyes its just a rifle not assault rifle whats with the overuse of bright colors there is some game in your fps counter this looks slow and boring did you really start on normal difficulty that game seems so fun i loved rage still have it but it was wayyyyy to short the gameplay is very mad max like the first impressions60mins videos are excellent very informative for the average punter considering a game purchase i enjoy these ones at the minute as im not into the bfv stuff not into the game your vids and content is still class bf1 was great but v is meh keep up the good work fraggs rage 2 plus more weapons upgraded borderlandsmaybe couldnt finish the vid so i can play it myself but first half hour was great jack jeez this looks awful love fps games but this looks like shiet this game was pretty worth it cost me 0 on the piratestore this shit so cringy please play more i loved the original game but this one is just way too different i dont like it the speech at the start gave me a kind of kane feel big one looks like a brumak from gears of war also walker texas ranger game length 85 hours im hearing are you kidding me for 7999 canadian this is mad max so similar with the open world and destroying outposts etc they just put a space spin on it probably evil controlled by elon musk i agreed 5734 fucking the phoenix hi jack i think you should seriously have another youtube account wherewe can see you play through the full game i would like too see you play the last of us i would look at that all the time you are the best this game looks great on my qled visually stunning something seems off compared to e3 hmm not sure what but something seems off not gonna lie jacks dialogue is pretty corny 3108 i like how the casings eject out the right side of the weapon but the chamber opens to the left brilliant i hope the developers arent americans or more specifically voting americans where is part 2 bethesda hides bfg 9000 behind a 20 paywall for a deluxe edition i will just wait until 2 expansions are released and get the whole thing on sale in late fall my peasant 1080p laptop all i see in the fps counter is woohoo another generic shooter we sure dont have enough of those sigh youve convinced me to not buy this no coop or mp so pass real shame those cuts are awefull italian gameplay on my channel d omg you play like a slow sensitivity console bot thanks for gameplay but omg lol surprised you have 2 mill if your a noob pc player 426 immortan joe is that you interesting gameplay gonna try it such lame and tired writing im happy that youre thrown into the action right away the storyline sounds like it was made by google assistant when asked to tell a story 2228 wtf is that lucian its like a better more doomey version of that mad max game that came out awhile ago whould love a second hour prob wont happen right the ai looks extremely boring to fight walker is the voice of the amazing spider man game series wait what year is it wish i could fix my car like that too ark ai sounds like failsafe in destiny 2 lol ahh another game where the dudes you kill just stand there waiting for the end turn a corner and they dont move like statues when will it hit the makers of games that when someone approaches you with a gun you dont just wait to be shot you duck and dive yesterday night i thought its boring until i got the shotgun gunplay makes so much fun and the sewer mission from marshall was very nice on the other hand the open world is boring no doubt i enjoyed the first one from what i remember but this video does nothing for me theres really not many good games these days doom with a skin looks extremely boring rage 1 was way too short theres no way i would pay another 60 for one of their games ill wait till its in the bargain bin i am sorry why that game looks like mobile game is it 2010 game wtf hey play more make this a walkthrough its doom but open world does have a just cause vibe but more to a doom vibe but its rage but it sure does have a doom vibe theres a new gears of war hopefully this game is good rage 1 was absolute trash dude the fps counters covering up all the screen anyone else noticed the prowlers hologram looping over the animations why couldnt they just make this first person with the driving aswell glad i never got this anyway 1112 thats was she said can i play it with my friend or just solo looks way too easy the intro to this game is the truth hidden in plain sight think im just going enjoy the driving those buggies not to fussed about the rest of it wow you dont look around do you because you passed a lot of ammo this is such a video game and i love it i cant see the framerate from my phone xd 0916 its just a flesh wound monty pythonesque before cyberpunk and borderlands 3 this might have to do its still got a lotta jersey in it lmao cant wait to play this the writing seems atrocious this game looks way too easy for me man this is a really good mix of borderlands doom mad max probably controlled by elon musk jackfrags 2019 the fps counter is so small on my screen lol mid 50 fps with an rtx 2080ti gg 1950 im fairly certain you dont need that skill for those rockets you can probably just walk out the way hmm getting average ratings on steam sounds are really good graphics are ok if you can run it still i dont think i can pay 40 for it well 31 on other websites ill wait for a sale like all the other triple aaa games nice video i like the commentary thank you where is the fps lul please stop calling rifles in general assualt rifles there is no such thing the intro voice sounds like the chitauri dude from the first avengers i hope you play this this game reminds me more of jax3 than anything uff looks crap 435 he plays with a controller on pc this is just like a mad max game and doom game got a child its ok i guess fun gameall it needs is a br mode that is meant ironically excited for this game the enemies looks like the strogg nice frame rate counter i didnt have my magnifying glass tho so unlucky so then doom with cars anything other than bfv white man teammates getting killed calls for casual conversation freaking 4k out here making msi afterburners fps counter look like a handworms hip bone still looking for that fps counter lol the fps counter in the top left to cut it short its doom with comedy and its also more open first shooter that really looks interesting to me personally since r6siege tbh seems like loads of fun madmax where you at ar doesnt stand for assault rifle stupid it stands for armalite also nobody but civs call guns assault rifles its just not the name for them sweeet looks really meh use cheat code hes on fire i think this is a better fallout 4 than fallout 4 looking like a generic shooting gallery on rails half life 2 was also but man was it spicy i wish that someone would improve on that formula instead of this being just doom with updated lighting anyone else find the gameplay way to sensitive i love how alive this game is ok bethesda you conviced me ill pirate it im ot getting this for the sole reason i cant drive in first person this game looks sick af i have very fond memories of the first rage i played it all the time wtf is the fps counter would be totally into this if there was a proper coopmode raiden from mortal kombat appears at the end of the video the writing in the game seems poor at best the way they handled that start was horrible 426 sounds more like celery breaking than bone doesnt look that huge tho is there multiplayer so authority basically future nazis as they see themselves as the best race or whatever they are and others to be weak this game reminds me of mad max were playing rage 2 but all i hear is scanlan use bigbys hand ya punce sam riegal for dnd beyond president i already refunded my game didnt like it at all for many reasons good luck to people who tried to find fps counter while watching this vid on the phone including me looks quite boring another generic openworld firstperson shooter borderlands has replayability and variation because of its randomly generated loot this is just rage 1 with modern graphics not sure how people still enjoy these types of games anymore its been done a million times already looking like mad max or doom is just a gimmick the gameplay is still linear and onrails despite an open world this is just another checklist game they didnt even bother to check on that female wall rat at the start lol she couldve still been breathing bruh who hired failsafe from destiny 2 to voice the ark robot the constant banter in this game has immediately put me off they act as if the enemies are a game and not to be taken seriously also barely reacting to their friends being torn apart maybe thats the style they were going for but it isnt for me the gameplay side doesnt look but but i dont see anything special at all super generic could have been a ps3 game and i wouldnt have noticed beyond the graphics who else admiring the dust animations take the lift to the armoury why the fuk could u not take the lift from the amoury to the pipe ffs talk about make it long for no reason looks boring after a few hours the storyline is kinda poop its like a b rated movie but its only a hour gameplay so they made wolfenstein and doom of this game cant wait til after work when i go pick it up t minus 9 hours id software never fails to amaze me this game looks fun and awesome actually looks like a decent game might get it the first rage was trash glad this has a little more personality might actually pick it up fuck bethesda forever who else is disappointed that the things you kill disappear that fucking fps counter keeps blocking my view i hardly can see any gameplay frame rate is in top left but the the company you need to worry about is bottom left lol tutorial for a shotgun 4949 mature rated but simple ass tutorial for a shotgun wow thanks for the video jack now i dont have to buy the game because ive seen more than enough gameplay to know i will dislike the game doesnt remind me of a regular aim skill of jackfrags i may buy this it looks pretty good the normal difficulty seems pretty easy the reviews are mixed though this game is so god damn fun just wished they would have realeased on friday and not a random ass tuesday 1113 thats what she said we all had such plans all thwarted by one man nicolas cage literally 75 of this comment section is just babying about the fps counter the dude at the beginning has like the same voice as jetfire from transformers revenge of the fallen the graphics are shocking nothing like was promised in the trailer sam riegel bossing the protagonist role hey jack do you use vulkan api for this gameplay did anyone else get a doom feel at the start of the game rando ranger powers back online outstanding work jack thank you now it all makes sense shut up about the fps counter wait you do realize that ar does not stand for assault rifle right why are all character interactions and action scenes so lazily done why do games keep having these strong women characters storyline and dialogue is just so cringeworthy its like 70 of all the characters in this game are women i feel like this game was specifically made for sjws do we get a playthrough of this are there only girls in the opening to this game idk they seem like theyre doing it right but this is the bs were gonna be lookin at for awhile to come it seems the gunplay reminds me of doom i thought jersey was like an elite fighter i got my phone then my ipad then my pc then my 55 inch tv then my glasses then lasik and i still dont see this fps counter you guys are talking about are you guys messing around noticed the typo when youre fighting in that fuel station ill excuse all the mistakes and little errors in the game people tend to forget not everything will be perfect at launch so im expecting some bug updates and stuff well tbh it looks like it will be helluva adventure it runs great on my x box one s but first im replaying rage 1 just bought it on steam and it metro exodus who cares its a shit game the animation is 2005 caliber and the game struggles to render 60fps at 4k on more than a few areas even with 2080ti and 32 gb ddr4 ram its 2019 ffs no excuse its not demonetized what a boring ass game this is why 4k pc gaming is dumb oh look the master race is at it again why are they always monstrous to look at i want to the whole game play from you mildly disappointed graphics are just ok for a 2019 game avalanche has smooshed the best of rage with the best of mad max brilliant love the 4k video awesome it would want to be shirt loads longer than r1 for me to pay out big for it love to see a lets play style on this game from you does it have multiplayer this is so crazy i cant even read the fps counter on my 12801024 monitor lol well some of the opening scenes look like some copy cats of the movie starship troopers why is the music so loud i feel like the fps counter overruns the screen space you should make it a little smaller next time they took the gritty grungy vibe out of it now it feels like apopcalypse jack turn this to a lets play meh ill wait for cyber punk 2077 umm what happened to the female who got knocked by the door looks epic reminds me of doom and borderlands mixed the gunplay reminds me of doomremake does it feel like it looks fun reminds me of the mad max game is it coop as well the female ai voice from destiny 2 failsafe i love that game so good mad max with doom gameplay just a easy full play through since bfv is shit anyone 1the world of mad max i know they are the same developers 2the way a new gun is displayed when you get it of doom 3the car of batman arkham knight and if i missed anything drop a comment i dont know how i feel about this game feels like a mix of a few games that i already played and it doesnt fit the kind of games im playing now ill get it later down this year mayyyybe what do you think so jack has a fear of robot cactuses lol i am a ps4 player should i buy when i played rage 1 it felt like i was the only one that played the game did anyone else feel that way yes another open world game said noone ever is this with rtx on anyone remember like a year ago when jack said he might make a walkthrough style second channel love to see more gameplay sorry jack youre not good in this kind of games i love how they get rid of the character you dont choose dude the graphics look like shit jack how do i get your emblem jack i love your vids been here forever since before the boomdeaahda days but seriously i loved rage with all of its half life jokes and callbacks and its amazing skybox this game doesnt interest me at all its 2019 quality rail shooters just dont cut it anymore even in 4k with ray tracing i will just wait for borderlands for better rpg elements and an immersive open world with better jokes than this thing is trying to push almost as gory as rising storm 2 99 comments holy shit counter smol 1 comments female go boom boom what awful clunky dialogue the rest looks cool though where are jacks impressions about the game i dont need a tutorial for a shotgun jackfrags reminds me of the flood from halo 2 and of course the starship troopers scene at the beginning im getting destiny 2 vibes from the opening to the world i would definitely watch more gameplay from u jackkk plss hahaha borderlands 3 is going to smash this game to death the mans voice is the same as the guy who voices generic ncr troops in fnv this game looks corny jesus christ this games fn garbage xd reminds me very much of doom is this game online omg this game just to arcade and too easy 12 shot on enemy and dead feels like a reskinned doom with cutseens and reloading feels like a mix of doom and crackdown to me but oddly enough i kinda like it edit but there is something off about the npcs they remind me of andromeda omg this is epic fighting in this game and looks a little bit like doom cool playstyle you have the animations of ai seem a bit repetitive and clonky i get mine tomorrow i preordered the collectors edition is this max settings the artistic style is really cool but the actual graphics quality is pretty underwhelming looks like a 2014 game ive only watched just under 20 mins so far but cant help feeling like this is a very generic game anyone else i really dont get how you make such good content and gain subscribers so slow ive never skip one of your videos even this hour long one and yet your subscriber count stays the same i fill lucky to be part of what i think is a exclusive group but you deserve more love spend all this time and resources creating this huge beauty200000 stack of cash 265 really hope you will post like an hour game play maybe once a week i really like watching this just dont think i would enjoy playing it as much similar to re2 remaster loved watching mike and marry play through it didnt really enjoy playing it myself 2527 jumps in huhits got a voiice drives off in arousal so this is like fps gears of war idk why but this game reminds me a lot of killzone character lets fcking get some jack demonitised youtube idc meh its such a mediocre uninspired game just a gory version of any other space shooter which doesnt make it a great game who are these games made for this looks absolutely terrible why cant anyone just make a good realistic game that isnt all badasses and nonstop shooting and weak stories to cover the fact that you pick up health drops from enemies like were all so sick of yeah there is rdr2 but it wasnt very realistic i personally hate games like these and ive never met anyone who actually likes them jack when is the sea of thieves vid out do you have a second channel where you do full playthroughs because you really should have one the game looked fantastic id like to pick up a nvidia card reminds me of wolfenstein 2 a little bit cross is cool but vor is cooler sees bethesda meno longer cares about the game bethesda come play we got micro transactions and plastic bags instead of canvas come come come 1203 love how that creature that shakes the ground as he walks got the drop on them please will you do a full playthrough of this jack 3 such a dope game why is every main character named walker seriously too much bling bling learn how to take cover jack you should try and do a play through of this game im for sure leaving a like good vid looks like gears of war meets crackdown lol i have been waiting too long for this game doa complete go through video sub 60 fps with such mediocre graphics on top tier gpu seriously this game is gruesome great vid as usual i was looking forward to this even the provided gameplay before release but this looks pretty shit i hope you keep playing this i enjoyed watching it looks shit bring on borderlands 3 is anyone excited for this game hey jack my question is do you honestly think this game is worth the full 60 or should we wait for a sale just bought it anyway lol ant man i can shrink to the size of an ant fps counter hold my pixel this looks great straight up cheese ball dialogue and overcompensation of social virtues lol terrible so you are actually playing this with a controller on pc wow this really does look extremely cliche and boring is this a long or short game 48hrs eh im not a huge fan of some of the designs it kinda gives me a brink vibe for anyone that knows about that monstrosity you know you dont want to be reminded of that game in the slightest not really liking rage 2 so far i loved the first one but this just seems completely different and scraps the whole entire feel of the original and trying to be more like borderlands but just failing miserably and the dialog from the characters is just so cringy and honestly i dont think i could go through the entire game with such boring annoying main character at least rage one had the decency to keep the mouth of the main character shut and let you make up your own backstory and personality shes 23 with 7 years of military service hmmmmmmmmmmm lily i bought the game but i legit dont think i can run it guess i will find out at 9pm tonight that grenade really did some massive damage 743 this game looks like doom and something like gears with the banter between squadmates i mean had a first person love child i hope their are gruesome take down animations is it me or does the ai in this game dumbed down so that even a monkey could play it like why do some of the grunts have no arms this better be about 20 cause i think this is something ill wait for either a steam sale or wait for it to be 2nd3rd hand at cex isnt ozzy man in this tomorrow straight after work im running to the game store to buy this alfa romeo doesnt mind the swears good to see the video isnt demonized heres what i think doom with words anyone else thinks this game gives off a doom kinda vibe am i the only one who sees resistancethe game in this thanks for this video and i hope you make more i love your videos and content keep up the good work it gives me that vibe of cyberpunk 2077 will it have pvp it reminds me a lot of of an open world gears of war mixed with doom what a rushed story the game is already getting discounted and its not even out yet ill wait for a sale so do you like the game the fps counter is so fucking small that even a highpowered microscope cant see it for shit the moment you start caring about your enemy its already too late pls do play more rage the og rage sucked this looks better lol if farcry blood dragon and doom had a love child that is what rage 2 is this game doesnt have sprint feature boring feels like a doom and fear mashup ive watched an hour and a half of gameplay for this and boy does it look underwhelming ahhhhh i loved it it was amazing please make more videos on it lol thats meteor coming for us at 2029 april 13 look it up its got the same name i cant wait to get this i have missed games like this and cant wait to blow shit up just for the sake of it pure unadulterated mayhem this game looks cool but i cant tell the performance on your amazing nvidia 2080ti because the fps counter has decided it needs to go to an fps counter conference an hour watching jackfrags lets go general cross looks like the infected antagonist from i am legend lmao this was super fun to watch id definitely watch if you did a play through series or something like that most single player games have something special about them this feels a little bland no multiplayer setting on this one what a let down guess will need to wait to borderlands dan you play a battlefield 4 on controller play more of this 3736 car good luck out there walker pauses looks back walker lets go fxcking get some jack demonitized i see they used mass effect vehicle mechanics doom mechanics mmm intresting rage 1 sucked the enemy ai seems as clueless as the ai in wolfenstein i h8 she tutorials treat you like an idiot we are gamers we know how it goes dude stop holding my hand please imagine if this game had a bulletstormesque kill score system thats not just any ranger this guys is gonna pull some badass starship trooper shit jumps on mutant yes shoots hole in its back yes now grab a grenade grabs grenade yeessss 5 seconds later oh fps counter is covering too much space borderlands fallout 4 doom rage 2 ok fine i will play it a bit xd like a slightly less cartoony borderlands this seriously looks just like borderlands even some of the landmarks look exactly the same in their architecture and placement enjoyed this a lot looks like anthem with flying npcs and cooler weapons and better story and etc okay its nothing like anthem it just me or this nothing like the first game the way they kill off the character you didnt choose is excellent what a good touch worth a buy please continoue this game fallout doom exploded bag of paint rage 2 its up to you walker texas ranger ooo they have nightmares mode good i was hoping for a challenge disappearing corpses yeah not gonna buy so the animations for npc seem unfinished which its way early no issue there this looks really far along comforting you can see the influence of the new doom in thos gamelooks fab worst script writing ever following the road like a good civilized man or should i say like a big pussy boi constantly interupting gameplay with poorly written cutsceenes and dialogue screams mediocre me watching a 4k dermo at 480p watched the whole thing fps counter so small what a bullshit for someone who doesnt see it around 5060 fps goes under and top of it cant see st with this huge fps counter on my display how did this game turn into bulletstorm why does every game have a tutorial ive been gaming for more than 20 years stop telling me how to play looking forward to fucking shit up in this game dam am i the only one that thinks this story sucks and is full of holes it kinda feels like some middle schoolers wrote itjust my opinion and from the first minute i can guarantee you that mick gordon contributed to the soundtrack edit nevermind its not him i cant watch these in game cut scenes im sorry theyre just awful how did they tie her up with no hands 1248 fallout that we never got but we always needed single player games dont interest me i know jack never does lets plays anymore but the way he plays games and narrates just makes me want to see more damn i hoped i would be able to play on the minimum gamesradar shat all over this game in their review which was really bizarre as most of the others had nothing but praise make this into a series please is there squads available like strikes i see mad max in there the gore in this is what i needed for a long time this game is a whole lot of meh snuh bah i was wondering when you were going to talk about this the introduction speech reminds me of killzone your thumbnails are so juiiiicy jack have you tried out mordhau its allot of fun i would like to hear how you like it everyones excited but how is this a sequel to rage it looks nothing like it the atmosphere is completely different the mechanics are barely reminicent just vague lore its like if doom 2016 and farcry new dawn mixed its somethingbut it isnt rage couldnt they make the fps counter any smaller this is so bulletstorm 2 woot go avalanche i dont like the hit markers especially the skull and cross bones so much exposition gameplay looks fun though aside from the hostile ai looking pretty dull is that a fps counter for ants 2080ti and it barely stays at 54fps well looks like im giving this a pass if doom and borderlands had a baby they should bring a doom mode so this is basically just doom then right why cant we play this game in coop what about optimization is it good like doom 2015 i love the maturity of this game gory and gritty you play on normal really did they mock battlefield there he is not getting a defib out of there or its just an insignificant nothing jack why are you playing a random 2012 game in 2019 hl2 got facial animations right in 2004 why can nobody seem to do it right in 2019 besides nrs the ai look dumb as hell maybe cause jack is playing on easy mode need more of these unedited gameplay looks horrible seems like it could get pretty dull in places feels like a more serious singleplayer borderlands and the most fun part of borderlandsis that its multiplayer and doesnt take itself too seriously looks fun wish vehicles was a bit faster ill never understand why anyone would use this voice actor he sounds so bored and indifferent to everything i cant believe theres a tutorial for a shotgun the handholding is a little much good video but the game looks kinda boring to me lol did the other character choice die right away this is good like doom in the open world i think i will buying this after a month or so just to make sure looks like mad max game but only on first person rage was a pretty decent game this is just a mediocre gears of war sequel is this game out hot dam this is getting me hyped for doom eternal tomorrow we can all play that fps counter is still too big so walker is a ranger but is he a texas ranger youtuber sit back relax and enjoy rage 2 am i a joke to you i really enjoy this game would love to see more of it the game looks like a lot of fun but the only comments are all but what about the frames per second like this one thing that wouldnt be noticed if the counter wasnt there makes a game good or not gamers are so whiney these days coming from growing with games in the 80s to what is going on now you folks are spoiled and should have to be forced to play atari games for the next 5 years so you can get some of your bearing back now lets see this graphical quality in the next es this new doom dlc should mix things up anyone knowns general crosss voice actor sounds very familiar well looks like ill be playing this til borderlands 3 releases on steam the button that closed the door on the road block thing was to stop it from being used again since the button was on the inside of the door am i the only one who thinks the graphics look terrible looks pretty good now we just have to wait a month or 2 after launch to see if the microtransaction loot boxes kill the game looks very fun to play please do more of this game 3430 i cant believe you said that i legit thought that said locked loaded and phucked up unless the objective bullshit mentality can be hidden from the game along with the tutorials ill never touch this game wow im watching this on a 65inch 4k tv an even i can hardly see the fps counter holy shit the car talks looks crap i preordered this game but i unfortunately havent played it due to my console giveing out so its gonna be some time till i can enjoy this game damn now i have to go buy rage 2 this game would be great in vr does rage 2 have newgameplus i played most of the first rage but i was to young to understand it wat does this one have anything to do with the last one how ironic i was gonna buy the game before seeing this because this changed my mind it doesnt seem as good as it looked do a walkthrough my dudeeee game looks awesome it looks like a cross between doom wolfenstein and borderlands gun sounds are awesome only wish cod and ghost recon would take a cue from this for some reason fps games have been muffling gun sounds more and more over the past few years instead of having exciting gun sounds that gets you goin is it just me or does this game not look as good graphically as i thought more please i get a lot of doom vibes in the game play 647 really jack youre not going to look at the man you just stripped looks good but not sure its got the same wow factor the original hsd at the time probably because not many had done this style of game before be interested to see how many hours play time there is in the story i feel like they tried to make to many memes and make it funny they attempted a borderlands style character personality design kinda weird they hyped up the combat and such but hes just walking around pew pew pew pew is this doom i cant waitim getting mine at 8oo tonight im gonna fasten razor blades on my nerfy wing stick and go squirrel hunting jack playing bf 95 head shot playing rage 2 95 leg shot walker general cross uh welcome to dgrayman he only has about 55 fps and i think he plays with normal settings as the game doesnt look as good as other gameplays what is up with all fighter female characters man nobody seems to notice this shit i must be the only one that thinks this game is pretty much a borderlands rip off turn that music off ffs is lily a new wifu xd polished game and again these lesbian looking rambowomen charactershow predictable and boring the voice acting is garbage the dialogue is cheesy and tutorials are overbearing i wish some things had a little more depth to them with some of the vehicle mechanics like having to worry about gas and having to find scraps to repair your vehicle or something i imagine its pretty immersion breaking to have to fix a car by just putting your hand out then thats it 3126 the new christopher nolan movies i love how they ignore the female player character dying from that blast like nothing happened death seems like a pretty nonchalant thing in this games universe could anybody see the gameplay with the overwhelming fps counter being so big im so fucking hype for this game i love the first rage video keeps freezing up unwatchable rage 2 the highly anticipated sequel to everyones favourite game apparently after watching this videoi decided i would not buy this game the story line is so dumb love the gameplay would be cool if you did a walkthrough of the entire game i dont like how theres subtitles for everything damnit i want this game now its basically a girly mad max not fully sure but the voice almost sounds like liam obrian he said on critical role that he recently was working on something he couldnt talk about at the time but it could easily be someone else is this the beginning of killzone one anything to do with bethesda is a big nope from me for anyone looking for fps the fps is going between 5270 most of the time it is sticking at 62 why does this game feel so boring narration kicked it off then the killing everything with dramatic music i didnt play the other rage am i missing something why doe this game seem so bland why are we forced to learn the game mechanics in a test zone environment thats so god damn boring especially after the base was invaded there was so much potential missed in the first part of the story and all it gave was some rushed piece of shit idk am i being too harsh its like doom and mad max having a baby wer in 2019 guys wt is this the map resembles the mad max game for anyone wondering the average fps was 50 to 60 waitthis is not destiny 2 too many toturials and skill trees just let me kill people dammit game looks visually mediocre and quite boring the fact that the fps is absolute trash with a 2080ti at 4k when comparing to the visuals on screen just screams to me that the use of the engine needs a lot of work in this title doom looks better and at 4k runs better on lesser hardware all while being much older side note anyone get a borderlands doom mixed vibe from this too but not in a good way this looks so cheesey the second e described the mum i said please dont kill the mum straight away and they did what a lazy revenge plot gameplay starts at 306 for a 2019 game this is complete shit lol wish they went for a little more of a gritty somewhat realistic vibe and the ui had a darker less neon color scheme but im just nitpicking game looks fun hope you could play more games i want to let them win the fps counter jumps from 200 to 690fps that graphics card is insane why does it look ass and the lore not make eny sense ranger walker so you play as chuck norris in this game it looks like that one game no one ever played but made millions soooo bethesda made this game and took a shit in fallout 76 this game looks boring and nothing new god i hate these games theyre the playable version of hose shitty b movies where everything is hahaha war hilarious dont know what to think about this game whats this shit it looks awfull really doom 2016 is looking waaaayy better maybe evil controlled by elon musk elon musk sht they knew my plan can you shrink that fps counter a little its a little overwhelming jack im gonna play as a man me i think ill stay a while man this game looks really fun i might have to get this game whos pissed off about the new got episode who asked for this game i guarantee no one will remember it in 6 months its like a weird borderlands madmax mix also reminds me of farcry new dawn for some reason the enemies look piss poor easy and stupid the jokes when their fellow soldiers are dying seems a little off ruins the atmosphere i think hes not gonna defib out of that obviously they have never met a battlefield defib calling it now that robot guy in the beginning is your father and wants you to join the dark side why the fuck play at 4k the story dialogue it all feels very meh maybe im expecting more these days than whats necessary but seems like itd be a pretty boring campaign is this dooms less satanic brother 11pm sees jakfrags uploads rage 2 game play looks at how long well guess i wont sleep this looks like what bulletstorm 2 would be anonyone else notice that the main characters voice actor also voiced gaara this shit is multiplayer sorry ill not buy it why do you in all your gameplays of new games play like a console player the gunplay looks more like bulletstorm than rage its like if doom were a boring ass cover shooter jack whatever happened to the idea of a second channel where you do full play through best pep talk since hitler reminds me of one of my favorite games ever bulletstorm is the voice actor of the character you play as the same as yasuo from league this looks like a generic mobile game it doesnt look like it was made with any like title in mind like a unity shooter demo such a weird feeling your the best this could have been a nice lootershooter this is basically doom but with more of a storyline and kinda like in a borderlands universe right any multiplayer in this game this is like a free game on psn looks like on average hes getting 50 fps with a 2080ti first 15 min are enough for you to see that this is another american futuristic story driven shitty self over powered first person super action hero saga soda where you can do this an that as in every other american futuristic story driven shitty self over powered first person super action hero game nothing special in this game nothing new we need quality games like hellblade cyberpunk god of war 4 etc which stand out of the others no buy from me what resolution is he playing on looks fucking clean couldve had the high contrast option for the fps enabled for this one jack that voice is that voice from fallout nv the story telling has a wierd pace and the animation are not as punchy as the sound but that might come with future gear lemme sum it up for you m e h i love a bit of doom wait hang on a second its a reskin since when was dashing considered a superpower so quick to pick the guy back in the mid late 90s early 00s we used to get fps after fps without innovation it seems that trend is back this game looks like it was made for the ps3 with good lighting i can see im going to spend so long exploring ill never finish the main game another fake livecom is that the dud from starcraft wait are you supergt as well gameplay is awesome but the acting is terrible imo not the kinda game i would play at all but it might turn out to be quite good you know dev early concept mass effect andromeda thats a cactus jack please dont reload every 2 to 3 shots me looking for the fps counter fps counter im on my phone and i literally cannot see the fps counter lul when is there going to be more sea of thieves rage 2torial dont know why but it looks boring this is garbage lmao wow they made those graphics look way better in the trailers i mean as always only battlefield and ff are the only ones with the best engines this looks trash ahah always wondered if this art style was reproduced from a level i made once i made one for farcry using neon in a desert environment then ubi made blood dragon and a few others started coming out with bright colours to contrast a bleak backdrop the immersion is kind of ruined with that massive hit marker and skull symbol missed an arc chest in the goon station avalancheas the devs of just causesign me up man another snarky main character whose only personality trait is making witty remarks every five seconds i find it really perturbing that the two protagonists are in the midst of a battle witnessing numerous people getting violently murdered and all they do is crack jokes and shoot the shit i just cant take anything about this seriously im only at the beginning of the video but my first impression of this game is not great dumb and jackfrags prerecorded voice over is also dumb loved the 1st rage this time round i hope we get the proper ending we deserve are we getting br tho cannot go without mentioning easter eggs d lmao it they did like saints row did to its series its a shame i loved rage but now it has become too much arcade there ability and all shame knowing its avalanche studios making the game makes me worry that it will probably run like stephen hawking at release by the thought of how just cause 3 4 and generation zero turned out i have zero hope for that dev team the trader seems a lot like wallace was it from nier automata no offense but i think you ought to stick to bf commentary the female protagonist at the character select just gets casually annihilated and no one says a word youre my favourite youtuber as far no doubt about that your gameplay is an orgasm so pleasant and good keep up the good work jackfrags why is there so much pink wtf holy shit they deal with the two characters which one you wanna play situation very bluntly dont they xd nice game openworld but what horrible ai no challenge at all from the humour ive seen used in game and the trailers i feel like it tries too hard to be funny i think it was going for a borderlands style humour a bit stupid but funny small thing to get annoyed at but other than that it looks decent could you have made the fps counter any smaller early early bois unite i expected the narrator to say nicholas cage rage 2 gameplay first impressions thats the title if anyone was wondering this game doesnt look half good anyone else watch the cutscenes in videos and then skip them in the game so they can get right into it is the voice at the beginning shredder from the 1980s ninja turtle movies hi jack from new zealand d superman mad max just cause without grapples crackdown but without rules minecraft but with hyperviolence instead of wood mine comes out in 2 hours i honestly cant wait im so excited mine comes out in 2 hours i honestly cant wait im so excited driving in this game reminds me of mad max who tf disliked is this game has only story mode ohyea this game exists hey jack rage 2 looks amazing who cares ab being first i dont hey jack love the vids keap it up i aint racist never been this early before the mouth movement of the npcs makes me feel like the world is a few second behind definitely love the mad max quake kinda feel to it 1st see not even i care i think its not getting enough recognition 20 great game love it would love to buy on pc but it seems a lot of gamebreaking bugs have yet to be fixed as of december 2019 pause this game is amazing game developers need to take note gamers buy games to play the game not buy massive amounts of content excellent game series with massive replay value which is extremely rare that doesnt excuse the god damn crashes bugs and game breaking glitches bethesda never care about fixing the crashes and they squeeze money from everyone just like konami and activison game wont start on ps4 it crashes right after pressing x at the title screen constantly cant even start the game only just got this but i gotta say fun for the first 1020 minutes but then it just gets sooooooo repetitive it kinda just makes you feel your doing the same thing over n over 15 dollars a mouth isnt free especially if youre playing a single player game love this channel before you buy is a great series its the most reliable reviews for video games on the internet seriously pass on this horsesh1t didnt hear much cons so ill give two 1 time defense events are a pain especially when enemies constantly spawn on your objective you tend to bleed ammo and health fast even with powers its a shit show your guns can be upgraded with ammo piercing rounds but even against armored opponents they are subpar 2 edging on vehicles is to tight especially on motorcycles it makes for bad race events or when fighting enemy convoys i cant tell you how many times ive driven off of cliffs because the vehicles seize up vehicular camera also a problem it tends to want to dip down when you are fighting with something overhead i honestly miss games like soldier of fortune do you remember how cool it was that each body was made from 26 different parts you could shoot someone in the shoulder knee whatever today its like shooting on 1 piece dolls looks like imma try out rage 2 this game has the best fighting i experienced in any game 20 bucks for this the other day finally a price i can justify unpopular opionion i enjoyed this game much more than outer worlds the only way to get the game expansions for rage 2 on xbox is to buy ingame currency and to purchase through the game store in game not through xbox store i may have got the expansions if they had a season pass for it to be bundled with but fk no to macro transactions wanted to make sure if you want to get the game be aware many instead of making a point less vid on bashing the down falls of this game maby dont make a vid srry to say if your not a rage fan dont play it but if you are then its for you so dude do a solid gtfo honestly the game is awesome bethesda did rage justice i also didnt expect or want this game but it came out of nowhere the only gripe i have about it is the bugs but it is a bethesda game i stopped listening after doom in open world and now im waiting for the game to download now ive bought it i actually really enjoyed the first rage i enjoyed it right to the end but at that time i understood its name because rage was what i felt the game ends basically right when you expect that its going to start getting good it feels like youve just completed the basic prologue and are finally going to get into the real thick of itbut thats it its over jokes on you asshole i was ultra pissed but im going to give rage 2 a chance i like this game but i dont think my mx150 pc likes it as much i just loved the game this game surprised me a lot another open world boring bullshit game the first rage was one of my favorite game on ps3 and i absolutely loved it i completed its about 3 times oh meh i prefer not to play games that literally waste time making a character creation only to have you stuck in first person the entire game 4x better than fo4 only problem with it is a bugesda game yep it has bugsalot of it some will corrupt all your saves thus you lose everything and have to start overfrom the beginning but nevertheless im compelled to play it over and over again glad they went forward and made it borderlands with better graphics but less guns are you playing on xbox one x or pc with controller i get 30 fps on xbox one s can u disable the pink colouring i loved the original rage would love to enjoy this game but the damn vehicle menu just freezes up and crashes the entire game every single time xbox one s another shitty game of 2019 same repetitive bullshit youre in an open world and you travel to bases and take down the same enemy this game is even hard on easymode frickin wicked man yeah what if i told you xbox gamepass got this game for free game pass brought me here and i really enjoy this game i enjoyed the first one but i didnt buy it from the jump wanted to get it used now this one is really good had me playing for days and its really enjoyable this game is a must play ive played 2k and there are worst games out here this is actually have personality so doom with super powers much less gore and a mad max vibe alright im sold after all i really liked the first game except it was too short and the driving was less than ideal from what i heared i was gonna pass this game up but this looks like id enjoy it after all now microtransactions that one i have to wait and see thats a clear argument against a game in my view i have gamepass utimate and im looking to play this awesome new game for free and now i know ima be havin fun with my bros in this kick ass the game in the future both voice actors are great played as both game pass is so good now i rented this game a while back but now able to beat it the gameplay is the best part so this just came out on game pass and youve sold it to me fuck game pass im buying it its fun but it has alot of technical issues for me it crashes every time i go to the upgrade screen for the first vehicle and the menu is so sluggish and laggy my first 30min the audio completely cut out forcing a restart im surprised he didnt have any issues because from what ive read online everyone is having these problems maybe its better on pc or since he had a review copy they made sure it was polished maybe it only has issues on xbox one i got it through game pass and was so excited because i had wanted to play this since launch i guess ill just keep playing and hope it doesnt crash with the other vehicles the controls feel extremely stuff and sometimes sloppy but with practice its fun other then the fact you can play this without playing the first game i think i would have preferred a bit more of a reference to the first game like they dont really mention much of what happened after the first game till now like loosum hagar she was a teen the last time i saw her now shes the mayor of wellspring also i like the open world but it does break up the idea that wellspring was never set up like that well not the outside of it narrow canyon and such now its completely opened up anyone else having glitches and crashes making the game almost unplayable this game was wayyyyy tooooo short it was trash before you game pass i am loving this game now free on xbox gamepass so basically what im hearing is its a borderlands knock off just downloaded on game pass i was thinking of buying this game lucky enough it came out free on gamepass lmao free on game pass must not be too great huh who is here because of game pass coop multiplayer the first rage while a lot simpler than this new one was actually a pretty fucking bad ass game dude the first rage was incredibally under rated do you need a monster pc to play this game haha i want to buy but im not sure just dont buy this game deletes its own save files on top of every kind of glitching i tried every thing for a week my save file was deleted every time lost more than 60 hours thats it for me deleted the game and the save not gonna get back to it most probably will avoid bethesda altogether not buying any of their games seriously i wont be fooled again id love to get this game i get its a while after release but i home its like farcry new dawn but better am i the only person in the world that was a big fan of the first rage i played the first rage liked it but after months to years forgot all about it so this is on sale the store and im dancing around itbuti was insanely bored by rage 1 and it all looks like a non comic version of borderlands which i enjoyed but not looking to continue playing really should i buy it or save my money for the outer worlds i payed full price for this game and maybe played an hour can someone explain to me how do i get rid of this ringing noise in the game its a bug im assuming since it goes on throughout my gameplay and i cant hear a single word the ai says thereafter first rlrage was one of my favorite games on ps3 d so sort of exited about rage 2 yeah anything not on steam aint for me ill probably wait for sale on steam i found the open world to be very empty and boring but the shooting is very responsive and main missions are fun but the whole gameplay system is just a bit dull this game is connected to rage one though just because at the end of that game the arcs start to pop up out of the ground all over the world the orginal rage was legendary absolutely amazing in my opinion i was whining for years why they wouldnt make a rage 2 somehow ive slept on this game for awhile now idk why guess its a part of being an adult bethesda went full lesbian on this title the only gung ho manly yapping from anyone in this entire game is from gi jane gapers seriously and it gets sickening after a while i still cant get it to launch though youtube magic this video has autogenerated korean subtitles you can even autotranslate them into english and compare with what he actually says very good game it plays well on my 6gb 1060 plenty to see and do good graphics loads of action and some humour also too many bugs repeat levels same character skins shitty combat ai bad voice acting over sensitive controls broken abilities driving is garbage and the enemies are sharp shooters with way too much health first game was good not great this game is barely playable overdrive doesnt work at all and the game constantly crashes 410 is it just me or does it have a huge bullet storm vibe which practically raised me completed the main storyline in 28 hours awesome game but very very short this open world crap is just lazy filler spend more time on interesting levels i love the first game on xbox 360 order rage 2 for ps4 on amazon should have it this monday cant wait to play if a game uses danny brown as trailer music you should download it rage 2 is not rage at all its like halo meets mad max and this is the aftermath i really wanna buy rage 2 love id and avalanche but three things is the game worth it how long is it i dont wanna sign up for the damn bethesda launcher can i bypass that there is no doubt this is great fun shooter damm dnt care about story and blah blah this is fast paced gory shooting and nothing else just play it i loved rage one i still play it i will get this game much better than boringlands lul so you dont even mention the worst menu and inventory of all gaming history in this game huh or all the fricking bugs even after the patches or the frame drops or how bad this game looks in some places even worst than the first rage rage 2 is basicaly fallout doom and mad max and just cause where is the card on rage 2 the visuals look positively stellar how is no one talking about the latencyinput lag ill wait until i can get it for 20 bucks as the only thing good about it is the combat the driving and endless scavenging sucks i hate thes neon colors im a little disappointed that there isnt as big a focus on driving as there is shooting dont get me wrong i loved doom but overall it sounds like a fun game i just really liked mad max and i thought this game would be a nice bit of both doom and mad max it probably kinda is why bethesda dnt use id engine in fallout4 to make drivable vehicle really thorough review casual and not too pushy impressed only thing i would add is maybe mention that the game length is a kind of small and lacking in content considering how fun of a shooter it is i just found myself wanting more not a complaint really but maybe we can hope for some dlc down the road for a little variety to keep the fans entertained its such a polished fps id hate to get bored of it because it was a little too short man jakes voice reminds me of cleanprincegaming i thought it was ok not great at all imagine if he was sponsored by rage shdow legends while playing rage holy crap this is some massive shilling i just spent all my life savings on an expensive gaming pc and now i cant afford any real intensive games jesus the autoaim in the game is insane its a good game that for sure created a new language of fps rented this game the other day share alot of the opinions in the video is this online gaming or has story mode when i completed the intro it said you need the full game installed to proceed pls wait for the installation process to complete it stopped around70 should i exit to main menu and wait there or not who had this i would say play the first game if you still have a 360 or ps3 just because you can find it cheap and the graphics are pretty cool to watch during conversations it was what i wish dialogue in fallout was like at the time i was really hoping to play the game i got it on pc but had to return it due to startup errors so now ill aim for the console platform did jake finally go through puberty good for you buddy just got it for 40 on xbox one im doing a walk through right now on it still not too sure how i feel about it to be honest im picking up the game later today this is a ripoff if destiny 2 and borderlands playground for destruction red tanks i refuse to explode sir i have no internet whatsoever is there any essential updates or anything like that game is trash idk why the cover of the game reminds me to the 2016 election not worth money very short campaign and boring run around the map and do same stuff over and over for 100 times open world felt very empty it is very similar to mad max but mad max was by 10 better than rage 2 and mad max is kinda shity comparing to fallout 4 or dying light as pointed out by praxiic your reviews are more trustworthy than igns i used to watch ign for reviews but now that im older and understand how shit their reviews are youve been my go to this this is why i dont take game reviews seriously anymore i normally dont go out of my way to make comments but this game is amazing and was worth every penny reminds me of elements of doom fallout and mad max all combined into one game shooting that reminds me of cod and driving simulation like a good off road racer why on earth would this be demonized thats stupid love your reviews excited for this game now i think i should get it can you continue exploring after the story ends because you couldnt do that in the first one should i buy it mad max doom and bulletstorm all had a baby and this is what you would get its a great game i just really wish there was more content you can see and do everything in about 25 hours and thats taking your time the gameplay is awesome but one thing that really disappointed me is how short the campaign in you can literally beat the entire story in half a day which to me is not worth 60 bucks if you are ready to not play and be stuck on infinite loading screens this is the game for you do u need wifi to play this game i would of liked if it had a co op with like 1 friend i agree on the shooting part that rocks but other than that theres is nothing to really do in the open world all missions are found in towns but nothing can be explorered and found like in the witcher or rdr2 aside from that i found very few if any really interesting missions in the open world there are events but all do repeat characters and story seems uninteresting still entertaining game but only because of the shooting this was a pretty fun game until my sound crashed and then my game crashed the game never loaded up again after that i tried to reinstall but then it wouldnt reinstall i decided to return the game instead of going through the nightmare of trying to get it to work as far as the actual game it is too short and the open world is way too small gaming strike stop buying from aaa companies for coming out with half made games i bought the game an im loving it but how long is the story cuz i feel like im progressing too far into the story too quick been playing the hell out of it at first i felt like it was eh because i was busy and only could play 30 minutes here and there but when i got to sit down and actually focus and play for a decent amount of time this game got really fun i love this game so much that ive started to replay the entire story again yet now it feels to easy rage 1 was garbage fight me what in the borderlands is this really did not expect anything from the 1st rage game it was a pleasantawesome surprise thumbs up if you had the same experience the sound of the car keeps bugging out for me and it looks like everyone is mute an im the only one talking do not agree at any point you make the story is thin at the most the graphics are doomed and the humour the ai sucks no value for the money i say but hey if you want to drive around and shoot things up go ahead but rage is far better and if you want to play postapocalyptic fast shooter w humour get borderlands sounds like you got quite a benefit to butter this up is there a a splitscreen couch coop mode whats up with the audio great game i swear you guys better not do a video on before you buy borderlands 3there is no reason not to buy it take my fucking money should be the name of that video guys pliz read this i see a lot of positivity for the game here and thats good but overall people have gotten a bad taste from rage 2 cus of ign and other shit sites that does not make any good points here we have a video on the game that tells the real things and gives a perspective to the game and if it sounds good to you pliz buy the game it tells the developers that we do like this game and in the long run we can get a even better rage 3 reminds me of farcry new down i wish they would of added at least one unlockable sniper for those people who like surprising the enemy or being somewhat stealthy its really a pity how little this game offers the core gameplay is fantastic but theres just nothing even remotely worth playing around it fantastic combat in this game other than that its total shit loads of bugs and crashes audio problems the racing mechanics are beyond annoying and you have to finish first in one race i like the game but it feels broken its like me good qualities and potential but broken to the core i remember the first rage had a crappy cliff hanger endingi hope the ending in this is more fulfilling well structured review and i agree with most of it especially the open world aspect as a huge and probably only fan of rage 1 i actually think there were a lot of things that were done better in that game activities to do in the towns random attacks in the world more racing and vehicle combat activities more viable vehicle upgrades better secrets and nods to old school fps games doom quake wolfenstein and id room these are just a few things that i feel lacked in rage 2 overall great game but i feel they had to sacrifice a lot of the things i mentioned for the open world the difficulty thing turned out to be a bug every time u close the game it resets on easy even tho it shows its on hard another fps no brain required i loved rage but rage 2 left me a little disappointed the main campaign was very short i beaten the game within less than 3 days and i only used 2 weapons and 1 skill to beat the game r2 didnt have a good progression system for me to keep playing the game i needed to bump up the difficultly level to have a challenge mad max had way more stuff to keep you busy just came from zero punctuation and shocked to find a positive review and not his negative one lol single player ok buy a preowned copy from gamestop return within 7 days for your money back repeat rage 1 is amazing its like fallout mixed with borderlands style very immersive game hope rage 2 is as good cant wait to play it better than the last bu needs improvement xbox tectures look like a potato bethesda wants you to link your playstation account to your bethesda account to get the event rewards bethesda you dont deserve the honor gunplay amazing everything else meh this game was a big surprise to me i bough it without an expectations and i was amazed at how cool it was a bit short but pretty good the car is insane and lots of extra thing i wont tell that you get that are super cool also on pc the graphics are amazing reminds me of what borderlands was supposed to look and be like before they went the cell shaded comedy route is there pvp looks like fallout 4 and just cause combined together at first i wanted to stop and close this video after what you said about rage but then it grew on me like a cancerous tumour can you please bfyb for fade to silence really thinking about it but you guys definitely make a deciding factor for most games i get would really appreciate it i got it the day after and it was one of my proudest purchases the shooting and humor of it is amazing this has already became one of my fav games i have to download 22 gb in updates and 6329 on fallout 76 i hope we can play on xbox one tons of funtons of upgradestons of hours upgrade yourself weapons 10carspeopleya john carmack once said that story for video games is like porn yall i need helpwhat should i buysekiro or rage 2 rage 2 a short summary doommadmax1000moreblood me good grades or rage 2 haha funny question rage 2 i come always gotta trust gameranx ok i see your graphics are flickering too i thought my ps4 was broke or is there a fix it looks like a good game with nice praphics and all but at the same time it seem way too easy and too few weapons in the game im just going to wait for borderlands 3 i think basically what the reviews are saying is the kombat is great but the world itself is shit great review and great game wtf wheres the non binary option even tho i agree with what u said i think you left out a lot of negatives like countless bugs including audio problems also im amazed you didnt mention the laggy menu its super annoying wait for cyberpunk i bought it 2 days after release and im enjoying the open world ive played about 4 hrs and havent even done a main mission just going around taking out enemy bases 148 thats offensive so i dig it quite a bit i think it could have benefited from a little more in the way of world building and deeper explorable enviroments but i also understand it wasnt really aiming for the same commitment to enviromental storytelling as say fallout or the last of us it gets the job done and is definitely a welcome game to satiate my bloodlust until doom eternal id give it an 7510 is it online only or is there a offline play the game is really fun and really not good dont buy it for full price hi play is brilliant story is shit playing in hard has zero challenge 20 is good for this game days gone or rage 2 help me games like these kinda trigger me like i know how much potential it has but its just missing so much oh man i wish i had the skill and money to create a game like this it would be so fucking good amazing game disappointed in the deadzone for controllers though i wish theyd let us configure the deadzone in the settings hopefully they patch it still love the game though rage 2 had like 8 missions itd trash and your trash for saying other wise i just bought this game and i thought it would have a multiplayer surely the game is good so far but after its finished there isnt any reason to keep playing hopefully the new borderlands will have everything in it game sucks glad steam has a return policy your ruining peoples game experience ive got one more game i already purchased to play first metro exodus then this 100 im in the minority here but i loved the first rage and have been eagerly anticipating this sequel im glad they didnt go to borderlands level goofy not that its bad its just borderlands thing and im really glad they just gave more game simply because there was only so much you could do in the first one please tell me they brought the boomerang back just got my last achievement last night such a good game i loved playing rage so much so i insisted on buying the anarchy edition i look forward to playing this game i havent seen a single bad review that actually made sense about this game so i went ahead and bought and i had zero regrets the games fun as hell and worth the time and money ignore all the shitty reviews if youre into doom borderlands and if u liked mad max this game is definitely for you i think its for everyone really its just mindless fun youre telling me people didnt like rage 1 rage 1 was one of my favorite games of all time sitting at 55 on steam but its the game im booting up the most it looks like if doom and borderlands got together and one of their parents was crysis rage2 wont work on steam pc dam eney one now wiy that is no multiplayer no thanks reminds me of bulletstorm love the game so much fun neon color palettes have ruined this game piece of shit y they hide those guns though might redownload wolfenstein 2 new colossus ill wait for the sale for this is this game multiplayer soooooooits basically borderlands cool i want this they couldnt squeeze in a coop huh such a shame its way too short hopefully by the time i build my pc itll have a co op patch lol so i beat the game it was pretty fun i agree the story towns characters were just kind of eh but the gameplay was the most fun ive had with a game in a while before you buy have you noticed that seriously so many plantsfoliage are literally pot plants soooo much weed bruh niceee 0040 rage 2 is pretty new of course it is it was just released p the game deleted my saved huhu this is a sequel i did not want lol i dont like this ip sadly i really liked rage it was a huge game came on 3 discs it had borderlands vibes the graphics are still quite impressive for its age but it was forgotten for some reason it was before its time i think as cod was on top back i want this but cant afford to waste money as i have read its full of bugs watching this after buying it before i played it meh lost me at review copy i realy like this game the shooting the wierd npcs and the nice movment couldnt agree more 100 nailed it love this game rage 2 borderlands i think that was it what can you do after all the campaign missions and side missions i got it 2 days ago and its such a blast would recommend the first person shooting is great because we talking about id id made the first first person shooter videogame what engine is this using these vids decide whether i buy a game or not lol i feel like this game gets really repetitive really fast and theres not much to care about the campaign is like 10 missions long and the story is terrible but at least the gunplay is fun for a while but its no where near as good as doom plus i got some seriously annoying bugs that almost broke the game its mediocre but im happy for anyone who can have fun with it i just personally feel disappointed that i spent 60 bucks on it its great but if you dont like far cry like games you might not like it of course there are microtransactions in the game weapon skins etc been a subscriber for a while now and i never heard jake talk this good about a game lol i loved rage and wanted a rage 2 nice this game looks good this has been the best game ive played so far in 2019 the framerate graphics gun play and the content it has is fking awesome in fact i think this game is better than the doom 2016 reboot the cool mechanics this game gives you is superb and the weaponry i bought this game 2 days ago impulsively and already put in over 15 hours on nightmare difficulty i havent had so much fun in a game where i just too damn difficult to put the game down only to take piss breaks and eat and take a break some people say the game is short 8 9 hours but hell im still playing and havent gotten to the end yet ive found all three ex dagger project team members and did 1 or 2 missions for each but not sure how far i got to end the game can i play it with old 7850 gpu goons with mohawks not mullets definitely a buy the first rage is very underaded now i have rage 2 and its freakin awesome could this save bethesda playground for destruction sounds like mercenaries playground of destruction gameplay kinda reminds me of bulletstorm way more excited for doom eternal but this is definitely on my radar rage 1 was my childhood so this is a fuckin steal im one of the 5 people in the world that actually really liked the first rage its a buy for me on pc where do you submit glitches for this game think i will wait for 4 months before i purchase this having played fallout games and being an avid fan fallout 76 was just too much of a complete fuck up from the start and has only just started to be a playable game after 6 months bethesda to me is a corrupt company and will lie and deceive to get you to buy their product on release rage two looks great but i remember all the positive reviews on 76 and no mention of the constant crashes bugs and appalling overall design of the game at launch bethesda games in general take 348 months to fix so i will wait a little while and watch for the reviews after launch it will probably be half price after a week so could save a wod of cash unlike the last game that was released it dropped by 50 after 7 days 5m goal reached d the reviews for this are so variedshould i buy the reviews for this are so variedshould i buy game does have microtrancastions which means nobuy for me oh my god the game is good or not critics are doing a better job than the users giving the game a 510 really l just finish rage 1 and download 2 i really loved the gunplay in this game but im not gonna lieits way way too short i finished about 95 of the locations and missions and finished the main story within 15 hours id love a more fleshed out campaign and a way to redo missions maybe a new game plus kinda thing auugh doom with cars im about to head out so cant finish this video hows the music will it make me want to punch walls like dooms i hope so watching people play fps with a thumb stick gives me anxiety i hope you can read this but after find the people you need i went back to the sewer and im trapped in it now i cant get out why u whispering like u dont wanna wake ur mum up in the next room i honestly think this game is great the combat is top tier and the driving is passable really the open world looks great and serves its purpose u got me once rage never again this game is fun it reminds me of mad max but it doesnt look like the first rage only played the first half hour of the game but the audio sync in the cutscenes was way way out anyone else have this happen rage 2 is like a single player destiny story is meh but gunplay is awesome recommend if u want a mindless awesome shooter with a weak story are you doing a funny glitches video on rage 2 as for once i have one to summit the thing i hate about games like this is theyre forgotten so easily the market is so oversaturated with big budget names that they overshadow ambitous games and passion projects cause a game can have really great shooting mechanics but if youre not enjoying the stuff youre blasting away youre missing something cough cough destiny 2 cough cough awesome game for a change there are microtransaction in game if you look up on steam you immidiatly see rage coins xd i agree jam packed with loads to do great fun shooter a quality game throughoutso glad we got this one a must for all shooter fans ok i do disagree with you saying the enemy variation is great there is multiple factions of raiders so why is there only like 4 mini bosses used over and over through the whole game why not give those gangs different leaders to fight or at least more than just big mutantbig guy in a mech in my opinion if your going to focus gameplay over story add more enemies so im super excited for future dlc im having a blast with this game but would love the option of 4k hdr big thumbs up from me can you stop with the before you buy its really annoying why the game so blurry its basically bullet storm on steroids i remember playing rage with my friend although i dont remember the story so much i know we had fun hitting people with the wingsticks lost me at single player this review was paid check metacritic bought this game and was mystified until i saw your video thank you for making all this shit clear to me dont buy it i wasted my money i absolutely loved the original rage im so glad weve finally gotten a sequel cant wait to immerse myself in this world im really poor and want to play this game so badly someone send me a steam key please really pointless game this is the age of mmos and progress meaning something the game looks really bad tho free rage 2 on my channel boring game will be forgotten soon damn thats an awful mic i love how the ps4 pro footage always looks better than when you do xbox footage like this one game looms so stiff and grainy nothing like when i play on pro no cursing please kids watch these videos does it handle well on the normal xbox 1 im thinking about getting it but worried about it crashing and freezing all the time so is there any point in getting it ive had it for 3 days now and i still cant play it steam says its running synchronizing and then nothing cant fix it at all ive tried everything i read to fix it and still nothing i would be so happy if they added settlement building stuff and called it the next fallout i wanted a rage 2 ever since rage 1 ended cant wait to play it the first one is so underrated just came to say i hate your super cringe thumb nails how big is the open world i want this to be a game for me to just play all day and still have a lot to get back too i want to just get lost in this game and if you have any other suggestions for games to get lost in please let me know its good fun was a big fan of the first one so im happy to see its return bit of a nitpick but the side charecters and the side quest almost didnt exist and that sadends me with borderlands 3 on the horizon i am not splashing out cash on day 1 for this game maybe 6 months later when its 50 off great game i wanted it bought installed never started so got my money back read the comments on steam before buying i prefer you over skill up hes such a backwards reviewer much like doom im playing doom vfr currently and im freaking loving it i wasnt really into rage 2 but now that i see this before you buy i think its looks like its real fun but does it have john goodman lol nobody seems to mention this but can you aim down the sights with all guns i saw nothing but hipfire shenanigans and i dont care for it jake baldino trying so hard to change his voice still sound like a high school girl bitching am i the only one that found the bunker with the brain in a jar dont listen to this guy the game is really empty and boring only around 20 hours of gameplay and after that its the same shit over and over and over again ive finished it already and i absolutely love this and the first one definitely love the firestorm revolver with upgraded vortex ability i shoot 45 firestorm shots at the ground then vortex them all towards it and they just float in the air and burn amazing before you buy get a pc why is my game so laggy the frame rate is awful on my ps4 i dont have a pro but since it uses the same engine as doom i thought it would be as smooth as it was on there and this video anyone know why thank you for sharing this review i was initially put off by the ad campaign leading up to the release of this game but seeing some actual game play and hearing about it well im going to consider it a little more i have huge motion sickness what should i do or put sensitivity on avoid it i pirated it and i glad i did the game is boring af easy like very easy on nightmare difficulty the map is empty with no life like the mad max game but when you get out of the car you are doom guy killing everything with auto headshots in an instant there is a lack of a lot of details too like cliping into the car instead of an entering properly with an animation its an average game good job on five mil man keep up the good work rage was a shitbag of a game stole my damn money found out about rage 2 5 days before it released checked some gameplay and preordered i know bad but ive been enjoying it so much the gameplay is so great and car combat is also quite fun best impulse buy yet i recommend the first one this game is like far cry but with fun added you guys are the last gaming channel with any integrity its appreciated i love you guys congrats on the subs if anyone deserves the attention its you guys i pre oder it and its very great im having a great time but at the point where im at right now the game is lagging and sticking bad was always a rage fan and well of course doom this game just killing it i love it and others that i know that showed it to them freaked out and they bought it and havent stopped playing it is just an amazing game hate off to them i enjoyed the first rage so much so that i played it to 100 twice pc and ps3 never enjoy vehicular related stuff though doesnt matter what game it is i hate vehicle combat racing stunts etc i like that its sp and reminiscent of doom may end up buying it at some point but definitely not at full price its an alright game 510 because its really short and easy even on hard difficulty beat the main story in 56 hours i have to reset the game constantly due to the game glitching out i cant press the button i need to progress sound always glitches out or just doesnt play at allwhich requires another reset the sound itself is bad when it does play guns are fun to play around with the driving is awful dont care about story just skipped every piece of dialoguecutscenes game crashes every now and then im playing the pc version mindless fun nonetheless yeah ill prolly be opting out of this one which makes me sad i wanted to like this and support the single player cause but a shooter with story just isnt for me am sad this video seems a little off to me the way you talk about the negatives seems overly positive you never say anything bad about the game the worst is middling ground opinion some will say thats because you absolutely love the game however i think you like getting your free games and dont want to upset the publishers which is a shame because now its hard for me to respect your opinion anymore a lot of these comments seem way too positive especially towards a review only two genders o pathetic couldnt have said it better its doom meets mad max meets fallout its mindless fun with loads of secrets stashed away in its amazing map its not so big you get lost and everything is pretty easy to jump into the story is easy to follow and not overdone this makes me want to play doom eternal even more i played rage 1 on the 360 it wasnt that good ima have to watch more gameplay to decide if i want to buy this one does anyone know if this game has the option to invert x and y camera controls thats a big one for me and id try to look this up but honestly i can never find any info like that online 034 in and viola magic man appears lmao bootleg doom 4 meets the worst of farcry and mad max a grand total of 8 main quests 4 uninspired abilities and boring enemies i cant recommend this game the world feels empty and the story is awful the fps gameplay is the only redeeming quality of this game and even then doom 4 and wolfenstein did it better in every way the graphics are awful for a 2019 aaa game aswell i told you it will be sht whahahaha xd loving the gunplay i had a lot of fun with the first one but this has been my most enjoyable combat its fast but has a bit of cover shooter on it so its a bit slower than doom and for me thats a plus i m not getting 60fps in this game with my rx 570 the game is too easy i put it on the hardest difficulty and the enemys still lay down like cheap whores even the big ones i had to restart the game and not upgrade my weapons for it to be even remotely challenging also final boss wassssss easeyyyyyyyywtf like he has one move seriouslyit was the worst final boss fight so disappointed defo play on nightmare even hard is too easy sometimes and bosses are easy just play borderlands 2 or 3 which is coming soon we live in a world where id software try to emulate what ubisoft did for years sad state of things okay ya sold me im going to look for this today at best buy is anyone gonna talk about how crazy short the story is a game can have a great gameplay but if it doesnt have a reason to use it other than just repeat the same shit over again then its missing something jim sterling is a genius he found the game this most closely resembles and said it is that game what a poet oh shut up be honest and just say its borderlands rage 2 isnt worth 60 if you want to play single player just wait till its 10 lol dont worry you wont wait long or just get borderlands 3 is there any games that really fuck a modern gpu these days i remember years ago gfx cards struggling to top out games now it seems anyone can hit 60 on all new games lot of char are from first one and alot of the world looks similar to the first one if you have like photographic memory you will pick up where stuff is and what used to be their but he is right dont need to play first one to enjoy game just its a little interesting to see what happens 30 years later im going to be real this shit is fun af and a tad bit challenging the powers and guns you get are dope as shit i bought the deluxe version and been stuck on it every since imagine halo and doom had a baby with a open world love this game was happy they made it i was a big fan of rage 1 thought it was underrated thanks for sharing it looks great game am i the only one watching this in 2024 remember how first person shooters back in the day used to be called doom clones this kinda feels like a modern day version of that this game made me rage how to win in big boss fights spam grenades spam rockets fight will end in less than a minute steam has better reviews than these shills dude i loved the first rage ive been saying they shouldve made a sequel for years now and all of a sudden people are realizing how damn good this game is lol now if only they made a sunset overdrive 2 someone say non comic borderlands i looooove new doom and this game looks amazing gun design in this game sucks seriously honestly i find it boring repetitive face textures of npcs suck thanks i think i might get this game now this is how ive always wanted borderlands to look and feel having played both games i personally think that the immortal shrouded are a much cooler faction than the authority more interesting too does it have borderlands style replay ability by far the worst thing about the game is the exgen graphicstextures both in general and on character models and animations eg talking npcs mouth not moving with voice movements whilst talking not realistic very common repeated hand actions for eg basically really disappointing and somewhat 15 years out of date which is a shame considering the general fun factor and styling of the game gameplay is fine which is what makes that so much more frustrating as solo player i love rage 2 its like single player destiny amazing gunplay huge world plenty of areas to explore world bosses upgrades to collect etc loved the first one love this one its awesomeso glad this game was made the first rage led me to fallout so i always remembered it as being more shooter loiter and fallout was rpganywayrage 2 is awesome i might be slow but i low key thought he was playing doom during the beginning when he starts killing things really jars me that he hip fires so much like you know stuff like that is all stuffy kind of pass just bought my copy installing it now the question is for the pc version did they port the controls correctly or it still tells you to press console buttons do to an action i know bethesda has screwed up a ton in fallout but bethesda has done amazing lately first one is shit well this the first time i partially disagree with youthe combat is really fun and great being the best part of the game but not to be talked about through 34 of the video the open world is blandvery bad like mad maxwhich was not stressed upon the narrative and characters are pretty bland which also was not stressed upon the graphics are gruesome which you failed to mention congratulations on the 5 million subscribers i cant be the only one that lost all interest when they said no coop so you can play only singe player not multiplayer well im not sure about you but after being used to multiplayer fps going through battles against ai can be really boring even if the campaign is fun theres little replayability value in it buy its already pirated u can just play it for free i bought the game and i like the combat most of all for some reason the game is getting a lot of shit in the steam reviews what is up with that done with the game after a 10 hour session and i do have to agree with the hard difficulty because i was also playing on normal and it felt too easy but overall a great game recommend strongly did i played same game like you for me it is boring gunplay is lagy and slow i am very disappointed i love the game overall i just wish it had co op campaign rage was a doom reject that got tweaked and story changed basically dont underestimate id because they care about their fans the sugarcoating is strong with this one lol no ranged weapons cause the game wants you to get up and personal with the enemy okay thank you for saving me 60 cause if thats the kind of game which doesnt give you the choice but instead makes you play how we want you to play said the game developer thats what o need no multiplayer no coop no network connection you need its an open world bulletstorm play on nightmare difficulty for fun why are these videos always in my recommended i dont like this guys voice doom and mad max clone ill just buy those two or skip doom and wait for doom eternal meanwhile please checkout a plague tale innocence shouldve added first person driving if i was playing an fps driving in tpv would take me out of it bought it without hesitation and i do not regret it having fun making walkthroughs im barely completing the third mission too this game is like doom and madmax had a baby with saints row 3 humor love it again whats wrong with his voice buy a microphone been playing it since release and i can honestly say its the most fun ive had in a very long time worth the money twice over 4 minutes into the review and i just straight up bought it is it well optimised for pc im eager to see how my new 2080ti asus strix deals with this game d took you long enough haha jk cuh adoptive military badass mom erm no more like horribly written generic overdonetoughguy female commander in fact you can pretty much slap generic or bland af on most characters and their crap dialogue between that and all the bugs ive seen so far i cant imagine playing this game without drinking heavily to get through it all believe it not but the gameplay is very similar to halo 5 thats why that halo is my favorite and its multiplayer this is not a game for the controller the worst control scheme for fps i mean its still 80 for 20 gameplay hours no matter how fun it is seems hard to playing on ps 4 or im just noob hahaha controler gameplaysorry cant watch it its shitno flame plsjust a fact waste of fucking money i thinkeverything seems to be a dud people who ask do i need to play the first game are the people who care about the small stuff thats referenced i am so pleased with this game so much to do action packed and i suggest everyone try this one out the last game unfinished shit this time full of bugs are they still use the same engine from fallout 4 congrats on 5mil just cause 4 or rage 2 youre sounding more more like an alcoholic i love this game its so chill i have 16 hours of gameplay and i love it would be more but have school not my cup a tea would get bored within 60 minutes game have no sniper rifle to force u in close range combat is good because a game overall is great doesnt mean whatever the fuk it did is good thats a horrible idea i love long range weapons in open world games and removing them is forcing the player to specific gameplay style which is opposite of open world game also bad review u only did talk about shooting and upgrading ur guns how long is the game how many vehicles hows the story is there any aerial combat how many guns how big is the map and etc whats the point of making a mad max inspired game without making vehicles fun so theres a gaint desert in the game which you have to go through in order to go to places but nothing to do in the desert whats the point of an open world if theres nothing to do in that world its been a long time since i got severely hyped as i played through a game grinning and hollering this game did that to me best fps ive ever played doom eternal gonna have to let you pull some brutal rippin and tearin if it can hope to top the combat in rage 2 only issue ive had so far is that at one point it kinda glitched at the mbtv area and i couldnt leave normally had to reload a save aside from that little hiccup its fucking great congrats for the 5 million you guys more than deserve it its bulletstorm in a way at least holy shit this byb made me want rage 2 so bad no microtransactions no multiplayer thats what we want i want to like the game but as of this second i cant login to beathsoft forms to ask and get the tutorials fixed bc they are broken what i mean is i have had every pop up messsage about upgrading my wepons abilitys and car at lest 30ish times now and i feel like i dont need to read the tutorials message every single time i open a f suply box wtf is this a glitch or somthing bc it killing me the game look real good thanks for the review we appreciate yall this game is bad and you got paid to give it a good review already torrented it this game is awesome i dont mind the slow stretches because i dont like games thats all action all the time the downtime gives me time to enjoy the world a bit and i actually enjoy the weighty feel to the driving does it run welllook good on original ps4 when im clicking a before you buy video im expecting a hold on here is the bad stuff or whats wrong with it or what you did not like or this would be better better if not just positive positive positive if its all this good the the titel imo need to be something else maybe just a review of im going to buy it thanks for the review great combat bad game nice looking empty world lacking life bosses and enemy variation rip another letdown overhype shit game but im so fine with everyone slammin on this trash game for future better games in this style next up is doom eternal video needs to have english closed captioning is youtube just unable to autogenerate the closed captioning i dont understand why theres autogenerated korean closed captioning but not english i liked that this review actually gave a recommendation for what difficulty to play on instead of quoting some general guidelines that dont help much d i got the collecters edition it kicks so much ass you dont have to play it on easy like in the video and have it be a boring walkthrough its actually quite challanging on nightmare congrats on the 5 million subs this is irrelevant but just like the lady on watchmojo his voice is getting annoying top game having a blast kinda reminds me of bulletstorm remember that game this game looks amazing bro that literally is like rage 1 just with upgrades textures and a bit game play and furthermore rage one was the shit especially with the dlc to compleat it am i the only one that prefers the dark gritty look of the original why does it look like upscaled 480p everything is blurry even on pc with res scaling turned off looks like a bad ass game kinda like that 1st shooter you remember playin that you got really gewd at yea that 1 bad ass game its an incredibly fun game its powers and abilities make it a breath of fresh air and if you have the money this game is worth it the only thing i remember about playing rage 1 is john goodman voices one of the npcs so unless they only reference that ill be lost get some rest brotha congrats on 5 million subs i got important information for those that already bought the game and want to succeed in it now listen just dont be a mandingo warframe has a lot of groundslam peace crazy grinding crashes multiple times the open world seems ok npc conversations could have been better guns are ridiculously worse gates repetitive after some time shitty game please dont buy this game for a guy who likes a challenge and tactics i have to admit this looks like shit not something for me just another very generic poop and shoot when you mix doom mad max and a bit of borderlands you get rage 2 loved the first game cant wait for this haha congrats to 5 mil looks like mad max the game words of wisdom the game is really about the gameplay replace every time he says rage with borderlands and replace the footage with bl2 for a big eough good video but for a channel that has over 5 mill subs why the hell does the audio of that mic sound like its recorded on a phone pls tell me that there is an ads button and youre just too stupid to use it funny you should mention playground of destruction as a marketing term thats the marketing line used for the 3rd person open world game mercenaries its a ps2 era series similar to just cause with a focus on the amount of the environment you could destroy like rage 2 the big draw was the gameplay and having the ability to freely run around wrecking everything in sight def get a doom feel from it very enjoyable so far the drivingtraveling gets better once you unlock the icarus i find it enjoyable to just fly to locations its faster and easier singleplayer open world good shootin punky feel sounds good to me buy who buys single player games lol game has been cracked since day 2 yo dont waste your money for shit where is falcon at looks a lot like a boarderlands type game dreams early access before you buy please jake are you ok youre voice sounds like it hates you it is what it is switch off and enjoy id say mindless fun id rather play minecraft vanilla than this shit im not gonna lie the first one was kinda trash lol but it seems like they took all the stuff the brought down the first one and fixed everything and fine tuned it to make it a actually pretty amazing looking game so excited to find your review definitely subscribed this will be know as the game id dropped before doom eternal this game is canon fodder guys pretty nice piece of a game in our time it is something special fucking give them the money they deserve the team that did the lighting and sound need to be fired as both are broken for me games should not be pitch black other than the light on my gun i need to get this game ugh another far cry game copy why does this game play make me feel dizzy when i watch it as you sure its running properly im going to be honest the story is really short dont buy if you want a story game should of made it co op people are selling this on ebay at 20 quid already lol what the hell man is it really this bad i was done when he stepped on his own words maybe it could have been a her sorry for my sexxism in my sexxiness sad that this review will determine a buy or not for some people hey guys red box it decided for yourself and definitely unsubscribe this trash i wont dislike because i know you guys are tryn to get your welcome i did play the 1 it was fun but to short and missing alot but fun is there a ability to ads that was never used i beat it today in 6 hrs it was amazing d going nightmare mode now all the upgrades overwhelmed me to the point where i wasnt having fun at all a little too late to make a video about the first borderlands even though theres no audio problems with the video jake sounds like hes whispering not whispering like i cant hear him but more like while recording the video he doesnt want anyone around him to hear what hes saying about the game what fallout 4 shouldve looked like im so buying this game its broken on pc and support bethesda support is lacking i have had 2 game ending mission bugs that caused me to lose 15 hours of gameplay as i could not longer progress dont trust auto save lots of disappearing models audio missing a main npc that you have to look at a certain spot talk to him so i would wait some months for patches there is about 4 hours worth of main storyline gameplay not counting the horrible travel time were there is nothing to do all side quests are go here shoot loot level up the 3 factions spend money and points for upgrades repeat its a poor mans borderlands with doom gunplay any off the wall antics hinted at is not present maybe its in audiopda logs which i dont recommend opening as they crash the game fyi the bfg 9000 is broken it one shot everything and the he is getting hot cheat is funny as hell the announcer adds more to the game seems like a good game to hold me out till doom eternal i never played rage 1 but the trailers for the sequel got me hyped so i took a chance and preordered the deluxe edition i have no regrets everything about this review is spot on not to mention no bullshit epic store exclusive and no need to use bethesdas launcher theres a ton of mad max assets here but thats not a bad thing cause the combat in that game was mediocre hud is ass other than that looks good borderlands destiny doom mad max epic bruh moment i hate comparing games but after playing this i cant wait for doom eternal im playing it rn and its really doommad max borderlands all smacked together in a big sandwich very happy with this purchase so far fov slider was really nice addition the graphics look great and gameplay has been a lot of fun after whatching this channel for long time i just subscribed so i can help getting the 5m idk why people didnt like the first rage that game was so fucking fun had so much fun on it in my stoner phase looks fun but i think ill get bl3 1st then check this out its a great game i would buy this game but the bland open world is a turn off lol wish it was linear or like semi open but nope they made it into an open world game ill probably get it on sale or something tbh that first scene where hes fighting in the pit destroying hives i swore i was watching doom gameplay while i want to play this game way way way too many of the reviews say its not finished or needs a patch so i plan to wait at least a month if not until a sale to pick this up will probably give this a try at some point but man im a bit tired of seeing fps games i think i love this game vehicle physics are shit you only get 15 hours of playtime max takes like 10 hours to beat and get to 80 or so poor sequel should of been its own game 1st rage shits on this this is like just cause without the grappler and everything wow shitting on rage smdh rage was a good ass game it doesnt work with dual core i mean like my pentium g4560 no rage for budget gamers add this to before you buy the ending is absolute trash seems boring a no from me im in love with days gone did anyone else notice the autogenerated korean subtitles really wish this game had far cry style coop itd be a blast to play with a friend its a good game a lot of people seemed to wnat to rack on for silly reasons honestly i am back to cause youtube keeps reconnmended me your lame vids refund after 1h45 if you are over 30 years old and love quality over stupidity wait for a deeeeep sale i like this guys review a lot hes really fair and positive and his criticisms arent hyperbolic and nitpicky it doesnt feel like hate when he doesnt like something and it pumps me up to hear him get excited about the stuff he likes got it on release and while the open world is pretty meh the shooting is fuc awesome how do you know it good or bad if its not ducking released rage 2s biggest flaw is being saddled with the rage name it sounds like has the person playing ever heard of ads the game is boring as hell the writing is sooooo bad the gameplay is like borderlands 1 but slower seems like a fun game i would get at redbox and beat it in one night or wait for a price drop 60 seems kinda high for the kind of game it is looks fun no doubt but would be more open to buy now if it had co op i think 60 i think games like borderlands 3 lol love the before you buy videos great reviews looking forward to buying rage 2 wtf jake are you on xanax why did you slowdown the slow people doesnt understand you hope that you comeback with your signature fast style great before you buy by the way the game should be free for whoever owns doom this is a reskin almost 5 million subs eh clicks unsubscribe button hows the sound track for me atleast a good sound track can make any game especially action 10 times better just think of doom that sound track makes everything feel fucking crazy awesome and fits so well dont buy this game in my opinion rage 2is just a dumbed down version of borderlands good game for a glitch video for you guys supposedly this game is really boring havent seen much so this is from other youtubers it should have been a new ip than a sequel to rage because storywise it has almost nothing in common with the first one the first one was more semilinear atmospheric gritty with a western vibe while this one is openword bright colorful and punk hands up for all who played up rage 1 does anybody here know if it lets ur ps4 normal one not the pro sound like a helicopter cause a lot of newer games seem to be a little to much for mine when i play ad odyssey i cant bring myself to play longer than two hours because i feel like my playstation will explode anytime soon d and it would be nice if i wouldnt have this problem with rage bullshit obviously they got payed to say good shit about this crap game the races are fun af love the carnage of fighting as well been playing it for about 10 hours and loved every second of it 1010 wasnt interested because its so similar to metro and borderlands but this looks fun super fast balls to the walls action the entire first fight scene looks so boring like your walking in quicksand and looks absolutely nothing like doom hmm ill wait for doom dont worry i dont think anyone is buying this the opening logo brings me the same good feels as seeegaaaaaa lol this sounds like an ad avalanches driving is terrible it was bad in just cause 23 havent played 4 and its bad here although they do helicopters real well i drove for about 4 minutes in just cause 2 and flew in helicopters for like 30 hours why no comments about game limited installations on steam where is critic for too much pink colours you guys loose the touch it isnt interesting to watch this video applause for new bethesda product if you like this kind of game you should definitely try shadow warrior 2 still hoping they would release a shadow warrior 3 tho i went to ps4 page and seen coins for sale and decided i dont want this game put on mute and watch and see if you feel the same way though the power of suggestion may have already set in they need to stop dicking around and give us doom eternal the first one wasnt exceptional but i spent a lot of time playing it it was fun to play many things to do i also dont really remember the first game just remembered it was fun wanna try this one for sure o shit i forgot this was out gotta take a trip to the store i like having the choice of having a sniper with an assault rifle taking that away just makes me not want to play a shooter that doesnt even give that option not for me for 60 i will wait till a sale the average score from the top 10 critics i saw was a 710 i think it focused too much on having a big world with lots of activites and lots of outdoors fps combat and not nearly enough on story and linear fps combat sections everyone says the combat is great tho childish baldino did you mention the microtransactions what are they like how close to fallout im looking for a over the top insanity game looks like the game is like borderlands and far cry new dawn to me just cause first person doom this sounds like a paid review the only thing i remember from the first game are john goodman and the wingstick no spipers no interest totally sick of mindless run n gun games what does it plays pretty fun mean feels like a more costly mad max which i played the crap out of nothing too special but just mindless fun as you said thanks for the heads up about the difficulty i started a game yesterday and did the tutorial and it was very easy so i was waiting to hear someone mention if its one of those games where hard is the actually normal mode lol this game sucks nice game you sold me on the collectors edition lol for me this game lost some of its original rage feeling it seems to be a mix between mad max and farcry however it is really a good game rage was a great game glad to see the second one is also a great game too i actually really liked rage thought it was interesting but yeah it faded from my memory fast is a great way of describing it you mean before you torrent it this sounds like awesome thanks jake im having so much fun with this game so im confused as to why this game is getting bad reviews the combat is great even for someone like me who is bad a fps and as i said im having so much fun but how is it compared to borderlands so red faction guerilla open world crossed with doom shooting then borderlands craziness and you get this work of art d you were right i picked it up last night and started the game on hard just the right amount of challenge mad max meets doom and that ozzyman voice package anyone remember the game called just cause 4 man that fell off the radar real quick doom eternal guys were definitely involved in dev this buy for me just subscribed hope you get to your 5 mil today its worth it you dont need to play the first game in fact you dont need to play this one neither bethesda is making you create a bethesda account to play this single player game i just ordered the collector edition ranger eats rico for breakfast and shs out mad max for tea lol great freakin game how many weapons and abilities do you have i want to get this game for sure but one of my main issues with the first one was its length i actually really liked the game overall but i was able to breeze through in a single weekend and was kind of disappointed to finish it so quickly especially since it had 3 discs from what i remember was this issue fixed could you play the game for a good while and does it have replayability i loved rage 1how am i going to like this one i think multiplayer could work well i dont think any fps game is worth buying rn save up for bl3 and their assumingly amazing expansions its fun but crashes a lot i dont like the game its too empty its absolutely amazing to see rage 2 being spoken in such great light so many reviewers are just not up for this game but this this has made me proud jake and its on playstation 4 i heard its a boring and very short game with empty open world doommad max two of the greatest thing of the decade put into a single package why not btw why do you need a sniper when you can use mortar and big guns on your car fuck the story its a game and its a goddamn fun game but it has reload not doom by a longshot prolly feels like doom but not with that so how much did they pay you for a faultless review so borderlands with bulletstorm gun play and doom enemies no wolefenshtein for you guys are you ready to rage where is ma falcon only thing you need to know its not borderlands 3 lol my biggest gripe are the graphics ive never seen such a difference from trailer to game it looks awful why does doom 2016 look so much better gameranx please suck more balls to go to heaven or earn some extra bucks i had little to no interest in this game now my interests have been peaked i am tempted to buy this game this game is by far one of the best fps games ive played in recent years and i personally love the vehicle combat taking out convoys is one of my favorite things to do in game rage 2 is a 4 or 5 hour campaign that ends abruptly theyre banking on the dlc rather than the storyline what engine is this made on it seems very optimized and smooth i may need to pick this up the recent fallout games have been so buggy and unoptimized have you changed microphones it sounds odd great review though game looks boring as all hell it pains me to watch the slow tardiness of an fps played on controller a 180 should be instantaneous anything else hurts my brain not elitist its just a peeve of mine the slow movement and terrible target acquisition is hard to watch i appreciate the relatively unclipped gameplay way more enjoyable than the heavily clipped gameplay that is more common on youtube it gives a more subjective impression of the game you play as a ranger named walker 1010 i find the ads for this game so annoying for some reason so its basically bulletstorm been waiting for this since the first one in 2011 i pre ordered the deluxe edition and absolutely lovin it so far driving leaves a lot to be desired but the gameplay makes up for it i wish the protagonist was silent like the first one and it didnt go full campy mode and stayed serious regardless 1010 its doom 2016 with a bit more power and story to it mixed in with a lot of fun combat it runs like a dream on the one x highly recommended if you want to have some violent fun dont say playground of destruction unless youre talking about mercenaries its sad and wrong all at the same time ive played the original rage wayy back in the day and i did really enjoy it cant wait ti get around to this playing a shooter with a controller its like you people hate games honestly i have this game its fun and all but the story is so short probably the quickest ive ever beaten a game but overall the game is good but i personally prefer rage 1 then rage 2 but also rage 2 is a lot more dynamic in the open world then the first game you can see stuff going on around you in the open world just cant watch console gameplay question out there for those who own this game on the ps4 prois the picture more crisp than smooth using a 4k tv i understand its only 1080p to reach 60fpsjust curious i buy the game then always watch the before you buy after rage 2 playground of destruction eh im still gonna wait for a sale thanks for making a video for this i still dont trust bethesda after fallout 76 i think they should have brought the hand to hand combat from mad max thats all its missing and more in the open world ive been stuck on this game since i got it on the 14th on the 20th of may i am buying this game just looks like he shooting with an assault rifle games are ruined now a days they have changed rage completely its like they copied doom old rage was more of a survival theme this is a basic bitch shoot em up i felt so dumb when i forgot about the perk trees they had in game and kept just trying to use things from the beginning or the game and after i upgraded things i truly felt like a god now i regret that i didnt do it before and now have 28 deaths in my stats so fun though i never played rage should i buy it trash fps games its nothing like mad max i want mad max 2 the game way better then this pew pew garbage all the people who didnt care about rage enjoying this now imagine being someone who loved rage as soon as rage ended i wanted more and now i got it so much fun having a blast i remember when rage was released the hype was about the new id tech with megatextures and then you play the game and the featuresadvantage of that new engine could not be less obvious to be honest i loved this games gameplay from day one buying this game i couldnt careless about the story all i want is to shoot up some bogies in style and this game scratches all those itches soo stfu and take my this type of shit just doesnt appeal to me anymore you sound different do you have a new mic or are you sick hope the first one its really fun story is trash but it doesnt matter the open world sandbox and guns make up for it i might have to spend the 60 on this one love these vids man game looks interesting i think ill redbox it first haha thanks for the vid you definitely gave a great idea of whats in the game 5 million subs thats no small number great job and very much looking forward to the odometer rolling over really awesome review thank you so much for all your efforts hello humans lex any relationship founded on lies is destined to fail its a good thing we dont have that problem clark lucky us smallville tv show terrance out jake you sound different no mention of length ive heard its only 8 main missions long and about 7 hours if you take your time with exploration can anyone confirm i know i was giving this game so much shit people are so triggered over it its just ridiculous im picking this up ive decided i am still not sure if i want to get this game im excited to play it but im going to wait i like the way it looks but given its current review scores i see it dropping price pretty soon and id like to save the cash if possible the best way that i have to explain this game far cry meets mad max and has sex with crysis some of the best elements of those games are kind of meshed together into this game sounds great feels great driving isnt as polished as mad max but everything else gives a challenge while making the player feel very satisfied about how theyve dispatched the fools on the other end of their barrels great stuff enjoying the game immensly thus far hermaphrodite lizard isnt an option at the gender selection part boooooyyyycooooott doom crysis before you buy buy it id tech has probably the best gunplay right now however imagine that same gunplay but coop what should i get rage 2 or days gone rage 2 borderlands 3 and halo infinite looks like well have some great shooters this year and hopefully next year well get halo infinite i already bought it 2 weeks earlier sorry bro ill pick up a copy tonight then great before you buy pretty much nailed all the reasons that ive been enjoying the game good mindless fun how is this any different then previous shooters stop reinventing the wheel id rather their budget went to dlc for crysis instead of a generic shooter with more pink colors exodus is gunna be goty but this game will be a close contender why is the person in the thumbnail wearing futuristic airpods was it just me or was the manikin at the beginning wearing a tv on their head didnt mercenaries use the playground of destruction tagline yo the thumbnail damn near gave me a heart attack making me think they turned heihachi into some tumblrista fallout 4 and metro exodus spoiled me rage 2 looks kinda boring no sniper rifle no sneaky play no building your own base weapons no romance options etc mehh im gonna pass on this one i hope you guys hit your 5m subs today you guys are turning into my new gametrailers rip keep up the good work still hoping to see me name on the console giveaway rather play borderlands or destiny if you think your getting something like borderlands here youre gonna be disappointed sure there are a few similarities but you can say that for just about any game in this genre gameplay looks fun and solid but do the crushers still have cleft lips if so 1010 i like my mutants to look like mutants bless you jakey boy so much depressing disappointment going around about the gameidk why its not the next freaking god of war or anything like that but its not even trying to be i find it unfair to have this game shat on by people who arent in the mood to play what it offers like someone who only plays sp games be made to review an online one and call it trash im loving the game so far but like you said the systems early on feel overwhelming i literally thought the whole hatchling scene was from doom does this game have difficulty levels it looks very easy another fps ffs looks fun thanks was this gameplay filmed on normal also the trailers mention that you can drive anything you mention mechs can we drive mechs looks like apex offline im bored of fps anymore repetition in wvery game it seems anymore its all about the ultra violence baby sorry rage 2 i got a date with borderlands 3 fps crackdown 3 calling it now before you buy just download it now for free its been cracked fuck bethesda for tryin to be sneaky with denuvo jake did you start to do coke your voice is coked up looks like bethesdas version of farcry hard pass this game is amazing its making me forget to sleep its so fun and addicting driving can be boring but thats why i got a faster car and it does have microtransactions but they are purely cosmetic do not effect gameplay and as far as i know only the gold skins arent earnable in game after that the sanguine shotgun skin and the like can be earned at mbtv edited because super tired from playing rage 2 is john goodman voice acting again like in the first rage looks like a basic bitch graphics upgrade of mad max plainly put the game is fun it has its flaws but lord this game is just fun if you looks at reviews they will point out the cons in the game but the major pro is the the game is fun congrats on 5 mil you guys a co op option wouldve made this way better we did not get a double uplod for before you buy we failed men its free for pc playerstnx codex ill probably wait til its on sale but does look funjust not 60 fun to me its too late ive already bought it but still gonna watch this video i know this game is really more of a combination of mad max and borderlands but honestly there are so many parts to rage 2 that i feel are more like what mass effect andromeda should have been the driving the environment and especially the tightashell shooting mechanics and special powers are all exactly what mea should have had well done rage 2 worst thumbnail yet this is fallout 4 fixed imagine if bethesda had used the id engine for fallout 76 playing this game on hard difficulty is a blast i dont understand why everyone shits on the first rage it was fun as hell someone plz make a rick and morty mod for rage 2 bruh congrats on 5m subs ahead of time this game really is nothing like the first except for the concept the driving is very mediocre but then agin its a shooter game even though i was a big fan of 1 and 2 is very different i still find my self playing 2 for hours on end this game just looks like a roid raged borderlands i am normally not into singleplayer fps titles although i liked the doom remake quite a bit tbh but this one looks amazing this game looks like garbage i wont be bothering im loving this lots of content fantastic fluid combat and it perfoms excellent atleast on pc so nice with a game thats loaded with content and not broken on release i was happy to see a conclusion to the story and to see the references to the last game but i love the updated guns and powers the only thing i hate not having is the crossbow dan hagar john goodman gives you from the first game i preordered rage 2 at first i had the same feelings oh just another rage but as soon as i picked it up i was dragged in the combat definitely is what is keeping me playing driving mechanics arent bad and i enjoy the fact that i can go all over this massive map all in all great game fun to just let everything go and destroy enemies thaank you 3 added this game to my wish list look forward to getting it when i can i cant play this game now guess i will just go play some doom im glad you didnt have to play the first in order to jump in here the first game was very lacklustre for me personally it had the cool throwing glaive thing but other than that was like a lower grade borderlands oh cool farcry with super powers got the game last night it sucks i didnt care about or want a rage 2 its a good thing companies dont make games just for you then isnt it ps4 version has a 68 on metacritic rn forgot this game came out i loved rage 1 who could forget the wingstick im very excited i loved doom i love mad max and i love cyberpunk it would be disingenuous if i didnt buy this game those last 10 seconds summarize the whole video that was sick the audio though the first rage came out in 2011 it was good for its time dont get me wrong it could of been better but it was okay for its time rage 2 looks way bigger better more action more guns vehicles more stuff to do more world to explore and do what you want rage 2 has way better visuals and graphics all in all the game looks really fun to play and i cant wait to play it i bought rage 2 no regrets im having a blast the only thing that annoys me about this game is when your car talks to you every time you get in or out does it have real time ray tracing i nearly fell victim to steam reviews if you like mad max quake doom searching any nook and crany borderlands i recommend it im actually impressed how well this game is optimised not really any microtransactions he says hahahahaha you might want to change that statement you dont want people to think you are being dishonest now do you im going to give this one a try ive been sick of fpss for a while but this seems up my alley i loved doom i never care about the stories in games i just like to beat them usually the talking is pointless anyway rage 1 sucked the story was short and there wherent that many guns aldo i do like the walk8ng turrets they are cute until you upgrade them before you buy its a bethesda and avalanche studio both have shitty game i rather wait for all dlc with huge price drop complete edition can you make your review video shorter the game is good but oh my god is the fovaimingjankiness a problem at the start its absolutely disgusting takes a lot of menu work to get the game to play like a normal shooter without horrible aim ramp and awful sickening motion blur but is there loot hahaha before you crack ive found that if you go up to the pink boxes instead of pressing the button to open it ive been just meleeing it and opens it just as fast and keeps you in the action no mention of the epic game exclusive mention easily one of the best games to release this year wow the amount of things they took from borderlands is crazy 60 for a 12 hour campaign and a bunch of shallow openworld elements before you buy trigger warning some enemies may have extreme depictions of cleft lip 210 so the original rage had a coop campaign and now its strictly single playerlooks like a bulletstorm rip off as wellno thank youwhen the hell can we get some original games instead of these reskins of other games i didnt care about this game but after this video i think im down no reason this game cant be multiplayer not interested no mini games or card games honestly constant violence gets really old for me is it just me or does the gameplay massively remind me of bulletstorm basically the game is just like the concert on e3 so its far cry but its actually mad max and doom you cant use the dlc content you bought if you dont create a bethesda account they announced this 24 hrs before release played 2 hours of it but i dont think its worth the price i paid i got my refund will buy again if its a bit cheaper finally a game that doesnt force me to pay for microtransactions and day 1 dlcs to enjoy it want to play this game but will wait for a sale on the xbox store i really thought you guys were gonna rip this game to shreds you made trending yo he punched a foe and their armor flew off lmao i have glitch videos of rage 2 to send you please make a link for me to send them its a blast new turok ftw its a shooter not an open world not my kinda game but looks very fun might give it a try sooooooo dont buy it why are you whispering you need to yell this game looks like its going to be stupid fun during the gameplay i saw a little bit of just cause in it little bit of borderlands plus this game gives the developers something to build on and improve for the better rage 1 was lots of fun but was stupid short like i literally beat it in 2 or 3 hours with no guide is this short too my question is did the alt ammo come back cause i loved the friggen grenade shotty and rebar nailgun gratz on the 5 mil subs well deserved and keep up the good work yo how do you call your car like in mad max you could call your hunchback to bring the car to you if you wandered away from it wow 5 million that is awesome so happy to see this channel grow from what it was so bethesda made a far cry no moneycant buy lol you can tell they put a lot of work in making this the sad part is its single player which means eventually you will get bored playing by yourself they should have at least added a coop feature i really enjoyed gameranx review its not as superficial as ign and not indepth as acg i really love karak review but sometimes its too long that i just stopped watching halfway the duration just nice keep up the good work gameranx i fucking love thsi game it has so much funny content id recommend it bigtime looks great but im still gonna wait until it goes on sale can you see your own feet those ai really looks dumb they either move around doing nothing wait for player to shoot them or they shoot with very bad accuracy the most fun game of 2019 the fact that 90 of the world is empty and just about getting from a to b to the actual action ruins it for me the areas with enemies should at least be bigger and with a bit more hostile density it just feels empty even though the core gameplay is good the should i play the first game question is dumb imo you can play any sequel first at any time you just wont get the references that the game might make if you really want to understand the references then play the first one this applies to all games lol what happened to your voice been having a blast with this game the gameplay is on point i literally dont care about anything else give me more things to shoot hmmm i like the look of it but i think ill buy it on sale used but how many genders are there rage 2 should be the opposite of boycotted it should be mass bought just to let other companies know that this is how you make a game no microtransactions incredible gameplay and constant progression he says its a lot of fun but watching all the gameplay just makes it look generic and boring as hell huge rage fan been playing 1 since it came out i beat the first one for the millionth time a few weeks ago and ive been super excited for this one i cant wait thanks for spolers i love snipers tho is there online coop male or female character is that really jakey boy commenting again because ive just played it for a few hours i get what jake says in this vid the dialogue is mildly entertaining but just feels off like they go for borderlands humour but still try to be serious sometimes and the dialogue really feels like the story is in the way of the gameplay the gameplay is very doom and i agree with jakes take on it the movement feels a little stiffer than some of the more fluid fps but the variety of enemies gadgets guns abilities and super satisfying explosions totally make up for it so far its 25 story but 455 gameplay i recommend it on hard mode especially if you like toothandnail combat that gets your heart racing when up against craftier and dangerous enemies looks like a game with the boring mindless shooting of doom and the empty uninspired worlds of avalanche games most easy 5 or 6 10 ive ever seen ive honestly had several moments already were i literally stopped and thought to myself holy shit that was fun im 30 i have not said that to myself often past the age of 10 also one issue ive been encountering a lot of sound bugs playing on pc sometimes voices cut out or sounds repeat on a loop ive had to close the game a couple times due to annoyance but it fixes itself on reboot at least the internet on my phone works where is falcon i love rage 2 so far great game single player is whats keeping me from buying it even though its really fun this game looks so cool i wish they make a battle royale where u can drive like this and have ultimate like pushing away with forcejust some superpower abilities too late alright got it and its awesome gunplay is one of the best ive ever had in a game i feel like people who play games below max difficulty are sociopaths that only want to feel powerful while they murder hoards of helpless enemies man you stuck at fps games it seems ill wait for a sale looks pretty good though tape the trigger down and walk looks great but im not an singleplayer player bought it maxed out at 1440p it looks like trash tbh was surprised when a toted large open world game was only 35gb found out why it looks like it came from 2010 driving basically has no physics like an early just cause game very arcadey with virtually no story combat is ridiculously easy and guns are laser accurate stopped aiming down sights all together because it seems unnecessary no discovery the very few guns are all listed in your invent just greyed out voice acting quite bad and animations completely out of sync when there are animations at all full price do not buy if its say 25 aussie or 1520 american pick it up for a time waster we want jack back gameranx this host sucks its fallout with cars one big thing i noticed about this game they really like pink just subscribed surprised i wasnt already that should get you a bit closer to 5 mil great game but the driving is garbage just like it was in mad max the saving grace like it was in mad max is the ground combat i cant wait to see what crazy and new weapons there are i play on hard and use super wingstick and super overdrive cheats a raging good time i feel like nicholas cage on 10 monsters im only about 3hrs in so far but im loving it i got a little bored of mad max once the map really opened up and got flooded with icons but im way more into the combat in this so hoping that carries me through it the main characters look like ass too but luckily its mainly first person lol i will never buy another bethesda game again but kudos on the review love watching your videos is it just me or the video is on 10 for most of the time a plague tale innocence or this so this is just a boys will be boys game go around and shoot your way through everything boring i dont want to be rude but your review sounds so copy and paste from gamingbolt its like you seen hes review and just swap out some words here and there it resemble a lot borderlands 2 and 3 why it has a very low metacritic rating ghost recon wildland wannabe lol i saw they had micro transactions on angry joe twitch stream ill wait til the price drop to 20 bucks lol from everything ive seen rage 2 seems to be both trying too hard to be wacky in a setting and world tone that doesnt really fit that and also doesnt have a ton of stuff to do outside of the main story seems like it could be fun for a bit but get old quick probably not something id buy for full price because id be afraid of getting bored before i finish it that said seems like if i wanted to play a better version of rage 2 but without the open world filler stuff that sounds like it just gets in the way i should just play doom 2016 its pretty much a single player borderlands looks cool tho rage 2 is a game you play when you want just mindless and satisfying fun looks a bit like borderlands cool vehicles smooth shooting and game play sliding and mobility borderlands 3and more similaritys what do you guys think first game in a very long time to make me forget i had other things to do solid and honest fun sounds like jake is getting sicker and sicker between videos take a break and heal up dude this sounds like a good alternative to borderlands 3 a billion weapons is about 999999980 too many for me buying it when its on sale smacked out by the bl3 announce in some ways why you trying to sound like falcon alright this a honest guestion never got a pc before built one before fucked up built on it sent it all back bought new parts and computer wil start but just keep saying cant download windows and restarting over and over again even if windows is not plugged in should i get a professional or send everything back for the 2nd time and get a prebuild run a before you buy for outward developers forgot that blood should stain the walls and ground ex enemy standing in front of wall gets lit up with bullets but the wall behind had no blood splash at all looks generic as hell without blood stains its 2019 and you cant do blood dynamics correct hardpass ps doom had it it looks cool but my only problem is the environment or setting i dont like post apocalypse stuff but i guess its a good game but just not for me why is there no coop mode would make the game even better i really cant see what would anyone find appealing in this game its was an instant refund what a trash game is it really 2019 game looks more like 2010ish game refurbished you know what else is great about this game a fov slider on console makes it feels 10x as fast really enjoyed this review jake sometimes you just want to sit back zone out and mindlessly blast enemies without having to be all competitive like you do in your online shooters fortnitepubgapex this is a game id love to get my hands on given your review rage 2 a great game that came out of nowhere with no anticipation and hype just a great game while other games that is being hyped for years to come out as lame glitchy bad game is it just me or does jake suck at first person shooters 5 million subscribers i like doom so i might like this but i will wait for a sale im just gonna wait for the discount 122 that means i have to play rage 1 before rage 2 ok got it lets get rid of jake and bring in someone sexy its a beautifully made game it nails what it is had a pre order in gamestop im broke ffs gotta wait 5 more days i read that you can finish main story and some side quests within 1015 hours only and if you do everything then it is max 30 hours too short i guess they did that because of dlcs i am really not into buying a game that you can finish so fast mmm he says he doesnt remember nothing from rage 1 and then he brings constantly things from rage 1 in comparison with 2 is it just me or did someone else got a rage 2 trailer too i got a rage 2 ad before this what are you talking about on steam you can buy rage coins so there are ingame transactions the lighting effects look amazingguess will look even better on pc do yourselves a favor go buy this game it is soooo good pretty words you say but the gameplay i see leaves me with the impression of an acopaliptic desert with future features which dosent make any sense as a theme whats more the map seems like most of the time you spend playing is travelling and rooms of combat are just espacious squares with some platforms randomly made without any propouse dont know about you or the community but this game is unfinished anyone having troubles with the deadzones on controllers for pc i always love gameranx reviews and was really curious about this one because it seemed like a love or hate kinda game but the gameplay seems strong and sometimes that is what makes a game good plus the devs seem like they genuinely care about the game as a game not as a medium for shoving microtransactions loot boxes and other crap down our throat so i appreciate this sequel and its a good step in the right direction for gaming that said i am not big on shooter games so i will definitely wait for it to go on sale a plague tale seems quite interesting though that has mixed reviews too with the opposite being the case mediocre gameplay and story but impressive graphics the first rage always stuck with me the hours upon hours that me an my cousin put into it are still happy memories i think about often one day we put it down and just stopped playing thats why im hesitating with rage 2 im afraid itll fade fast and i wont pick it back up again this is not your typical id studio or even avalanche game first of all the story is a cringefest of epic proportions during the start of the game theres a theme of identity politics on overboard with ugly and comical characters your protagonist is also a nonchalant detached character whom you will feel no attachment to that acts like a 12 year old along with a bizarre pink theme to the whole game ladders chest lids gps ui etc are all pink for some reason why the pink it feels like the game is maybe content catered to a fringe group of people on a specific side of the political spectrum even doom 2016 had a better story and thats saying a lot onto that this game has plenty of bugs and some technical issues that for a game codeveloped by id studios is very unexpected however not unusual for avalanche studios the pc controls can at times feel very unintuitive and ultrawide resolution only works for actual gameplay as the cutscenes and menus will not display a lol jake u sound so sick ill think about buying this one after they finish the first one metacritic sitting in yellow 68 critic and red 47 user i dont understand why almost every youtuber review i see its a must buy is it just me or does the player character move a bit to slow especially considering this is like a doomdishonored kind of fast paced combat system im not even playing it but i can tell a mile off that your movement is way to sluggish how close is the driving compared to mass effect it is enjoyable so you saying normal mode easy but your aim man potato lost me at review copythat means you have to say nice things sorry ill go to laymen for a review its rubbish tldr shooting good shooting good glad it exists shooting good i see that the mixom corporation managed to survive demonic invasion you should release these before the game comes out comes with denuvo for a single player game this will leave me very hesitant even ifwhen it goes on sell there is no excuse for this in a single player game started the game with nightmare and died about 6 times on to the first mutant pack after you get the suit feels good mon who would design a weapon system to have bright glowing lights on its side youd be an easy target at night and its not very camo for any situation the only review channel i trust i hate hip fire ah nuts the super attractive daughter of hagar grew older started yesterday only thing i dont like there is no option switch to 4k 30 fps on my 4k tv game looks shitty xbox one x i dont wanna 1080p 60 fps ur an awesome reviewer 200k views on this video makes me think u r under rated or overlooked simply because ur mainstream keep up the fantastic work im getting this game btw it looked badass i wondered if it played like it looks like it plays and u have convinced me even your comments with the driving made sense according to what i saw in an earlier trailer seems like the game mad max wanted to be much better than those multiplayer fps games one word bethesda only excuse not to buy this game id never even heard of rage but i loved doom as well as all the borderlands games so this caught my attention early reviews were enough for me to order it just before release on xbox one x not had long to play it so far but happy with what ive seen so far on the whole already beat the campaign this is one of the most satisfying dumb fun shooters ive ever played and i found an enemy character model with a penis tattoo on his chest game of the year who actually asked for a rage 2 i thought the first one was so obscure and little known that people wouldnt even know what it is let alone a sequel to it is there any side mission things heard there wasnt i feel exactly the same about this game a lot of fun with shooting and killing jake is in la for call of duty mw4 im calling it can you remove hitmarkers ill buy it when i finally catch up burn the world and boils the ocean good game but the graphics downgrade is pretty significant dude i remember when gameranx was at 12 mil jeez good job growing the channel guys ily all and you make fantastic content so its not a bethesda game your stream has korean subtitles why fix this pls rage 1 is a decent game it reminded me a lot of borderlands that ar looks like the ar from bulletstorm ill probably get it when its on sale the only reason hell eat his words is cause he got the game for freehe never has to put out money out of his pocket like everyone else cause gaming companies like kissing asses like his wasnt the original rage super serious dark and not as crazymad max as this one but but butits too late i preordered it and it arrives today im about to play this but i thought id poop and watch this first its a pretty great game ive played it for 5 hours so far the story is nothing exceptional but i didnt buy it for that the gameplay is super fun driving has been improved upon a lot since the first game its kinda like if mad max had the gameplay of doom though i find the weapons here a bit more satisfying than in doom but thats probably because the ragdolls are way better the abilities are especially fun they are not locked behind anything as well you can get them from the getgo which is appreciated did we play the same game woah jake your voice is really suffering hope you are well or get well again soon you sound very excited that will pass give it a week and the shine will fade im interested in rage 2 but dont consider it a must buy maybe add it to my black friday list one month later 2999 at argos now we are talking carnival of chaos commence now the reveal of just cause 17 where rico gets super powers and a ton of guns looks fun but the ai seem stupid which would make the skills annoying and unsatisfying ill wait for borderlands 3 057 to 102 that is exactly what i want the game does have microtransaction via a store that sell cosmetic items im the kind of guy to bring a minigun to a stealth mission if i was a game id be rage 2 cant wait to pick it up tomorrow light up afew joints and go to town baby i love big ass guns just a fyi if you want to do cover shooter in this game it will hurt you if you do the mobs will just nade you to oblivion think warframe as a fpser been waiting for this game for years so glad that it looks so fun and gore cant wait to throw the wingblade again are people getting paid to say its good it is possible to die in the game battlefieldoom awesome game amazing shooting and funny over the top characters very good game controls weird on console straight what ruins rage and rage 2 for me is that i want it to be closer to borderlands so bad and i get disappointed by the lack of different gunsloot its a good game just glad i only paid 45 for it when a single copy cost like 100 i did not like rage 1 but hopefully this one is better wow almost 5mil subs impressive as hell this looks like a lot of fun adding it to my list d absolutely loving this game so far the combat feels so damn good and fluid what happened to your microphone not a fan jake hit puberty should i buy this or mordhau great game so amazing and great video like always guys been waiting for a game like this for so long looks like rage 2 is what the first rage had the potential to be this game look like good those hos just love shoot something and lots nice l thing l buy it if its found steam but hell if there found some annoing microtrasns action its fast refund but l trus this game and combany for now new to the game stock up on ammo as much as possible even if you think you wont need it always remember ammo ammo ammo ammo sacrilege rage was an amazing game the first xbox game i bought and i love it still its good but i ran into a glitch where the ark info guy doesnt respond to me hes located in marshals bar rage 2 after you buy title is fixed falcon is sleeping with his children next to jake confirmed a video without jake baldino acting like a tard thank you new mic is weird dude noticed it last vid i want to get it but i have give it 23 months till they fix all the bugs first love it so much fun best fps fun i have played for ages took me a bit to realise but i found it was worth visiting the 3 main allies asap so to unlock their projects as the perks for those help a great deal and ffs hunting for those supply crates was annoying til i saw somewhere there is a proximity perk lol i spent too much time hunting for those great review too im not sure that most reviewers played the whole thing or like me played it wrong like you said it knows what it is i dont trust anyone who got a review copy of the game i played rage 1 and jake described it spot on it just didnt really carry me throughout the game and eventually i stopped playing it altogether but this after watching streams of itoh my god do did the motion blur bother your experience so far im 45 hours in on xbox one this game is 1010 the industry needed this huge enough open world to explore and so much to learn and level and do so satisfied with this game something that doesnt happen these days anymore lol i picked up a plague tale instead honestly i was sceptical about it but then the entire day went by and i was still playing it ill get to rage eventually will they fix the ps2 graphics and absolut shit image filter the gameplay is insanely fun but its just so sad that on the base consoles it actually looks worse than the first rage in many aspects i just think that the game wouldve looked and ran better on all platforms had it been done on the id tech engine rather than the apex engine my only complaint is driving is a bit sluggish ive gone to buy outward into the unknown congrats on the almost 5mill guys d all these video games just look the same to me anymore its like doom with guns if you swear less balls to the wall and saying shit youll get a lot more views does physics play a big part in the game i keep seeing people being blown away with the shotgun and taking damage but then hitting a wall and dying is firing enemies into walls or objects a viable tactic doom gunplay bulletstorm combat mad max world borderlands scenarios interesting i always sort of expected it would be kind of shitty but now i will actually consider playing it im kind of bored with this game already and ive not even played it yet i dont like the op abilities just a shooter would have been better for me i was waiting for this game for so long and now that it dropped its saying its not available in my country this game is bethetic first off rage the first one you have three discs for each level you beat one level get the other disc beat that level go to the other disc not that fun trying to back a disc pls no other discs in rage 2 playing this game with headphones is insane omg i never though i would find a reviewer that gets it you hit the nail right on the head with this one sir i mean wtf were they expecting its id and avalanch here those two devs are known for one thing and one thing only idgamplay avalanch creativity these devs have never been story driven developers long story short a bit of commonsense would tell you what kinda game this will be some of the reactions to this game blow my mind i want to make you some hot lemon tea jake get well soon also i trust this review more than i trust igns i might just buy this is jake sick does it not look like a premium crossout its nothing like the trailer where are those flashy multicoloured explosions this is disgusting lol every thumbnail i see for this game looks like a fuckin downsyndrome version of fagnite some explode and some are more unpredictable im worried to ask whats more unpredictable than a villain who might just explode pc gamers are still crying over denuvo and graphics though sigh i might as well ditch pc community at this point on steam people think this looks like far cry i guess all first person shooters are far cry copies now rolls eyes edit well to be fair it is like doom and far cry after playing for awhile which is awesome but still shouldnt cry over denuvo and graphics 9 guns in an open world fps microtransactions no thanks anyone know if it runs better on xbox one x or ps4 pro buy rage 2 max out your sensitivity drink 4 beers let the headachemotion sickness kick in im soooo excited to get this one runs like shit horrible upgrade system boring weapons horrible driving mechanics and the story is just a far cry clone of having to clear out certain places fuck bethesda for making this shit stain series i bought the regular edition might exchange it for the deluxe ign gave this game an 80 they always remind me why people myself included hate them forgot to reference marcus from borderlands is in the game sale buy to me i just can not pay 50 to 60 for such a one note game no matter how fun the note is will be a game i dive into over the thanksgiving xmas season i remember rage 1 being a bit slower paced more tactical coverheavy kind of shooter this looks like a bullethell sprayandpray kind of gore fest shooter kinda disappointing even though it seems fun seems like the slower paced adventure shooters are all kind of dying out in this day and age in favor of fast paced action nonsense there is two problems with this game micro transactions and the use of anticheat dram software for a single player game you also are forced to make a bethesda account seriously not cool you also cant remove the spyware whoops thats more than one problem if you got a pc say good bye to your ssds due to excessive and pointless writes while the game runs mate this game looks fucking sick why does this guy sound like a friend whos trying to overhype a game cause he wants you to buy it so yall can play online together why when they review a game do they play on a console i want to see the best the game can offer not this cant really review a game on a console definitely the dark souls of rage games ai seemed crappy was it cuz footage was on normal it sounds like youre trying to talk quiet like when its past your bedtime and your mom is in the next room but you just have to do this video before you can rest wow idk man it looks pretty fucking fun gamespot gave it a 610 lol fucking hipsters its good enough bro the way you used mad max and open world doom made me want to buy it lol good strategy shoot first ask questions later thats not jake guys i like your review videos more then other peoples review videos sorry preordered 2 months ago cant wait to pick this up when i get paid next week looks really fun did someone tear out your larynx i waited for this video to buy might get it on pc after work i must be the only one that loved rage 1 im enjoying the gameplay but the story in rage 2 is below average rage 1 made me care more for the world and environment seeing dan hagars daughter made me smile because i remember her teaching you how to use a wingstick in the 1st when she was 19 watching this even though i already bought the game lmao i was interested in this game but that enemy ai just looks really really stupid in my opinion these kind of games dont go well with an open world if this game was a linear fps then i think they would have concentrated on the story which would have made the game better thank you for talking softly its pretty late god bless not a single negative point only neutral such as oh well the game doesnt really reference the predecessor and then only catchphrases and wow this and that is great bought review go fuck yourself im waiting on mack to say if its worth a buy bought comment btw i honestly just cant bring myself to care about the story the first halfhour feels rushed and the dialogue is almost bad the characters are not interesting and the upgrade perks mostly just give stuff that i couldnt care less about the driving is also extremely lackluster but the combat is amazing im going to finish the game regardless because i preordered the deluxe edition so im going to get my moneys worth im only about six hours in so heres hoping it gets better kinda reminds me of borderlands with normal graphics gotta stop making jake do these first thing in the morning i love you guys but i think these videos would be a lot better if you showed the things you were talking about while you were talking about them like that needler thing for example if you arent playing rage 2 or days gone rn wtf are you even doing with your life fallout 4 doom aside from them using denuvo and linking all of the preorder and deluxe edition content to a bethesda account this was a list topper until like a day before launch when they started to admit just how anticonsumer they were planning to be with the game good job on attaining such a large audience im watching this 5 hours after you releasing the video and over 1000 comments already so this is like a love child of doom 2016 just cause 4 borderlands and call of duty count me in been waiting for this video definitely gonna pick this one up im one of the few who really liked rage 1 basically borderlands which is not a bad thing at all definitely getting this they should of added civilians they cant add all be bad guys at all times steam shows the publisher as bethesda so i think ill pass not touching that hes using the dont wake up mom voice jk homie you guys are the man finally a great honest review on the game im about 5 hours in and i agree with pretty much everything youve said kinda curious why the metacritic is relatively low so far im having an amazing time and i cant say enough about the shootingpowers and upgrades preordered the delux waited till midnight and have been playing since great game anyone have room setup or game rig advice for me comment my face off if you must but recently i havent been able to just sit down and enjoy a big game like i used to lmao imagine spending all that time creating awesome gore only to cover it up with massive hit markers from what ive seen so far this is almost a straight up mad max reskin with doom gunplay but thats not bad i loved that game100 completed twice this looks boring id rather play doom remake again it is just stupid chaotic fun if you want a story look elsewhere if you want to shred through muties with powerful weapons and powers pick it up now honestly the gameplay reminds me of doom and i loveddd doom if you want the real experience disable hud and crosshair after you can handle the gameplay its way way cooler and fun looks awesome cant wait to pira i mean legally pay for this seriously though good honest review great job guys game is so much better than i was expecting i was hyped for it and than i kept rewatching the trailers and saw how much everything looked like youre always using the same guns and powers and thought it was gonna suck like if done wrong thatll get boring real fast but the gunplay is extremely satisfying i was worried about the little amount of gun variety but with all the systems at play when it comes to upgrading everything i can see why theres not a bunch of different guns there would be no point anyway all guns in most games feel the same so im digging what they did here they managed to make the small variety of guns feel varied game is batshit crazy 1010 on the fun scale would recommend definitely worth a buy if you love mindless fun thank yall i was waiting for this vid this is absolutely a buy for me although i wouldve really liked to have seen more cleft palates in the game i bought this on pc and have a duel monitor setup and the game was glitching putting the game up on both screens and would only react on my off hand screen this made the game pretty unplayable for me so i refunded it but otherwise than that i would have kept it because the gameplay was fun ill just buy it on a sale later when they patch that issue i havent even got to play it yet because it released with a 136 gb update i dont know while it looks like doom it gives me that far cryish vibe so many open world games give these days and that throws me off because i must have like 4 or 5 games like that at this point this game is generic af not sure why this dude is so excited about it does anyone know how this game runs on a base ps4 just another open worls post ap game i really want to play this but no time with work uni and becoming a father holy fuckballs this game is fun doommad max washed down with mescaline i went into the game as blind as possible been playing for about eight hours really enjoying exploring combat is fun as hellbuy this game damn sniping is my favorite part of shooters before you buy you should know its been cracked when you unlock the hoverbike you can zip through the map beautiful bad ass game just gottt my collectors with talking head monster he s my bitch now lol i think the games graphics looks good and blurry this game is boring bcz all i can see is that this game only has killing mechanics and nothing more wait for the dlc john goodman was a voice in the first game respect i already got the game i just wanted you guys opinions and ill say i agree 100 fun gameplay but the graphics are blurry and textures low res even on highest settings with auto resolution scaling off it manages to still be enjoyable but looks like a 2014 release you mean i cant play as a gender queer non binary star boy cluster fuck no buy is it cracked i started on hard mode but switch back to normal yeah normal kinda easy but hard mode hits too hard n dying alot isnt really fun in these types of games the point is to feel op im enjoying this game a lot btw it doesnt launch on steam i preordered it and payed 80 bucks and i cant even play it wtf sooo should i buy it or wait for the outer worlds weird question why are the subtitles set to korean auto translating it to english is just gibberish it might be a yt problem though cash money to me the problem with rage 1 to me was repeating the same levels with different enemy placement they need to do a rage 2 glitch video ive got a good one u can still get up close n personal with snipers wtf lame idk why but i get a lot of cyberpunk 2077 vibes from this games super smooth gameplay the shotgun feels fucking great preordered still watching this d rage was boring and never took advantage of everything it had open world was boring story never went anywhere graphics were only nice when the camera was static and we never got to explore the abandoned areas so in rage 2 instead of fixing those issues it just made killing more fun that may seem fun now give it 6 months why do you review games on consoles when a superior version is on pc you are playing on a mix of pc and xbox why not just stick to one platform and if you are playing on pc why not use a mkb especially for a fps game like this going to get this just so i can respact wahmen so hard they explode i personally didnt have fun with it moving around feels like a 2009 game could just be a bad port to pc seems like a good game but im a little sad they changed so much from rage 1 the original had some very unique enemy ai and combat in general very realistic at moments and i think the neon apocalypse is a little played out tbh imo the story is terrible and the ui is really ugly to me it looks like it isnt a 2019 game i also think the driving feels really stiff and its not any fun the only good part of this game is the gunplay plus ive heard the game will probably only last about 15 hours before it runs out of content a little underwhelming for a 60 open world game what up gameranx cant wait for the glitches video why dont they ever make driving fun like justcause if its supposed to be a careless apocalyptic crazy game why not i have watched a couple reviews of this game and this one is by far the best the enthusiasm and love of fps shines through i know reviews are really just an opinion but all the focus in the other videos was about the frame rate and graphics and didnt nail the fun factor thats what i want in a game fun everything else is second i rented it this morning and will start playing tonight but i want to thank you for a great positive review on this keep up the amazing work yall do jake you sound sick i hope you get better jake needs to lay off the cigarettes they still managed to keep the iconic bomeerang blade its a buy a for me hearing it feels like modern doom is a red flag to me couldnt enjoy the gameplay its just to easy to defeat enemies so it feels like nothing is at stake dont think your hitting 5m today unless people start pouring in but your almost there this game looks good if we were in 2012 too many repetitive missions i remember playing rage 1 i thought it was a good game til i played borderlands 2 lol looks like a game ill buy during the summer steam sale and then never actually play it but can you die in this game rage was so terrible that rage 2 deserves to fail as well no goodness will make up for the trash bag that was rage play this on nightmare trust me 110 not enough rage its a buy is it good on low ram computers hey jake wassup with your voice could you guys shout out to me when you guys release new before you buys this will help me with my channel and what games i want to play on it game looks like someone played too much borderlands choose your gender just like real life right i unsubbed just so i could sub again i didnt know about the chest trackers but when i did it was so helpful because those chests can be so hard to find loving the gun play no micro transactions yet already a jewel in a market full of crap i wish there was character customization i would love to buy this game just cant right now hears massive damage instantly thinks of historically accurate giant japanese crab monsters i have a gtx 760 i know this is a stupid question but can my gpu run this game sooo mad max x doom with a bad story too late already bought it i think hard difficulty would be perfect for me hope everyone has a good nightday and has fun playing this game if they have it its kinda like a first person devil may cry i heard it sucked this games is sooooo good been playing all day wow i thought this was doom eternal footage it looks fun it sounds like the mic youre using has changed the out of car cockpit view makes it look cheap mad max doom 3 rage 2 more like 1 3 2 so its bad dont buy it i refunded just before 3 hours and best decision i could haave made the open world seems just so empty with things like fuel stations i didint relise i was playing a ubisoft game fuck yes this game looks like exactly what i want buuuut i feel really bad that i know ill drop it as soon as doom eternal comes out ya feel do i need to play the first rage to play this one oh yeah this game is definitely fun i just wish it looked a lil better on the base consoles sounds like a purchase to me will this play ok on an s if you buy this buy it on pc if your a console gamer like me then skip this game id think the more weapons the merrier right i mean praising the game for a small selection of weapons really jake says i dont need no nanotraits just give me guns and what a pc player using a controller for a fps blasphemy im glad this franchise redeem it self i was a fan of the first rage and actually wanted a sequel ps shut ur mouth jake some of us did want a sequel lol really didnt do the first rage game much justice how would have answered the question do you need to have played rage 1 to get rage 2 no but you get to play rage 1 for the first time gameplay looks super boring hey jake you feeling okay brother also i find this game very rewarding when it comes to cash and feltrite or however you spell im loving this game just want more guns but am not complaining at all it is beautiful aim down your sights weirdo been binging days gone then hopped on rage 2 n gotta say the smooth framerate threw me thefuckoff i remember awaiting the original rage after all of the early touting for over a yeah and after it finally came out even though it was obviously unfinished i still loved the gameplay and atmosphere hopefully this iteration will round it out the way it was supposed to have been for the original i like rage 2 i just wish the pc version ran better i tried running it at 4k and the game wouldnt even launch after that after i fixed that and left it at 1080 being that there is no 1440 i still drooped down to 17 fps in menus of all places computer rtx 2080 i7 8700k 16gb ram these videos are more like before u play the cracked version for me good game just price is a bit high here in aus 220 where have i heard this beforeoh yeah borderlands 2 also this game has no loading screens once your in the open world which is very impressive that they pulled that off i take this game for 9 bucks in 2 month i forgot this game even exists gameranx videos in 60 fps i say yes jake souning sick af i now want to play this game thanks to this review thanks for pointing it out gameranx i think that id be board too much like mad max gonna wait for borderlands but i always love the content this team puts out this game looks like open world shadow warrior 2 looks like cod advanced warfare mechanics reminds me a lot of destiny you sure have positive comment on this but from what i saw in live stream i was kinda interested in this game when i first saw it but i think ill pass on this one tbh thanks ill await a sale i will say its not a bad video but the moment i did not care for or even want a rage 2 was said i understood you had done no research and was clueless about how rushed and unfinished the development of the first rage game was this game literally comes from the unexpected success of the first rage game made possible by the passion the developers at id had for it and the first thing said is this i never even played the first rage game and even i have been excited for this game im just a guy with an interest in games this is your job how am i supposed to have confidence in you knowing what you are talking about also want to know how i feel feel like you are just trying to please people and that this video hardly did anything that the official trailer for the game did not do already this video is to show pros and cons eh where are the cons then do you mention any at all you said you did not like the driving not sure but i think that was all to anyone know how it runs on a plain old ps4 needs motorcycles can i say that the shooting kinda reminds me of bulletstorm in an odd way remember bulletstorm you guys need a patreon account imo its kinds look like far cry mixes doom bulletstorm very epic second colourful beautiful postapocalyptic world ever etc so they have the awesomeness of doom and skills like borderlands im sold i loved the first rage i guess mostly because it wasnt hyped i always enjoy kinda hidden games because i dont get oversaturated with them every where i turn my head this looks the same but even better yall are so close to the 5 mil mark congrats as it is very well earned you put out honest fun and high quality content kinda sad i may never be able to see the face behind falcons voice but i will settle for more of his videos the vehicle controls are trash trash trash one thing im glad they changed is the headbob that shit in rage 1 made me so sick and never made an option to disable it we need games like this once every while good ol shoot em up style games like wolfenstein rage 2 doom etc there is not much saturation of games like this so its good they come up once every so often love watching before you buy after i actually bought the game no snipper rifle thats bullshit i cant star the game in steam i really liked the first one and this one delivers ten fold its a pass for me i actually love this game so far all your thoughts are the same as mine he is lieing the shooting in this game is horrible these guies are paid to lie there are microtransactions in the game just look at the store menu ingame you buy rage coins with real money to buy skins etc 515 jake literally smashed her im on pc will i have a better experience using keyboard or plugging a controller so rage is basically just cause but in first person and more enemies cant wait for yahtzee crosaws review d why is the audio trash i should have gotten rage 2 instead of days gone yuck i never expected to actually care about this game but after going through many different videos on it i think im finally going to just buy it yeah but is john goodman in this game its just doom wasteland disappointing fast paced from all the footage i have seen so far enemy ai isnt all that fast in reacting or always reacting u sound like kermit a lot more in this video im downloading it right now and it is taking forever damn it cant say no to simple mindless fun and single player im sold is the card game from rage still here lots of games can learn from modern dooms gameplay hopefully they can improve the story and open world in the next rage games im watchig multiple reviews of this game and this guy kinda sounds like hes getting money from the devs to say positive things hope im wrong ill play it when it goes on sale not an immediate play for me this game is a good buy its fun and engaging with beautiful environments but on og ps4 and xboxone the frame rate is locked at 30 and is very noticeable in a game like this especially after watching gameplay of it at 60fps this is my most anticipated game of the year this and borderlands 3 whats up with jakes voice new mic or sick only played it for about an hour or two so far but im pretty clueless as to why its getting such mixed reviews so far i really enjoyed the first rage but it was like a box of twinkies thats only half full this looks more like a full box of twinkies and a 2 liter of mr pibb i want it great review ive heard the base xbox version runs pretty poorly but all the gameplay i see is from the x something people should know about this game is that the pc port of this game is terribly optimized to the point that you are going to see heavy and game breaking performance issues on low to medium settings even with a stout rig on top of this the pc version is a very lazy console port with so much of the game mechanics and item interaction clearly designed with the lesser precision of a controller in mind there is aim bot while in vehicles and objects and environmental items use action timers to activate among other things people should also be aware that when people say the story is weak they mean the story is practically place holder assets like you see in the alpha build of a game no depth or substance as if something else was meant to go there that never did lastly i have never had a games visual effects make me motion sick before but the neon epileptic seizure the game has every time nano abilities get used were astoundingly effective at inducing headach the game looks sick this is my next skyrim doesnt matter how good the combat is if it lacks in every other area im not going to enjoy grinding away that was the case for me in rage 2 preordered the deluxe edition and played all night last night this is a great game that actually looks and runs perfect on day one thats extremely rare nowadaysprops to id and avalanche warning to people who plan on getting this on pc it has denuvo and in pure bethesda fashion they chose to withhold this information up until 24 hours within its release window if youre also planning to pre order andor get the deluxe edition you can only get the dlc that comes along with it after getting a bethesda account meanwhile the base game can be played purely on steam why is his voice different wish the base console version wasnt 30fps its maam if your playing this on pc and have a controller use the controller for cars etc do the enemies respawn new mic or are you sick just picked this up but watching the review while updating after i bought it woops so the game is doomguy on vacation its not multiplayer this game has no soul maybe this gun play will make it to the nxt fallout im loving it i just wish there are more guns some smgs and assault rifles snipers still a great game man im interested in it but i just cant bring myself to spend that much money on a game in mildly interested in ima wait for a sale it actually on steam you mean before i torrent it because fuck bethesda they lost my wallet with 76 i wish games still had coop the first rage was a c at best i certainly aint forking out 60 bucks for a follow up especially after all the crap bethesda has pulled lately rage one was dope an this ones better i red boxed it basicallyits ight its not like the trailers and gameplay vids made it look this aint jake im fucking loving this game its a ton of fun and honestly exactly what the devs said it would be and i greatly appreciate that it wasnt a let down at all in my books and for the devs to give us what they said they would is a huge relief considering how games like anthem were a big disappointment for many people its literally mad max mod lol ive never even heard of the first game i dont feel inclined to buy this one 033 my due popped out of nowhere i actually thought the enemy spread was one of the most underrated aspect of the original rage each clan of bad guy had a different fighting style except the mutants they are exactly what youd think they are started rage about 2 hours ago on ps4 buy this game if you want an open world fast paced superhero doom game normal mode has to be easy now or games journalists will cry about it pathetic why i feel like this game been downgraded rage 1 is on xbox gamepass btw i played maybe 5 hours of rage 1 yesterday and have been playing rage 2 since about 11ampdt i have rage quitted a few times already lol i want to play but its not available in my region for some reason in steam male and female gender where the hell is non binary or no response option there any multiplayer change your damn thumbnails you use the same one for every single video and it immediately makes it seem like a bad game how does the game preform on a regular ps4 based on the number of times you said its a good loop in this video im going to assume youre an easily amused person who enjoys doing the same thing over and over again boring nah im gonna hold off for a minute cyberpunk is all thats on my mind gonna go play world war z til it releases i think a reason that people just dont care about the story of the game or the characters is because it looks like bethesda is doing a lot of tell storytelling and not show storytelling like i remember kavatch and how devastated it was by the oblivion gates because i was shown and experienced it as opposed to having a cut scene tell me about it there is a roadmap for the game on their twitter so iam gonna wait until the dlc comes out to have a lot of gaming experience this game runs absolutely horrible for me even with everything turned to its lowest setting i still get stuttering with explosions random frame drops and my rig is more than capable of running the game on medium settings at the very least even the alt fire for the shotgun makes my frame rate tank for a second i really hope a patch comes out soon fixing these issues the game itself is enjoyable and ive been looking forward to this one for a long time which is why its so frustrating walker is voiced stopped there no thanks also the game looks like another shitty borderlands doom just cause mad max very nice this feels like borderlands a lot which i like since borderlands is one of my favorite games ever just bought it with knowledge of it so hope isnt it a bust for me only if fallout 4 and tesv se actually looked like this why tf wont bethesda dedicate this kind of technology to tes and fallout series personally i really enjoyed the first rage back on ps3 and i managed to buy rage 2 online for only 35 about 45 currys had a 10 off discount code so i made use of it look awesome cant wait to get it on pc i just dont like that they removed the co op option that was in the original games great but the inventory screens my only problem playing on ps4 and navigating between weapons vehicles etc is super laggy and slow and the best news of all its not an epic store exclusive yea im not spending 60 for story games i wait until its like 30 so its borderlands without the loot ahhhh a fun video game just like what there meant to be fun thank you jake for the great video as always man i wish we could have the gameplay and story from metro exodus but in a world like far cry new dawn or rage 2 im enjoying the game mostly for the graphics though youre wrong about the microtransactions they have in game currency available in the store it looks stiff just like the first one youre videos are shit rage 2 is a way better game than the last and i agree with everything jake says everyone that reads this should look into this game so why the mixed review on steam then ive been playing this all day and i gotta say its a ton of fun the shooting is 100 on point but i cant help feeling like the driving has taken 2 steps back from mad max its like this game is more id software and less avalanche also i was really hoping for a crazy good soundtrack and theres just nothing noteworthy there worth a buy nonetheless i fucking love this game its fun as hell and i cant stop playing jakes talking real breathy today i can feel the heat thru my screen sweet good video and info gonna buy it is jake sad or something his voice sounds different love these types of games i can just sit back and chill out with music or podcast in the background this is what i imagine borderlands would have looked like if they didnt stick with the cell shading animation seems better than i would have thought i am one of the few that actually loved the first game i enjoyed it and was disappointed with the abrupt ending now rage 2 is here i am excited for it is this out yet wow so the game nobody had any expectations for is one of the best games this year gg avalanche studioes got the game on day one and its really fun characters are decent and the protagonist has a surprising amount of banter this is not a rpg to keep me engrossed in the game world buy doom 2016 with superpowers yeah i can take a sick day for that too bad its an fps i was slightly interested and now im not wish i had preordered it to get one of the dlc campaigns however some audio bugs were reported gaming bolt i think said he had to restart the whole game to get rid of a gun sound repeating not sure if he meant reboot or total game restart plus i hoped rage 2 would be longer than reported campaign length i guess though if it had a meaty long campaign it would be more than 40 for the standard edition this looks so boring game dose look way to easy on normal tf up with his voice in the beginning lmao just a little pro tip lvl up the project for the doctor to the far west first that way you dont need to keep searching for ages for a cargo crate that you cant find didnt sound like you at first jake had me pissed of for a sec game is pretty fun however the driving mechanics during the races are completely broken i found myself having an unresponsive emergency brake going around corners and the steering just completely going off the rails and ramming my car into a wall also the first time i did the race for the celebrity mission i won the race but then it told me that i lost and i had to repeat the race even though i was in first place crossing the finish line not to mention the textured drop in and out which is very frustrating on a game on this generation i played rage 2 last year at e3 and was really pleasantly surprised by how good the gameplay was happy to see those thoughts echoed here i love this game so far i love it its a game that knows what it is the shooting is wonderful and the progression is deep the story is meh but the shooting mechanics are so much fun i dont even notice im on hard and its deaf not too hard at all exspecialy if you go out looking for upgrades 2k away from the 5 million subscribers you can play as male or female next sentence so he trigger intensifies the thumbnail guy looks disgusted by the title lol were loving this game i wanted it to be like the original but it doesnt seem anywhere near og rage the og rage had a sniper rifle ah well ill just wait for another dishonored all the nostalgia can we get a before you buy on the oculus quest this game looks highly repetitive and way too much of a grind pass but like lets all agree minecraft 2 is going to be ground breaking and will destroy this game i have a jar full of toonies 2cdn saved up for games considering rage 2 over rdr2 i actually refunded the game after an hour couldnt stand another glorified shooting gallery with no story and a usless open world at full price ill wait till a sale before i pick it up again but thats just me is jake trying to copy thors voice its skyrim with guns wait the beginning of the game is awful you have to rush to the arks early and it will be fun you had me at single player fps ill get it when its on sale i suspect this game will drop like a brick in price within a month i remember playing the first rage back in the days because of jesee pinkman might get it when its like 10 or so your words be speaking but the game looks like shit got my copy n i fuccin love this game nice video mane too many glitches that crash or make the game worse like audio going super loud when entering the races honestly looks like a downgradegraphically compared to the titles out today this game needs updates a little bulletstorm vibes here and there before you buy dont microtransactions in a single player only game no thanks love it i preordered the deluxe edition and love the hell out of it i already have put in over 7 hours and really really enjoy it looks better than borderlands bl art style got old pretty quickly for me but also i am really tired of these shootersneeds some good old mario ori persona zelda etc is it online only or can i play it on the road they need to add an option to adjust deadzones for people using a controller the deadzone is too high for me but the game is fun overall thank you congratulations on 5m boyz that a huge achievement for real rage was mediocredont see the need for a sequel im shocked but this youtube channel is the one i go for all my games because you out of all give a good review and feels like its my review if you know what i mean lol but thanks keep up the good work because you give a good impression on any game thank too late already buyed too late already bought it acg approves mrmattyplays approves gameranx approves seriously buy this game already i started at normal and i got my ass kicked relatively often but maybe i just suck want walk through i mean u guys cant give more i might pick this game up just because its a good single player fps i just started playing on pc and have been looking for a good single player fps to practice on that isnt competitive at all garbage ass game never coming to a before you buy to see if a game is good no matter how awful the game is this channel will speak around it to the point they will be nitpicking everything positive to say like idk if its because they dont want to lose their sponsors but holly shit ive been really annoyed with gameranx recently finally a critic that enjoys this game and sees it for what it is the main problem with this game is the developers never put any effort into advertising the content ive had no idea what the game was about or what it was until now but ive heard the name it seems like a pretty kool game but its not my type of game i remember the sky boxes in the first rage they were amazing from what ive seen the sky boxes in rage 2 does not impress 010 would not buy walker male voice is vito from mafia 2 you sound sick it feels like doom with reload animations definately gonna buy this the gameplay is amazing but on base ps4 the graphics are fucking awful because of really low resolution textures and nonstory npcs that dont have their face covered are flat like they have no depth in their face no features either besides eye brows and i have had alot of really bad sound issues 5m do something special the first game was great shooting mechanics story gadgets cant forget the spider gun driving and audioooo was incredible jake my dude you sound burned out if you need a break its cool with all of is cant wait to try thisbeen waiting since last year shooting is good oh and the shooting is really good wait did i mention the shooting is good whos this guy so glad its not a store exclusive too late already bought it whos hyped for cyberpunk tf is wrong with your voice to me rage 2 is just a carbon copy of a mix between doom and bulletstorm only played it a couple of hours and i love it cant wait for doom eternal no 4k kind of pissed i am a graphics whore and there are a lot of gamers out there like me dont know why this is not includesd just looks like another game ill pirate nothing special here omg this is exactly what i think this game is just so freaking fun i bought it played it for two hours was fun but got boring so fast they better use the rage 2 engine to make fall out 5 cuss wow im jake baldino and i frickin swear like an 8 year old great combat uninspired world ye but game lenght is about 12 hours would have preferred more mad max and less doom fps shooter with no sniper and a focus on close up action guns are for distance not close up face to face the player should just run around with a baseball bat if thats what they were going for kinda seems like the game doesnt quite now what it wants to be and any kind of stealth play options would have been nice they mindless run and gun looks like it would get old fast mtx in a single player game lol gonna buys this for dirty cheap in some months this one came as a surprise to me i thought this was gonna suck as the previous game but no im generally surprised that this game is crazy fun im really glad that this game is good and pretty much better than the previous game im just debating if i want it on xbox one x or pc i played about 30 mins before work today but i enjoyed what i played looking forward to my days off so i can really hit it jake is either sick or has a new mic and headphones he has podcast voice lol i hope he feels better if he is sick i believe there are rage coinsso mtx confirmed super powers kinda turn me off from a shooter this and borderlands 3 are my most anticipated games of 2019 microtransactions everywhere why dont they just take them out i mean look at ps4 exclusives they sell well because they dont have this nonsense in doom breath of the wild finally somebody who actually gets what the games main focus is that bar with the clown entrance takes me back to from dusk to dawn d oh look something good from bethesda except its from id just published by bethesda p im just glad id didnt get dragged down by bethesdas modern mishaps just bought this game cant wait to break my controller assault rifle with armor piercing puts in work i want to know if its worth 80 got it for ps4 pro and cant believe how smooth it is so far it even has an fov slider i fun single player adventure with a well balanced combat system that gets funner the harder it gets finally i preorderd this game and it was on my doorstep when i got home from work today i was having a blast playing this but i just started getting a bug where it sounds like car engines are always on with a deep loud rumble i cant hear any character dialogue the internet said to reload a save i did its still there do i have to restart my game rage 1 was so meh tho avalanche really doesnt do story or lively open worlds well but good to see id software did good with the shooty shooty fun times conclusion its shit this just sounds like a big ok game find a wind razor motorcycle youll enjoy driving a lot more early congrats on 5 mil u guys deserve it it looks like a more realistic borderlands too fast of an introduction in my opinion sounds like a great game con is they took out coop game looks terrible wow tldr bethesda are morons dont give them your money is there a kinda multiplayer mode or online mode so its a mix between borderlands and farcry new dawn looks like one of those games youd start off playing then get bored quarter way into it and then you stop playing lol i dont like the whole super power aspect it just changes the original feeling love the game but the audio bugs get annoying fast and they even make it so you cant talk with other npcs when will big game studios release a game that doesnt have stupid ass glitches like this the day 1 patch mentality is frustrating kinda looks like a doom and mad max glued together i love it playgrounds of destruction was the subtitle for the first mercenaries game may developer pandemic rest in peace im loving this game only 2 hours in but its great playing on the xb1x comparing rage 2 to fine wine thats why i watch jake baldino looks like a way better fallout 4 ill take it congratulations on 5 mill ive been here since before 1 mill you guys are the best before you buy thumbnails are always the best why would you only use iron sights like a single time in the entire video lol not trying to gatekeep how to play shooters but why do i feel like this have a borderlands vibe with borderlands 3 also coming out this year think ill have to pass on this till it drops to half price looks fun but it looks like well borderlands just got it and got to say im extremely surprised by how amazing the game is totally worth the money i would love to hear a before you buy start with jake yodeling hey gamers with a mouse easier single player awwww man i heard that the base ps4 and xb1 have performance issues is it really that bad lol sounds like jake is whispering this is a no for me so generic jesus the world from what ive seen looks unnecessarily large like they made it that big just to say its an open world and add time to the campaign to those who have played does the world feel bland like after a few hours you just do the main missions cause everything else is super repetitive your reviews are so damn on point thanx so much im super excited to get this game it looks awesome i loved new doom and this looks like similar shooting pre ordered and ready to go tip to make the game even faster up the fov all the way that rifle you used looks like the hammerburst from gears of war im curious how the game explains these nantrite abilities iirc nantrite was solely used for autohealth regen also really curious to see what happened to the mc after r1 after he released the arks i dont want another doom so ill pass i really hope this game sells welli really do but since people dont really buy single player games anymore unless they have big names attached to the ip it had horrible marketing i honestly thought this would be compared to far cry new dawn more based on how both games are a post apocalypse and are very bright and vibrant with superpowers this video was missing a tea with honey and lemon and chicken soups on me at the end p get well jake super determination shown when doing this bits in spite of being sick love this game doom borderlands a sht ton of fun damn best buy has yet to even ship my pre order never again pre ordering from them online again great video again jake and congratz guys on reaching 5million hasnt happened quite yet but it will youre pretty much the only game reviewer whos opinion i value trust ive been looking forward to this before you buy just picked up my own copy pretty stoked is it just me that has already bought every single game before the guys make the before you buy videos could you do an episode on the vr game hotdogs horseshoes and hand grenades ign did this game no justice sad also isnt the phoenix voiced by wonder woman i forget the voice actor for it this looks like destiny mad max style im in this is doom meets bulletstorm meets borderlands its pretty much copy paste 30 from each game i liked the first rage this however does not have that original idea vibe the first had looks fun tho review copy we all know what that means anyway shooting looks fun but there is a lack of variety and modifications story looks eh ill pick it up during the summer sale on steam maybe i want it but not for 60maybe 20 30 if its tax season get some rest jake you dont sound too good so yesterday i pre ordered rage 2 on amazon the physical one for the controller skin i also chose for it to come the next day but it got delays i hope it comes tomarrow might get it tomorrow or thursday depends on when my stupid job decides to send a paycheck its a fun offline shooter i have about 7 hours in and havent experienced any glitches or bugs runs smooth and looks great on ps4 pro as of right now 60 on steam and 51 user reviews on meta read the review before you buy guys will wait 69 months just give bethesda a chance to just make it work ya know bugs and glitches ect the opens world really breaks up the flow of gameplay and there isnt really anything going on so its truly a sequel to rage then because the original was the same way the open word stuff was the weakest aspect of the game while the shooting felt fantastic literally looked this up an hour ago now its here this looks like exactly what i want definitely buying it rip to all of the people who got annoyed about denuvobethesda versionquirks 3 hours in and just really started doing the main quest instead of raiding arks and bandit camps and such lovin it high octane awsomeness not for mouse and keyboard players and battle royal brats my kind of shooter rather wait for borderlands someones going to have to correct me if im wrong but this just looks like your standard shoot everything on sight game open world doom as he mentioned i guess if i found doom boring this might be the same i think ill wait until its heavily discounted while i buy a plague tale and i finish days gone so been looking forward to this vid for weeks did anyone else get annoyed by the lack of aiming down sights in this gameplay footage a ranger named walker my how original i liked rage just wished it was longer the settings looks like a mix with mad max and borderlands the guns reminds me of bulletstorm the gunplay is similar to doom 4not to mention eternal5 the powers idk destinys warlock and i dont remember theres a game which got this similar powers but i dont remember what game it is anyways all of that makes the game looks fun but im not a fan the the driving in this game or maybe im not a racing game person i thought he was sick at first refreshing review you focused on what the game delivers well on the fun aspects which i appreciated i am enjoying rage 2 im playing on ps4 pro the gameplay is fun fluid and well developed the explosions look great too my only gripe is the lackluster npc facial animations the lip syncing with the voice is often pretty bad i had no interest in this game but i forgot to skip that one trailer where he punches a buffalo of a cliff and thought yeah i might even buy this full price they already added micro transactions for skins picked it up today and totally agree with jake its just mindless fun that doesnt try to be someting its not deffo got that doommadmax vibe going on im only a few hours in so far so good thumbs up bethesda i still have the first rage and i still play it well if the gunplay is the best part then ill just play doom because i know rage isnt better than that really appretiate the vids guys always great and honest opinions keep it up reccomended settings on pc with an i7 870032g ramgtx 1080ti so this or borderlands 3 so its a open world doombulletstorm hybrid sounds like a buy to me is this jake baldino sounds like an intern what happened p this doom and bl combined what happen to his voice you should do a series where you go back on older games you reviewed and then review them again after months updates looks a little like bulletstorm which i am totally fine with gameranx have you been paid for telling all this bullshitai is trashgame is empty as fuckstory is boringthe game is short affinished it under the 9 hoursthe game lags for no reasondenuvo for shureproblems with textures not apearingthe driving mechanics are badthe world map is small and the list goes on my pc specsi7 8700k 50ghz 16gb ddr4 3200mhz ram gtx 1080ti 11gb 256gb nvme m2 ssd didnt get great reviews so stop over hyping a mediocre game you sound like youre recording this without trying to wake up your mom in the next room i initially saw the hair and thought this was another dumb political video too late but my first impressions isits kinda sloppy so far driving is clunky already saw typos and glitches and this after a 14gb patch on ps4 sending my copy back for pc only received an empty box with a stupid downloadcode they can shuffle that up their xxx looks pretty boaring anyways expected much more exciting missions feel like watching an anthem game well sometimes you just need some cut and dry gameplay with good mindless fun rage 2 approved painful to look at the controller play for anyone who played the first game the wingstick is here the reviews on steam really got me wondering when to buy it or not doom borderlands far cry and mad max all in one thank you for making such fun gameim really enjoying it what do you recomend wait for borderlands 3 or buying rage 2 i see this as a 30 game going to wait for a sale and updates it does look fun early congrats on 5 million i hate when they ask that 1st question like yeah before you play gta you have to play the first one lml like really guys just play it 5m is approaching its very close the first trailer was amazing but it looks boring now hmmm ok thought this was an online gameseems like a borderlands game i just dont know how i feel about this game im not gonna buy it of only buy this kind of game if its on sale only thing i remember from the first one is wing stick only joking thought the first one was a good game so the story is shit im absolutely in mood for another id shooter anytime black blood if only it had coop couldve been a borderlands3 killer jake sounds like hes in a james charles apology video nearly at 5 million nearly at 5 million like i said in my review its doommad maxbulletstorm in a open world its really fun you sick jake is this game full co op recently i wanted a fps game where i could just turn my brain off and shoot stuff and i wasnt finding any ive tried doom far cry metro and nothing hit that vibe and then i remembered that this game existed and oh man its exactly what i wanted are there any form of microtansactions im suprised no one has commented before you preordered the game yet still waiting for borderlands 3 looks like a cross between borderlands and mad max gotta love embracing the madness vibe of these kind of games will buy later today so excited finally a good game to buy getting tired of being burned by lackluster games that are over hyped no more anthem bs anyone else get the deluxe edition and not able to access the content i do have my bethesda account linked to my system so thats not it if its anything like the first one or better which i bet will be then im defo playing the crap outta this game the combat is topnotch and im enjoying blasting through everything while also constantly upgrading my character with new weapons and abilities the open world itself is very well designed and fun to explore but i just wish it was a bit more dynamic when it comes to random eventsshoot outs why are you whispering jake havent bought it yet plan on buying it payday i wanna try out the hes on fire cheat though played a ton of nba jam on the genesis when i was a kid big head mode ftw seems fun and my type of game but i just bought mk11 so im gonna wait for a price drop just hipfire all day long hey jake you alright you sound a sick what do you mean you can only choose between 2 genders theres 78 last i heard really want to buy rage 2 it feels like a good experience what the hell is wrong with your mic jake are you okay you sound ill great review jake i always look forward to the before you buy vids d this game just abruptly released in my opinion ive barely witnessed any hype for this game in the past 12 months why is the blood black like enemies are full of oil instead of blood that should be red even if it is dark redthat you can see but this is just black does the person playing not know how to fucking aim this game is actually super fun its getting a lot of hate on steam for some reason though cant please anyone these days why i have only korean subtitles i havent play the first rage game so far rage 2 is okay rage 2 is a great fun game been playing since yesterday definitely worth a buy what about that smug cliff the game is about the gameplay weird concept lmao who is here before 1k views what the phuck is this love trying to guess who voices each video this game felt like a jake video so glad to hear you been waiting for this how much strategy is there get a new microphone why does his voice sound so different literally listen to 000 again does that remotely sound like jake to yall until he introduced himself i had no idea who the hell was speaking lol usually his voice is a lighter tone but here it has much more bass well im definitely buying it now at 433 did you start using a diff microphone or something got louder quick ha ha rage 2 actually looks great and i think i would love it it looks so good in fact that i feel like i should go ahead and play through my copy of doom 2016 first anyone else agree or have thoughts as to why i shouldshould not play doom 2016 first just a question is there a way to purchase or unlock the pre order bonus or if you didnt pre order youre just screwed just buy it i just played the game for a couple hours and i am really enjoying it great fun gameplay no bullshit no microtransactions no stupid exclusivity no drama feels like the first aaa game in a while that has no controversy surrounding it really i dont see where the difficulty looks too easy na ill wait for borderlands 3 i prefer story and world to only having good shooting gameranx iety laughs lamely sorry im early i also really like some daily dosage of gameranx its like coffee for the morning or afternoon 8 views and 14 comments nani id love to see a reboot of the quake series damn how i loved quake 4 is this just telling you how good this is before you buy lol imagine a new turok with this game engine loved the 1st rage this time round i hope we get the proper ending we deserve why cant they make a game with this exact gameplay but with a great story i describe it as almost a doom light in terms of difficulty but it still has the movement and gunfeel wow jake is really sick hope you get better soon man i just picked this up today as kind of an impulse buy and im glad i did the story and open world dont do anything new or exciting but as you said the gunplay is where its at and im loving each fight i get into am i he only one thats gonna mention how god damn chill jake sounds throughout this entire video i work a lot of hours during the week and dont pick up preorders until friday but most streams ive checked out on twitch the streamers have been pooping on the game i personally think this looks like a mix of the mad max movies and doom im really looking forward to this is john goodmandan dan the drywall man conner in this game too jake are you okay you sound like you are sick are you sick jake sounds like you have a bad sore throat feel better if you are my friend told me this was 4 coop nnow i dont wanna get it since it only one player i about cried from laughing when walker became a ranger so i quit playing at that point and got a refund sadly avalanche really sucks at driving mechanics before you buy rage 2 asmr edition damn im early rage 2 is basically bethesdas borderlands i loved the first one 2nd is even better its way 2 short to me this games is like mad max doom bulletstorm and borderlands bought the game this morning and all ive been doing are the side missions lol theres a lot to do its over the top action go for it get the game why are you whispering you venturing into asmr radio this is like doomquakebioshock fun as hell the enemies remind me of the smog from quake 3 so far its a decent enough game doom and wolfenstein 2 is much much better beeeforeeee you buy early they say the game is all the rage no thats not jake remember guys they didnt let people know it had denuvo until the game was here its almost as if they were hiding something they think is bad definitely a miss nothing like the first one well damn if i knew this game would be released today i couldve bought it i really like rage 2 its been a lot of fun like a open world doom the ai is kinda dumb in spots though before you buy beat your meat to clear your head then decide this game is dope af im getting this game just waiting for the next ps4 exclusive lol i already bought it and like it why arent there more collaborations like in rage 2 id are proficient in shooting they made the shooting part avalanche have experience with car combat they made the car combat lol i know people say this a lot but i deadass did get off pornhub for this i was in this middle of a anastasia knight video too thank you for doing this fast i didnt know if i should get or not crap too late hows this have 8 views but 48 likez first one to dislike the video starting playing last night called off sick today and been playing all day amaaaazing game pls check out my recent video i loved rage 1 it was awesome though the mini games were really difficult to me i got rage 2 ad on this video i agree i have a rageing boner for this game far cry doom cyberpunk 2077 all the energy drinks rage 2 avalanche games makes amazing open world gameplay but always fails at making the world lively even if i had an xbox i wouldnt buy respect jake i fought alongside him in vietnam but does it make you r a g e rage 2 is kinda decent game its like doom but open world but the ai on this game is like kinda eh but yeah the game is good gameranx always coming through unpopular opinion here but the first one has a place in my heart flaws it does have but its a special thing for me wow theirs only 9 comments rn this game make me rage so much 2 times in a row cool a buy for sure imo i dont want to rage here dont care that im early i rllllllllly need this game f i r s t woahh my first time being seconds early i feel nice jesus christ you sound ill i searched for this 10 min ago 3rd i mean 6th nirst finally maybe the first first first first free with gamepass at the moment awesome game borderlands 2 is lifeless until you hit an area with enemies better than borderlands and fallout crap its not perfect at all but this is more like what those games should have been rage is my favourite game of all time rage 2 is a totally different creature just didnt work for me extremely disappointed game absolutely rules to me this game is a perfect 10 checking this out because its free on game pass gonna try it out i love doom and farcry so i think this will be a blast its an ok game but it has faults that ruin it for me it take about 2 million bullets to kill people even if they are just wearing pants when you get to an outpost and kill 99 percent of the enemies there if you get killed you have to start the entire outpost again and with less bullets etc plus it doesnt allow you to save during the outpost take over so you always have to start the mission from the start i never knew this came out already why does this reviewer sound like hunter s thompson its like fallout doom the resistance border lands and mad max right so no story or short to none wont get it then rage needs a multiplayer online kinda like halo doom online game modes the story and cutscenes are lame gamepkay is fun though do not buy rage 2 its an amazing game but theres a bug that prevents you from moving on with campaign and its been going on since release and still hasnt been fixed 15 hours in and completely pointless do not buy rage 2 im here bc xbox game pass never had more raw fun before than with this game im still not sold on rage 2 i loved the first one love id and avalanche and want to buy it on steam but dont like how you have to sign up for the bethesda launcher to play is the game worth it on steam id software are the best in fps games period just tried it on gamepass glad i didnt buy it as literally any amount of money would be too expensive it looks really nice but if feels like youre playing a clunky ps2 game i didnt even make it to the vehicle play it was so bad walker is basically just doomguys cousin and surprisingly even more invincible really i havent been below 50 health for the past month whats that soundtrack plays on the background just played this for the first time because its on xbox game pass and it is freakin awesome its very rewarding and very satisfying to play its one of the best games i have played in a long time i give it a 9510 combat is great on that game i recommend to every fps fan we this fun gameat last a great sequellets put the fun back into gaming gamepass right now whos here because of game pass imo rage 1 is better rage 2 is not the same is like a whole different game when i play a game and cannot stop that means its a great game and this one is i tried this with gamepass i have the first xbox one and clearly the game struggles gameplay is not smooth this game is closer to wolfenstein than doom doom gameplays smoothness is light years apart from rage 2 again i played this on original x1 tried it for 30m and its gone to much latency on gameplay this games like 20 already copping immediately the first rage was so much better 20 hours wow game is free on xbox game pass pc by the way xbox game pass brought me here great game i have a question i did the most of the missions with all the storage and arks and pads etc i beat general cross and credits appears and the games shows only at 31 completed what else i must do it a mess i played it for 60 hours bethesda has no shame or talent they are common thieves but everybody knows that any action on the screen and the frames drop to something between 5 and 10 on the ps4 reinstalled 4 times nothing change just dont buy this game deletes its own save files on top of every kind of glitching i tried every thing for a week my save file was deleted every time lost more than 60 hours thats it for me deleted the game and the save not gonna get back to it most probably will avoid bethesda altogether not buying any of their games seriously i wont be fooled again i think rage 2 should have been a linear instead of open world we also could use more weapons combat is top notch better than doom you can dodge here we could also use more monsters that requires different approach all n all i loved rage 2 maybe the only 2 fps games ive played this year that were better are destiny 2 metro exodus thanks ign that was an unbiased review unlike how you treat any capcom or sega developed game i havent seen a single enemy convoy for me rage 1 is way better then this im still playing and its fun fight me game is dope didnt like this apex clone first game was way differend anyways its a no from me the main story is just too short i think just 10 hours great review thats exactly what its game is i would wait and buy it for 2030 bucks thats a steal for this great game like destiny 2 and fallout 4 had a baby as a hardcore punk fan and a nihilist this game is perfect for me ehm sorry when did rage become an hip hop lesbian easy fps great work youve ruined the unruinable and i remember when rage 1finished the game was out it was sooo underrated im glad that the sequel keeps the same vibe this game is soooo addictive ok why none of the reviews mention the performance issues gamebreaking bugs and the awful awful laggy menu and inventory i really want to buy and enjoy rage 2 love id and avalanche and right now its 2639 on steam but i dont like how you have to use the bethesda launcher to play is the game worth it i remember how excited i was for the first rage the trailers looked like the original borderlands concept i never played it but it looks better than this imo this looks like its trying way too hard to be borderlands i feel like the side quests need more work you talk to an npc they tell you an interesting story but then theyre all the same generic mission either an ark bandit camp or a giant to kill rage 2 is my fav game if this game was coop it would have been pretty popular imangine the combos nope you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye next time please use a person without speech impediment to do a review i beat the campaign on the hard difficulty other than the upgrades and reliable fps elements the game was empty all of the levels were over quickly and unengaging resulting in my loss of interest in the second play through there are four groups of enemies but each has a small pool of variation to draw from this game deserves a 410 for its lack of story memorable characters and lack luster use of an enormous open world bring back pros and cons okay got damn we get it you like doom but please stop comparing this game to doom because its not doom its rage 2 why dont you go an upload a doom video an rant an rave about it some place else so just cause doom steroids i just see league of legends when i hear this music the gameplay is great but im still not too sure about the story im doing a walkthrough on my channel if you wanna check it out i thought its twisted metal 2 remakedissapointing the controls are sloppy im gonna make this my play before borderlands 3 so we need these guys to team up with obsidian obsidian designs and writes the game these guys deal with the combat there should be music or rock music or like something while fighting with enemys but still its an awesome game i completed it been playing for 2 days now and i personally think the game is excellent and i absolutely love the short fights and bosses this game brings me back to my child days of playing all i hear is are you ever going to get ofg of that xbox and instead of my mom nagging me now its my old women lol i have not enjoyed a game since i beat odyssey game is amazing playing on a x box one x on a 4k uhd hdr tv the picture and graphics are freaking mind blowing the combat is great on par with doom only here for the comments no new game plus lol what a joke this game looks like playstation 3 xbox 360 graphics i mean really whythis is the main reason ill wait to see the reviews on games because its ridiculous how much they charge for the poor quality of graphics they put out they know they can do way better even the story line is weak comparing it with doom nearly made instantly stop watching this review whats the guys name that kind of narrates at the beginning it sounds like the same exact guy who talks as narrator in doom i really liked it but felt the game was way to short dont trust ign combat is really fun even more than doom but its way too short i spent 5 minutes in combat 20 minutes finding boxes they should put endless enemy waving mode or somthing id probably give this game a 6 i dont know this game was ok kind of forgettable its a lot of fun best part linda carter magnolia from fo4 voices your car this game look more like the game call bulletstorm ok ill say it imo this is way better than doom fight me wow this feels fresh why is it so underrated rage 2 is better than rage 1 rage 1 2011 8510 rage 2 2019 810 xd the cnn of gaming one of the best single player games ever made combat is amazing also well over 40 hrs of gameplay play john wick music while defeating a bandit nest with a pistol those of u saying its short story story was never the point its all about the action and nice shooting gameplay with lots of tools with how u use the tools being the focus explore find guns and abilities and all that it feels extremely short just saying im real like this game the first one was such a fun game horrible story but the gameplay was so much fun i look forward to playing this hey guys whats the background music the only thing enjoyable in this game is the combat nothing else thanks for the review i wont be buying great info thanks its basically shooting and alternate fire of doom vehicle play like borderlands blow stuff up and cause chaos like borderlands humor of borderlands objectives and side quests like borderlands with mad max style raiders and a technofascist like borderlands its a great borderlands this looks like farcry new dawn mixed with boarderlands 2 that being said i already bought it before being announced whats the name of the soundtrack in 506 this game needs multiplayer since when does 80 equal a great thats like saying a b in school is a great score got bored just watching the same fights over and over this game is played on autopilot watch my rage 2 review guy its alot better then ign the rage is meant to be raging from all that was lost ign is drunk 6 for days gone 8 for rage 2 i think ign is a joke too many upgrade options all games need to take lessons from borderlands 2 skill tree and driving i have never seen a game with driving this bad deleted the game after failing the race 10 times if youre on the fence about picking this game up if you enjoyed the doom reboot or the last few wolfenstein games then you will have a blast with this game its basically doom but with a different setting updated graphics and openworld theres a lot of content here for a singleplayer fpsthis is a solid choice to hold you over til doom eternal how is that possible days gone 65 this boring fps game 80 810 for 8 story missions excluding tutorials just wow i finished the game its boring and too easy even on nightmare bunch of redundant guns that you dont need to use situationally use assault rifle and melt through the game in a few hours play 30mins and youve seen it all last boss fight is a joke you spend whole game getting abilities and arsenal for a fight that never comes the song at 410 is here to win by alexander hitchens if anyone was wondering damnthats one hell of a shooter anybody else loses in chazs race even if you finished in first 60 for 8h of gameplay 8 out of 10 can i be honest just got it and no like no its boring sorry and im a borderland player fallout play like no fallout 76 is better and thats really sad feels like a halo knock off and i dont even like halo lmao waste of 60 today fun simply isnt enough anyomore does it have nuanced story telling are the characters likeable hows the framerate is the missions design varied and combat intuitive does it have replay value how does it treat women homosexuals ohh and best of all does it release on steam if not its obviously a 210 very nice review my feelings exactly i will buy this btw doom is simply outstanding so thats a great thing cant wait to play this omg is it me or bethesda getting real shity with their games fallout 76 was absolute garbage now rage 2 seems like the mad max video game just redrawn and a different story except in mad max they were smart enough to give u a flashlight and descent sound without it glitching out all the time gotta wait for updates doe 012 oh dear pls my eyes got killed really wtf patches dlc and mods could make this game great so rage 1 85 and rage 2 80 press f for respect to ign heres a tip make your own review dont ever put stock in reviews from anyone unless you know and trust the person reviewingwho knows how much of the game they have really played go watch a twitch stream of the game and listen to players who are really thoroughly playing thru the game and who are gamers not writers dont ever listen to these reviewers your opinion will always differ the last few years ign and gamespot and other reviewers have made badlow reviews of games that were excellent make your own opinion you could be missing out on a game you might enjoy just 20 hours seems a bit short this game is an appetizer leading up to the main course that is borderlands 3 thats not a bad thing just pointing out the obvious open world and rpg elements have pretty much become musts for me these days they are more important than narrative imo thats why this game in on the radar narrative in shooting games just cant hold my attention anymore im much more interested in the world the gunplay abilities and the upgrades loot save the epic stories for rpgs although the action in this game looks a bit too arcadey for my tastes im an avid destiny player it might be worth a play but oh boy i cant wait for borderlands 3 this makes me want to fire up mad max and start a new game the original rage had some of the best shooting mechanics in a 1st person shooter the story wasnt memorable but all the action surely was 537 in case your in a hurry hey ign did you actually play this one to review it this game is a 10 ign overrating games as usual great great game hints of loads of different games really intense at timesworth a play insane difficulty is literally that ing needs battle royale for a 1010 just bought this yesterday but not played yet because updates guuuuuuu somehow it makes me have a hi expectation on tesvi instead of wanting to play rage 2 loved the game but the story should have been longer the action is great with all the combos but 3days after i bought it i was already through which is sad since i wanted to play more in my opinion a game should at least give me you the amount it costs in playtime the original rage should have launched a whole slew of games it was a great game although short so should i just wait until it hits a sale to buy it or is it worth my 60 dollars so basically this is mad max with different graphics so its an actual doom clone in 2019 felt like yesterday people were bitching about bethesda becoming a bad developer just because of 76 this or mortal kombat pirated it on pc then deleted it after playing about 2hrs game is cheesy as hell and super generic and forgettable this game is way better than 80 imo i love the doom 2016 gameplay and i love rage 2 game play i feel personally the reviewers have lost their touch both id games are way better imo than the scores you gave hurry doom eternal ive completed rage 2 why do you always have ads you piece of shits shoot jump reload repeat i dont know why i recognize this ign reviewer more than any other ign reviewer i know he reviewed fallout 4 ok honestly this game was a huge disappointment nothing like the first one non sense shootings no story way to short graphics lame overall a game to skip shooter of the year so far on pc cost 40 euros and im getting 30 hours of gameplay easily changing the settings made this game much better on the onex turn off motion blur and change field of view to 75 and sensitivity as you prefer but i landed on x38 y28 and it feels quick but not jumpy this made a huge difference this game rocks i really like it rage 2 is not only a love letter to those who played the original but even more to those of two other super fun and hugely underrated games i thought we would never see a sequel of mad max and bulletstorm thank you ign for giving it a score it certainly deserves im done with gamespot as much as i enjoyed this game id argue heavily against 20 hour campaign i just finished my campaign in just under 14 hours included in that i have every power maxed out every weapon with the shotgun railgun pistol and assault rifle maxed out cleared every single pink objective bandit camps mutie camps etc have about 15k feltrite and literally nothing to spend it on i had so much fun playing through but now theres literally nothing to do and before the comments of well turn it off easy mode 4head come in i was on hard for the first 5 or 6 hours then turned it to nightmare once i started getting my powers upgraded and it became too easy and i almost always play games on easy or normal for the first time rage 2 enjoying this open world shooter great fun gamewe were surprised actually how well it played and it looks great on our xbox one x thought i was watching doom gameplay the first 30 seconds haha trash game bethesda looks like bio shock score 8 tipical of ign im loving the game goin in a den using the many ways to kill is a blast wasted my money really hate the way they hid certain things behind the deluxe edition will not be supporting this developer crazy how this game and fallout 76 came from the same company though im sure different teams made the two games far cry new dawn looks better and it scores less sowhy cant lucy review this i wonder why did this game even need an open world anyway besides a marketing gimmick if the world serves no utility then whats the point why not make it level to level with a hub area for vehicle combat httpsyoutubekhzphnzro64 my reaction and thoughts on rage 2 i cant quite put my finger on it but theres something off with the analog controls in this game it feels like theres an overly large deadzone on the sticks that turns into a ridiculous acceleration once you pass it it just feels off and medling with the control settings in the menu doesnt fix it im not hating on the game but i just didnt like it like i thought i would honestly one of the nost boring games of the year so far the world just needs secret locations fairly well hiddenmaybe some puzzles it would make it seem much more engagingfun and makes the player want to explore beyond the obvious markers will they patch rage 2 to fix the problem so basically this game feels badass to play i just got it today and i can tell you that the gameplay is pure joy mad max x gears of war x borderlands x doom x wolfenstein where the story lacks a bit the gameplay makes up for crazy fun game favorite fps of 2019 exodus pretty close behind idk about you guys but does anyone think the graphics are stunning whats with pink apocalypse settings first far cry nd now this who else often skips to the verdict i fcking love this game its like doom borderlands destiny mass effect and mad max had a baby named it rage 2 which means its awesome i love the combat man playing on hard is a really goo experience i thinking about switching to nightmare just to see if the agressive play style is also valid there doom helped this game huh and how well did ign score doom oo yes but the graphics look wank on pc how did this game get a better rating then days gone 8 really what is wrong with you this game should have score around 15 so this gets an 8 and days gone gets a 55 erm ok then also i feel rage one was better the story in this is terrible lets be honest not saying its a terrible game tho its still decent i give it 710 im about 7 hours in i never finished doom 2016 so i played that instead of buying this game lol praises doom for lack of variety complains about rage 2s lack of mission variety lol the whole game of doom boils down to kill all demons and thats pretty much it if youre complaining about mission variety youve got it wrong i actually prefer this game over doom by a lot ign is giving rage 2 a 8 and a plague tale innocence a 7 well done ign lol it should be rage 2 50 and a plague tale 85 was that a lootbox there no it was actually just an old school box full of loot thank heavens at least this game from bethesda went a lot better than its previous game fallout 76 we all know how that game turned out for bethesda as well as the huge mess they later got themselves into right afterwards with the deal with that canvas bag and the nuka cola rum bottle damn he fackin hates this 810 this game actually makes you feel like your raging this background music is great loving it waiting for angry joe audio issues in my game cant play it until they fix the problem he said its like mad max oh im definitely getting this someone tell me shoudl i buy this game so a second rate doom or 1st rate that beat hard though your review music its overwhelming id rather hear the game and the reviewer clearly right now its just grating calling it now switch version coming at some point looks amazing i didnt like the fact that almost everything is upgradable i also hope it doesnt have a very bad and short ending like the first game 20hrs ha 10 hrs at best with grinding its fun but its not worth the triple price 20 maybe 30 dollars i kinda trust this review i lost faith after the fortnite one looks fun enough but i was expecting something deeper when i first heard about this game ill wait until its 20 or something and i want a new game to play so am i missing something the blue feltrite just naturally floats to you but not for me i didnt even unlock 3 abilities before completing the game one thing i dont like about this game is that you cant use weapons enemies drop you have to find all the weapons in special locations so unlike doom where theres a great progression for the weapons you get if youre unlucky you might be stuck with the same weapons for a long time or if youre lucky you might find a lot of weapons and abilities and make a lot of the areas and missions a breeze i smell crysis p most likely the car combat customization and utilization will be focused on a dlc i feel like this game would be better if it was linear and not open world sooooooo nothing about the story guess its that bad literally i renamed my rage 2 shortcut to doom 2 days gone 65 rage 800 hasnt played a shooter this energetic or satisfying since doom and the secret formula for rage 2 is doombut yet they gave doom a low rating for being repetitive how does this make sense its crazy this game didnt get lots of advertisements its so fun i think the reviewer forgot it was not a call of duty game farcry new dawn is that you general cross looks like a strogg out of quake 2 italian gameplay on my channel this game looks insanely bland and overdone why not just wait for doom eternal instead atleast that game has some personality can someone tell me the music used in this vid its lit personally i liked the first one better just get bulletstorm full clip edition thank me later my only real complaint they shouldve used the doom engine id tech 6 instead of their own it would be way more impressive visually imo still the combat looks fun enough to give it a try are we really at the point in gaming where hidden collectibles being to well hidden can be considered frustrating has gaming gotten that easy this game looks fun but idk im 23 and getting older barley play the game i never finished far cry 5 but this looks like a funner version i might have to lower my game choices to 2k battlefield and anything rockstar wow what a difference makes a competent engieneor an awesome engine like id6 this engine is fantastic so why bethesda is stuck with their old engine is beyond me because id software works for themso i imagine that all bethesda can do is simply askwhy having a partner with one of the better engines around and not using it in other game stop giving me a mission of killing enemies or defend the base in rage 2 give me more killing missions i love killing i love ign reviews they are best imagine making a game with cool vehicles but not making a way to use the vehicles only few times disappointing the game is horrible trash and doesnt even aline with the first game anyone else bored when its not a multiplayer game since bots are boring to play against did they literally base the review score off of how fun the combat is every single other review ive seen or read has said that the story isnt great and the open world is boring and repetitive i dont trust this review at all im sure the game is fun but id wait for a sale since 2016s doom wolfenstein 2 exists ign had to set graphics to low and also turn off ambient occlusion in order to run smoothly on gtx 970 this game is demanding days gone or rage 2 is this a review it feels more like a promo video rather than a review come on please gotta love the fact ign has the lowest view count nobody takes them serious anymore they give this game a 8 but give days gone a 65 an 8 i was thinking it could be a 6 or 7 after 24hrs thanks i had a commercial for the army that said step into there shoes vr then the commercial cut out early and showed the intro gameplay for rage i had to do a double take thinking whoa the army has changed i actually prefer the first game in the series im sick of generic open world first person shooters is this battletoads i was gonna say this looks like a knock off of doom but a lot pf people beat me to it nothing to do in the vehicles but its from the makers of mad max how is it possible theres nothing to do mad max is awesome indeed a fun game but after i beat it in a day mind you i was done but in general a real fun game just beat the game in 4 hours dont buy it the combat is fun but has no diversity seriously dont buy it the whole game is so underwhelming there is no end game content either 010 monster insulted my malformed lip i got to say i was very very disappointed that it was nothing like the first one but other than that it was really cool 80 for a generic lifeless and boring game with poor graphics and no real story nice one again ign another garbage review from ign wow this game definitely surprised me did not expect it to be this awesome man absolutely brilliant work what was that song playing in the review it sounds dope lifeless open world of course its lifeless an asteroid killed 80 of the earths population anotver game with no brain required lmao it didnt borrowed from doom did u play the first one basically it had the same type of action of u always moving and shooting it was before doom dont disrespect this game by comparing it to far cry i love this game just as i loved the first rage my only real complaint is how low res it looks after being used to everything else in 4k or close to it this game really needs a resolution boost even if just a bit i cant believe this game cant get closer to 4k at least 2k and keep 60 frames when games like doom and wolfenstein were able to pull it off shitty engine i guess they should have gone with id tech instead still waiting until dunkey drops a vid on it do i need to play the first one this game or dmc5 graphics look nice like how vehicles blow up this looks so much fun i cant wait to play it really makes you feel like rage take notes lucy obrien and days gone was a 55 yeah right suckers i loved the first even tho loads of the games world was locked for dlc doom inspired has this fucken dink ever played rage gtfoh i think ign is really improving the way it does reviews for some reason they just seem to be getting more consistent and more comparative to the average gamers views can you be a black or transgender character you know cuz you gave days gone a horrible review cuz there werent black or transgender freakers guys the game is awesome i really recomend you to play it ive got 15 hours in this now and i do love it the combat and abilities are really all its got going for it though lol meh ill wait for a sale video was uploaded 23 hours ago according to ign its 20 hours long did they beat the game and edit their own personal video because i see no watermarks whats with all of these reviewers saying this game has a lifeless or boring open world i feel like we all got different versions of the game remarkably in the version of rage 2 that i bought baddies roam the open road fighting constantly with opposing factions highspeed races are taking place around random corners convoys of death careen down long stretches of sandy highways trade posts pop up in unexpected places heavily armed goons and road blocks abound and all manner of flora and fauna can be seen off the beaten paths id really like to know what the critics version of a more lifefilled open world for this game would be straight 8 hours great game i genuinely cannot understand how ign rated this better than days gone dead set but anyway this game has many opposite responds on steam reviews i couldnt stand doom so i guess ill pass on this game did anyone else love the music in this video and does anyone have a link wait so the open world is lifeless yet there are loads of things to do and explore outside of the main missions which one is it a baren world or a fun filled one if mad max and doom had a lovechild another rage master piece buy it now lol try ggmanylives instead and the plethora of uploads denouncing it as rubbish instead this game is great all the people bashing it are butthurt sony fans who hate that days gone got a lower score lol great game so far you didnt talk about sotry let them fix the effects or i aint getting it im cheap so i very rarely buy games at full price but ill definitely be buying this when theres a sale in the future a postapocalyptic world feels lifeless i just cant i hate doom so im sure this game isnt for me your one of the only reviewers left that i trust from ign great review lol and then we have the gamespot review the soundtrack on this review is lol so the open world company didnt do well but the doom guys did great lol nice basically if doom and fallout had a love child looks boring rage was also empty and boring very quickly i wont bother with this till it ends up being 5 quid on sale first person shooters have weirdly became one of the best genres doom titanfall 2 wolfenstein and now rage some classics meh ill wait for angry joe i just have a hard time trusting reviews anymore ign gave it an 8 saved you 6 minutes of your life is there any form of character customisation where do you get the proximity indicator where is the city he is talking about be able to find in the world whats with the music in this video i could barely hear the man its a blast to play the power up mode is called overdrive and not rage so should i get both fry cry new dawn and this or is one better than the other great can you do a a plague tale innocence review i have this game its awesome and actually fun unlike alot of games arent fun anymore they a grind or to serious to compete in enjoying sitting back with my controller yes controller on pc and enjoying the fun fast game drinking a beer wow a 8 wasnt expecting that from ign so suddenly ign is credible again whatever game is mediocre at best music at 410 please also this games looks hella fun might have to get this if u play doom 6 why play this game editing in this review was on point thumbs up this looks like a game that would be perfect for coop purchasing intensifies who here is still pissed at ign for giving days gone a 65 what about all the white characters watching delrith from ajs one shot certain bosses on nightmare spare me the details is game breaking any shooter that you dont need cover is meh its not bad just not worth the price its asking one thing that wasnt made prevalent in the review is console performance the game does nottttt look so hot on ps4 pro and xbone in fact at times it looks pretty bad textures look really blurry or fuzzy but if you cal look past it the game runs smoothly enough and it is still outrageously fun to play game description a meteor has wiped out 75 percent of the worlds population ign the world feels dull and lifeless 210 whats the music reminds me of bulletstorm i agree with gamespot everyone get this game or check it out it is a blast to play well worth the purchase should we make side quests to build the lore of this world that was already boring to begin with no lets just try really hard to be borderlands and make boring cookie cutter side quests youve seen in every open world game ever i am back in 2011 i simply love this game so much moment to moment fun so more like doom and less like far cry ill wait until this is sub 20 a reviewer with a brain excellent give this fella a raise the force push and ground pound look like destinys class attacks i think fps games are dropping off theres only so much they can do with them these days if this game can get 8 than why days gone got 65 i just got distracted by how fast the guy doing this review speaks looks like a mix of doom and fallout yall need to do the pros and cons that you used to do at the end of a review so many mediocre games at the end of the playstations life cycle cmon this year has been horrible so far id like to get this but doom enteral and borderlands 3 are around the corner its 80 just buy the game if you want to much land i usually dont like shooting games but rage 2 is great gotta scratch that cyberpunk itch i was sold on this game when i played it at e3 skull on crosshair can i turn it off in option on consoles so days gone gets a six and this crapy game gets an 8 this game was a nice surprisewith all the let downs lately you mentioned far cry you gave 3 a 90 4 a 85 5 a 89 rage 2 gets an 80 just pointing out ign reviews are a joke period now thats a real review o i love it thanks for that much information finally a fair review congratulations ign i do not see fun in walking running and shooting every hour without meaning because the games do not evolve put strategies becomes more interesting its like mad max in first person mode what song is this if you didnt feel rage then you didnt have it on nightmare difficulty this game looks awesome you won this round open world games its meant to be played while high i knew it would get an 80 72 and 68 on meta definitely ign only gives high scores to 1st person shooting games even days gone has more content and depth hahaha its a buy then great review dan the best part of rage 2 is the memory i have from the night rage came out where i stood in line to buy dark souls great new animations they had to change they got too old it is an 80 out of 10and it is a blast to play 8 seriously what a joke ign am i the only one who gets dizzy and get headacahe after 40 min of gameplay the game is great btw was the first game this silly or over the top for lack of better words ign youre stepping up your review game very well presented seems kinda forgettable great gameplay but nothing really memorable probably pick it up on sale i find it hilarious how a game no one wanted turned out to be way better than the games people actually wanted mordhau review remember to check out other reviews and dont trust ign waiting for borderlands 3 while playing rage 2 seriously great awesome game just played yesterday and i cant wait to get back home from working and play some more didnt even need to go online to have fun with this game unlike anthem why wait this long to post the review ign i think this review has nailed every point dead on rage is a great single player experience that i definitely recommend for people seeking to juts mindlessly shred people in the most beautiful fashion ever must look great on base consoles at 30fps dont trust ign reviews there complete rubbish this game is sick though but be careful of ign should be an epilepsy warning fallout 4 x overwatch rage 2 whats the music its great still not happy about days gone score its worth a 7510 this reviewer is worth it so this went away from the rpg elements the first had hard pass cracked in no time 810 too many menus lies fake news this game is garbage loving this game 8 hours in almost nine still having plenty of fun no downsides ign finally got it right yaaah why upload a video not in 60fps recommended tip play the game with headphones at max volume i know you all are exited for rage but wait for cyberpunk 2077 guys anybody know any of the music used in this video feels like doom well thats all i need to know 8 is fair great game and very very very fun but not epic with some dlc has potential to be really epic must buy to all fans of fps games they arent memorable why is this a complaint what game actually as memorable characters most games dont why does the thumbnail look like faze adapt lmao game looms great plan to pick this up on friday this is one of the best games ive played this year feels great to just have fun with a game after disappointments like mk11 and days gone i dont know about the reviewer but this game deserves a 9 it looks fun as hell for a first person shooter it is absolutely fine and entertaining this is a low brain energy game that involves shooting things after work or school to blow off steam the game is just as fun as doom and at times better i didnt have trouble with my frame rate on my pc it is a 1000 dollar computer i got it over two years ago dont complain about the plot it is a shooter there is no plot so dont worry rage 2 reviewed by a robot remember white man and white woman bad makarov cod mw8 2023 the main bad guy looks like a generic enemy from quake 2 can you play with friends online might pick this up looks like this could be a bit of fun at least something to kill some time before borderlands 3 comes out d it looks terrible on ps4 blurry with terrible textures so basically it just needs a update the reviewing guy sounds bored of his job the shitty hiphop music did annoy me about this review why am i resubbed to ign gamespot i unsubbed from these fools over 4 years ago bought it maxed out at 1440p it looks like trash tbh was surprised when a toted large open world game was only 35gb found out why it looks like it came from 2010 driving basically has no physics like an early just cause game very arcadey with virtually no story combat is ridiculously easy and guns are laser accurate stopped aiming down sights all together because it seems unnecessary no discovery the very few guns are all listed in your invent just greyed out voice acting quite bad and animations completely out of sync when there are animations at all full price do not buy if its say 25 aussie or 1520 american pick it up for a time waster lifeless open world lol ok ign i guess every game has to be as atmospheric as rdr2 smh i took the plunge and got it is there a high replay value is the story long or short considering on picking it up but really dont wanna spend 60 on a short campaign only game he said the world feels lifeless its a game about the apocalypse cant wait to play it not doom but farcry new dawn the rating is finally correct ign although i would give it a 9 so a plague tale innocence gets a 710 from ign while rage 2 gets an 810 im so over trusting ign reviews i asked for this game a long time ago and idk if i really care anymore days gone its better than this garbage 111 did anyone get a warframe vibe from how that ship opened up aint it funny how it ha happens fair review 20 hours most people saying its 9 hours gonna pick this up soon got to finish other titles first you give thsi game a 8 but days gone a 65 i demand a rereview of days gone fair and balanced with a garanted 1010 from the start and that you overlook flaws that on other games you wouldnt basically this shouldve been a linear storydriven game instead of an open world days gone is far better ill pick this up when its 40 bucks in a month looks great though im glad that theres a lack of random encounters compared to far cry 5 this is how fc5 starts out walking about deciding where to go a van carrying hostages drives by with the driver shooting at you you free the hostages and now a fuel truck nearly runs over you an armed convoy of cultists show up and start attacking you you fend their attacks off and now a plane is making a strafing run you avoid the plane and now a turkey mauls you since you ran out of medkits your partner revives you and you see cultists escorting hostages you free them and now another wave of cultists start attacking youre shot with a tranquilizer bullet and the next campaign mission starts 20 hour campaign lol either ign is deluded or just crap at playing games lets go with both shall we i see that rage 2 got the start before cyberpunk 2077 cuz the games looks the same cd project running slow some reviewer say rage 2 main story takes 11 hours ign says it takes 20 hours mhh this game is so great go buy it you wont regret it one bit should i get this or days gone this is a 75 max mad max has more rage than rage it looks boring ign got scared and out of fear gave it a 8you should never make a gamer angry gs gave it a 6 couple hours in and im having loads of fun popping heads reminds me of headshoting the grunts on halo dan the staple stapleton 20hours campaig other reviewer said 10hours play for gameplay not story or world d e n u v o if you can get it on console we are so lucky to get this sequel the game deserves to be supported by everyone for sure the game looks insanly easy from all the gameplay i have seen are people reviewers playing on easy difficulty gameplay looks really great at least better than haterspot gs wow cool post ign thanks for sharing whats that music on 408 damn thats some cool music they got there nothing but praise 80 ign cannot be trusted anymore it just looks so generic i cant see myself playing and enjoying it the secret ingredient is doom but ign gave doom a 71 for me doom is a 9 and rage is at least an 85 after around 10 hours in regardless the best fps of last 5 years would be 1 doom 2 wolfenstein 2 the new colossus 3 metro exodus 4 titanfall 2 5 rage 2 honorable mentions 1 farcry 5 2 shadow warrior 2 3 battlefield 15 prey far cry primal dishonored 2 and resident evil 7 were amazing but i dont consider them to be shooters this looks like the best coop game of this generation what a waste instant buy if i could play all this mayham with a friend ill give it 89 tbh its super fun i pre ordered an now im pre bonered dat shotgun feels so weak though game by bethesda wow i am shock best review ive seenand hes absolutely righti fuckin luv this game igns reviews have been declining in quality 20h campaign no way its less than half of that why is no one calling them on that hope its better than the first and has more role playing aspects whats the frame rate like on base ps4 i mean wolfenstein 2 was a pretty energetic brutal shooter and that came out after doom anyone know the song at 407 thanks wow cool review ign thanks for uploading remember when only the best triple were games 100 a pop its been 9 years since the first rage not 7 the first one came out in 2010 ign ign review narrative sound robotic wow cool review ign thanks for sharing these people nearly gave aw and fortnite a ten soooo 20 hour gameplay for 60 usd nah thnku i already have doom honestly looks like a 9 to me looks like the open world of far cry the shooting of doom and the driving of mad max which are 3 of my favourite things so its like far cry on crack 20 hour campaign for a campaign only game seems low i know for completionist its probably 60 or so but ive never felt the need to 100 anything other than close to all of skyrim it is possible to die in the game i regret not pre ordering this game now its brilliant fun the reviews are so mixed its a solid 810 the gun play is the best in a shooter for a while and the action is fast and frantic pretty sad to see the vehicular combat isnt anywhere near mad max i had really high hopes but seems like they just attached a minigun to a slow as molasses 4wd at first its very slow and limited but it gets better with each upgrade and weapon you get days gone is so much more interesting 65 rage 2 8 days gone shut up ign nobody likes you moerfuers ign 80 really lol wow the music sounds awesome too d 60fps on ps4proxbox x thats all i need can not remember the last time i had so much fun playing a first person shooter i love this game everyone needs to do themselves a favor go out and pick this game up now i promise you wont regret it why is the video quality so poor this looks fun i miss bulletstorm its really boring tbh wish i didnt buy it basically an appetizer for doom eternal mad max ripoff which looks even better to be fair i thought this was going to be a disappointing game im glad i was wrong im actually enjoying and its definitely scratching that doom itch ive got at the moment i gotta say sam riegel as the voice for the male protagonist isstrange im going to pick this up because ive waited for rage 2 for years and the gameplay does look fun but i worry that it lost the feel ofthe first rage there the satisfying ways to dispatch your enemies blended so well with the erratic movement of your enemies and the general feel of just making it with whatever garbage you had are cities still a thing vendors side quest givers and gambling etc ign you did something right for once i hadnt even heard of rage before this video but this game looks amazing this game looks gorgeous i saw this trailer and thought it was borderlands 3 at first looks fun what is the music used at 405 its really fun glad i got it so far this is mad max fps game its all about the combat which is great five hours in and barely scratching the surface having lots of fun anyone knows background music name does anyone remember bulletstorm this is my new game after im done with sekiros multiple endings cheat activatedlol can you slide in this game and another bethetic so called tripple aaa title i even read comments of people proud to have preordered this crap doom 2016 got a 7 though its one of my favorite games of all time so 8 is ok maybe its because i play on ultra on pc but in my first hour i constantly ran into random encounters and the world did not feel dead at all aside from story this is the best shooter so far this year period ignore those flaws based on openworld standards rage does not mean to be a true openworld game the free roaming and car sections are just in there for a changing of pace it literally looks like a doom game what annoys me is all those people who were like pfft ill just wait for borderlands this can be a fun game too people ign always complain about being empty its the apocalypse assault rifle sounds exactly like bulletstorms assault rifle rage as in party can you still collect cards and play card game duels everyone keeps saying the open world is lifeless are we playing the same game cause thats not my case at all and im very picky with open world games the way some people have described this game and the way i would describe it has me feeling like we are playing two different games here they gave this hot garbage an 8 but days gone a 6 gonna wait for the summer sale or game pass to pick this up are their any races in rage 2 thats like twisted metal death matches waiting for halo infinite im here for a real review after watching gamespot the only problem with this game is the price this game needs multiplayer battle racing or something like that multiplayer free roam would just feel weird but do some multiplayer with racing car battles or mutant bash tv rage 2 is awesome play it when i see game with first person i deslike the game simple is that i hate first person oh skins in single player game for real money and no word about it great review hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha you give a plague tale innocence a 7 and you give rage 2 an 8 out of 10 as always your scores are trash ign no tastes in games at all ign 1 out of 10 no battle royale if rage 2 was released in this form 10 years do yall think it would get higher reviews dude in the thumbnail looks like faze adapt stg the way they show the score and the review name has changed people call them tedious upgrade systems i call them the best thing about rpgs the love child of doom and bulletstorm yep buying this next month when the price goes down shooting things in rage 2 is more fun and satisfying than any other game that has come out in the last 3 years for that its a 910 did this guy just said 20 hours campaign what this game would be better if it wasnt a open world game great game very fun they need to make army of two army of two 40th day and army of two devils cartels for the xbox one bethesda is never getting my support for their absurdly high regional pricing for the same usd5999 vampire bloodlines 2 rs1299 rage 2 rs 3999 mad maxfar cry new dawnand doom had a babygreat game wish they would have made the game linear the open world is the worst aspect of the game wtf is with the screen effects its giving me a headache just watching this footage so its the mad max game from 2015 with dooms gameplay this is everything i didnt know i wanted not doom by far dont be fooled by lies a heads for anybody who is about to play do as many side activities before you touch the story because its short af ign the worst i liked the first game will buy this one yall can hate i like what i like 810 just cause it came from a great dev no thanks its bethesda and avalanche both are terrible publisher and company remember fallout 76 and elder scroll blade dnt forget all the recent avalanche game have been decent and garbage i probably wait for all dlc and flash sale for this one a game perfect for stoners with all the gltich effect and colors i love the new animated text for this review hows the shotgun its garbage but its aaa so 810 ok like what is it with you guys and your constant changes in the appearance of that scoreboard at the end its kinda weird rage replacing borderlands as the better franchise guess well find out dont know what youre talking about when you said a near lifeless world i cant go 35 minutes without seeing some enemies or enemies fighting eachother its literally full of life you must not of played enough i give this game a 8587 question is this game an rpg shooter like far cry new dawn or normal shooter like doom 2016 ign has no credibility this game is fun worthy purchase picked up the collectors edition got it for 100 the damn talking head is mounted above the dining room table next to jesus all i heard is everything is awesome but were gonna give it a 810 cool video design though whats the deal with these purge like reviews on single player games dont yall get tired competitive repetitive battle royals name of the soundtrack in the review the ai isnt aggressive i want this am i the only one worn out by first person shooter games or any shooter game in general legend of zelda botw was also a pretty lifeless world with few npcs and at that they were the same npcs though out most of the entire map big but lifeless as well what makes this an 8 but zelda higher because it got a perfect 10 ign makes no sense and gamers buy what ever non sense and take these review companies too seriously im torn because i love doom wolfenstein but im burnt out with the open world genre very repetitive game get an 8 and tons of fun day gone another repetitive game that is tones of fun gets a 6 lmao ign please stop resting game being deployed overseas they games require constant internet really makes it hard to pick up a controller outside of tdm will i need constant internet with exception of updates i might go back to skyrim if i have too theyre not doing the 5 rating anymore lmao looks like they get how convoluted their rating system really is 1999 in 6 months rage 2 is great ehh ill pick it up on sale for some reason the steam review said it otherwisewellyou can review the game by yourself instead hear peoples opinion does this game have multiplayer ive had fun so far a first hour in but that thing hit the ground outside in the wasteland and i pick it up i had a huge smile on my face this is a great fun singleplayer shooter enjoy it please explain how this game is better than days gone i depend on ign rating before i buy a game the other ratings i saw was a bit off but ign always get it right thanks ign lol who even are you i just love the first background instrumental of this review lol i have no idea why ign are still allowing this guy to read reviews mr robot just do something else at ign seriously your reading is definitely effecting youtube viewer numbers with mounting disappointments like days gone and rage 2 we need cyberpunk 2077 and death stranding this reviewer has voice frequency that is incredibly annoying to my ears it make me dizzy its basically doom with vehicles lol the music from this review its not from the game is it multiple currencies that better not mean what i think it doesawe man world feels lifeless a post apocalyptic world dont you think it hit the mark rage 2 is amazing im about 4 hours in and its exactly what i was expecting a fuller and more dynamic mad max with doom level gunplay what more do you need in a shooter 1010 from me if you want a story then go play the witcher its basically shooting and alternate fire of doom vehicle play like mad max blow stuff up and cause chaos like just cause humor of borderlands objectives and side quests like far cry its a great game might as well give it an 85 if its really that great funny how doom gets referenced in this review when we all know what happened when doom got reviewed by someone else tried this game on my friends account shooting is fun but it didnt carry the game for me no interesting characters no story the world is lame missions are wank i preferred rage 1 tbh well the villain looks like a transformer ive got high hopes for doom eternals gameplay now ill just gamely it its a 90 at least how much money do you need for a quality review goddamit aside that fact this will scratch my borderlands 3 itch im picking this up cause it looks awesome rage 2 should be a 87 in my opinion despite its horrible character creation i never seen a game with such bad looking characters other then elder scrolls oblivion thats a fair score im downloading rage 2 right now and im so hyped you said doom that has me in didnt these knuckleheads rate days gone 65 i love days gone so is no one going to point out that it definitely has such a bulletstorm vibe this game is over the top delightfully quick and utterly batshit i absolutely love it buy this dont wait ok im convinced ill get it tomorrow after work so your telling me this game is a 80 but days gone is 65 i guess ign really do be like that it looks pretty fun if its as fun as doom ill definitely get it later on notice how gory this game is notice how nobody complained its sonys ultimate wetdream 80 is a pretty fair score thats what i would have given it as well anything lower is underselling it really im vegan and i can beat you silly latest video is proof they rated this higher than doom interesting lol who are you woah they actually understand the kind of game it is lol how long is this game 15 hours how bloody boring when did igns music get so bangin bethesda officially left the chat today the real question is how in the hell they got the announcer from the original nba jam i thought that guy retired i like the new formats for ign his monotone is killing me made me quit mid review jesus its pretty damn fun tbh subscribed tu the gamer 2323 the open world is so empty and bland here comes plague people complaining loved the first love the second im still not buying it since ive seen the game crashing on other streamers plus the story is trash just get plague tale instead sub to me i do movie and game reviews and im creating a content cop series the comment section i like the new theme of the review absolutely love this game 69th im so proud this game seen interesting to play hopefully the game isnt too bad but it is fun game looks sick i watched tmartns gameplay part one and its amazing 534 why look different but still no pros and cons days gone gets a 6 but this get an 8 cmon ign play fair me rage you rage we all rage 2 gameplay looks great meh kinda bland wait for cyberpunk 2069 instead guys for sure id play this but i think ill wait on a sale for this one days gone is 65 but this 80 yeah yeah ok imagine if this was like irl and this is our futre bro like holy jeez plague the innocence rage 2 is so fun i wish i was happy i have a small youtube channel anyone want to subscribe to me i came here for the comments part 2 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvldfxcfyl0fylistpl4vbgurudhoh24ifklsylrthtv2gzkindex3t0s thanks to bethesda for providing me with this early copy if you enjoyed the video please leave a like subscribe or share with your friends it really means a lot you can also follow me on twitter httpstwittercommkiceandfiremk general cross they copy him from warframe if itsanything like the first rage it will be fantastic hope you get the boomerang thing i loved that i ended up buying four copies of the original rage one for my neighbours son one for my grandson and two for my self i had one that got scratched when metioning no names someone moved xbox and the disc got scratched so i invested in another deluxe copy i loved thst game when that giant baldy baby creature thing appeared i just loved that game gonna have tlo get my self this 2nd rage thanks for sharing am i the only one that is having problems with the whole game freezing during combat and when ever i am upgrading my vehicle on the xbox one the game looks like shit especially on console i know the cutscenes are in engine rendered but they look sowierd like those old xbox original game cutscenes it just doesnt naturally flow go to 21221 wait a second and he shoots three times you might have notice it sounds like ba dum tshh like someone told a funny joke 4152 thats how not to waste ammo my fucken god from a outstanding shooter they made another gay shit game gotta love the weird and rage 2 doubles down from the first game which itself was a very weird game indeed kinda like fallout meets quake meets the road warrior meets i dunno the sex pistols whats not to love kinda takes me back over thirty years ago to thrashing with the dead kennedys live and loud in a nightclub the size of a living room with two hundred sweating people bouncing around in it edit the sages and wise men of legendary genius all said it was impossible couldnt be done but i bend the knee in respect for id softwares success in making mutant bash tv even more bizarre than it was the first time round between the ravishing desdemonya and that dude down on allfours with that featherything sticking out of his anus im just likewow wow as always mkiceandfire many thanks for a great entertaining chatterfree gameplay vid im sure this one will be as fine as all your others but i wont be watching much of this one not yet doom clones are games that mimic dooms gameplay not gonna lie i was skeptical about rage 2 but im so dam happy i got it i fucking love it the maps rooms look dead like pics hanging hey man there is one youtuber and his name is benky he stoled your nocomentary videos and monetized them in the future only lesbians and a few guys will exist lol what a crap game whats up with the rage games lately rage 1 used to have the same problem where the ppl just stoped talking at the end but you see the texts the most generic sci fi i have ever seen what happened watched about 10 min not exactly exciting gameplay unoriginal and overdone if there is any freeroam game like this one and you are in first person it means there will be no first person for the cars is it just me or does the male ranger sound familiar i love how this is convined with mad max the game aaaand call of duty black ops iii i just love it a freeroam with futuristic guns and aliens and scavengers as well did you enjoy the game dude the story is sooo weak even when it starts feels like a micheal bay movie wtf the character are so flat and bland and killed off so fast yet they dont show any emotions to any of their family members or friends dyeing wtf oh no my mom died 10 seconds later yo ghost mom thanks for the op powers fuck you bleh thanks damn i love this game i am an orphan i dont have a motherno mention of dad i am sure if the female character was chosen the script wont change to i am an orphan i dont have a dad and trained by his father the drill sergeant and guess what who is the bad guy the man poopifying the brains of the gullible made a huge mistake buying the console wanna grow my kids up in the right state of mind dajjal is here nice channel im trying to start a gaming channel nocommentary like your but in portuguesebrasilian like cheears to you the art resources seem incredibly thin in the intro section i didnt watch until the sandbox open world wasteland but sheesh consider how richly populated with detailed items the interior rooms of uac facility at the beginning of doom 2016 were still interested in this game need to look further edit skipped ahead much much better in the open world back on track to purchasing the game the riva tuner program not working i think the game not supported yet what an awful game stupid ai enemy game like ghost recon wildland is smart ai enemy that can adopt environment and cover so its doom borderlands the fun bits 15344 that whole scene was justwwas justno just nope uh uh nada an absolute gunshots marshall reminds me of kratos old version from the new norse now i that i think bout it kratos broke the 4th wallwhen meeting the stranger think no one was behind him and the kid was hiding and the cam is where he was facing and they might take the god of war all throughout the different pantheons till there arent any gods to screw with him holy eff the campaign is short full of a garbage what the actual fuck is this game man am i the only one watching this and feeling how blah everything is it seems like theyre just yadayadaing all the lore and using absolutely no emotion to convey any of it looks like the same engine that made doom 2016 either way its awesome seems like shit but thanks for sharing i made a cool commentary in my head when ranger jersey died he died with a dumb name omfg sam sam is the voice actor for male rhwjsidbdbe i am 1 minute and 56 seconds in and general cross is moving faster than sonic as the flash towards the cliche catagory he is basically a lich who lives on modron as in the plane modron if ya got that joke you are one hell of a critter d just wanted to pop in and say thank you for not clogging our ear holes with 90 percent bullshit commentary like most other youtubers this game suffers from bad textures and terrible shadows this is the worst plot ive ever seen ill drop a like but im now watcning this game guys please someone explain to meim playing this on ultra and 1080 toobut why my game looks like ultra low and anti aliasing like offits so annoying for mei love rage and cant wait to play this but now im diyng inside becuz of this anyone knows nobody absolutely not a single soul id software what if doom and borderlands had sex why this game is so gayish this game has made it so bethesda can keep making fallout i am both extatic and disappointed as other companies usually do it better another game ruined by sjw and feminist pandering why are all the good soldiers female and why are they all so ugly rage 1 was famous for having sexy female characters but once again sjws forced a studio to make them ugly just like mortal kombat just like tomb raider etc too flashy stopped watching after 935 possibly more fun than far cry new dawn for sure i remember the old rage got to choose 1 out of 3 classes so our brave hero bravely robs the armor off a ranger corpse so much for moral high ground half the videos u making are high gameplays honestly if this was a movie i would call it a b rated one cause the actors do not sound believable at all man like if you look closely the words not even matching up to their mouth movements and its just like some parts of the game seemi dont kno cheap like the sound quality and action part its so weird am i the only one that thinks this looks like cyberpunk2077 abit graphics wise the game look unpolished ok if general cross time travel in this game then where is general cortez i remember beating rage so long agoi hardly remember much but it was such a good gameending had me fucked up why does everything sound like clickety clanky hiss whirr tick tick tick cool game looks like less fun doom for me i will wait with my muns for doom eternal 1501 wtf happened there d the female character option gets utterly destroyed by a door absolutely no one stopped to check if she survived they gave no fucks and i was just sat here thinking you gonna check her you legit just finished having a conversation and seemed to know eachother no ok then lol make it ultra you are computer can work this game easy it would bad when very fasy work ace gameplay makin it look easynice meh far cry is better this is the most hipsterlooking post apocalypse ive ever seen that spaz hand looks so annoying when playing oh mani am playing after days gonemy first thought rage 2 graphics is shit completely different game and game engine than in first rage resulted in subpar student like video game verdict suck balls people who compared this game to doom are insane this game looks good and thats it its the same sound actor of hitman right there is a lot of doom 2016 in there and thats the way you fucking do it i dont get all the talking about boring ppl just love to complain about everything they used the wrong name the hell pretty sure it should have been nicholas cage who thwarts plans im not impressed not at all over feeling mediocre this game looks like well it looks bad the first one was good this sims like a pure money grab 3648 tot i saw icecream guy what is this video fukin ad simulator legend has it that hes still trying to get to the courtyard respect my authority any one else notice at 1503 how quick the background turned from smokey destruction to sun rise not so bad ruins putting tutorials in the middle of gunfights over and over woahhhhhh nice graphics its basically shooting and alternate fire of doom vehicle play like mad max blow stuff up and cause chaos like just cause humor of borderlands objectives and side quests like far cry its a great game why do they think that the half shaved head is a good design choice why do they ever think that stick hand into strange hole rage 2 is quake 5 i think rain was in the same arc walkers parents were in dude sorry to say but your gaming skills are pathetic i have never even heard of this game do i need to play rage 1 before 2 too many cut scenes and talking to npcs then driving on top of that its gona be 10 action was up for this too lol use dash to move out of the way of the slow moving rocket that you could have walked away from lol so many popups wow this game is bad the recorded message prowley left you said you are last ranger when he wasnt even a ranger he stole the ranger suit in the battle after this was recorded where you already using driver version 43064 when recording this i am asking because you are also having all the nice visual bugs i am experiencing with this driver looks good snd fun but reviews says that history is 6 hours long and the controls of the vehicles are very mediocre payday today looks like i want getting today too much pink color not serious game its so frustrating watching you play they actually managed to make mutant bash tv bad it was so awesome in the original that woman has no quality to pretend the character would fit as a post apocalyptic tv show host the original was a kinda crazy recluse hidden somewhere off the highway and hosting mutant killing show wtf is up with the human centipede what audience are they catering to why do they show the character clenching their fist when interacting with object i dont remember the originals world showing there is the force where did the telekinesis come from this is so bad its like they dont know what they worked on this is more crysis 2 but worse than a rage sequel ffs whats up with cars having talking ais the suit being upgraded constantly why make it finally open world if the distance between settlements is still fairly small and there are still plenty of places that cant be explored because youd fall from too much height people imagined what it would be like to actually be allowed to explore the original world this was supposed to allow for that to happen but instead we get just a bit more space in the sandbox they fixed all the engine problems in the original but lost everything that made it good the atmosphere is gone the interesting characters are gone the hero keeps talking about his adoptive mother who was also his military superior the muties look worse and its not a compliment and the settlers look sjw that id want to be their enemy this game stank my god this games looks amazing i remember playing rage in 2010 and i never thought a sequel would be born general cross is one decidedly nasty individual great game sequel though thanks for a great video misses obvious chest now i remember why i was enraged with one of the other playthroughs this game reminds me of mad max and sunset overdrive awesome mad max doom mash up walkthrough done now upload rage 2 i wanna see it before i buy it 12810 are you fucking kidding why make the mercs fight through the muties if you could just sent them straigh to the turbines room from your elevator all those prompts omg is this a 2002 game i hope you can remove them in hud options why does this instantly remind me of that mad max game is it the same game engine or something edit it is avalanche apex engine so yes updated but the same game engine overall i love how mk just hovers on the grenade deflect perk before acknowledging that hes just going to fuck up the timing on every attempt and so he gets a different perk instead thank god they bit that dudes head off he was fucking annnoying so much for ranger jersey asshole characters basically a doom engine game with a crap story fun for a weekend grab it when its cheap this game i dont know why doesnt attract me as much as i hoped the main character is irritatingly peppy the ui in this game looks similar to doom wen your only objective is to open chest mk walks away do yall get this resistance vibe it seemed like human army soldiers being attacked by mutant monsters invading in this beginning part and enemy cyborg zombies looked so horrifying i dont give a fuck what they saying about this game im going to play it untill the end this game feels like it was made in 2015 and that they have relied heavily on the design of mad max not impressed overall oh only 25 advertisements oh what a game what a bad game is it just me or does the phoenix car sound like a female claptrap thank you for this video so i can see i cant be bothered with this shitfest of a game my eyes hurt even from watching this in small window doom eternal but not doom eternal basically i realized the male character has a voice actor same as the amazing spiderman games thisreally isnt that good thanks you mkiceandfire for the video on days gone enjoyed it and will be looking forward to rage 2 looks insane cant wait to play it game is boring at 10134 the lady is using the ipad or ragepad upside down heh like a futuristic mad max cool do you or anyone experience stutteringlag when driving around in the game 1452 our main character is not a fullfledged ranger he is a wannabe ranger all he did is pick up the ranger gear from a dead ranger people who want to become rangers need to go through initiation first or does that mean any random person out of nowhere will just consider themselves as rangers 1532 is that lee the graphics dont look like much of an upgrade from 1 holy shit i remember the original one back then glad it has a sequel lip sync with npcs needs some work the voice of the guy in the beginning sounds like uptimus prime from transformers dialogue looks a bit dull and the map doesnt look very fun you forgot so many itens inside the arks omg ooh was wondering if you were going to tackle this game keep bringing the goodness mk 1501 i cant get her facial spasm out of my head now its haunting me one thing that bethesda can really do is a good soundtrack missed stuff inside arks loved the first rage this one looks better 21352 why not collect all containers so a huge no sale for me its over hyped flashy junk it will be good for people who do not see there is no qluality at all with this shallow game another bethesda shit cash grab no one should buy this game wow this video game is fantastic im not impressed by the graphics rage 2 not a creative bone in its body nore a bone of its source material looks like a less imaginative crisis 2 with no shits given about its source material meets call of duty intro what gpu do you use reminds me of bulletstorm and wonder womanlady azura is the voice of the car sweet i dont know how but they managed to make a worse rage this ps4 ive only watched 10min of the vid are those obvious audio issues when the characters get their intros there are subtitles but nobody is talking is that consistent thru the game lily is a snack just love the graphics of the game this is goooddd this game looks like cyberpunk2077 slow ammo slow movement etc wii music turns on in the background that nigga fucking died wow why are so many people in this game suicidal have long range weapons and explosives run right up to the enemies it not rage i known anymore it destiny like bullshit bethesda this gonna be a long game bethesda style i was expecting this game but honestly boring i get a doom vibe from this game i pre oderd this game look like a sci fi movie hope it does well is it me or do half of the enemies remind you of quake 2 10242 fezzik im on the brute squad miracle maker you are the brute squad at least thats what that reminded me of for those of you who havent seen princess bride go watch it or the dread pirate roberts will come for you hmmwerent the authorities humans thats what i remember from the last game you standing next to that ark chest and not opening it is making go crazy what is your config 1080ti is enough nice gameplay almost as always mhymm rage 1 was bad in every aspect this is even nice fights are made in doom style weapons also but will there be enough good story to call this game good also few bugs are there bruh the beginning shot looks like the teaser trailer for starfield think about it those first scene with the ranger was so awesome until they dropped a hot steaming pot of reality on him wow another flop good job bethesda you fooled people into thinking you made a good game again trust me after one or two sessions of playing this game you will quickly see through the repetitive slog this game becomes it stops being fun and starts being a chore all the while you have to listen to ghastly uninspired cringeworthy levels of dialogue and bad writing my man mk with another much appreciated bruh this game is a beauty god this looks so generic and boring its such a clich can i play this with laptop ryzen 3 vega 3 i see ace combat 7 isnt able to run in ryzen 3 but when i play it lower it to 600p with high texture and the rest is medium my laptop can reach 3040 fps so the guy or gal you dont choose at the very beginning immediately dies lel man i love this game even tho i rage 2 okay ill shut up this looks better than the first one i want this game when it comes out nice game this the game ive been waiting for rage one was a classic we need the doom guy on this game so fast apophis is a real meteor that is coming within the orbit of earth in 2029 surprised me within the first seconds of the game heard the game is 45 hours long is it true the voice acting is horrible no one ever chooses to play as a girl in the few youtube walkthroughs lol thx mk i know what im going to do for next two and half hour looks like the first person shooter game i have been asking for shooting crazy shit the game anyone see lilys face at 1501 hahaha oo will a plague tale innocence be played i really love the game but the scene transitions and the voice actor is not that good hey mkiceandfire good luck with this game if it becomes a series ma man go play plague tale innocence like ifvoyu want mk to play it mad max first person not intresting early it has been years but what was the plot of the first rage game since i stopped caring about it awesome video keep up the good work and keep them coming is that sam rigel i hear ill wait for the next doom seventh finally its here rage 2 awesome the guy from the thumbnail looks like james charles edit i dont really care if its a girl because i just came here to let you know that thats a james right there this game looks awesome thanks to bethesda for providing me with this early copy if you enjoyed the video please leave a like subscribe or share with your friends it really means a lot you can also follow me on twitter httpstwittercommkiceandfiremk to me the best game of the year a classic with a quake 3 pray mad max feel what else do you want more lol the start sounds like corporate bethesda while they made all those choices for fallout 76 hahahaha thanks for the game vid mkiceandfire cool color schemes thats crappy didnt get to know what happened to walker started this today this game is like mad max but futuristic i finished today the gunplay looks good but this is not a rage game the music the towns the weapons general cross was supposed to be someone scary and cunning instead hes revealed to be a cartoon villain so disappointing omg can you turn off those stupid purple roadarrows link for download this is one of very few games that i just did not have much fun playingit was fun when i startedbut then i just got bored youve got the same gun for the whole video thats disappointing also i hear its not worth 60 but steam sale is at 40 and im still debating what do you think worth 40 killing as a joy joy in killing that shouldnt be like that this hero is a psychopath why gamers do always the same lately with those retarded dialogs he should fight for surviving not to get a boner kids will probably play this and this will mark killing joy fuck game business is getting worse and worse where are the heroes from the past the ethical and moral superheroes where they fight for their freedom brothers etc and not joy killing for killing bethesda you are becoming assholes after fallout you already showed it to us this looks basically like an open world doom 2016 even the soundtrack is similar i like it though masterfully played thank you subbed i dont get the hate people calling this game repetitive strikes me as complaining about all the flying they have to do in a flight sim its an id game id finds one gameplay loop then polishes the hell out of it sometimes literally if you dont know what youre getting with an id game thats on you not them you dont sue mcdonalds when you order a burger and dont get fish it has that doom 2016 feel to it look i know your trying to make money but do you have to put so many commercials in your vids it sucks to have to skip thru so many when watching your awesome vids just a little advice might not want to do that in future vids might ake someone not watch the next one something to think about thanx for reading yow that descent at 42637 shouldve cracked the rear axle of the chazcarsp like an egg this is just fallout 4s nuka world gone horribly horribly wrong been watching your gameplays for years hate hearing awkward guys and girls try and be funny with there awkward commentary so i appreciate your gameplay your an above average player but a below average driver lol i watched the whole thing gave you a thumbs up of course but the game itself sucked the first one was much better in terms of story lines and overall scenary variety what was the story of this one a tyrant trying to conquerenslave the world nothing new here hopefully the next one will be better the vehicle war reminds me of a very very old game called interstate 76 i wonder if anyone else have played it heres to hoping you do all the side quests and whatnot general cross sounds like the didact interesting cricket from fallout 4 is now gulo if thats the villain of this game on the beginning that is probably one of the most cookie cutter generic excuses for a villain ever in gaming this game have easter egg like that gun have the cod ghost skull why play this when you can play doom where is the original character from rage nicholas raine okay so if walker can put on jerseys armor after he got torn apart why couldnt lily put on her moms armor when she just had a blade through the gut why cant you both be the only rangers left let that girl carry on her moms badass legacy bethesda publishing increasingly shit games until they morph into ea rage 1 wasnt an amazing game but it had a certain charm to it that feels missing in this one see i cant get in a car with someone whos able to run themselves over youre so bad at shooters i cant wait to play this reminds me alot of bulletstorm can i play this game ps4 game needs like a broader loot system like armors and stuff for your characters as well as full character customization and base building that would of been cool hate those feminist shaved hair normally when i stick my hand into strange holes i get chased by angry boyfriends the game is already discounted how can it be so short 8 missions and the campaign ends please improve more hey mk there is a game thats finally showed some progress of coming out its called code vein from what ive seen it seems like fun im just wrapping this comment here because i want to try and see if i can help the game become more known how is that diff from rage 1 any night time or ancient city exploring rage 1 location is awesomeyou can see the apocalyptic modern city 841 only the main history ice fire you nah play nice game this game was meh same old post apocalyptic tropes like mad max which weve already seen a lot in boderlands with a bulletstom gunplay and the shallow ubisoft open world formula just wait for the price drop how was the game imagine if there were an alternate campaign where you play a soldier in the ranks of the authority and rise up the chainofcommand as you gradually conquer the planet not so cool as rage 1 sorry i ask my self where nicholas reign is from rage 1 who has rage 1 first can i drive a human if thats game play action the enemy ai doesnt seem too great that said id prob still buy it rage 2 the sequel no one asked for until ya bitch this shows off rage 2 will be badass the first was one of my fav games of all time i reckon this one will be just as good if not better it was good because of id software preordered the delux edition lastnight so all i need to do is wait 3 months wow this looks like so much fun thank you for doing a sequel the first rage was seriously underrated wonder if therell be ark raiding oh id what would bethesda do without you coming out in 2019 may 14 looks playable but doesnt knock my socks off to be honest you know when id software said its a game engine footage it is game engine footage is this out yet it does not look very much better not release the game bathesdahasballs my second most favorite company ladies and gentlemen so lets see crysisdoombulletstormmadmaxrage 2 oo this trailer confused me but not in the bad way but in the wow this is unique way looks like the ai of the enemies is as dumb as a pile of shit they almost always missshot the player at best but most of the time just running back and forth or doing nothing at all its not a new elder scrolls im disappointed the fov in this game is giving me a headache please give every version of this game an fov slider at launch so little standards now a days i can not wait to play this game this isnt getting enough love all i can think of is an open world and more scifi looking bulletstorm wierd this looks lit cant wait hope this has a really hard difficulty setting im not sure if its just me but those textures dont look the best perhaps its the environment losing its megatexture charm from rage 1 i mean there wont be texture pop in issues but something just seems off in this trailer it is alpha of course however also detail shadows have the draw distance of about 20 feet by the looks of it ya this game is going to suck howcome the bad guys dont move this whole game is frosting a bite of frosting is fun a plate of frosting is boring rage 1 was terrible this look like a lot of fun first game was better at least it had its own identity the ai was the best still the best imo and now they turned it into doomcrysis game no ai whatsoever enemy shoot the sky i remember i picked up the original rage when i saw it on breaking bad a while back i got really into it and then to realise that my disc was damaged and i couldnt progress any further currently downloading the original one this game looks amazing more than any other bathesda game for me cant wait oh what a day what a lovely day im here for fallout but i may try this out but just cause 4 is coming out so many games hell yeah lemmie at em i liked the original game a lot the voice acting was weak and felt phoned in i did hate that but if im honest this 20 version of rage comes off looking like a dressed up version of bulletstorm on wheels unless i hear its mind shatteringly amazing from someone i trust ill be waiting for the bargain bin edition this demo is not hiking up my skirts looks dope like a mashup of rage and crysis super hyped for this cyberpunk 2077 and doom eternal never thought id be looking forward to rage 2 more than a fallout game im a single player kinda guy this game is looking absolutely incredible i never played rage 1 but i can already tell i am gonna love the hell out of this game i love story based fps games with lots of skills especially skills that are movement based and this game nails that from what i can see with so many combos i can see myself playing this for hours just doing sidequests and exploring the world it reminds me of the borderlands series which is one of my favorite fps game series of all time i cannot wait for this to come out d copy of doom the game looks awesome but their marketing campaign does not im afraid this will be yet another underrated game still gonna preorder though iam curiosu that do they will use the opengl doom but in the apocalypse xd bulletstorm mad max borderlandsdoomthis looking forward crowbcats video please add a wedgies kill move on rage2 hyped doom demon invasion in progress rage 2 thats cute the guy doing the voice over sounds like a poosy i dont care what the heck anyone says rage was a great game im very happy we have a sequel and cant wait to buy it so many assets from mad max and then oh wait avalanche studios sorry bethesda but i wont be hyped for this game anytime soon after the way you handled the first rage game borderlandsbulletstorm nothing new voiced protagonist is a bonus add fuck loads of dialogue looks promising so far much better than the first my only advice is more destruction thats the specialty of avalance studios right also smart ai is what will sell this game along with dynamic animations goty please no battle royale well if it is anything like fallout 4 it wont be any funafter reaching level 60 on survival mode because i wanted a challenge in fallout 4 i have a good understanding of what went wrong they took everything that was great about fallout 1 2 3 new vegas and removed it from the game and replaced it with tedious monotonous grinding and player trollingthey couldnt be bothered to add the simple companion ai where in fallout 3 you could tell your companion to back off and let me explore the worldthey couldnt be bothered to take the survival mode in fallout new vegas and simply add it to the gameno they had to remove the save game feature which makes the game painful to play in survival mode where save is limited to sleeping but without the added weight and food restrictions it just wasnt any fun after i played new vegas on survival mode and now ive gotten to the point where ive dismissed codsworth and refuse to travel with a companion because they get in the w i love the scream at the giant right before the end its like destiny on steroids 80 of youtubers have better transititons whos your editor looks fucking horrible the pop in feels like im playing an average ps4 game starting 142 for example seen when landscapes are in view they could improve that on release right update its pre alpha hopefully the improvements big on release why are the bandits here so slow unresponsive and innacurate in rage 1 i remember them having some grit and the player not being able to effortlessly slaughter them like this now theyre nothing but weak ass worms i hope the game as coop dont care about a pvp multiplayer but would love to play this with friends in coop even if its only 2 players fuck this looks fucking awesome wow the average age here must be really young if many people have never heard of or played rage 1 from 2011 s too much color too much saturation too much shake too much noise stimuli overloaded obnoxious tiring powers gameplay mimics mass effect andromeda i guess is not for everyone rage was not super futeristic this is a mixe of doom and call of duty no no no what happened this is not the rage i know i was super hyped then i saw spring 2019 i heard this game will be a single player only no multiplayer the reason is rage 2 world is so damn big loving the campiness of the game the first rage was a fine game but it took itself too seriously despite how silly the game world was the authority is the most generic possible name for an abstract faceless group of antagonists this game seems more colorful and willing to embrace its fun crazy side hopefully the game is good and actually has a decent pc port at launch will rage 2 have an fov slider on all platforms the fov presented in this demo is uncomfortably narrow s omg im so excited by this game day one for me looks playable i will buy it the fallout 76 we never got so basically bulletstorm x borderlands x doom cool will check it out after release its like mad max and robocop had a future baby will it too have a legendarily farkedup texture popping system finally we killing antifa omg this is amazing combination of doom like shooting fun with the awesomeness of mad maxs road havoc thank you andrew wk the apocalypse rage 2 im in who makes these decisions about trying to bring back some 80s style im sick of it a lot happens in this trailer but i dont see why i should play this game it has much more style to it than the last game but still dont find it appealing borderlands by bethesda d my two most favourite things in the world so basically from what ive researched rage 2 is a total conversion mod for just cuause 4 lol bethesda slapped id in the face and took rage from them and gave it to avalanche studios and asked them to keep the main story and weapons but go wild with it using the just cause 4 apex engine if you see great driving cars thats why they just took the just cause driving code and used it with different car models in rage 2 rage 2 is just cause 4 skinned differently and with a first person perspective added so that its not third person like just cause not sure if thats a bad thing but i can already see lots of mechanics feeling similar between the 2 games the first one had style but lacked fidelity this ones seems to have better fidelity but less style when am i supposed to play this between fallout 76 the last of us 2 halo infinite and gears 5 not to mention if nintendo announces animal crossing for the switch forget about it too many good games my dudes when i saw avalanche studios i was sold on this holy fuck i dont care about open world games anymore im tired of wasting 50 hours wandering around repeating the same bland content over and over leavefalloutoffline remember how the first one ended this is a stroke of genius on bethesdas part to bring back a cult classic in between 2 massively popular aaa sequels this is why bethesda is king around e3 looks fabulous i am a big fan of the original rage love the andrew wk song at the end lol mad max and doom in one gamefucking sold okay this looks fucking amazing im going to be so broke its soooo many gamesss first falloutthen doomthen starfieldthen tes 6now this bethesda busting the corporate nut this shouldve gone under a different namethis isnt rage but it sure does look good whats with all the weird cyber punk shit kinda ruins the whole game for me loved the first one second one makes me wanna sleep til release this actually looks fucking dope the guy who edited this trailer needs to be promoted asap hell give him his own company and lets not even talk about the devs id software is amazing seems nothing like the original game is it just me ok i love the apocalyptic dilapidated city vibe from the first game but the restrictions of old gen consoles made it hard to pull off properly but rage still remains one of my favorite games now that this one is coming out i have hope that they will fix all the little things that made the first game less enjoyable than it could have been im excited but please calm yourselves bethesda between this fallout 76 the new doom and tes6 i will be broke by 2020 sigh i love the look of this game but this protagonist is kind of turning me off i been waiting so loooooong i cant wait first game was ahead of its time and tried to hard to pack in 4k textures and texture streaming when people didnt have 4k monitors or ssds fast enough to stream texture data leading to bad popin and some upclose textures looked really grainy because of how they limited how detailed close textures could be also the gameplay had a lot of ideas that werent fully fleshed out the best parts were the rail shooter sections but the driving sections could have used work and the game came out a whole 2 years after borderlands loading times were a little weak also came out the same year as duke nukem forever and skyrim so lots of competition and i think people were too burned from duke nukem to want to play another apocalyptic shooter and just waited for the recently announced borderlands 2 this time however no borderlands for 5 years mad max was 4 years ago this type of game is long overdue bethesdaid just off the high of doom fallout 4 skyrim reveal technolo the authority you mean after all this time hhh and stephanie mcmahon are still in charge figures khajiit confirmed so all enemies have mohawks lol dont get jour hopes up though it is e3 rage is one of the most underrated games of all time i thought this day would never come mad max saints row edition please increase the field of view then it will be perfect i loved the first rage so much this looks incredible this actually looks kinda boring could you guys make first person driving a part of the game pls nobody does explosions like avalanche thought this was a driving game like twisted metal great choice with all the andrew wk music my pc will not run dis is the doktor the same from metal gear revengeance the end of rage 1 was really dumb and weird it looks like a mix of the old rage mad max and bulletstorm not sure about this one andrews performance wasnt that good so the guys who published doom and the team that made mad max decided to make borderlands thats cool not coming to nintendo switch even though it can looks like a fun game but i like my postapocalypse bleak and strange i hope it delivers doombulletstormmad maxrage 2 boring you have no idea how bad i want this to be good this game has charm this is my new fallout since fallout got wrecked by worthless pvp btches love cannons looks great for as short and unspectacular as the reception of the first game was i thought it was a great proofofconcept for a full game not to mention some of the most satisfying gunfeel different from gunplay in any game to date im glad they have the stones to do it up proper as it seems from this i get a bulletstorm vibe from those combos d am i the only one who is in love with the talking head d this is the first collectors edition i am getting the hype is real i m r e a d y t o d i e this feels like a old shooter like doom and quake but it looks to have also an amazing explorable open world avalanche studios just rage 2 the max that build up in the beginning was intense did i yell rage at my screen yes yes of course i did does this remind anyone of bulletstorm looks epic i like that its someone who is used to the wasteland instead of someone in hybernation or in a bunker extremely generic this definitely looks cool but i feel like ive seen just about everything in this trailer before in other games obviously borderlands mad max some of the main characters abilities looks like something from bioshock then off course fallout if we didnt already have a new fallout coming out before this then this could fill that fallout void i may play this game but when the price comes down jesus the shooting feels fucking good if fallout cyberpunk mad max borderlands doom had a fivesome this would be the result holy fuck the gunplay and ragdoll physics and graphics everything looks fucking dope im allready sold holy fuck its so epic this guy is a ranger or he is the doom slayer fuck anthem looks really generic its a pretty game but looks like fisherprice difficulty maybe the mp will make things better combat seems a bit too arcadey for game set in a wasteland the player should have to be more careful and conserve supplies if the gameplay matched the setting i would be happy i can play this game without any hud elements as this video shows as gameplay footage in far cry i could choose which element from the hud is being displayed or not i had only one hud element visible there but i am happy with a full removal either im ready to die okay ability shooter it certainly looks more interesting than the first game though from the first viewing i am a little worried that the bodies look a bit floaty when they die from rifle fire but well see how they refine the physics as the game develops more i hope they add some crazy weapons like fallout did seriously why has everything to be punkedupsuperheromayhem these days i dont get it i loved the original rage and avalanches mad max game and was hoping for similar vibes a gritty and deeply immersive postapocalyptic survival shooter but this looks more like a borderlands freeforall just with punk vibes instead of the cartoonish graphics pass this game is the love child among fallout bethesda doom id software and mad max avalanche studios this is gonna be awesome really enjoyed the first one glad its back looks like a helluva lot of fun i love it when trailers are like this does what it says on the tin this game is only single player more complete than rage 1 at this stage lol sweet i love you bethesda its looks exactly like fucking bulletstorm even the new doom had many elements from it i guess nobody compared it to bulletstorm because of different aesthetics this on the other hand looks like a carbon copy from bulletstorm so glad i started working in april this looks good as fuck my god yes this is exactly what ive been begging for for all these years mad max borderlands fallout doom im fucking sold looks like doom and borderlands fucked and had a baby can we get this for switch instead i feel like rage 2 is going to be battleborned to fallout 76 killed off almost immediately by a better game in the same genre was worried there wouldnt be any ads but now i am more excited for this than fallout 76 its like bulletstorm with crystal meth xd cool except ai seems to be dumb as hell hope you played it on rookie level this looks like the lovechild of doom fallout and mad max i love it lol the narrator sounds like hillary clinton ok but is the mutant arena show back for some reason there seems to be a lot of people who think this looks stupid andor not good i cant imagine what its like to wake up every day with that sort of mentality about things i feel like its trying to mimic the action chess of doom but doesnt have the flexibility and maneuverability of doom to execute it heck yeah the way you can combine different traversal and combat abilities looks like a lot of fun also its got a good slide and a good shotgun check and check looking forward to this my kinda party the parties i usually attend only has body counts in the single digits boring aaaahhhhh i cant frigging wait ok this looks way better than in the trailer but plz remove the ironsights your action is fast paced so stop giving us features that tells us to slow down this looks like hl2 gameplay on crack include ways to keep the momentum from the double jumps and dash this really has potential dont fuck it up is this a clone of doom looks like a good game to buy next summer for 10 bucks ive decided to quit my job and play games instead as how else can i play them all kinda like doom but colorful haha where is the blood so much rage d bulletstorm things detected feels very basic this is giving me vibes of suicide squad and i dont like it may get it if its single player only with no smell of coop or mp feels like a borderlands wannabe though are we still gonna have to fight the authority like from rage 1 dont like the modernlooking assault rifles and generic white 30something grizzled grudgebearing absolutely typical soldier type 314f but the combobased firstperson combat has always been my style which is why i loved doom so much combobased freemovement combat is always the best way to go its really the only way the player can express themselves properly in the game this is what the first rage should have been like it was ok though i hope enemies will give us some challenge anyway waiting to get my hands on it looks lot farcry with more fun michael bay studios looks great i liked the first rage quite a bit and this looks like it addresses many of the shortcomings that game had seamless open world is a huge plus i need this game now if this has coop im sold 059 that fucker just shot his mate head 427 doom shooting level style locked in a room with enemies until there are no more enemies i just replayed the original in anticipation for this one and im really liking what i see the original is good but i love the extra mobility the player has in this one plus access to special abilities that werent in the original also i hope the ending wont be so abrupt this time the first game ends at feels like should have been the half way point but instead the credits start rolling and youre left going wait youre just going to end it before things got really interesting a male protagonist in 2018 blasphemy been waiting seven years for this looks great like a neon doom i hope the ai is smarter than in this video tho they all seem to be standing targets it looks like doom with a colour blindness filter on it it looks like doom with a colour blindness filter on it ill buy xbox one x for this game xboxonex cant come soon enough this game is going to beat the dick off of fallout minecraft edition or 76 whatever you want to call that shitshow needs better blood spilling and splatter on environments and i think it would be perfect also maybe more active dismemberment when shooting enemies as well rage 2 fallout 76 starfield es6 thats bethesda the last of us ii rdr2 this is going to be fun nobody plays singleplayer anymore i think i am in love please make sure the game doesnt require a patch to be played to the end i like rage always have bought it for ps3 and pc excited for this i really hope the narrator can keep his mouth shut during gameplay the open world is bad enough and was the worst aspect of the first game ill try to overlook the suicide squad aesthetic hopefully the gameplay makes up for all the lame show boating this hypes me up way more than i expected it would doom and just cause had a son not sure this game knows what it wants to be just one more elder scrolls in enother settong 303 that was a clear miss wtf took me a while before i recognized drkvasir this is not believable at all an advanced car of the future can not automatically aim at targets ridiculous and it is not realistic that humans would be necessary for any of such battles robots would do much better and not require people to die also there is no way moon would be torn apart and just stay out there as a collection of large pieces love the madness mad max on steroids yes please give us elder scrolls 6 im just looking forward to blowing stuff up looks like a beautiful game but the ai seems to be a bit underdeveloped you can see enemies walking in your line of fire and dying i hope its just for the trailer otherwise there is no challenge wellthat looks awesome ill take two please game of the year 2019 this reminds me so much of the mad max game and i fucking adore it good cunts looks even shittier than the first one and that was a steaming pile of garbage did they really just name the main character walker very unoriginal but looks great looks like bethesda saw bulletstorm and said you know what we should do something like thatbut with a twist michael you better get ready to continue that rage quit series looks like doom and unreal tournament and mad max es6 please we need a new real first person rpg agean before we die of old age lol fuck meim excited for this i honestly thought it was a racing game at first the thumbnail certainly suggests such sigh alright fanboys go ahead ive already copped shit today for daring to comment on the trailer for elder scrolls 6 i can handle a little more great sound design day one holy shit the color make this game gorgeous hoooooly shiiiit this looks dope been a long time since rage looking forward to this bethesda you the best ill wait for the mod that will mute the pcs voice super dooper cooper exited for this needs more blood and gore its a little toned back someone wanna buy this for me itll be appreciated whoever did this trailer needs to be fired take my money dam looks fun as doom but even faster bring it on little bit cringy but it still looks good please rerelease the first rage game and give it a idtechwhatever iteration its at right now makeover it will get downgraded due console limitations lol nice graphic tho i remember playing the first rage and thinking it was very generic in retrospect and after seeing this i actually miss it nothing says slipshod world that fell off the edge like a gun that could have been ripped straight out of cod also the animations arent even close to the quality of the first game this game turned from oh shit this sucks what the hell happened to oh wow its actually pretty good well played id software is that low tech power armormech suit 622 i want it so satisfying to watch walker huh glad to see the writers really squeezed the creative juices on this project seriously how milktoast is the name gameplay looks fun tho is this on id tech 5 anyone know if this will be coop was the first rage coop either way looks amazing but just wondering glad i have you rage fallout 76 if its not offline solo and just online solo then at least i have you to fill the space this looks amazing this better continue the story from the first rage it doesnt even remotely look anything like the first and anything mentioned in this demo is nothing resembling the first bit disappointed bethesda did he talked to a khajiit get ready to die voice actor sounds like aaron paul i am so excited sweet might give it a try the enemies dont seem very smart the ones at 416 literally walked into your line of fire id this is going to be good reminds me of red faction guerilla so this would be pretty cool on switch gameplay trailer it looks like the gameplay is generic im sold on this one very nice jobim another one that always wished for a sequel to the first game bring it on the enemies look ridiculous the explosions look fake like bright pillowsthey also need more smoke this looks better then anything they have showed today i am both astonished and dissapointed my wallet is gonna fucking implode i saw it already in e3 live it looks like a son of doom and mad max but its absolutely amazing loving those slide combos and getting some extra air off the gravity grenade thing 551 unless its a double jump looked intentional off the grenade though look if they dont fuck it up with the end in this game like the first one its going to be a serious goty contender so mad max cod bulletstorm pass and nintendo switch i look forward to playing that looks like theres around 12 different guns so far 4 the player uses which all have a similar style and its cool that the setteler pistol original shotgun and original rocket launcher are in it all the factions actually look very similar to ones in rage when you look close the cars also look similar and its cool to see returning factions and new types of enemies in them in lack of a borderlands for people saying its too colourful stuff thats colourful is like plants guns cars bandits and grafiti the main stuff like buildings are still bland but it is more colourful ye for people saying its lost seriousness in rage there were bandits with uk flags on their faces jokes and puns sprayed on walls loads of easter eggs explosive rc cars and a mutant killing game show this one already has curled up people crying public exercutions and a city being massacred but i agree the tone is different and im not sure if its good rage 2the new california amazing depiction of a horrible world i hope i never witness lol damn it looks like everyone is aiming for spring 2019 releases im worried that the combat is too over the top and doomy and not rage enough fallout the handsome collection wow this game looks absolutely sick as fuck hella surprised the ground pound gives me crysis vibes they should make an arena shooter with this engine 333 clothes clipping issues in the ass its not a bug its a feature intensifies so many negative comments what the hell this is awesome 116 when the framerate visibly drops oof meh rage 1 still had better enemy and character animations by far who cares bring out fallout 3 remaster what a day what a lovely day youve got my money i loved the first rage the live performance of the trailer song was cringey af btw why does that weapon sound like balls slapping of a girls bum can you fix that please who cares i want fallout 76 i seen a motorcycle so does that mean i can drive it itd be a dream come true if you can cant wait such a poorly edited gameplay trailer the gameplay looks decent tho loved the original still cant believe were getting a sequal really looking forward to what you guys can do it looks cool but mostly excited for fallout 76 wolfenstein 2 is so impressive for such weaker hardware than ps4xbox one who waching the live stream what about a switch version insert you could have been working on a new elder scrolls game rather than working on this comment here sub to my channel peasants cringe i had rage on the ps3 and i completed it i am sooo excited left the stream for this so many games so little money and time cool i got this game its amazing wasnt the bfg 9000 in doom 2016 is bfg 9000 common in bethesda universe the gravity gun looks awesome ive never played this but before i left for work this morning i started the download on the game passid software usually delivers something worthwhile it looks cool this is basicly doom with few extra steps i dont know why but i find it i kind of funny how the gravdart launcher changes the image to firestorm revolver in the arch loooove this game most fun ive had in well not that long really this looks so fun what is this its like playing crysisquakebulletstorm fused together it looks like a pretty cool game though but missing originality and personality looks sweet time to buy it the game doesnt even look hard no challenge at all they got a real gamer to do the video man this guy can play how do u get the bfg 2000 i preordered the game now im trying 2 find the gun the ttk looks way to spongey loved the first rage this looks ten times better got it pre loaded on my xbox one this looks super boring this game looks like doom mixed with borderlands pure fire i am already in love with this gamefeels like in madmax car chase at the same time so many variatioins bloody ell that actually looks excellent seriously welldefined gunplay with excellent abilities it may be a mash up of a variety of games but how it is presented is what matters this is high quality couldnt finish doom to its entirety after playing like 80 of the game i got tired of the run jump and gun mechanics rage 2s game play looks identical to that not sure i will purchase this one i enjoyed all of the recent wolfenstein games much more is that tutorial voice failsafe from destiny 2 you created the engine using mouse and keyboard you coded the game using mouse and keyboard you created the art using mouse and keyboard or penyou tested the game using mouse and keyboard and yet you show the gameplay using controller where is the logic there if there was any game practically begging for coop multiplayer this one is it aimbot for console noobs so this is just shooting npcs i really hope this has a horde mode single player game that requires a bethesdanet account what up with that i cant imagine how an online multiplayer of this game would be soundtrack yo i have 2 points i like to make first point is this dosent seem to look at all to be a rage game that we played and loved it kinda reminds me of a futuristic first person shooter it no longer seems like the old rage now with that said this game looks bad a the game looks very fast paced and on your toes about whats going to be around the corner something i wished there was in the first game even though to me this dosent seem to me like a rage game im 110 going to buy this day one and play the hell out of it and that grvadart gun i can see me getting into all sorts of trouble this will be a very fun game for its style but to me i think they lost the rage look but hey thats my thoughts on it commet on this people i love to hear what yall think just pre ordered this today cant wait till monday release it already i hope the on foot movement in this game is as cool as it looks the gravity shot looks cool here giving this a 2 or 5 on 10 if theyre lucky looks cool just not my type of game just pre ordered this i wont be disappointed ive always loved bethesda but i want to now donate then my left nut for soon releasing this doom eternal and elder scrolls 6 what platform is this footage from well as long as we will get more ammo for the bfg i cant wait i did pre order deluxe edition that bfg though xd none of the game take the place of mad max its seems like that but not that omg 1059 the doom bfg just destroyed that giant mutant game look freakin awesome but im guessing when it comes out it aint gonna look nothing like this another white supremacist basically rage 2 is doom borderland abit cyberpunk about freaking time they made a new one i liked doom but wolfenstein 2 was too boring so i am confused to buy rage 2 or not looks like alot of fun def going to try it out this definitely looks like a blend of bethesda and avalanche and its brilliant this is xbox one x il wait for price down for only 20 game looks amazing cant wait am i the only person on planet earth that enjoyed the first rage i thought it was gonna be like gta on drugs but it really looks like a lot of fun should have an epilepsy warning going on like 10 years with no new innovating game play more mmo based quests kill x of z collect x of y smash x of v ill wait till its 20 if i want to pick it up yeah it looks great graphics wise but that doesnt keep my interest for more than a couple hours i waited 11 minutes to see 1 or better a half shot of the bfg ty for wasting my time wow those colors be careful guys bethesda made this game i honestly cant see anything wrong with this game idk maybe the voice acting and story havent seen much tho doom fallout take my money i hope you can turn the hitmarker off its obnoxious and big love the original rage and this looks like loads of crazy fun this is probably the most generic looking game ive seen since well rage 1 this or days gone this over borderlands any day shouldve just opened that fight with the bfg doom with vehicule outside the hell its really doom ambiance 3 weeks after release we will see yt videos with the title here is why rage 2 is dying please made this one a battle royale either trees too big or people too small kinda doom like really beautiful game to can you use a controler with this the game that no one is interested rage 2 the first one was average as hell this is just another bulletstorm fix fallout and make better games bethesda also the comments are way too positive too positive i prefer the look of rage 1 the graphics on this look to similar to anthem destiny etc will this run 4k 69fps on my nintendo sexyfour way to make fallout look second rate wow its like doom mixed with borderlands looks like a blast that hit kill crosshair mark is a bit overdone i hope it can be toned down or turned off in the game i dont see mega textures technology borderlands 3 masterpiece is gonna destroy rage 2 and doom eternal game in 13 september trust me guys so many looks dope are you 16 years old who talks like that this game deserves bigger support for creativeness and awesome mechanics the voice of main characters sound cheesier and cheesier every year what the hell is nathan drake voice doing in a apocalyptic world this is not rage the game better have a higher difficulty mode clearly this is being played by a bot on the game urinalist difficulty no first person driving no buy notmultiplayer game this game looks great just found out about it can you do combat with random people like strikes in destiny 2 first time watching glad its coming out soon im hooked musthavethis yay it has microtransactions ah so this is what failsafe did before destiny 2 edit 309 just wish ign spent longer then 10 mins before judging a game idk why but it looks like there driving toy cars probably just me though so this is like whats happening on earth while doom marine is in hell its like mad max i dont know if im the only person that notices this but doesnt rage 2 reminds you a lot of borderlands is that you rico i was not expecting this it is not rage wish you could switch to third person if you wanted boring after 5 min digital shelf until doom eternal arrives this and wolfensteins next dlc will sufficeonly for a bit looking absolutely amazing the only thing that is worrying me is the engine its the same engine that powered just cause 4 and we all know how bad optimization was hopefully its better than the first one lmao i will buy this to support these great games instead of ea they should do bulletstorm 2 apex this is just like borderland but much more realistic and its not ea yeeeeaaaaahhh is that failsafe as the computer voice this game is gonna be nice this is how crysis should be makes me think of halo on acid wanna try this game what made rage great was its intense firefights in enclosed spaces from this trailer it would seem the devs have been heavily influenced by bulletstorm which is bizzare because theyre making the sequel to what was already an awesome shooter i mean the gameplay in rage was the best part of the game the only thing that needed improving was the story and interactive elements crafting etc i have never played a rage game before and this looks like doom and mad max what do you guys think of this game its like far cry but on crack this game could have an awesome forge im so hype for this i am going to use the hes on fire guy from nba jam voice over for this the bfg fork doom wow definitely getting doom vibes at that last battle how do you progress level up how or buying perks bioshock vibes tbh i hate when the main character is mutenot that i have anything against them i just like to know what my character is feeling so when i heard him talk i decided to pre order 3 at first this is the closest we were gonna see to borderlands 3 and then xd graphics this borderlands 3 gameplay borderlands 3 this i love how many games id puts the bfg in far better than borderlands 3 what it lookes like 2012 borderlands 2 like an expansion no new things in general and the technique the engine is the same too and not unreal 4 i feel like this game is not gonna be that exciting when people gonna play it just my opinion btw looks like playing this game will definately give you headache hey everyone be sure to join the official rage 2 reddit page for the latest news and updates httpswwwredditcomrragegame whaaattt u can high speed sprint double jump air dash count me in btw this looks just like far cry new dawn with far cry 3 environment i like it that was epic can believe they show the bfg 9000 gameplay of rage 2 looking forward pickup on tuesday may 14th i play first game on xbox 360 and now i going play it on xbox one that was underwhelming the maps reminds me of borderlands the hud reminds me of mass effect the gameplay looks a little cross doomborderlands i think i love this game bulletforce doom rage 2 i hope you can switch off autoaim oo i dont know yet if this game will have pvp or online cooperative mode came to watch bfg not this shitty gameplay this effect of blocky graphics artifacts is rather overused therefore annoying i hope it can be turned off in settings basically it flashes every 5 seconds even if you had no motion sickness before it can be triggered this way so now bethesda has three ips related to the apocalypse fallout rage 2 brink the music it just doesnt fit the epic fights this looks interesting imagine if bethesda used the doom engine to make their games man this game looks awesome want more games done in the doom engine 11 mins of throwing is it me or does the grab dart launcher sounds like quake 2s laser gun i was disappointed with new doom i know im weird but this this actually seems better than original rage and this means it would be the most awesome game ever btw thing i didnt like about doom all combat in open spaces no tactics usable bullet sponges especially bullet sponge bosses things i did like audiovisual effects music gore i hope there will not be too many bulletsponge bosses in rage 2 i really hate them i hate them in all games like far cry 5 otherwise a perfectly nice game when youre over 40 its getting boring shooting the same guy for 15 minutes what is opposite to boring develop tactics to use everything around to your advantage exploring interesting locations locations shown in this demo are awesome its like a mix between masseffect andromeda and just cause 4 it looks like crap with a bunch of special effects sorry bethesda this game will keep me busy for months to come looks awesome except that insane autoaim splat wow new first person mad max looking great bet its gonna be a great game but those giant hit markers must go lol was that last gun the bfg 9000 this game need a frickin dinosaur and im serious i loved the first rage cant wait for this to be out this year we are gonna get rage 2 doom eternal borderlands 3 cyberpunk 2077 halo infinite halo master chief collection niceeeeeeeee work bhetesda these game is d best of d year singelplayer way days gone was a little disappointing with the game feeling broken with all its glitches so im glad that it aint too long a wait for rage 2 shits boring never played rage but this looks amazing can i choose between a male and a female character why are people only talking about cyberpunk and not this its basically open world doom with viechles and super powers this has the same graphics and texture settings as cyberpunk 2077 i dont preorder games and the last special edition game i bought was for halo 3 steel case i placed my preorder the for the deluxe edition this game looks incredible i would prefer the hit markers to only be red when ive killed someone im loving the gameplay for this game you guys at ign didnt use the cheat code im on fire destiny and mad max wheres the part with the bfg 9000 lol why is the car not in first person really hope a lot of the hud elements can be toggled off definitely more blood dragon than rage lot of just cause in there too looks fun but its not going to have the feel of the first game this is a generic garbage aww it doesnt have multiplayer welp its a no buy for me what a wasted opportunity auto aim in car wtf lets not forget the fact that its made by bethesda imagine how insane multiplayer coop would be does this have multiplayer guys and what will it be like cant wait this is just the first person version of just cause 4 so the same apex engine why there would be so much difference between the graphics of these two games what happened to just cause 4 so stoked looks amazing graphics are smooth fast gameplay single player story 3 more weeks but i need it now was the first rage game like this damn imma have to play the first game bc rage 2 looks kinda awesome its only available in the deluxe version some of the best shooting in a game in a while just hope it doesnt flop like anthem holly crap a tank girl reference i have been waiting for this a long time i cant go out drive or anything i had back surgery and this game couldnt be released at a better time for me thanx only problems ive noticed so far is those are the only bosses ive seen in every gameplay video i really hope they just dont reuse the same boss over and over and over plus im not a huge fan of it completely stopping time while switching guns i just loved the doom switching guns thing i really hope they just put that in there or if i can change it that would be awesome switch im not feeling this that much but im also not gonna act like i wouldnt be geeked out over this if i was a kid so any grandmas and grandpas in the comments should know that games are intended for children if you still like games as an adult thats fine but no one wants to see your negativity on wat is it played on xbox or ps4 is there an online or local multiplayer for this game look great and all but its not rage far from it dis game got multiplayer this game looks like its gonna break my computer looks like a dumbass game with crap ai then again there is a huge market for such games this doesnt sound like the same voice actor from the first gameplay trailer kinda blows i like the other guy more especially when he screams when overdrive turns on this looks nothing like rage 1 wheres the western aesthetic and acoustic guitar music etc wheres the atmosphere just running around like youre on steroids this looks nothing like rage 1 on ps4 pro 10 fps xbox x nice a shame it hasnt coop the grav darts look so fun to play with will have to wait and see loved the first game failsafe is that you why hitmarker was skeptical but this made me consider preordering rage 2 look like so far cry new dawn doom guy has entered the chat anthem nascar edition all this random lighting and what not is gonna cause major fps drop even in the best of rigs i imagine this game to be dumbed down alot for consoles and is gonna have major optimization issues for pc the player voice is the same from the amazing spider man games1and 2 this video just made me want to buy it great gameplay why did they change voice actor from aaron paul though he sounded wa cooler this guy sounds like a highschool math teacher i wish they had classical multiplayer deathmatches we dont seem to have any great or original fps multiplayer games these days this would be epic cant wait to see the downgraded version played it like a boss hope its not repetitive is the character in the matrix or animus why did they ruin the game play with those pixelated effects other then that it looks fun but those screen effects are horrible this is the gaming equivalent of puberty done right doom mad max bulletstorm wolfenstein far cry so many vibes from this game this game is amazing this has lost almost all of what made rage rage tbh it just looks like a completely different ip tbh still no stealth gameplay i like that they let you simulate the weapons 3 i know this is gonna be a great game the ai doesnt seem to challenging or is it just meother then that this looks epic now this is what i am waiting for a game with the doom feel its just getting better and better looking by the day id and avalanche together ummm yes really 1100 first signs of seeing it click bait much jeez 412 did he just melee a grenade back at the enemy dammit i can only buy so many games on release chill tryna bankrupt me this is the next game that im hyped for love the style love the game play i cant wait to install it on my pcs for some reason i was thinking this was going to be an online only title no clue why but seeing this i might give it a shot rage was fun just didnt have much of a story wow another first person shooter yawns zzzzzzzzzzzzz becoming stale and poor now its no secret i am playing mercenaries 1 and 2 for the xbox original right now and having much more fun that any of this new rubbish the next gen has killed gaming forever because its all boring and stale omfg cant wait wishlist fot sure ill play this game bye destiny and anthem hello rage 2 is that motherfucking sam riegal so crysis and doom have a baby nooo i preorder rage two but why is it so green if its the apocalypse the first rage is more realistic and baron theres just way to much green cool so this is like borderlands x anthem the graphics look insane 609 people clearly dont like to have fun trash 20 the guns feel weak reminds me so much of far cry borderlands doom and bulletstorm im going to support id by buying this game it feels so empty crysis 3 on crack and steroids looks great but just concern will it be challenging at all this gameplay looks like it was played on easy mode im throwing money at the screen but nothing is happening i need rage 2 this game looks cool but it has the bethesda name on it so i will not buy it i wouldnt have even called this rage 2 sick would have been way more fitting im really enjoying the new style of the weapons not just mechanically but visually as well like the redesigned assault rifle in the last rage it was just a slightly altered ak type design which wasnt a bad weapon but that style in the postapocalyptic setting has pretty much been done to death at this point but now all of your equipment looks like it was designed specifically to work together with your nanotrite enhancements also this game will do an excellent job of keeping me happily occupied until doom eternal releases cant wait to play this looks like so much fun this this is just not rage any more what have they done i want same style that was in first one this is just mess i like the environment but that suit and enemies on hell no seems really bad this game dont deserve to be named rage 2 this video has 4k60fps yet its clearly running at 1080p60fps this the xbox version aint it 2019 must be the year of gaming cause oooweee man this game looks amazing as well as sekiro cyberpunk days gone last of us 2 halo infinite gears 5 mk11 man the list just goes on and on it looks like im finally going to have to get a system again why the graphics are so bad it literally looks like modded rage 1 but is it multiplayer i prefer the more cartoonish artstyle bfg showcase starts at 1059 too mainstream gotta have that dig dug reference soare they playing this on pc with a controller i know the consoles wont be running at 60 whos up for a spot of ultraviolence rage takes place in the doom universe then borderlands with better graphics i like it is there going to be coop mode gave the video a like but its not for you ign 99 sure this isnt what the final game will look like 1 really wants a games company to actually release something truthful and playable we will see if it works out rage 1 is incredible rage 2 doom total fail ive never played a rage before but this has me hipe id always polish their games because this game rage 2 looks so polished boring as f i cant wait to play this game as a person who has played the first one over atleast 30 times im absolutely excited very impressed keeping a close eye on this that pulling mechanics are insane imagine the posibilities the driving looks floaty andconcerning its like a jungle free roam mode for doom so they completely ditched the original rage gameplay and turned it into doom the combat looks far too easy the abilities are way op and the ability to simply spawn vehicles just takes away any immersion a shame since the game looked to have a lot of potential i really enjoyed rage and i was honestly hoping for the same post apocalyptic vibe but ima still try it shut up and take my money the bfg 9000 1050 vehicle nanotrite repairs nice to have this gameplay i will find more awesome stuff chazcar racing unites all factions cool there will be racing xerxesiii predatorclass tank authority tank pulverizer nothing special devastator immortal shrouded tank i think this one will be a common vehicle in convoy battle wind razor convoy battle they will use that ebomb system to protect the convoy rolla first target in convoy battle goes down with a big boom etc i hope they will show that the authority fights against other factions there can be a cool story mutant bash tv i love it this must be the big thing to finish and become a reality star in wasteland tv great their goes another great game ruined by the just cause 3 concept hope you can turn the hitmarker off wowthis game looks actually really fuckin great what have they done the original seems much better it looks generic like bullestormdoom whats with the auto aim doesnt really look like fun i really enjoyed rage but then heard nothing else about it suddenly theres a rage 2 and it looks pretty sweet these curse of la llorana commercials are getting anoying downgrade trailer feel better than gameplay this game is oddly similar to crisis 3 the gameplay mechanicgraphics colors combat style are oddly similar to crisis the motion blur looks strong do they include an option to disable it this game looks cool but i bummed out cuz its not like the first one at all standard open world sandbox shooter with clear out this and kill that type missions boooooooooooooooring multiplayer please this is 2019 people hate games like this unless you are on angel dust from the look of it its not even close to the original game rage its gone to much scifi they shouldve rebrand it to other title not related to the 1st one cool but it seems so hard on the eyes will be tiring after some playtime this game is pretty a game with style and personality and actually fun mechanics wow this looks awesome previews have been a bit mixed but this looks phenomenal i wish i had the money to buy 2 games per month lol i hope it runs that smooth on pc why does the games world look kind of detail less and this is the successor of the first rage it looks more as a fusion between doom mad max and crysis why all this pink i need this game in my life now motion blur and fov settings included for console how batman shoulda been one thing i want in rage 2 is difficulty choice like i see the game is easy love all the colors looks fun am i the only one who feels that this game couldve been launched just as a dlc to doom eternal please give us the minimum system requirements for the game 4k on bones sign me up 1158 there you go definetly a buyer havent had a game like this yet dude im sold on getting this game after seeing gameplay looks so much fun they need to make a judge dredd game with this engine oh boy a sequel nobody wanted to a game nobody played cant wait to pick it up for 5 a couple months after launch i am not feel bullet power when shoot sick of monster closets another dead franchise why does it have co op last moment was epic compared to bl3 cmon you know what that stands for the rivalry is strong with this one hyped for this game however there two things i think they can improve 1 they should put some animation on the crystal thingy upon collecting them the from the stash like adding disappearing particle effect instead of just abruptly vanished 2 the hitdeath marker should be less disruptive i think the skull icon is a little bit too big for the screen though id most likely be playing with no hud myself i love the colors finally games start to get some colors instead of endless brown yellow deserts looks like a mix of crysis and bulletstorm mad max it reminds of that 103 sounds like that line was voiced by someones drunk stephdad bfg 9k seems like a refined design from classic doom i love it dont wanna bother with the old bethesda lootingsystem if there is an option for infinite ammo im buying the game car crash mechanics from 2000 awful game i wait to see how big will be xaxa a have 1 tb storage to install it if i want dont be another just cause 4 this feels a lot like doom is that motherfucking sam riegel the meat man himself is that lastimosa from titanfall 2s voice actor stunning where is dogg the crasher thanks ign for having a competent player this time to show this gameplay kudos cant wait copyright claims incoming from destiny soon mad max in anthem world this game is definitely going to scratch my far cry itch wheres the doom eternal gameplay this could be game of the year for me i heard you can change walkers gender is that true mad max bullet storm and doom nuff said this game graphics looks pre rendered looks like a cross between bulletstorm and killzone kinda meh is there coop those vehicle controls look alot like just cause 3 and 4 but a bit less buggy mad max on steroids its looking like the worst visual elements from black ops 3 and the most pretentious design decisions from crysis 2 put together plus some hl2 trickshot gimmicks hooorraay for capitalism just imagine if this was a battle royale game anybody else hear failsafe from destiny 2 so i take it driving is supposed to be a core feature of the game if so please remind the devs that its 2019 the driving physics on their vehicles are about as dynamic and believable as pole position circa 82 why cant this game just come out on my birthday its just one day after lol is the card game still in it with collectible cards far cry on acid lol wtf are those hitmarkers looks like ms paint i sure do hope we can turn them off waiting for reviews with this one this game looks really fun and colorful looking forward to playing it i really havent looked into it but is it open world looks like doom and has a couple apex legend features its looks way to easy this is the worst mario karttwisted metalmad max love child that ive ever seen you guys think there will be a definitive end boss battle and a satisfying well thought out ending this time around is the ai failsafe does the bfg9000 only get from deluxe edition no any information says you can get this weapon in game progress this looks like a hot wheels game lmao this mightve sold me on this game tbh i knew nothing about rage but this looks fun as hell the new the legend of zelda is awesome this is great im pumped you remember that feeling when youre actually excited for a new game yeah rage 2 i love that there is outdoor and indoor combat sam riegel voicing the player character is that anthem with cars because the ui and the hud looks so much the same something to hold off the borderlands hype or its the other way around omfg this look fun classic modell of bfg just like in doom 1 and 2 whh are they using the overwatch kill reticle now well with all the games coming out this year im def gonna end up broke at some point looks and sounds wicked so is this pc with a controller or xbox gameplay crysis borderlands farcry my little poney rage 2 overdrive kinda hurts to my eyes i loved the first one and this looks amazing coop multiplayer all i hear is failsafe from destiny 2 huh main gameplay reminds me of shadow warrior 2 problem in this game is fomm bathesda bug and lag everyware hehehehe i remember how fallout 76 looked enough said imma wait for a discount on this one sorry bethesda you are on the watch list wtf men this is freaking awesome i was promised super metal epic music yet all i can hear is gunshots and wub wub boom on a loop is it suppose to look cartoonishly mad max i the best apocaliptic game ever rage 2 hold my bear so the previews for this game havent impressed me at all just saw the gun video and now this and i am totally stoked this looks awesome the gameplay looks really fun but i am worried about the objectives and mission design i really hope it is not another big open world with just a lot of busy work strongholds littered everywhere and no story or anything of substance besides perhaps the main campaign missions etc if crackdown and bulletstorm had a baby rage 2 i think this will be the surprise hit of the year this game looks absolutely amazing im confused why its called rage 2 though it has literally zero similarities with the first game probably could have made way more money launching it as its own title bfg 9000 ok i think we need a panzerhound as avehicles what about stealth in this game cool but the ui is disgusting whats the point of this game just shooting hope you can turn of all that flickering electric shock effects and that purple crap on screen it hurts my eyes if no its a no buy from me the framerate during fights and car scenes is so bad wtf it feels like 1520 fps looks cool no lootcrates right hes like every quake champion in one new crysis looks arcadey looks awesome must buy game of the year sounds like failsafe is doing well i just hope the vehicle physics are nothing like just cause 3 or 4looking at you avalanche so destiny 2 mixed with rage openworld call of duty advanced warfare movement and doom combat but you can just sit in your car and shoot all the enemies doesnt look like the essence of rage to me 246 is that the voice of failsafe from destiny 2 awesome but i miss closed corridor locations a lot does this have multiplayer its like if doom and bulletstorm had a baby looks smooth as butter even on the outdated consoles if doom and wolfenstein are any indication for how smooth its gonna be on pc it will be one hell of an experience on a high refreshrate monitor cant wait the vehicles need moreweight i guessit feels like they are floatingand next to those huge plants its like a heavily modded lego racersbut the shooting feels right is that sam riegals voice as the main character this should be fun rage 1 will always be better no way the game will graphically look like this come launch and did i see console controls come on you know that game gonig to be awesome when you name something in it pulverizer nothing really new so does this mean that doom guys efforts were in vain if this is how the earth ended up i hope theyll upgarde the shot effects cause you dont feel like you are shoting definitely getting this if the reviews are okay twisted metal hope they dont downgrade the graphics this looks great rage is basically the doom guy fighting punks instead of demons i hate the holo zoom really hoping we get a red dot for it i know thats a weird thing to complain about but gun design is important when i have to look at the damn thing all day also i am really hopimg that hard mode gives enemies more health this is not at all how i pictured the game from the trailers i actually like this much more 751 is this how the character we play look like he resembles a hipster hobo trash hey bungie hey bio are you watching this this looks like mad max and the doom guy vs the lgbtq lol all of the pink purple baby blue colors and sparkles that must be the games objective your character has to fight the betas to get the color schemes back to normal guys who buy this are likely the betas you will see in the womens make up section omg just look at the pretty colors you betas do you more real women for the alphas that computer sound is that failsafe from destiny 2 but wait bfg9000 was created during exploring potential of hells argent energy on mars by uac corporation and there was only 1 prototype which slayer was using during doom so i dont think that rage and doom are in the same universe this bfg is just a nice easter egg this better be on steam epic exclusive yet mad max doom and we got rage 2 you know what i dont even care if its not called mad max 2 this game is what mad max fans were waiting from avalanche studios and the fact they did this in conjunction with id software its even better open world mad max car combat with doom shooting elements criticswhos gonna win e3 2019 rage 2 hold my beer this game looks sickkkk not impressed haha but bl3 was announced so oh well this game look so nextgen this game actually looks sick definitely consider buying it now imagine a ratchet and clank game like this a battle royal in this setting would melt the opposition with this game bethesda gonna redeemed they selves who else is getting mad max vibes from this game so awesome you can autorevive is this coop if elder scroll vi using this graphic i actually pre order itbut rage 2 looks greatso whats the different between this and borderlands aside from the graphic the game play looks fantastic but im not so sure if they have a strong plot going here yet it looks like halo mixed with just cause 4 looks fine but honestly most not all modern games just blur into one big sameness for me these days a feast of games all of which are okay but not brilliant and look identical the vehicle gameplay feels like rc racing hopefully it feels like farcrydoomborderlands at the same time it looks amazing really excited for this wish there would be a minimap though instead of the bl1 navigation system they got there what are the system requirements im getting borderlands vibe with doom and bulletstorm mixed intake my hard earned money please this looks incredible i wonder how much a super deluxe booster would cost in the micro transactions shop oh what a day what a lovely day doom on earth the hud looks like almost every recent scifi game that was released andromeda anthem and so on anyone remember that old movie tankgirl 455 looks like a crossbreed between doom and mad max love it this game really makes you feel like doom guy doom and rage in the same universe nice pre order cancelt thought it would be better but this is crap like everything they release in the last years boring stuff what a mindless game opportunity lost no challenge dumb weak enemies might as well shoot chickens its cool how this game went from contenders from brownest game to a e s t h e t i c s like every other game now why am i getting a crysis 3 vibe from the scenery wow its like playing all over again mad max was that a protoss at 215 just because you are offended by people saying it looks and plays like doom does not mean it doesnt look and play like doom this game is doom oh cool destiny the second to second gameplay and everything looks so much like doom not necessarily a bad thing but even the fonts and hud looks the same d is this game going to be 60fps on xbox one x i tried playing exodus at 30 fps and not enjoying it at all at 60 fps this will be a must buy for me fps games on console 60 fps or do one ill wait for doom rage was amazing but over by the time you got comfortable this just looks like a downgrade to me and the fluorescent colors that other games are doing right now is oddly a off putting ehh its just not for me again the new doom is where ill spend my money i think it looks awesome and epic this will surely be legen wait for it dary legendary and i love that u getto see some of the vehicles especially love the combat and the fact tht u can haz bikes this really feels like im watching someone play with their lego toys like everything is actually really small does anyone else get this feeling i like the art style very much that was so fuckin doooommm i propably wil not use cars to see everything beside cars i think its more like crisis 3 saints row 4 last time i used a demomagnum was in resistance23 cant wait to have that in my life again see i really enjoyed the first one because it was all by chance the first minute or two is literally auto aiming especially the boomerang i wonder what will happens if he uses the gravity gun at the boss battle ctr doom and this is all i need to be happy this year what the hell is failsafe doing in rage 2 xd so no one is gonna talk about the downgrade that pink effect gives the feeling of farcry new dawn cant wait preorderd to the gravity shot is giving me life and also mass effect vibes this game looks the same most mainstream fps i guess ppl are brainwashed into likeing the same thing but cry about cod thats why cod is trash doesnt have to change when it has millions of fans going crazy over anything fps the doom vibes i get from this is amazing shouldnt have spoiled the bfg in the title im pretty sure doom wolfenstein and rage are in the same universe but split into different paths edit what i mean is they all have the same past but a different presentfuture they are rage but u oh wait wrong game how this game can be more better takedown system gameplay does seem bulletstormish not a bad thing i liked that game not a fan of the grav launcher seems tedious im wondering if this ties to the first story at all the first one had an apocalyptic rustic age setting im not really feeling the new age polish here twisted metal meets doom im all in for those here for the bfg like i was its right at the end lol failsafe what are you doing in rage 2 serious sam on maximum real trash ok id software now im waiting for a new quake that isnt quake champions lmao why is the bfg9000 here are these the same devs that made doom x3 no multiplayer like the original ill pass crysis borderlands doom mad max and bulletstorm had a son and looks pretty nice wtf this looks badass nice bfg is back nice little dish before the main course doom imagine playing this couldnt be me those visuals are outstanding they should make a battle royale and beat apex ive heard the driving sequences didnt have the best controls hopefully im wrong this does look amazing why are ign players such bots just hard to watch anything by them the ai sounds like failsafe from destiny 2 why is so make up on this game face wait is this a looter shooter or what kind of game is this sm bfg weapon am now rage cant wait to play this oneits looking better and better wait does this take place in the same universe as doom that robotic female voice is the same one from destiny 2 welp shut up and take my money this literally blew my mind man to all those complaining its a mash up of other games please go make your own game and see what people say doom but more colourful laughs in preorder what happened why is rage look all weird now i hate it as a huge fan of rage 1 and its rustic and postapocalyptic feel rage 2 looks very modern and completely unrelated game looks just like doom hopes and dreams shattered was going to pre order crysis bulletstorm and doom all had a baby yea think we gettin it wow this is literally open world doom minus the demons not that im really complaining but i hope there is more of a reason that they used the bfg in this game other than marketing if its in the same universe ok but if it isnt idk that seems kinda weird they could have easily given it a different name other than bfg i dont know why this reminds me of doom but futuristic and stuff this looks great but the flashing screen during overdrive made my eyes hurt is that the voice from the thingy thing on nessus in d2 after seeing thisim of the opinion that id should make the next duke nukem game doom crysis and borderlands combined count me in i honestly was not interested at all until i saw this thats one hectic mess driving looks rough seems to be funny this new doom 1080p no thanks we know doom guy introducing cyberpunk killing guy hes like doom guy but with tie dye colors and human meth heads to kill fun stuff if only it had co op and destructible environments i like this game i really dowhos gonna play it that first sequence reminded me of a 3d spy hunter so doom and rage are linked in a way in five seconds i went from not caring about this game to wanting it right now why did they remove all of the blood and gore i wont buy this game if its too pg13 this game looks fuckin awesome but i hope it isnt like far cry 5 with over use of the retaking camps like seen here hope im wrong tho so if rage is releasing soon doom eternal is next later this year from doom to rage nowadays lots of fps are rebranded crysis clones d doom with a different skin people say not to judge it but it looks like if doom was an open world needs a mini map on screen if you ask me damn i keep forgetting about this game this looks really cool but nothing like the masterpiece that was rage at all wait the car at the 453 just appeared out of nowhere come on thats pretty immersion breaking surely there could be some kind of delivery system everything is cool about this game besides that dreadful pink color they try to shove in every aspect of the game whoever came up with that design idea should be fired i will be very busy with days gone and this the hype is real this game is brought to you by torgue manufacturing xplosionsssss lots of neck vein lol imagine playing rage 2 instead of bl3 those red enlarged hit markers on the enemies are ruining this game for me with my ocd ocd aside i expect every game to have a clean hud in todays day and age whats with all the like neon purple and cyan weird hit markers and wheres the story sure graphics have improved but preferred the old style in rage 1 tbh im more excited about this than borderlands 3 the only things i could complain is the dumb cannonfodder enemies and the do always the same thingsmissions looks like a far cry game in the doom universe looks fun but imagine if the environment was destroyable along with everything else theyve packed into this game idk why im getting serious sam vibes that ending tho the ui and hud elements are way too overblown i get that it fits with the aesthetic but its very distracting and a bit too much even the crosshair and hit indicators are distracting i prefer the ui or lack thereof of the older builds this forest environment looks way more interesting than that desert thats been shown still not enough here to keep me interested ill wait on the reviews is that me or the veichule system look like just cause one this doom eternal and borderlands 3 man cant wait that robot girl sounds the same as the fallen ship from destiny 2 on io depending on cyberpunks release this has the potential to be goty 320 isnt that failsafe from destiny 2 looks nothing like original rage looks exactly like doom meh this is a wait for sale at best for me does the car chase seem awfully similar to arkham knight or is it just me not complaining i loved it in batman explosions look great but because of that im worried last game with beautiful explosions i played was just cause 3and well that game had crashing issues if only this game have close combats kills lke in doom my only complaint is that i like the old voice actor better mad max of doom im in i keep saying that was a bad idead to give this guys this ip to work on it for me its just another just cause with new shell and cmon using apex engine than id tech 6 makes me laugh it looks nothing like rage but im feelin it kill with skill far cry new dawn exists rage 2 hold my beer have in mind that this one is actually coming to steam isnt that the same ai girl from destiny 2 first few seconds in the video and me being selective i dont think i would be liking the sound design it looks cool and gameplay is smooth and also looks like a lot of fun but this is not rage 2 call it something else call it rampage but not rage the vehicle combat still feels really slow especially compared to mad max i think they should speed it up a bit honestly when this game was first revealed i was disappointed it wasnt a fallout game then fallout 76 was announced by bgs a few months later fast forward to today and im beyond excited to play this game the more i see of it the more i want to play it so thankful for rage 2 now from what ive seen it should do far better than the first rage game you cant expect me to think this game wont lag like hell cant see myself buying it looks to me lile a free rpg more anyone got rwview worth buying devil may cry lady edition 2019 and people still want to pre order and believe in the first glimpses of gameplay they get oml i really like how he plays like the doom marine from the new doom oh look another generic shooter the bfg looks insultingly under powered looks fun but i can see this game getting dull fast if the enemies cant pump out decent difficulty awesome as doom 00 but with openworld in the cars this game exactly not for epileptic this is basically open world doom im looking forward to this the first one blew my mind when it released ill love this aswell if its about 30 the same mad maxcrysisdoom how this not be a success damn this game would be amazing if they had co op mad max has it ingrained in my head that all post apocalyptic worlds with car combat must have people with australian accents this looks fantastic love the vehicle combat after recently replaying titanfall 2s campaign this honestly doesnt look that special its pretty clear that this was made by the same team that made mad max this pleases me jesus flipping christ those combats are brutal this looks sick at the moment it looks actually more promising than borderlands 3 i cant wait the end this looks amazing they took everything about the first one and improved it by 100 cant wait for this its just me or the environments in this one looks dull compared to the first one literally mad max same vehicle mechanic charging shooting though the car convoys gameplay is almost as if crysis and doom has a baby who is walkers voice actor i heard it before just cant remember who edit just found out its sam riegel they need to have multiplayer wow this was a surprise this game wast even really on my radar after watching that i went from meh to hype im a little disappointed that the bfg didnt get much screen time but this looks promising was that failsafe talking in the tutorial hitmarkers are a bit much but other than that this game looks amazing iv played more than i can count amount of open world games and im not sure why but the scale of this game looks massive havent seen a open world game in size impress in me in a long time the world looks huge my only complaint is the visual glitch camera shake when ground pounding im so happy that games like these are having a comeback loved doom loved wolfenstein cant wait for doom eternal and this i hope this game dont bring my hardware to madness when the first trailer was released i was like this another game that will get swept under my radar but by watching this gameplay i probably consider buying this really like how fast pace it is mad max breeds with bulletstorm rage 2 lgbt doomguy ripping with unicorn diarrhea make a series id watch please split screen just me or did they actually get someone who knows how games is this game online hoping for 60 fps on consoles its like mad max borderlands cocaine headache i hope you can remove the hit markers they are huge that would annoy me fast other than that looks great so far hard mode play only i think idk why but i remember playing the first rage and being completely bored playing it i hope this one is different honestly cant wait for rage 2 and doom eternal came here for bfg from classic doom stayed for tankcar only watched the vid because of the bfg when she says shes home alone 430 nice to see a crysis sequel after so many years kinda feels like this is the appetizer borderlands 3 will be main course bfg9000 this isnt doom please tell me this is releasing on steam on launch day i feel a little doooguy on this game footage thats a fugly looking hitmarker looks great i do hope theres an option to remove some of that combat ui mind you dont like the hit indicator looks like if rage 2 was a shooter fact single player games are dead great game this is scripted gameplay not impressed omg its like a doom gta5 and fallout combined but better this is what i wanted destiny 2 to be also the gun and enemy design is orgasmic we need more stuff that doesnt look like other stuff in gaming they say that walker can be male or female but we dont see any gameplay with female walker not with female voiceover at least i hope theres higher difficulty levels damn this looks much improved since they showed it off last year definitely looking forward to it now based on the developer and this footage you know this games going to be optimised to hell and back cant wait to play it it looks brilliant 225 fps drops in 1st serious action scene and its like medium graphics settings well i guess consoles just cant work properly with modern videogames graphics waiting for pc gameplay video to see how this game actually looks like thats insane man bulletstormfarcry56rage 2 i hate the hit marker hopefully there is some way to remove it i lost interest in this game just cause 4 failure generation zero failure rage 2 this needs to be a hit avalanche no negative comments hmmm is that failsafe i hear 1100 if you came for the bfg 9000 this is awesome looks like a lot of fun quite like this actually the combat is a lot more fun than something like far cry 5 for instance this game looks better everytime i see new video about it at first it was a disappointment but now i guess its gonna go into cart unless it becomes chinese game store exclusive which if i recall right is never gonna happen cyberflunk is doomed looks nothing like rageevery modern game looks like a clone of those mmorpg games yknowthis makes me want to go play warframe for some reason this looks like a combination of doom bulletstorm titanfall just cause and or the mercenaries series with the vehicle spawning and maybe even a little bit of crackdown and halo with a touch of mad max and borderlands vibe damn is this pc gameplay with controller or xbox x im ready for the downgarde doom apex mad max rage 2 awesomeness please tell me that hitmarker can be turned off black panther simulator american arsenal edition doomcrysis and some elements of mad max if only this had coop it had the bfg is this and doom universe connected kinda disappointed that this doesnt have takedowns opening is like madmaxs combat doom crysis mad max mario kart farcry rage 2 yeah im cool with that lol why im not interested ive never play rage 1 but i do play doom 2016 but thisthis is just too much doom with open world and vehicleits fun tho but im not id prefer doom because linear so i shouldnt explore the whole map dont care borderlands 3 is coming makes me think red faction remindme shadow warrior games for some reason this game looks so awesome i love how they are using some doom mechanics and a few of its guns in the gamereally expands the doom universe and makes you wonder how rage 2 ties in it better than borderlands already heavy metal music slowly rising from the horizon this is mad max on drugs people true question is what platform is this on because idk if current console hardware can actually get stable 60fps like this video shows is this game running on a super computer and using an xbox controller or is it played on an xbox console literally blown away at how smooth crisp and sexy it looks take my money gaben the enemies seem to be part of the scenario they pose no danger to the character doom you cant defeat me rage 2 hold my beer look just like gta combined with rdr bully and smash just amazed by the gaming mechanics and character models really graphics and gameplay of video games these days are getting better and better ign you get to see the bfg 9000 under their breath jbaited am i the only one who noticed that the voice actor for the protagonist sounds just like sam reigel this reeks of scripted gameplay is that liam obrian or sam riegal nobody me jump in the middle of the crowd epic games time exclusive the mods for this game on pc will be amazing whoa doomcrysismad maxjust cause 4far cry new dawnawesome hes basically a clone trained by a sith overwatch single player should be like this the vehicle combat looks too easy i really hope you can disable lock on mode while in your vehicle for me i lost all interest in the game when borderlands 3 got announced rage 2 the outter worlds borderlands 3 what a year do i hear failsafe if this games gets a an coop mode borderlands 3 can give up doomguys vacation does this game not have coop this probably the best gameplay ive seen thus far wasnt really interested before its like a mix of doom and borderlands it looks amazing and exhilarating i wonder why most of gameplay showcases such as e3 gameplay is played using console even if the game is avaiable in pc platform didnt like the first rage i doubt this one would be any better hotwheels on the titanfall universe this is something but it gave me a bit of nausea imagine a vr lol the quick motion will make u vomit epilepsia shooter so the grav dart launcher is basically just the drill gun from bulletstorm but with less gore xd holy crap it looks awesome probably a pc footage though the gun fight looks way better than cyberpunk but the quest i dont think so i hope it has local coop like borderlands aaaahhh i dont really like it i was expecting something better is this epic exclusive this game be too violent why cant we just run around offering therapy and meds to the crazy people that would be sweet that slow pan through the weapon selection wheel to get to the bfg loved that how is this bethesda differ from other bethesda doomguy got the hell outta hell reminds me of way too similar to a ton of other games for some reason this game makes me want another titanfall gamr why does this look awkward i actually cant wait for the sale on this game so i can buy it this looks way cooler than borderlands 3 stop teasing and take my money is this xbox gameplay or pc guess i can wait for that norfleet now rage 2 was a doom open world game all along kind of makes me think crysis and doom had a beautiful little baby doom guy with a voice nice needs multiplayer but apparently it has a map to big for multiplayer this nowhere near the first one i like it tho half of what you see will not be available in the final build also why couldnt these guys make fallout 76 i think besthda could learn a few things thanks for putting other video tabs in the video right when he uses the bfg pretty impressive how the game is running on the just cause game engine which has always been a third person open world looks amazingbut so did anthem not that long ago so rage happens in the same universe as doom this game look like my dad crazy look at the awful buildings in the background looks like a 7th gen game this is doom as an open world i want it this game look very dull s wolfenstein rage and doom crossover maybe sometime in the future that bfg description tho rips and tears whatevers in its path 1 this game looks great 2 funny that if you notice how the mechanics loot drops ammo seems to work ill put money that this will have a battle royal mode halo and doom combined sort of just cause 4 atmosphere doom slayer armor please where are the triggered steam users to vote down this video still really interested to see how this story turns out i know this looks like it could be its own thing but i hope we get at least some closure for the first game these huge red hit markers are soooo annoyingly obtrusive would be nice to have an option to turn them off gameplay looks absolutely fantastic though cant wait am i watching doom gameplay watch doom guy get a wing stick in doom eternal is this rage 2 or bulletstorm 2 im not sure here doom 20 with rails another generic fps shooter with no brain and just shoot meh it looks super i mean this looks like a mix between borderlands and mad max im pretty sure the flashes and pink color will give me psychotic breakdown after a couple of minutes this game is sick dudetake my money hmm i dont like the art style and the level design seems chaotic some of the enemies and vehiclesstructures kinda look like something out of a bad scifi movie from the 90s the enemies and map kinda make me think of just cause 4 it seems like theres a lot of running from objective to objective changing icons on a map from color to gray i hope this game ends up having more in common with borderlands 2 than just cause 4 combat seems fun tho looks fun but dont see any need of skills to play it im glag they choose to release it on steam in the end thank you bethesda you made the right call im not sure about the setting it feels all over the place one moment it seems like a mad max experience driving cars built from junk and fighting wasteland punks and the other you are fighting super hightech aliens also whats up with all these magic tricks you can do i dunno it feels like one of those games that push the players power fantasy way too much and end up ruining the immersion and feeling like a big sandbox is this a downgrade or im blind this game is the mad max game we deserve a game that is different than every other game while looking fun nice i dont understand this its nothing like the first rage how will this fit into the lore there wasnt any powers or gravity guns in rage 1 am i the only one that had a very bulletstorm feeling while he was in combat i loved that game and for rage 2 to be similar for me at least would be awesome looks really nice just hope they dont downgrade on release what system is this being played on pc xbox one s xbox one x im actually excited for this now why is there almost no blood nice game play awesome love the game i have the original first game this game is beautiful i cant be the only one who thinks this gameplay had no complexity to it at all its literally just sidestepping and shooting different toys like come on is that fun that gun at the end is the exact same weapon from doom 2016 wait wait wait the classic bfg 9000 from doom 1 and 2 in rage 2 take my money and give me this game id now i hope there are more weapons than they showed already man its so crazy comparing the gameplay mechanics and the overall feel of this game to the first its like in the time span of the first and second game everyone started taking drugs and steroids as it rained guns from doom lmao not gonna lie though this looks great and as much fun as i had with rage 1 i dont think it wouldve worked and gotten attention if they kept things the same way for the sequel shame this is coming out with borderlands 3 on the horizon so its goodbye to level design forever who needs to actually think of interesting geometry when you can just have huge bland open spaces with occasional props scattered through them d borderlands 3 rage 2 my social life in danger looks very polished rare thing these days all i want is to be able to turn off the flashing in the hud elements in the lower left meh looks mediocre imo no offense to others that find it amazing its just not for me i guess crysis looks cool 527 thats the goddamn firing sound for the quake 1 shotgun and you cant tell me otherwise i dont like driving mechanic avalanche studios it feels like you drive a toy car beside that i like the gameplay doom and mad max had a baby and its a little monster of dyed blue hairs and full of rage too not sure about the voice for the character this looks amazing d 755 got some unreal tournamentreaper vibes failsafe is that you is this doom the fallout 5 that we never had 654 658 defnitely not played by any ign staff batman post apocalypse hm single player shooters arent really my spice but it looks enjoyable stop playing fps with a pad controller this is so boring finally the great game again i hope it wont end up like fallout 76 why do people even make games like this looks so shitty and boring wtf hope this will not get boring in a few try as mad maxs stronghold take oversince both game were developed by the same team what i hope for is a way to turn off the health bars give me that and this will be up there for a shooter in my book i was buying this way before this gameplay anyway my gaming library is fatter than king henry the 8th wouldnt it be funny if rage 2 was removed from steam before it was released and made as an epic store exclusive 5 10 doom clone i just came here to see the bfg doom x far cry id software is making one hell of a comeback this looks really fun though i feel like something like this would benefit alot if it was something like borderlands when it comes to weapons and leveling that shotgun doesnt have enough oomph behind its blasts hope this connected to rage one somehow ok this actually looks amazing game looks so rad and not an epig store exclusive im buy this harder than doom guy punches demons this game looks super fun the screenfragment stuff is really annoying the sequel exactly no one asked for is shaping up to be a surprise mustbuy thats honestly a refreshing change from the beloved franchise sequel that everyone asked for shaping up to be a sad shell of its former selves looks like imma have to go in the ini files to remove that horrid kill marker jesus man i cant wait to play a game and be able to pause it too many online games out these days its not wasteland anymore superpowers nice looking cars and all that stuff i miss old rage rage 2 makes me feel so cynical now cuz its like who cares borderlands 3 yo an thats so unfair i know but gahhhh so is it gonna be an epic game exclusive or am i just scarred from recent gaming news why does the gameworld look so cheap and fabricated especially the apartment buildings doom crysis shadow warrior bulletstorm mad max guys watch this come out as an epic exclusive or doom eternal lmfao i hope u can play as a female walker or at least picks different voice but i doubt it nice lil game to get me ready for cyber punk is it me or the game doesnt offer any challenge to the player rage 1 was hard early game and thats why i liked it so much why this game gives me the vide of the mistakes made by ea this game feels like they were playing it on a super computer like using 2 rtx2080 ti or beyond that when it comes to the real product everything will be downgraded just like what anthem did i hope this is not the case this company should make a new twisted metal 610 was that a rakanishu d2 reference hmm thought itd be gorier this game is obviously tetris roblox combined i thought when after he shoot he was gonna melee the enemyreminds me of doom anyone else less excited about the game after watching this this is clearly doom 2 ohhh a new crysisthis is not rage is that failsafe sounds familiar to much colours its looks like a candy fcnewdown does this even take place in the same universe as the first one looks totally different i cant handle this one of the first thoughts that came into my head was is there an actual large map this time and after a few minutes in they show it already a huge step up from the previous game i loved the first game but not having a large map to look at was definitely tough doom just cause borderlands farcry mad max rage 2 hyyyyyyppppeeee i was way more looking forward to rdr2 and three kingdoms but the more i see of this game the more i want it now so close the guys who did mad max nice watch this be an epic exclusive the aim assist looks too strong this game looks amazing but im scared there wont be much to the upgrading mechanics thats what really keeps me hooked to a game tbh always having somethibg to look forward too around the corner seems fun but with how 76 was i really dont trust bethesda i dont think this is a rage 2 wasnt very impressed with the first presentations of the game but this looks pretty fun car combat looks like assasains creed black flag ship combat on cars if bl3 had realistic graphics damn gameplay look so fcking cool cant wait to play at 610 the enemies remind me of the jaavos in resident evil 6 doom without monsters man l miss twisted metal mad max with trees whatd they do to walkers rage screams whatd they change them for the previous ones were better a minor detail for sure but its noticable hot wheels turbo racing doomguy now can drive this is what bethesda can do when they trash the creation engine timestamp of the bfg 9000 this looks strikingly like doom guy and doom not rage 2 does rage 2 have any identity of its own everybodys gangsta till the bfg starts firin curious the protagonist of rage 2 speaks i believe this is a first for an id game goddamn this looks fun i was ready to give it a pass because of the crappy bethesda launcher but now its definitely a buy looks so much better then rage 1 like a completely new differnt style all together its mass effect guess this will make up for the loss of borderland 3 looks like a cross between the new farcry and doom eternal not bad not particularly impressive anybody know if itll have multiplayer wait is that the bfg this game looks incredibly fun cant wait hopefully we can ramp of the difficulty and can you play with friends if so im so buying this game it looks great just saying if this game had like 2 player co op it would be a lot better doesnt need anymore than that something needs to be done about those hitmarkers i hope that hit marker can be disabled cant wait to see the crazy ways people kill enemies in this game it looks like itll be a very fun fps and with a cool aesthetic doomsandbox gee another sandbox game the vehicles look so small it remebers me of rocket league this is doom no rage 2 well now i know where all the people who were suppose to help on fallout 76 went bulletstorm doom far cry mad max wingsticks anyone im so ready for this game i loved mad max and im glad its more of a fps now is that doom im seeing i dont know why but this reminds me of bulletstorm doom with open world cars and setting in a post apocalyptic world hell yeah this look sick that ai sounds so much like fail safe why the car third person view perspective makes the illusion that youre driving a toy car in a miniature world i guess its the fov ammount of fake positive comments is overwhelming 1003 you know what would be great if the game had destruction and u can use that gravity gun thing or a different weapon like the gravity gun from pacific rim 2 and make the building collapse on those big guys finally doom gameplay that isnt doom day 1 preorder set can we talk about the dudes voice acting its aweosme hes like in so many games glad its decent voice actor and not mass effect andromeda style p new twisted metal gameplay wonder how doom is gonna top this wow i was waiting for the bfg and then it shows up for 5 seconds super wack the sprint animation looks amazing damn bruh resistances revolver im sold i really enjoy driving in first person view what far cry new dawn shouldve been damn this game looks fun the game must be played on pc with a controller because theres no way it is played on such high framerate on a console new mad max looks great is that sam riegel made a new twisted metal game with unreal engine 4 this giving me bulletstorm vibes as well as doom i have a sneaking suspicion that the combat will become stale quickly 309 this ai sounds familiar car mechanicsphysics look terrible i hope theyre ironed out im sure thats due to avalanche i hope they get jennifer hale to voice the female main or laura bailey looks fun but i dont trust any hype now aaa games on release is a big question mark nowadays why are the enemies as dumb as stormtroopers they couldnt hit a fly it looks alright i just wonder about the optimization of the game engine and the amount of fps vs racing gameplay this looks like mario party mixed with skyrim hopefully we can change the pink ui elements to a different colour the vehicle mobility is strikingly similar to batmobile in arkham knight i liked the convoys in their mad max game looks like they just did the same thing here with bigger booms nice imagine tes 6 or starfield on this engine id sell my testicles for that reminds me a lot of bulletstorm just release it now once borderlands 3 came out every shooter game is going to be irrelevant this looks absolutely awful so what percentage of this footage is representative of the launch day game taking bets now fallout 76 levels of glitch feast full on graphical downgrade ala watchdog exaggeration of launch day game features carte no mans sky or perhaps another unfinished potential wasting disappointment to follow up anthem is this a new dlc to mad max i hate to say but i think they ruined the wingstick man i miss being really excited about a new game nothing new and innovative these days just clones of clones of clones the first rage was so primitive and wasteland like i dont know how i feel about this overdose in technology imagine a battle royal game that looked like this lol if mad max game is more fallout than fallout and this game resembles mad max does this mean rage 2 is more fallout than fallout itself its ironic because both fallout and rage 2 published by bethesda and even more ironic because modern fallout is developed by bethesda itself damn ok this is on my radar now its basically doom which means its awesome dear bethesda could we get some sort of death race mini game in rage 2 single player shooters are making a massive comeback this year was never a fan of demons and linear structure of doom this looks right down my ally the weapon wheel pause makes me said hopefully we can disable that the hud just looks bad its like those arcadey games but developed for a modern game world if they dont fix it im not gonna buy this just cause 4 but with gore and in first person nice too much screen noise for my tastepass looks like a grat game but i hope i can turn off those hitmarkers they are kinda distracting and annoying the open world feels unnecessary little groups of 4 or 5 enemies with giant spaces inbetween introducing rgb guns in before the million and one un skipable ads look at that optimization though cant wait to play its as if the original rage and bulletstorm has a beautiful bloody child jesus christ at these broken shotgun animations how the hell did nobody at avalanche notice the shotgun forend pumping animation not animating properly on occasion or the fact that walkers left hand jitters below the shotguns forend whenever his thrown wingstick is attacking an enemy wtf is this aimlock this actually looks fun not gonna lie this game looks so awesome also reminds me a bit of bullestorm which i loved can anyone remember this httpsyoutube63qaj9bvmgu nice pink apocalypse xd way better than the first one looks like doom and cod had a baby bethesda better not ruin this game and this better not be fake gameplay footage this looks painfully average honestly the gunplay looks like a discount slower doom with generic abilitiesfound in so many previous games shoehorned in in an attempt to separate it from doom im sure past that nothing else interesting is going on the vehicles look floaty enemies look boring with their ai still stuck in early 2006 like so many other games today the graphics look nice i guess and it looks more interesting than cod and battlefield for whatever thats worth hard pass ill just wait for doom eternal i want it doom gunfight mad max vehicle battle im in what a great game can i get it from epic store exclusively pretty locations i like this game was made for stealthgamerbr lol this looks like what farcry new dawn wanted to be 421 was the dopest thing ive ever seen highquality video persevere with making excellent content and you will increase rapidly subscribe to our channel and so well subscribe back the hitting mark is too big and annoying i hope there is an option to turn it off just realized this is the first gameplay ive seen that had the crosshairs on i think i actually hate it lol i knew something looked weird while watching it turning that off asap looks like crysis but more fun im probably getting the deluxe edition just for the bfg lol more like 11 minutes of gameplay and one blue balled bfg 9000 shot okay this actually looks pretty fuckin dope the way the explosion glitches the screen disturbs me so much this doesnt look like a rage game at all not saying it isnt fun but okay this actually looks fun what i like to think doom 2016 was a shooting tech demo are there a lot of cool easter eggs and secret things to find console aims for you lmao console is for bad gamers do we get variants of the ar like in the first rage like the ak and authority machine gun this game is going to be a rage of 2019 i kan feel it me wtf man cyberpunk 2077 is a first person open world game cant see my character give me motion sickness whats the point other me watching this damn this is sick is this really a open world game what a great game doom soundtrack intensifies real talk tho some melee executions would feel right at home in this game that holosight is terrible far cry and doom had a baby i hope we can edit the fov thats such a basic thing especially for a game this size the bfg 9000 model reminds me the model from doom 64 the more i see of this game the more im convinced its gonna be dope af well at least it looks better than falldown 76 from standard to deluxe edition i go the bfg is always worth it so no easymode this time ign they should have character entering the vehicles animation lazy if the game had destructible environment and bosses which are not bullet sponges im 100 down to buy looks like a mixture of just cause doom and rage definitely impressed this reminds of bulletstorm so this is literally nothing like the 1st game cool not buying so much gameplay revealed i dont even think i need to buy this game the ai sounds like the one on the crashed colony ship from destiny 2 loved the voice so cant wait to play this game tbh oh hell yes game looks incredible the first one is a classic so doom and rage are part of the same world fk yeah im in its so rare to see a game where the ammos are located on the left side of the screen bfg at 1100 btw i really wished that this has coop coop could make the game perfect the ranger has to be dooms guys grandson at this point im still worried about the narrative and mission variety visuals and gameplay look absolutely phenomenal will there be coop i wonder what the bfg is like in overdrive the tutorial womans voice sounds like the same one from that doom eternal gameplay trailer and the voice over in opportunity in borderlands 2 this game looks so sick i was already on board but after seeing this gameplay and that fight with the giants im wishing it was out right now how ironic rage 2 erased all my hate for borderlands 3 epic deal its the dark souls of fps ign they should have just called this something else i see nothing left of the first rage this seems just to be a more colorful open world doom the new crankdown looks lit it looks really fun i never played the first one though another destroyed franchise please dont downgrade the graphics much this looks like true fps fun cooking mama goat simulator crack cocaine rage 2 wowomg lol so pumped like my comment plz i need validation stop wow this looks like a video game whoa wait a minute at 824 am i the only one who had major crysis vibes at this point in the video i sincerely hope not the open world looks really uninteresting and seems like a bunch of points of interest on a relatively flat map traversing between ground combat segments seems boring who needs borderland 3 anyway this is the rage weve beeen waiting for they have to tone down the disco lights or some people will get epileptic seizures all open world games are irrelevant while bl3 is on the horizon besides elder scrolls 6 wheres the part where they actually use it since i like to skip to the ripping and tearing im trying to keep expectations low going in but watching this makes it so hard nice game the overdrive effect is waaay to flickery i hope they will change this or that theres an option to turn it off sleeper hit of the year this game reminds me of tetris and street fighter looks like a game thats fun at the start but gets boring and repetitive later shut up and take my money interesting game but i loved the original games look and its weapons these morefuturistic weapons kinda lost the touch of the original game bam the game is awesome better watch out anthem gotta appreciate that description for the bfg emits a huge explosion that rips and tears through whatever is in its path now this looks cool is this the crew 2 this game has learnt a lot from doom wow this game looks like insert a game below here doom mad max bulletstorm crysis borderlands far cry dark soulsuhh what serious sam tetris mario pong oknobody actually said those last few games why is it so less gory than the original bfg 9000 doom theme starts boycot this game of bethesda that is what the mako from mass effect should have been why post a 4k video if it looks like 1080p upscaled bleugh i hope you can turn off those color filters because im getting blind i feel like mature games should start to show body damage on characters it looks kinda bland when you see no damage inflicted doom eternal did it and it looks amazing sad to not see it here this will satisfy me whilst we wait for bl3 id softwareyou messed up60fps across all consolesnot just the enhanced ones damn this looks so smooth and fun omg im keeping my eyes on this for sure now this game was a pleasure for my eyes and ears the colors the transitions the kill animations sound was top notch bruh this looks terrible what are you all on about its a doom fps mixed with poo halo wars style driving and the enemies are your stereotypical destiny 12 mobs you all are way too easily impressed by these poo companies id please remake commander keen was your best franchise pumped for this now looks great been an amazing year for gaming so far division 2 metro now this amazing and i still havent finished hitman 2 looks very highly scripted i dont trust scripted trailers they say nothing about the real game underneath trash omg in my list to must have when it comes out oo love it doom wolfenstein and this is what shooters are supposed to be only thing thats missing is quake 24 sequel d autoaim on the vehicles what a noob solution 1056 the bfg doom reference you have my complete attention its like mad max with glitter eyeshadow its like far cry meets mad max with a touch of doom looks like they took a page out of doom in terms of gameplay games looking great i preordered this 3 weeks ago cant wait its gonna be goty an exciting aaa game actually coming to steam on release wow that giants trees everywhere this is giving me a darksouls vibe especially with the bfg my headcanon is that this takes place after hell on earth if doom and just cause had a baby that was raised by far cry they added a dodge mechanic this is just like dark sul looks fun but too easy bfg 9000 im getting this game for sure this game looks fuckin cool so far okay but why does this game actually look fun i hope their are lots of different monsters in this game i really want to see some monster like things and not just humans everywhere this game kind of reminds me of an updated serious sam 3 this looks boring hopefully this comes to xbox game pass so i can give it a shot doom 2016 with cars whos the protagonists voice actor sounds super familiar i wish avalanche studios would do a sequel to mad max man i wish this game were in 3rdperson and had coop id get it if that were the case top 3 anticipated game of the yearcant wait why do they think i would ever want to look at that overdrive visual effect i do think the game lacks a kind of vision or identity to an extent it feels like people going lets do this and no idea was denied but mechanically it looks like a blast ai seems to be asleep all the time in all gameplays if this game has coop then im defo getting it the big red x hitmarkers are a little off putting wow this game is like grand theft auto v cause theres car and shoot em up and even aliens cool but gtav is just like gta iv right wait i think this is more like far cry am i right now for duck sake stop comparing every freaking new game that is not a sequel nor prequel to any game to like every game thats has the same elements to it its just dumb its like saying basketball is the same as volleyball cause they both use a ball wait isnt volleyball and badminton literally the same game because you like throw something over the net again and again until someone loses its just so dumb to keep on comparing new games to existing games already stop the just like and see the games new elements to it and definitely dont compare the freaking obvious makes everything you say irrelevant this feels like arkham knight batmobile why am i not excited looks awesome but the movement seems a bit weird while double jumping and dashing forward imo looks like running 60fps so this pc not playstation i assume a i see its xbox hmmmm awesome gameplay im cringing already rdr2s horse chases seem faster and more actionpacked than this bullcrap in the beginning looks like crysis amd doom had a love child and gave kid to the ratchetclank kinder garden i love it lots of genius comments comparing it to doom mad max and just causehhmmm i wonder why its like that what i really like about this is that it plays a lot like the recent doom and im sure this will get a 8 or 9 hopefully its crazy how picky these gamers are these days looks like playing games for fun have been thrown out the window this gaming generation is horrible and its gonna stay that way unfortunately has no one played the first rage this is exactly how the first one played towards the middle of the game lol does anyone know if you can create your own character or are they set in stone wow rage looks amazing better the the first looks cool im fricking hyped the hit marker is way too big i see doom mad max far cry where is rage 2 who else look in the comments to see who else noticed doom style gameplay that hit marker is annoying af looks okay but considering doom eternal is coming whats the point of this i was just thinking give me a ground pound and ill be sold im sold doom honey phils on tv the ui looks terrible its nice to see an open world console game run at 60fps with decent graphics sure it looks pretty but im so done trusting flashy trailers im not pre ordering and im not buying it until i know the bugs have been patched who else had a nerdgasm when the bfg came outta the bag im surprised at how destiny like the gameplay and environments look like in this game even the ui in someway imagine a 3rd person view to this that would be cool i hope they release modding tools with it so its got the soul of doom 2016 with the restrictions and bad design decisions of farcry 5 i feel sorry for my social life when this game comes out i might lose my job and everything is that failsafes voice in the ark training module cuz its absolutely sounds like failsafe enemies sound like the helgast in killzone then you got the generic blue big cannisters on bosses convoys and also the bfg 9000 from doom tell you what it feels nice to remove a game from your wishlist s the game feels like a combination of destiny halo and mad max i appreciate this although i have to call it a mashup of other games yes baby the defibrilator is back give me this game already how much loot is there is that sam riegel voice is that sam riegel voice if so thats one more reason to play doom new gameplay anyone getting a doom 2016 vibe from this i am so proud of how far video games have come beautiful aspects are beautiful environments that also fit so well along well programmed gameplay whats with all the overused motion blurs and over saturated tints horrible on the eyes this is like if crysis were a dude who woke up one day and decided to stop brooding sign me up doom and rage are the same universe so like is the bfg gonna be deluxe edition dlc only or is it in the game but you have to wait until you get to it just hope the vo for the female player is better the male version sounds a bit meh this looks like bombastic fun im sold this game looks epic glad to see zenimax hasnt completely fallen cant wait for the new doom game rage 1 was so fun cant wait to play this one wat the new jak and daxter game needs to be like miss that game when he gravshot that dude right into his boot i said oooo out loud so day 1 for me bl3 is gonna kill this before it even comes out are they playing on easy mode or are the enemies going to be that fragile looks really awesome cant wait to play it bright colors d need this game in my ps4 now this legit looks like alot of fun huge improvement from the 1st one i cannot wait for this game man hopefully it does not have microtransaction nonsense rage 2 cyber punk 2077 i cant freaking wait for nice to finally see some nondesert gameplay now that borderlands 3 is ruined until it releases on steam i guess rage is the better option now hopefully hopefully the game comes to the epic store cant wait to play this masterpiece i see some mad max in here yep those particles are gone on release mad max borderlands this that voice in the tutorialisnt that failsafe from d2 wow im impressed bgf power level its over 9000 it looks so bland and generic wheres the creativity its like a more colorful openworld doom game in a sense looks like it will be a lot of fun a little more story than doom as well which isnt to say much since doom barely has any lol im so confused what is this game about is this a call of duty game with a twist of destiny idk just think bethesda has access to engines like this and fallout 76 looks like the way it does when i get this game i think i might od on how awesome it truly is this game looks way better than i expected i dont get why theres almost no hype about it anytime gameplay is shown motion blur should be turned off this looks insanely fun does this game support coop campaign artistically rage 1 was a step above i have a feeling the gun play is going to be really fun but the open world is going to be boring hold up did bethesda make this this looks like a us marine with a gopro strapped to his head looks like alot of fun the shooting doesnt look nearly as satisfying as the first one which is all that game had going for it this looks like generic normie trash holy crap big improvement over the first definitely day one buy thanks you id software for well optimized games i hate games where the cars dodges to the sides like that so basically minecraft meets mario just cause 4 is that you can someone tell me when the bfg gameplay is i dont want to watch 11 mins of spoilers just to see how rage 2 is incorporating the bfg this time around like rage 1 authority cannon looks so dumb and repetitive just shoot shoot shoot its mindless garbage worthless bullet storm doom far cry 3 blood dragon just cause 4 mad max this game also everything is turned to 11 oo so where is the bfg 9000 just watching this gameplay makes me feel like a badass alone i cant wait to play another id game that would be the most violent thing on this earth and would probably get alot of flak from media not kidding i am super hyped the more flak it gets the more people will buy it p also hyped to see how avalanches skills in making chaos tie in with ids skill for first person shooters that hit marker tho ah looks great rage 2 and hopefully doom eternal will do till i get borderlands 3 on steam next year other games on my list are wrath ion maiden trine 4 streets of rage 4 ori 2 hollow knight silksong then hopefully we get a release date for cyberpunk 2077 at e3 what a time to be a gamer i liked the first game a lot but i never expected there to be a sequel years later cant wait to play it did the main character voice actor change ive seen so much controller gameplay im starting to get worried for the pc version kind of looks like mad max without the fun combat mechanics im surprised that companies havent yet realised how done to death these generic fps mechanics now are still id be happy to be proved wrong just cause v new down looks awesome this is not rage just cause bulletstorm wow this looks so cliche and boring i swear ive played like 6 other games like this in the last six years game developers really need to start actually adding new things other then specialguns that you know dam well you not gonna use in favor of the traditional ones is this doom and bulletstorm or what glad to see everyone else immediately thought the same thing wow someone who can actually play videogames must not have been igns gameplay the game looks awesome though you lost looks nice but only time will tell learnt my lesson preordering games thats unfinished or downgraded damn the more i see gameplay of this game the more i dig it the legend says that when bfg is used the shits gone wild ill wait to see base ps4 gameplay devs said its gonna be 30fps on base consoles this looks way too fast paced for 30fps well have to wait and see who is playing stealthgamer br this reminds me of crysis a bit vegetation and overgrowth in broken cities is this the new crysis they better have that card game still looks similar to first with some awesome bulletstorm style the only thing it requires now is a devil may cry like stylish meter not impressed with the driving all too easy makes a fast paced doom like fps plays with a controller people love to try and tear new games apart this looks awesome if you didnt play the first rage i suggest you do it was a lot of fun very underrated game this one looks just as fun and awesome cant wait i had no interest in this game until this video whats with the aimbot though this game looks really easy if they could reduce the glitch effect that would be great i hate the skyrim style minimap so much a classic minimap on the corner would have been better for a game like this one i think im going to enjoy this gamea lot if its on steam its a deal wow omg this game its like an fps other things a video game crazy mashup think this will run decent on a gtx 970 its the bfgjust wish we got to see the aftermath looks generic as hell they are still a dissapointment yay new gameplay im so hyped for this game looks like a vast improvement over the first one im not feeling this tbh online co op massive doom meets borderlands vide here love it borderlands 3 the remaster of 1 and rage 2 heck of a looter shooter year ngl at first i thought whatever but the more gameplay i watch the better it looks honestly the game looks pretty cool the second reason i want a ps4 the first is doom mix of doom 2016 and bulletstormyawn this this is an orgasm for the eyes and eyegasm if you will i only clicked because i saw bfg 9000 in the trailer and i wad curious as to what the hell it was doing here instead of doom hooked the second i saw that dude fly away from the shotgun shot who here is still playing that shitty far cry cash grab crysis doom bulletstorm mad max rage 2 i prefer borderlands 3 to look like this looks interesting reminds me of bulletstorm and red faction guerrilla this game looks like one of the best fps games in recent time really hope it turns out this well double jump aerial dash holy war on christmas trees batman we got ourselves a fun game noone writes this is like dark souls so ign did you guys play this or did someone qualified play this cause i dont know this looks like a mixture of doom 2016 and far cry new dawn neato you have finished off that giant car boss wow they actually did put in the bfg game looks alright i wish youd tell us what platform this was recorded from old school is returning little by little these kinds of games need to be played in a hard difficulty so u can enjoywich i like loved mad max this is day 1 for me what a coop missed opportunity this needs a games journalist mode epileptic seizure inducing visuals when the character rages is a deal breaker for me ill pick it up if a mod comes out to remove that very promising all these creative ways to kill your enemy reminds me of destroy all humans i cant believe people actually thought this looked like borderlands borderlands 2 with realistic graphics it is like mad max had a baby with doom and farcry blood dragon is the preist looks quite cool but i dont like open world games that much usually they are boring so i hope it will not be similar to far cry all these tedious tasks but looking at map im afraid it will be controller aim xd kinda sad there are only 8 ish weapons 100 comments section in this video is basically insert video game to compare it to is it me or does the ai sounds like failsafe no coop no thanks they missed a huge opportunity here 100 will never buy or play this now disliked not cuz of rage but does the video quality seem off to anyone else seems lowered quality mad fall borderlands rage of doom farcry out max please subscribehttpsyoutubeuxny5wroi4i driving looks annoying and i guess there is alot of it bulletstrome an crysis had a baby so excited for this i wish this game was co op tbh we all would of enjoyed it alot more imagine being the guy working on the death animations except all your hard work is obscured by the fuckhuge skull and hit markers ehi thought this game was gonna be a huge spotlight but now im not so sure reminds me a lot of bulletstorm and duke nukem but so far i havent seen the thing that makes the game stand out like dukes humor or the bulletstorm story progression could be so wrong but it looks like it could get boring fast definitely not worth a preorder first person anthem is here stop comparing this game to other games theres nothing like it why do people say this is mad max when rage came out before mad max the executions are literally your character does a little wiggle and the enemy explodes its not badass in the slightest its got less effort in it than a fifa title nobody is gonna mention that the tutorial voice is the same as failsafe from destiny 2 disrespectful meh it looks just like a generic open world first person shooter fuckin hate health bars in shooting games is this going to be co op looks like way more fun than borderlands been playing borderlands 2 remastered and it gets sooooo repetitive nice but shoulda have put more time into generation zero its like doom mordern one mixed with bulletstorm mixed with mad maxglad they fixed the texture loading issues of the first game that fast running is dope destiny much oh hell yes bfg time baby yes this pleases me doom on crack take my money is it just me who thinks this looks boring af its like if doom and mad max combined i am totally grabbing this one basically doomjust causemad maxfar cry combined take my credit card why isnt the guy from far cry 3 blood dragon or someone pulling off the same style doing the players voice totally a missed oppurtunity d just cause 4 graphics but better i think rage 1 looks a better game still lol crosshair is too small the enemies still have sweet bread instead of intellect looks like something i would get bored of as soon as id buy it but will it look and play the same when it releases alright alright ill buy it 540 bear with me here open another tab and find the song two fingerssweden and play the song while watching the gameplay try and tell me that it doesnt heighten the experience its badass tbh if more games added licensed songs during gameplay like hotline miami did the game would be more enjoyable all around i am telling you looks pretty awesome would be cool if coop would be possible definitely gonna get it when it goes on sale lol so basically doom set in exotic locations with vehicles got it i really want this game it looks awesome ok im sold on this there will be a lot of cheats that will be used in this game so basically doom but set in a different timelinedimension anyone else remember how rage has the worst video game ending ever pepperidge farm remembers is this an epic exclusive or will it be in steam is that duke nukem voice actor remember your favorite game and your first kill at level 1 it was great guess what thats the most fun you will ever have in a game we are just chasing ghosts with the same old game formulas maybe in 50 years we will have something new hope there is a fov slider for consoles the battle of the greats rage 2 vs borderlands 3 quietly optimistic the first one was rubbish but this does look pretty cool looks nothing like the trailer downgrade era well what i can say you combined mad max doom released it on steam i bought thats the bloody deal so this is the same universe as doom awsome new gameplay everyweek on my channel the chase looks like its from blood dragon no everything looks like its from blood dragon this is rage in a bulletstorm formula period i really hope this pans out to be great hey look igns not playing this game looks insane i love it third person customisation common devs crysis bulletstorm rage 2 are people ever able to appreciate a new game without calling it a mashup of other games love this 056 was that sam riegel narrative concerns me cant wait for this ufff the game looks really blurry this looks like it will give borderlands 3 some competition for fps of the year i already have mad max borderlands and far cry new dawn this is gonna be wait for deep sale in 2 years for me this is exactly the type of game i need after a long stressful day the driving actually looks really tight and fun as well doom far cry rage from what ive seen im in take me money rage 2 and doom eternal count me in bethesda why does this look like something from last console generation i could have swear that i already seen this a while back looks dope but i hope we can turn hit markers off wth is this a t for teen game if they wouldnt have shown the title i swear i would have thought this was crysis bulletstorm shags with doom while mad max and far cry watching rage 2 wow this looks beautiful i love the first rage despite the ending im looking forward to this game btw solid in game music is it just me or does the voice actor sounds like peter parker from the amazing spiderman games this looks amazing farcry new dawn is that you the vegetation level looks awesome looks way better than the first rage this feels passable for a mobile game excluding grahpics off courseit is just another looter shooter imo me this is looking like it might be pretty fun epic store well i got some news for you the vehicle gameplay looks great but the first person shooting gameplay is plain they shouldve just made a new fallout game with this graphics if doom mad max and far cry had a baby and gave it lsd thatd be rage 2 can we have more uneven terrain vehicles sticking on the tracks does not feel great borderlandsepilepsy motion blur overdrive edition looks dope noseriously thoughthis game looks super fun despite the special effects is bit tooo much for the eyeshopefully it delivers and has options to turn off some of the effects cus surely i am not the only one gotten sick from seeing the gameplay while at the same time felt the hype lmao yea ill buy it especially for that bfg at the end reminds me of farcry anyone else get farcry vibs looks awesome but i dont know i mean where is the cash shop no loot boxeshmm might just pass on this the more i see the more generic it looks i want this over doom eternal lets do gameplay on a system that can run 4k xbox one x games like this really show off the polish of what the game engine can do i also love the colors utilized makes those 4k hdr televisions shine the world is incredibly detailed i will laugh very hard if this game turns out to be better than borderlands 3 do i hear sam regal 0227 allfather give me sight it literally looks like a sequel to bulletstorm nothing looks innovative here it looks like an average shooter and it looks too easy like the boomerang automatically attacks 3 targets that are highlighted it should not be that easy it looks like its as easy as the new doom which was so noob friendly just like this game seems to cater to the noobs and not the hardcore people like me i played and beat the original rage 5 times and let me tell you this game isnt even looking like a rage game it seriously is just looking like bulletstorm 2 with a mad max vehicle you can drive and in last day games has so unimmersive crosshair and hitmarkers you cant see nothing wtf bfg doing in there looks generic to be honest hope this is from the avalanche mad max team and not the just cause 3 and 4 team hitmarkers are too big this walker has the voice of a teenager just saying this looks super fun finding different ways to obliterate your enemies with different weapon abilities in an open world also made from dooms id software if only it had first person driving tps drive in a fps game kinda runis immersion the new doom game looks great i dont know but the gameplay looks like bulletstorm to me not the car sequence ofc is it just me or does the mutants seem like there ai has been downgraded maybe im crazy lot of unwanted clutter being rendered on screen makes my gtx 1050 cry todd should learn from the second part of bethesda the game seems very fun theres a lot of funny ways to kill your enemies xd looks super easy no challenge im out looks sweet cant wait to pick it up hey theres green on my mad max wow cool game environment unique looking characters who do you play as oh another white guy never seen that before that legit looked like the jungle from just cause 4 that kill marker is way too huge the new mad max looks great its its over wait its 9000 graphics look terrible almost blurry is this the same as having all gfx settings set to lowest in pc i really want to play this everyone else ps2 me wow i cant wait to play this amazing ps4 game edit cool i actually got 99 likes this time why is this video such poor quality its drowning in compression artifacts is it to hide the glaring pop ins and the sub par draw distance i have high hopes for this especially because i thought it was the team behind mad max who built the world but all that hard pop in reminds me of just cause 4 which is so ugly i cant even play it is this on base ps4 that will be 30fps right it still looks smooth af cant wait for the game there are not a lot of games out there that allows you to be a total action hero badass this is going to be one of those games for sure the game looks terrible on console 30 fps and the motion blur makes me sick best played on pc i loved the original rage for what it was however this one you guys lost me its too colorful too pinkish sad i didnt like doom 2016 physics i like cod and bf more realistic physics i already preordered this game so i hope the fps doesnt feel arcadish like doom people that played the beta of rage 2 hows the fps experience that popping in visuals is terrible this crysis but not rage where atmosphere rage 2 put a gator tag for us to play that game gotham record the datarage2 driving looks terrible than gta 3 are they going to keep adding content onto rage 2 italian gameplay on my channel very soon please tell me if you can see your characters legs when you look down wait does the game run at 30 fps or is it just this video more like rage 2x on account of sonys censorship shenanigans rage 2 looks epic on ps4 sorry the gamer community should have respect for each other because all of us play video games eh quick question when youre not in the mission you can still use the vehicles just free roam go around anywhere when you are not in the mission can you do that i thought they said the ps4 pro version was going to be 60 fps guess it looks like only 30fps on consolesnot worth buying its hilarious reading the comments most of you clearly dont know who this is thats playing it do you if you did you would know he plays his video games clearly tim just hasnt played rage 2 much forest details are enlarged to nonhuman size not normal ferns are 3x what is this the avatar took to long to release i dont like the lockon or aim assist just let me use mouse and keyboard also the hit markers are annoying this game can be great with coop why havent they added coop to it fps games are not made for controllers this guy has never played a game in his life it looks really bad on ps2 i feel like this game is going to be really repetitive nice video guys but fix the description x borderlands 3 who cares about this game anymore day one buy cant wait if youre going to show of gameplay as an advertisement at least get someone decent at the game to demonstrate this was just hard to watch and made the game look slow and boring and is it just me or does this game look stupidly easy im questioning whether i want to buy this or not now i was going to pass until i saw the flight portion i love games that give you horizontal and vertical gameplay image quality looks way too softblurry get this on pc or wait for the ps5 version non cover based fps are the best ones pre ordered the collectors edition and have a week off work for this game will be playing and streaming it all week last time i saw rainbow arrows for a waypoint was just cause 3 looks great cant wait looks awesome im just buying for the powers that fov makes my head hurt so theyre bringing the ps2 back boring playstation is for kids people say that the original xbox is ahead of its time what about the ps2 eh watching video on highest settings way everything looks out of focus blurry everybody here must be so proud of their originality when making a ps2 joke this looks super promising i think rage 2 is built on the updated doom engine it might be safe to say that this is what we can expect from the new doom sequel this year saints row doom is going to feel suspiciously similar when it comes out little bit downgrade but im wondering about pc yeah my ps2 still working next gen ps2 graphics i hope i can remove those purple arrow markers they look terrible cant wait to get my ps2 out again this looks pretty dope this is a decent looking ps2 title but have you played black kinda working off of the far cry formula pretty much then this is unbelievable how ps4 still handle it in 2019 ad six years almost seven old console pc after six years its a total garbage rage 2 gameplay 9510 soundtrack 9310 graphic 9810 game recycling 1010 i still have ps2 its pretty dusty better clean it up the guy playing is really badhe doesnt switch gunsprioritize targets or watch his ammohe really needs some practice doom and jc4 bet this is gonna be an epic exclusive might have to buy all upcoming titles on console this video makes me want to get the game day one is the deluxe version worth paying 20gbp more tho any lasers weapons playable why would you get someone to interview a developer about a sequel who hasnt played the original sloppy af gameplay at least i can see a bit more of the world he says covers for wimps or whatever then immediately went and did it sick game tho im buying 2 framerate is brutal i swear almost 99 of game journalists never play games on a regular basis this plays alot like atomic heart hate the backseat gaming i keep hearing a woman grunting is the main character customizable edit looked it up and you can thats so sweet new buff for the ps2 this cant be a games journalist he knows how to jump any battle royale here this is a ps2 game gotta get my ps2 from the box maybe next time verry verry verry easy mode this game from watching it looks like it would be more farcry then anything else borderlands 3 is goin to eat this game the effects of fire and smoke look awesome overall im very impressed reminds me of doom and far cry mixed together definitely a day one buy is the gameplay from the ps2 slim with hdr or the fat ps2 i cannot stand thr color change in overdrive with how often you go into overdrive mode it distorts the color and makes the game almost nauseating i like how he says dont peek around covers but then does that so the most important question is it 60 fps on console great graphics for a ps2 game hehe who needs a ps5 ps2 is running great i get a headache from this blurry image quality rage 2 like doom 2016 20 i just want borderlands 3 nothing more nothing less wow it looks so bad on ps4 pro guess im going with pc ps2 had they biggest comeback not soulja boy a female character maybe we can customize your character like fallout 4 when does he say ps2 can you see the legs of the ranger if you look down like in halo the video quality is very bad am more exited for jedi fallen order but am gone still play this game this game looks and plays better than athem which am disappointed this yr off best graphic ps2 game so far i like how boss fights are not too easy and requires tactical approach not just straight shooting ign be like this game is graphically ahead of its time 310 not enough rage low res textures in 2019 delicious ahhhh great wow the ps2s graphics are even better than the ps3 the weapon wheel looks like a replica from doom the graphics looks like ps2 version 510 made by alia the gameplay is pretty much doom reskin with bioshock super power ill buy it read the description idiots ps2 was hotter than xbox tho why so less guns literally just one gun per type no modifications underwhelming rage 2 hits ps2 may 14shoot traveled to wrong time but man are these graphics insane i wonder what ps1 graphics look like game is not about hiding behind cover 438 hyper cannon ie rail gun love how they use fancy words for an old school weapon those purple waypoint directions are distracting it was a bad choice to let this guy play their new game so thats what girl walker sounds like is there coop or multiplayer the guy who play this is such a bot looks amazing for a ps2 game this looks like its gonna be such a dope game im so hyped wow really ps2 soooo never mind 1500 that fire pistol is insane yes so its another run around map collecting things game look i like farcry and similar games just as much as the next gamer but idk i guess i just have collect items on an open world map fatigue nice lighting and environment design surprised its running this well thought it was idtech6 engine but its running avalanches own apex engine you know when your player is bad when the developer has to tell you how to play lol it only took you a couple of tries the developer is probably thinking for people at home its really a fun game trust me that popin jfc lol whos grandma wrote the description ps2 stronger than xbox one whoever was playing was so frustrating for the devs to be honest why this game look like a crysis sequel the driving looks really stiff but other than that it looks amazing for a ps2 game rage 1 for me was boring af it put me to sleep every time i play it so color full 80s style doom and rage 2 are amazing i wish that they used actual players to demonstrate those games ppl who know how to play a game and enjoy it not those stupid teenagers who does not have a clue about the game mechanics and video games in general never knew my ps2 could handle this so glad they managed to hit that 60 fps mark much rather that over 4k this just proves ps2 will never die watching someone with no situational awareness be told exactly what to do is annoying but im happy to see more rage cant wait for days gone gameplay insert comment trying to be funny by joking that this game is a mix of doommadmaxjust cause shooting enemies with ashotgun from afar is this guy from ign or something smh why everyone in the comments are saying the game in ps2 is it a joke or what ps2 making a comeback i totally get it ive called the ps4 the ps2 before because it reminds me of that era no 60fps footage next halo game in ps4 really cant wait to read up up how censored this is oh wait its just obscene amounts of gore and no wahmen except the staple female protagonist option you never see sony says thats ok i want to play this so bad but those colors are too much arkham knight 2 whats underground supposed to mean rage 2 is about as underground as the eiffel tower id software fps avalanche studios open world rage 2 days gone mortal kombat 11 im buying all 3 anyway but at this very moment im most pumped for rage 2 man they really pushed boundaries with the ps2 here that finger snap is like fullmetal alchemist bought my collectors edition my ps2 is very happy no love for the ps1 far cry new dawn was pink colour too im glad im still gaming on my ps2 ill definitely get this ill shall own rage 2 but can i holster my weapon max settings 1440p 30 fps on my monster pc ryzen 7 1700 16 gb ddr4 3200mhzcl15 gs kill rip jaws gtx 970 g1 gaming dellp2416d 24 2560x1440 60z ips i will kill them all buying this for my ps2 day one lovely video especially when supporting ps2 the macro blocking compression however is horrid man i cant wait to play this game looks fun this game looks cool console plebs complaing about graphics omegalul you are running a 6 year old technology idiots honestly looks very boring just appears like the rest of bethesda games such as wolfenstein and doom dont buy this lazy reskin rage 2 for the ps2 nice lets go even after 14 years ps2 is still getting games lol what a beast of a console xd why would you not show off that this game runs at 60fps on ps4 pro can we get a video where you choose between male and female walker and change your appearance thanks wow playstation 2 when this better not be an anthem case anyone see that farcry rope at 1340 one of these guys sounds like tim turi from gameinformer man im happy its on ps2 just looks a little disorienting but this game on average looks you can see that avalanche studio has a weak apex engine the game suffers from the texture of just cause 4 better to make a smaller world but which will be nicely presented skipping the fact that rage 2 nohow has a climate of rage why are not asking about multiplayer this game looks great it looks greata little bit of doom in a open world when you show off a game you usually want to show it off with someone who knows how to play the game right cant wait for this game wow i love how much ps2 graphics have improved i didnt know it was possible for such old hardware buying a ps2 tomorrow hey playstation im a huge fan of ur consels they say its not a cover heavy kind of shooter then a minute later they encourage the demonstrator to use a cover based play style those are pple from game informer i know guys are playing with gamepad but come on aiming is not that hard hand the controller to someone that actually knows how to play can somebody explain the joke about this being a ps2 game the creators of doom v rage 2 hits ps2 ma 14 this shouldve been fallout 4 sony bringing back the ps2 im so happy that i didnt sell my ps2 the ps2 has come a long way just finished ffxii rage 2 is a combination of doom 2017 mad max and cyberpunk 2077 was interested in this game until i read that their treating it as a game for a service ill just save money instead wow ps2 gameplay of doom and mad max with just cause graphics glad to see sony still supporting the ps2 is that just me or is the fov verry low i cant wait rage 2 hits ps2 may 14 from the description looks dope for a ps2 game id next stop playstation underground station this is my comment thanks for all your support on this video i will be uploading a walkthrough of the full game at launch also looks worse than the first one now it looks like every other game out wonder if this will come out for the switch like doom did playing days gone rn but this might be my next game no comentary pleaseeee look like far cry new dawn but in modern version i recently got this game and honestly its not bad so far ugh always so annoying watching a consoler play an fps game the looking around is so uncomfortable how the fuk do you monkeys play fps games like that gross can i play this one without playing the second one just got it yeasterday im kinda bumbed cause no multiplayer like i thought they said they would have is it me or is the gunplay a little bit slow all i got from this was you like saying insane is there only 1 assault rifle thats all i see in any gameplay thats lame and shit if they couldnt make more then 1 gun the whole gamen anyone else here feel that rage one was just a crappy boarder lands rip off its idnot i ddumbass what happened to the amazing gore effects it looks like they reduced the violence drastically this game will tide me over until mhw iceborne and borderlands 3 driving looks like shit not buying literally looks like a rc car emersion breaker i dont like the pink in this game just think of what bulletstorm 2 couldve been it wouldve been magnificent this game reminds me of bulletstorm me and sequel have serious beef i hope it has everything from rage with new additions looks boring as hell empty wilderness uncreative weapon design rinse and repeat dungeons only silver lining is that its pretty what a disappointment i have a feeling its gonna get repetitive really quick like far cry 5 played it for a week and never picked it up again i hope im wrong though is there any challenge in this game my heart rate went up when playing doom but i can watch netflix while playing this game i was watching this to get a feel for the game and help me decide if i should buy or not and no offense but your gameplay was less than enticing im not meaning the game itself but how you played it was very vanilla i mean no offense but i literally watched for 30 mins before you used a different weapon than ar and shotgun i didnt even know you had a pistol you eventually pulled it out but didnt bother to use it i watch these gameplay videos to see the diversity and get an idea of how it feels i was less than impressed by what i saw you may have used other weapons closer to the end of the video but i wouldnt know because i got bored of watching why every time they do gameplay trailer they fucked it up by letting a noob playing the game congrats to anyone who gets it boom boom boom 858 hot fucking shit this looks great damn was hoping that wed see the best parts of rage return with the tight level design small arsenal interesting areas and the more focussed but more interesting take on open world looks like were actually just getting an avalanche version of far cry oh well at least the bro gamers get another generishooter seems too easy all enemies die in one shot dude rarely takes more than a quarter of damage in life no skill builds lack of loadouts variety of weapons abilities progression traveling from one hub to the next to farm rep off easy mobs seems so boring bethesday launcher always redirects to the deluxe edition shady showing us exciting totally new game play footage from exactly the same jungle area we have seen few weeks now from every preview its ok but dont be a twat and say things thats not true mate dont be like ign and other fake news big game media house hopefully you can disable that motion blur can you disable arrows on the road looks naff looks ripetitive af go to point a destroykill everything then go to point b c and d and do the same if bulletstorm and doom 2016 had a baby rage 2 im spotting so many bugs that are not exactly game breaking but they are very noticeable and could cause issues too much hud clutter and that horrible hitmarker remove it this game is going to get slaughtered with horrible reviews and it should just for example among other things 1952 hes driving that motorcycle through water and the water acts like glass not even a ripple let alone a big ass splash you would expect wish this was a better game we shouldnt need a huge update later on to add better graphics also that cyclops thing is a straight rip off from both doom and duke nukem crysis vs far cry nothing more d damn this game looks fun man it is one expensive game looks so generic that i hate it gotta love next gen console gameplay that cannot even hold 30fps it hurts my head to watch can you turn off the highlighted path while driving or rather im hoping the ui can be totally customized which it most likely is everyone is on this ha i wish the foliage moved when you drove over it can you turn off those ugly hit markers i know what im fucking hitting always great when motion blurr exists the more i watch the more i just want this game the framerate haha you sounds like harry potter when you talk about your game p thumps up p it aint a raw gameplay when i have to hear your shitty commentary motion blur yuck so many people in this comment section really need to find a new hobby looks like complete trash just like the first one i see theyve already downgraded it this gameplay looks nothing like the initial gameplay reveal last year its the same old boring shit weve had for years nothing new at all fuck this garbage for a game that seems to have tons of potential it sure seems generic as fuck of course they make a second one when i stopped playing video games it just looks like ubisoft trash why would anyone bother with this shit developed by id great great now wheres the catch in partnership with avalanche ah this video is a 35 minute long ad already bought the fucking game you need a new pair of thumbs youre so bad at shooters i like how hes being curious in the gameplay i d bro its id software looks so boring soooo i am chuck norris so much pop in graphics looks good otherwise and i hope it turns out good aweful lot of lag and pop in for a completed game if it didnt have the special power shit i would probably buy it i just dont like stuff like that all ya need is guns man lol some parts of the ui look cheap that will annoy me looking at it popin looks terrible wait till next gen another dull game tommy what wait youre a ranger named walker are you from texas too 35 minute commercial are you kidding me edit and it plays just like any other shooter released in the last decade looks better granted but its just rehashed old doom with vehicles what borderlands 3 should have been my pc will be chugging more than a train hope this wont turn into a pay to win game cant trust these companies ffs i think ill pick this game up i liked the original this looks fun and it could hold me over until borderlands 3 comes out looks a little too easy looks good cant wait for bethesda to fuck it up somehow man do i hate it when games do a giant overlay on the ground when youre driving annoys the hell out of me farcry5 but in the future just cause but first person destiny but better abilities and less weapons doom but less hardcore game looks great despite you doing your best to make it look not so with the way you played it i wish they made it more fast paced like doom like why is there even a sprint mechanic imagine how awsome it would be to be as fast as in a doom game but with an open world s it just me that saw the fps drop from time to time hoping that s just a demo issue because these guys are running the game on crazy hardware and to have fps drops on that hw s worry some how long until clearing camps gets old is there enough here to keep things fresh and interesting im lost right new the game looks excellent but what happened to the savage world where it wasnt soo pretty what i want to know is whether or not random encounters take place when you get out of the vehicle and wonder around the wasteland that was my biggest complaint with the original game the world felt empty oh shit its bethesdaprobably going to get motion sickness then in a couple years the gotye will be 20 for a sealed yfold copy ill bite then thanks in advance to all of you fine gentlemen for paying full price and beta testing the game for me wait till it comes out than watch reviews i dont trust this game developers anymore these days looks kind of boring that game from a solo developer seemed more action packed i think ill just wait fir borderlands that texture popin though looks pretty generic to me pass i hope they fix the texture pop in and shadow filteringvery off putting this guy plays like a potato i preordered the collectors edition i cant wait for this is like mixed of apex and doom with cry engine hmm looks like crysis graphics why i think this new rage 2 look look like crysis remaster at the first battle when use the power and shooting this is the type of world nier should have had just with robots vehicles etc this looks so so good game looks great whenever i dont have to see that shade of pink unfortunately that pink is almost always present call me old fashioned but this is pure style over substance plus how many more postapocalyptic shooting gallery filled mutant saturated wastelands do you wanna waste your time with if people keep buying recycled ideas then companies will keep feeding you this bullshit huge bust its not co op boring thnx for saving my money playing with a controller and lack of creativity makes this game look worse than it is looks like a revamped apex legends to me fun the ki is no danger at anytimehope that gets better in the final game fps with controllerjeeez i am really hyped for this game i played rage 1 a lot i wont be able to play it on release day but will be able to in about 2 weeks but i felt the urge to dig out the old xbox 360 and fire up rage 1 that game was so amazing for its time the first time i played on 360 was a few years ago now and i bought it preowned in cex for 1 i hadnt ever heard of it and i wasnt expecting much from a 1 game but i was so wrong i spent more time playing that first rage than a lot of other big title games waiting for that acg review oh christ how is bethesda going to fuck this up with microtransactions and other bullshit i remember when they were one of the best game developers in the world known for their great games and love of the art now theyre just a bunch of hacks this does look pretty but damn im almost afraid to play it lest i be disappointed again by those mother fuckers madmax doom open world ill wait until its on a steam sale so crisis 4 everybodys wrong this is rage 1s and mad maxs baby im getting this if u want a high end action game u come to the right place looks sic wish i had a ps4 pro 60 f per sec but 30 frames per second looks good imagine this game on ps5 hope that comes out next year i will pay 500 4 it if its more i might wait a while but its going to make xbox1 x look like a sega mega drive i hope its got some indoor parts like old 1 did i passed on days gone to get this give me a thumbs up if u think i did the right thing looks like its action packet just what i like bet this will be hard on hard mode i will play on normal to start with till i get use to stuff then next play thorough be on hard mode one of the things that annoyed me about the first one was that its was supposed to be open world but it had limitations to that certain doors or areas could not be reached until you fit a certain criteria also i wish we were able to create our own characters also that racing was an option and not mandatory to reach the next phase of the game wait for reviews cant wait to play this next week yeah glad i skipped that far cry game earlier this year this seems much better i finally realized that the female ai voice actress is the same as failsafe from destiny 2 works for me will this have mods like the others bethesda games personally not a fan of the pink color palette not like the original but oh well this guy sucks at playing video games please buy yourself a pop filter be careful bethesda made this game might wanna reconsider if you dont know what im talking about just youtube search the fall of 76 ai needs some worki spotted at least two bots which just stood there staring into the distance instead of fighting this is looking good im glad i preordered now lolit is not rage 2it is doom in open wolrdvery bad but it is ok for school boys rage 1 was better in gameplay and feelings rage 2 is fucking facepalm what a wickedly original looking game with never before seen abilities and gameplay he says with complete and utter sarcasm its far cry newest dawn with steroid usage just wished it gave you the choice of choosing between first and third person the way most bethesda games do getting this on pc i honestly fucking hate that we never get third person games like this anytime we get a third person game its some simple hack and slash bs i want a game like rage 2 cyberpunk etc that is in third person and i want it to also focus on melee and gun gameplay like warframe but clearly thats a pipe dream all we ever get are first person shooters over and over what system you playing it on gaystation 4 lmao pc master race 4k 60 baby waiting patiently everyone keeps inserting there favorite games into what they think this is going to be like sorry to break it to you kids but its going to be nothing more than 1st person just cause the game looks amazing cant wait till i get it posted through my door on release day it looks genericlike all other shoters those days this game is trying so hard to be borderlands this will keep me busy until borderlands 3 comes out on steam piiiiink square buildings everywhere superpowers empty environments this is not rage this is a commercial tasteless thing hope the money will allow them to make rage 3 better than the first cause the second one is pure bullshit but pink the bullshit how is the gunplay is it as smooth as call of duty it looks super clean ok but its not id its id which is a term freud came up with to represent our more base desires its really fitting for the kinds of games id makes only i find it similar to any other game out there thats not hyping me at all instead borderland 3 does or age of empire 4 does all other games are just some sort of copy and paste mechanics preordered and paid for unlike most people i am willing to roll the dice and spend money on the game ive been watching dont need a review to determine what ill enjoy great video my friend looks good but they should have called it something else this isnt rage seems to be lacking the rpg elements of rage 1 more fps and very fast motion like doom its not jumping out at me i will wait a bit press a to win the game wait there are even pink arrows on the dirt road to show you where to go im was hopeful for this but everything i see makes me discouraged the pop in of textures and shadows is annoying to say the least its like they put too much shadows in but it cant be rendered in time doom combat and ambiance in an open world looks own worthy this game its ok i cant wait to start destroying people with the bfg off doom this game in my opinion will be a game of the year for me this game looks like crackdown on steroids hm too much doombulletstorm too little original rage shooter gameplay looks fun captures that shooter power fantasy vibe that we want from these types of games the only slightly underwhelming thing is the jungle environment everything looks deathly still and too orderly road framed by exactly the same types of smaller shrubs overshadowed by the same huge trees it really feels like it was made in a map editor and they just repeated shrub a b and c and treetype 1 2 3 not a leaf moves nothing stirs dirt road is very smooth it just breaks the immersion a little bit as opposed to fc5witcher 3 which make their environments feel more authentic for their respective universes ya man rageborderlands will hv my undivided full attention fps r bk in fashion well it looks promising but its published by bethesda who have a history with buggy glitchy game releases so ill wait and see woww sublime shooter looks and play purfect a gem cool im waiting for this game not so many enemies around hmm already 015 seconds in and im seeing really crappy falloutesque textures reminds me of bulletstorm graphics look like anthem or even better gameplay is doom x crysis 3 is this console or pc i have preordered rage 2 already and im so ready to get started looking forward to buy it i will wait to see what news we will have at e3 this year if nothing get my interest i will buy rage 2 looks fun as hell nice gameplay did they changed engines it looks like crysis 3 farcry 5 i feel the first one had a nicer feel to it what specs are you running on the console pc you are recording with you are bad at this game looks like they lied again about open world seems pretty linear to me just like that last one super stoked for this game this will help hold me over until doom eternal yay it has microtransactions is it multiplayer for some reason jungle type environments are my absolute favorite type of environments in video games i havent been this amped for a game in a long while can i least change the race please no more white protagonist this and borderlands 3 will have me by the balls this year ugh yeah looks like a modified open world doom cant wait to play you can really see this generation of consoles coming to a end when the frame sips of the shaders have to reset but im still amazed on how good it will look for yall console gamers i hope i can disable that terrible hitmarker looks like i know what my next game purchase is gonna be hopefully bethesda adds mods the driving looks so unsatisfying fuck a jungle game where you drive over plants and nothing happens wow what a love for detailits 2019 i wish hed hush so i could watch the game god damn that game has some horrible ass slowdowns get ready for the downgrades kinda like far cry made a baby with doom i think im gonna get this game looks awesome and thanks for the video man cant wait for this game was a huge fan of the first one cant wait for this great video tommy takes a fist full of cocaine and shoves into face and inhales ok heres the plan we take the doom guy put him in mad max world and give him more guns more superpowers and make all that look like it was made by a coke head this game looks good but would be even better if this was multiplayer narrative could of been halo open worldbut yea imma mute the music when i get this looks so much more bgrade watching actual gameplay than what was shown in the trailers looks good love the gun in the game play reminds me of fifa 19 will there be multiplayer or no what version of doom is this i just preordered this game and i am absolutely pumped to play it wonder when im gonna see someone use a mouse and keyboard setup for this 134 guy just spawns after you get there when is the shooter genre gonna take a page out of the from soft book and give us a challenge im so sick of just mindlessly shooting shit and being untouchable the shooter genre needs step it up and give us a challenge for once im not buying another booster shooter the only this its got going for it is the boomerangs i played tie on the wii so i already have done enough boomerangs so im giving my wallet a break bad reviews incoming why this doesnt look like rage not even close this looks like a whole new ip christ what the hell is this i hope there will be races vehicle upgrades arenas and a lot more like in first rage the graphics look bad already and why is it in lush areas i loved the desert like in rage 1 sometimes after a hard days work i like to just relax and shoot stuff this look like that kind of a game and honestly i like it so easy too give it a month itll be on sale for 4999 the 3999 then 2499 then in 6 months psn plus free these graphics man jesus pretty sure im gonna listen to pantera the entire time i play this game this doesnt looks as id game at all this is a just cause with new skin weapons are shit combat looks like a fucking puppets in official trailers combat was meaty but this the map is very very little so i dont understand is this your typical kind of singleplayer uncover the question marks and kill everything game or are there some rp elements in this like character creation faction allegiance branching dialogue etc wastes ammo shooting crate to get ammo gamer logic i like how ids not shy about using bass in their games everything from guns to abilities always has this bombastic thump and feel that make playing the game feel awesome give me shotgun so i can make it go boom same with doom i understand you dont want to show a lot of dying on these types of demos but playing on the easiest setting just makes the ai look dumb hard to feel like a bad ass with slim to no challenge at all i say show clips on the hard difficulty and crank up the health of the player at least we can get an idea of the punishment inflicted while playing i do like the fact that they have made another rage but i fell in love with rage because it was different and looked post apocalyptic this is not either different or apocalyptic in my opinion but to be honest it looks a lot of fun maybe its the presentation that is putting my off it will probably feel different when i play it loved the first one this looks way too garish as for all that silly neon this game looks great for 20 game looks fun and this too may be nit picky but why do the enemies disappear so fast after death ruins immersion for me but ill still be getting this lol if the health doesnt regenerate im buying game looks awesome but lets face it other than art style this is borderlands 3 minus the gun variety and it is much smaller dont get me wrong i am getting rage 2 it does look great but only because the release timing works extremely in their favor this will tide me over until bl3 and then i probably wont play it anymore unless the promises of a changing world prove true thenmaybe in the end ill be brutally honest everything between now and the release of cyberpunk 2077 is a tidemeover gun play looks really nice im definitely getting this looks fun i just hope that as the game progresses the enemy mobs become larger similar to later missions in doom i want carnage but combat in these camps seems like you only engage a few enemies at a time another far cry pass this is a worse version of borderlands it doesnt even have co op online 2019 and we r still making single player open world games ctfu trash if this was co op online id def buy it but its not so pass its like doom farcry and mad max had a cocaineinduced threeway love it price for this game will drop harder than the framerate loved the first game the ideas were all there stoked for this one just watching this gameplay got me hookedimagine when i start playing it cant wait my opinion on the game is what it has always been this looks like a game i would expect from avalanche studios avalanche does not make horrible games but they dont really make great games either in my opinion avalanche just makes real safe generic forgettable games mad max was a good game maybe this will surprise me like madmax did holy pop in its beautiful tho who the fuck actually plays with motion blur on ready for downgrade one more trash futuristic game id love this as a multiplayer i hope if you get out the cars and have a wander off the set path theres actually stuff to donot just empty space between outposts with a world like this it would be a huge shame not having random encountersmissionsfights as long as games like this exist i will continue to be fat gotta love the fps drops on console that sky is actually extremely impressive driving is long boring and lifeless considering it looks like most of the time it will be doing just that then fuck it was interested now il wait for a sale does this game have storymode because my playstation plus expired few days ago and my dad said he will buy it later so please tell me if this game requires playstation plus to play thank you i cant wait for this looks fun i will enjoy it thanks for posting this gameplay video of rage 2 it looks like fun but i refuse to preorder due to the fact that many new games have loads of problems when they first get released past experience has taught me to just wait a few months until after a game releases to buy it in the meanwhile im playing the first rage on steam do you think that rage 2 will have a free trial weekend on steam several months after release bulletstorm did all this and more years ago im very excited to play rage 2 as it has id associated with it and im close to buying it on steam but do you think its worth full price definitely worth 35 at gamestop not gonna lie the game looks lit as fuck but hopefully the open world isnt as bland as just cause games i want side missions and a good story that will keep me playing the game i hope you find the old dude from the first game somewhere this is raging in the wild an animal planet documentary by tommyt999 my 1 x is ready looks very repetitive wolf2 really spoiled me with player shadows ah well we cant have everything i dont like these vibrant colours theyve gone with i prefer the dull less colourful look of the first game still looks good tho the fact that i didnt like rage as much as i didnt like it makes me so indifferent about this game please tell me there is an option to turn off those purple chevrons on the road whoever was playing is such a noob wheres the story im getting this next week preorder baby this game looks sick he talk with extra ch word lol im so hyped for this this is doom ima pass i didnt see nothing too extravagant looks like alot of repetition framerate is all over the place oh yeah i am all in stoked cant wait gunplay reminds me of brink for some reason some of those frame rates dont look to good ill wait until this gets a few patches i hope theres stuff to do besides just shooting and driving it seems like the apocalypse never happens in a first game all that atmosphere was lost and these saturated colors do not match anything with what was the previous game they are worried about copying recent games and made the game much different from the original im getting this game it kind of look like far car 5 in a way i like the world i played the first one but really press x to climb a ladder now this would be a great br it looks like a realistic borderlands guy talks like he took a smack rip i cant believe that ive ignored this game this whole time im all in all that texture and shadow popping puts me off i think it needs more work tbh whats with all the pinkcerise is it supposed to be nuclearchemicallystained or something this got on my nerves in the last far cry are they hoping to attract the ladies i loved the last rage game and i am sure pink aside i will enjoy this one that headshot crunch sound mmmmmmmmmmmmmm hi did the game launch via steam or bethesda launcher thanks i may be a bit nitpicky but im sad to see that plantsbushes does not seem to move or react when driving through them the game looks cool tho it looks amazing but i prefer eye divinecybermancyless amusement park and much better atmospherea world that has a meaning and presencetho original doom quake had that atmosphere and mystery that modern games like this lacks deeplyalso the enemies are very monolitic in their attacks there is no really strategy comparing with the original doom and quake when each enemy had their on set of attacks and mixing them together offered a constant source of varietystill it looks impressive and i love the screams of the mutants but in the end i wouldnt trade heroes for ghostsi hat that pinky idea that tell you what you can touch where you have to gois really childish everything is amazing except driving and cars i buy it when its 10 euros in july he said superkind lol damn good word havent thought that one before the graphics look terrible go here clear out an outpost go here clear out an outpost go here

an outpost go here c what borderlands 3 should of delivered a remastered of rage along with this game wouldve been an awesome move again another massive open world to be just a time waster to get from one spot to the next is this pc or xbox one footage i like the style of this game but the gameplay looks too boring omg this looks fun ive never heard of it til now this game has everything imo i like the verticality of it its not just flat ground for mile after mile i can see a lot of hidden places to find i dont usually pre order games but i did with this too bad this is just another shooter it will be fun but no cover system no blocking mechanics no insane movement abilities just an open world shooter with updated graphics next gen is just a disappointment nothing crazy innovative just a run and gun the most boring thing about shooters you just shoot the whole games yeah a couple abilities thats it no epic battle music during boss fight i dont like that bethesda being the publisher i ll have to wait all full review from independants skill up angry joe etc to be honest but it looks to be a nice iteration between far cry and destiny at first look damn this is better than cod zombies but its a full game hope theres an fov slider cant wait for this game also would you guys still bang loosum in this game i would still hit it httpswwwpcgamesncomwpcontentuploads201901rage2herocharacterjpg ok id we all know you can make a great single player fps i would love to see what kind of multiplayer driven fps you guys could make yea i know doom had multi but that wasnt the focus another boring and meaningless chewing gum from avalanche ok why is that car so tiny compared to the plants trees there are ferns 2x the size of the car wtf why havent there been a game with rainbow six type enemies forza or gt like driving and open world like gta made yet i mean dont get me wrong this looks cool and all but its just missing that finesse is that type of game even possible with current hardwaresoftware i mean picture this you drive to a location on the map with a vehicle that feels like youre driving to a place where you have two types of enemies some brainless and others are strategic now thats the type of game i want to see made i was so hyped but i feel they should have slowed it down a bit same reason i left new doom alone combat to fast to enjoy i always liked the first one in face i bought it again for xbox 1 for 10 bucks i think it was it was a little short but not too short just wish it was a bit longer hope this one is longer ill get it for sure already pre ordered it soooo excited bruh i watched this whole 35 minute gameplay waiting for you to show us overdrive the veins in my forehead were pulsating as i just saw that overdrive meter begging to be used butnup regardless cheers for the drop cant wait to pick up my ultimate edition pre order i would buy this game if they dint fill it with car drive mode its crap the rest awesome the car crap well crap fallout pandora v looks like alotta of reoccurring quests like the settlement missions of fallout 4 looks a litle bit too easy i think it looks way too 2013 for my tastes i hope there is a toggle for that ads dof this game just looks outrageously amasing every time it is shown anyone know if rage 2 has floating damage text option i liked the first rage but this is on another levellooks gorgeousgunplay looks greatbeen looking forward to this and its a day one purchase for me why is punching the ground able to kill multiple enemies thats ridiculous and purple arrows everywhere you go is annoying and whats with all the gay pink colours everywhere so far its good i mean rage 1 was the best but the second game has better graphics and maybe a better story line but im not sure though but i want to get it badly but first i want to beat the first game needs to be played on pc that fov is vomit inducing the hitmarkers and red skull is obnoxiousreally shitty i hope you can turn it off the car reminds me of the vehicle in the moon patrol game looks like copy and paste of farcry completely ruined the dark atmosphere of the first rage which i absolutely loved what a real shame its a mix between doom 2016 and bulletstorm ea and people can fly 2011 get a fuckin pop filter m8 other than that good video look forward to this game hopefully has a better ending can you stop talking with speed burst sorry man but your awful at this game lol i didnt know now post apocalyptic was real this looks amazing dont like the protagonists voice he always sounds like hes overdoing it and it still looks more like a mad max bulletstorm mashup what are the specs on ps4 60 fps why are youtubers such shit at gameplay gonna be a dislike for me dog i dont see why people are so okay with mediocre games like this recently the game looks beautiful and im not gonna bash ids ability to make a phenomenal shooter but the ai is atrociously bad the fights already look repetitive and boring drive here use shotgun to one shot weak enemies overwhelmed use abilities with ridiculously short cool downs post apocalyptic open world games were becoming a dime a dozen even when the first game released and here it is nearly a decade later more popular and dried out then ever just slap on some terrible driving mechanics so the worlds seem bigger though yet still empty and stretch the game out a few more hours in length ill give them points for having a beautiful lucious foliage to look at instead of all barren desert but even then its kind of more of a hindrance cant see around foliage or small paths leading to objectives vehicle doesnt turn well and gets stuck on bumpy foliage when you miss paths i love open worl in the 1st rage u literally only had ur gun bombs and boomerangs no special movement like the enemies who can take cover and jump tables now ur armed to the freaking tee and u have better movement i cant wait to play this game looks boring as shit looks generic to methe player is just too overpowered and the enemy ai is so dumb also the glitch effect are hurting my eyes i am starting to eyeball the hell out of this game cringe and yikes man my visa carte is in the red preordered days gone and rage two bought shadow die twice spiderman metro exodus rdr ii resident evil two remastered shadow die twice metro exodus re ii and one of my fav game ever rdr ii are great games no doubts buy thoses very good games i gonna wait for the division two and try to finish the first opus who is an exellent game with all thoses updates and dlc this game is very complet with a huge content and not expanssive at all im the only one who think spider man is a little bit overrated i mean he is a good game but not as good as announced imo sorry for my english language i dont know speak english so far absolutely love the combat ad the fact its a bigger game but only issue i have so far if that it looks too cartoonish like boarderlands hated that game but im willing to give this one a chance since i absolutely love the first game and still play it till this day dont disappoint me since i already am getting it does anyone know if the cheat codes you get in the game disable achievements oh my god why isnt he using his abilities you can be using all these abilities constantly this is what mad max should have been bethesda hook me up with a pre release copy ill review it and wont have this annoying british trying to sound all legit person making people not wanting to watch the darn video game looks sick i love the scale of the landscape those trees are huge and so are the mountains and cliffs and vistas i hate worlds that are unrealistically small ac origins was great with vast empty deserts and scale im seeing that here too and i like oh look guys we got a troll here named space man i try to make some simple points about rage 2s driving mechanics and tell him that there is car combat i also tell space man that he should try gr wildlands if he wants to experience a game with bad driving and that real animals dont fit in with rage 2s scifi environments space man then says im angry and i bet you preordered it like a loser consmer sheep haha i then flamed his ass good and told him that i am not a sheep or angry space man then says that im a 13 yr old for cussing him out well sir you desrved it he then says i only projekt red games and elder scrolls i dont get into hype about newest trash heap ok space man so every game ever made and being made sucks if it isnt made by projekt red or an elder scrolls game bullshit fyi space man im 42 and have over 200 games in my collection i unlike you know what a great game is this pos space man probably stopped with elders scrolls 1 and declared the gun play looks very satisfying way too over powered i have a feeling this is 1 of those games u just want to 100 and get every bit of juice it has to offer im feeling optimistic i am calling it repetetive garbage 710 i was so addicted to rage1 on ps3 hope bethesda has a winner and not full of glitches like fallout 4 am i the only think same grahic style as just cause 4 my worry is that it will become repetitive and feel kind of samey for each location and mission does it actually have a proper story also each location is nice but it seems the rest of the world is just about getting to next location not much go off the beaten path to discover a secret etc its a shooter after all good video is there an option to disable or reduce the overdrive effect that could give some people fits can you holster your weapons day one buy for pc xbox one x preordered the collectors edition cant wait to play this game on my rtx 2080ti wow frame rate drops and pop in console version right is this doom 20 the map size is perfect the gunplay is much improved from an already amazing foundation and the graphics look very current gen with the colors really poppingto sum it up this game will be fucking sick has this got multiplayer i wonder why this one isnt a wasteland like the first i thought the world was destroyed by a meteor what a good long and showing video there are many things to like about the game i think the look of the landscapes the sounds and details such as the ranger pulling out his sidearm when targeting stuff on the raptor bike not to mention the combat and design of npcsenemies love it why dont you spoil the whole fucking thing why dont ya idiot goose big youtubers and twitch peoples pc runs smooth like butter my pc arrrrrrrrggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh helicopter noise intensifies can you turn off the call of duty like hit markers that appear when you kill enemy ai definitely needs an upgrade why is the framerate so slow awesome graphic this is sick great gameplay howd the difficulty feel was it challenging my worry with avalanche studios coming from the just cause games is that those werent that difficult you said you can blow up everythingyou basically lied when the barell exploded the bridge didnt flinched kept hearing a dude in the background on this awesome game dont need the commentary there is some doom mechanics in there looks like crisis 3 and doom 2016 had a lovechild solid video do you happen to know of theres an option to disable motion blur add a grappling hook and we got the new just cause 5 sound good this game looks great too the hit markers abit too much but theyve done a good job the music buzzes it along nicely maybe im nit picking but whats with the water not splashing or any movement i think this game looks awesome but i kinda liked the darker more grit vibe the first one had this one seems less serious more arcade like total gana buy this game all i can say is cant waitttttttttt was this played on xbox one x you need a pop filter my guyits fucking bad pretty certain i will get this game getting a little farcry new dawn vibes but with id combat and all those awesome vehicles this should be way better framerate is horrible o ill buy it 1 day late because my birthday is on the 15th and i wanna treat myself ehh gameplay wise it doesnt look great it looks nice and okay but as a rage game nah it look more like an arcade shooter as opposed to that gritty combat that the original had im kinda disappointed tbh gun customization do you have any info on that anyone know if the enemies respawn at outposts or is it more like far cry where you clear out enemy spaces then they are gone from at area i was worried about the enemy ai earlier but now this looks great cant wait unless the game is too short or too repetitive should be really fun gameplay footage of dis game sometimes look awesomesome times looks shitjust like dis video it looks repetitive havent played the first but looking forward to giving this a spin doomguys new car is sick dude that game look like bulletstorm farcry doom if missions and scenario isnt be linear game can be good madmax in the future the narrator needs to stop talking wasnt sure about the game until the last couple of days i now need it looks a big improvement over the 1st and looks great the settings are big and beautiful wow my wallet is gonna take a hammering in the next few months rage whats the biggest gaming let down of my life however i think this is going to be radically different can i see the legs of the ranger if i look down whats with the wifi image on the ui is that for internet connection or to show proximity to something graphically the game looks pretty damn cool im curious as to how long the story mode is and if it is linear tommyt999 awesome vid im so amped for this game refuse to preorder tho i literally just downloaded rage 1 the other day i will subscibe to whoever subs to me by the way im not lying game looks great but i hate

they deliveredbig time is this out looks crazy they should make another twisted metal finallythe next gen generation games ps4 graphic is rage 2 day one purchase for me fix dooms trophies fury road i love this game you put multiplayer in this game and its a day one purchase for me do they all have mohawks rage 2 e3 2018 gameplay feature l ps4 sleeper hit confirmed oww thats the action i need it better than doom i need it in my life ill be honest this looks freekin awesome whens their going to be a new destroy all humans game i want this way more than the new doom or wolfenstein games never played rage 1 but im interested in part 2 from seeing that gameplay hope stealthgamerbr play this game oo anyone else wondering why comments are disabled on the tr video what a peaceful and relaxing game yeap this is the one this is cancer if this is aimed at adults why do you put all the 12 year olds whet dreams in it doom just cause mad max rage 2 oh yeah im so hype game looks crazy where humanity dies rage rise is this the xeno doom timeline dragonball is something else 00 battleroyale confirmed wow im early how do you think the rage 2 gameplay looks so doom and sunset overdrive had a baby but then had an affair with borderlands this is what mad max should have been this looks insane junkrats dream world mad max game cranked up to 1000 now it looks even more borderlands than the first does this game have multiplayer never even heard of this what is this about basically borderlands the cover art copies mobile games borderlands who give me rage is this borderlands lol looks good though never played rage 1 but im definitely gonna play this cant express how much i loved the first one this game is overrated red faction guerilla meets crysis meets falloutmad max meets new doom if andrew wk isnt playable im boycotting looks goodbut a bit too metal for my taste these days getting old and its gonna have as many bugs as skyrim can it get any more feminist i feel hella old because after the music started my senses were assaulted to the point where i couldnt even focus enough to understand what was happening on screen but i think there was a wingstick thrown in one of those 08 second cuts so thats cool i guess so instead of the djentdeath metal of their last id reboot or the soundtrack for unreal bethesda went with hardcore punk for the theme of rage i like it i want this to be a game where i can release all my anger i hope its more like a gta type multiplayer i dont wont to be too similar to borderlands i just got an ad for rage 2 to a video for rage 2 thats something you dont see every day this video is about 18945233009862times better than that stupid annoying asinine live crapction announcement trailer is anyone a tiny bit disappointed that they went with a wacky and wild vibe and ditched the serious and lonely survival aspect of it all when i played rage 1 not once did i say boy i wish my character had a double boosting jetpack and super powers every time i decided to leave a safe city in rage 1 i felt scared and as though i had to be nervous and that is exactly why i loved it so much now every time we leave cities we are going to have punk raiders with green and pink hair throwing paint bombs or some weird shit at us and ill just use my super sonic powers to blow them up while listening to edgy angsty punk rock on the car radio not too happy with the change of direction still going to get it since i was a massive fan of the first one though i guess we will just have to see how it goes switch damn ow this looks amazing lol i got rage 2 ad am i the only one who thinks this looks like shit this looks like a more realistic borderlands i got a borderlands fibe from this video i reckon thisll be like an open world doom super excited to find out more damn take my money a fun as hell teaser followed by a fun as hell gameplay trailer lets go watched an ad for rage 2 before a trailer for rage 2 gj youtube looks generic as fuck ah geez talk abou6 destiny combined with borderlands this looks like a game borderlands 3 without cell shaders another laggy mess bet ya i got a rage 2 ad for this just wanted to say that bye fallout of duty modern borderlands rage dont you mean bethesdas borderlands looks like serious sam and fallout had a baby i just watched a trailer ad for this game before the actual trailer trailerception behesda is always the king looks good bet its gonna be canceled in 543 look at all this plebs judging a game before it came out please dont be bad i cant wait for another formulaic openworld game i hope theres plenty of radiotowers watches the announcement trailer ew this looks horrible watches gameplay trailer woah this is cool i finished rage 1 years ago wanting more thank you bethesda i feel like the open world will ruin this game would rather have a new fallout or elder scrolls game because this game looks weak please id gives doom hell on earth and put in some thrash metal please mad max fallout doom destiny shadow warrior 2 take my money its like a combination of nuka world and mad max can this not happen please the first one was terrible im sure this one will be too what about starfield would much rather play fallout in space than this borderlandsmad max knock off ill have to power on the ps3 and play some rage its about fucking time lol gearbox beaten at their own game it looks like a mix between doom and fallout 4 but not much different than a generic shooter game meh so where is the gameplay really worried that this isnt gonna be good who knows how good the game will be at release but for now i give it thumbs up for using andrew wk in the trailer fuck you bugthesda finally a game that just looks fun this can easily be savior of the game drought reminds me of titanfall how it should have been and destiny how it should have been the first game was highly underrated incredible lul its actually a thing d will john goodman return thats what im most interested in knowing still waiting for elder scrolls 6 this probably gonna end up like fallout 4 dont get hype nor pre oder until get review fallout on drugs rage 2 doom on cocaine bulletstorm the spiritual succesor borderlands 3 confirmed its like doom borderlands and fallout had a dirty dirty threesome together the gameplay reminds me alot of destiny 2 this will be good looks fun as fuck im sold this wouldnt be an avalanche game without explosions and vehicle warfare of course im getting a just cause taste in my mouth yeah thanks a lot walmart its gonna be one of them games thatll only last for a month then itll just go down i hope iam wrong someone explain this video to me is this movie a cartoon or animated 710 not even slightly angry were the bad batch i hope its just doom 16 with an open world map rage 1 was a pretty big disappointment for me definitely not getting my hopes up a borderlands competitor boarderlands and fallout put together ill wait for a sale before i buy lol its sad nothing in this trailer will be in the game never heard of this until now whats it about and is it any good or should i get the first one first i never played the first game and never really wanted to now i think i should finally something interesting hyped i rather play something gangster true crime or mafia we have fallout borderlands and mad max etc well i guess i have to wait for rdr2 but i wish they made more games in a somewhat realistic 3 person setting fantasy is great but its getting a bit oversaturated in my opinion especially the post apocalyptic thing if thats what people want good for you but i need some variation real soon looks sick whats the name of that song is this a joke rage was a rustic wasteland now its rainbows and colourful bullshit not on switch they just wanna miss out on easy money huh holy s this game will kickass until next year when i brought it n enjoy it i still havent forgiven the original for being a boring buggy nearly unplayable mess gonna have to pass neat trailer tho looks fucking shit i really hope it doesnt have a bad ending like the first one it was amazing though this one looks amazing too cant wait a game that actually looks fun bethesda ea this looks pretty dank good shit on internet was that rick fallout 5 the curse of destiny 2 i never played the original and i was actually mad that this game got announced because of what everyone said about the first but after hearing this is made by the same people who made mad max and doom and after seeing the trailer im excited for this game ill play it till i puke whats the song playing edit nvm just found out that its party til you puke andrew wk this is the definition of insanity hell yeah now this will be fun avalanche avalanche aaaaavalanche borderlands 3 looks cool oh wait this is rage 2 my bad anyone else hope that as a preorder bonus they give you a remaster of rage 1 if this is successful borderlands 3 is doomed xd is this a new engine based off of doom 4s one im fuckn down to trash official gameplay trailer x official trailer o rage 2 this video just took 60 bucks from me ok so this game is mad max fallout 4 titan fall attack on titan destiny fortnite why on earth is this getting a sequel the other game was shit well lets hope its better than the first one since that shit was unplayable insanity rules avalanche studios the team behind just cause 3s amazing explosions and huge open world id software the studio who worked on doom thisll be a great mashup damn i thought this was like mercenaries 4 or something action heavy and marketed towards young teens gosh i hope the game has some real substance because the marketing does not apb reloaded next level hmmm i dont know that trailer looked kinda meh to me oh well i wait to see more before completely writing it off gameplay looks very fluid this could be the best single player game from bethesda this year that was such a breath of fresh air to watch they are doing something completely different looks like borderlands crossed with fallout never played the first one but will certainly pick this up if its anything like this trailer this feels familiar cough cough sunset overdrive cough cough doom shooting style mad max style high octane convoys what more do you want where is my elder scroll 6 so much better than that shit from yesterday lol but will the story be better mad max on steroids while taking lsd while having sex on top of a unicorn flying in the air giving a middle finger too fallout 4 on the 4th of july awsome fallout mad max this fuck yes looks great so when is borderlands3 coming out id techlooks like we got another doom based game the mods will be crazy in this one any chance of splitscreen it looks like a mix of doom mad max and borderlands all clustered into one mad max far cry boderlands 3 vs rage 2 pretty lame how similar they look gameplay engine and all well now guess we are getting that mad max sequel from avalanche studios after all looks awesome literally a more insane mad max game which fits perfectly with rage play rage one to its awesome looks better then i expected but lets not jump to conclusions so post apocalypse far cry meets doom im ok with that the first one could be pretty tense at times i guess theyre going for less crafting and resource management and just balls to the wall action looks like a weird mix of doom and fallout 4 i like it with avalanche studios insane explosion are confirmed with id studios dooms fast paced gunplay is confirmed marrying the two distinctive styles of two studios will be awesome andrew wk for the intro music has fuckin put the icing on the cake fuck yeah the reveal trailer was so cringy it looks like next gen borderlands without cel shading yay a game that isnt ashamed to be a game and doesnt wish it was a movie fucking finally as a big fan of the first rage game dreaming of a sequel for years that could fix the problems of the first and expand on the world and story this sequel looksnot good the tone feels vastly different and the chaotic direction that theyre going for feels completely different from the first game which did a great job with its horror and atmosphere elements im not feeling this game at all and this crazy colorful direction was used in two separate trailers so far for the game so i cant even say oh its just one teaser so well see ill have to wait for some legitimate gameplay footage without the profoundly distracting heavy metal vibes that theyre shoving in the viewers face with the marketing im hoping they didnt decide to trash all the stuff that actually worked in the first game id like to take the world and engaging horrorsurvival elements seriously as i sort of did with the first game from the looks of the marketings tone anyway it doesnt se looks like mad max bit with actual good combat words to describe this fallout but xtreme and radical how long have we waited for this it looks like a hybrid between doom and the latest mad max considering the studios involved its more than likely that it is anyway im sold and hyped never buy never play shit game avalanche just cause 3 mad max and id doom working on the same project yes man like idk this kind of makes me sad i loved the original rage but this looks more like borderlands then rage i will be hopeful that this turns out to be good but right now this doesnt seem like a good sequel to rage it seems like they really should have just made this a new ip id software you guys are my favorite both new and old but this open world wipes away all your magic im disappointed why not release this trailer first this game speaks to me on a deep emotional level if you think for 1 second im not going to pick this up on launch day youre fucking mental all we need now is time splitters 3 and 2018 will be the best year for gaming come back history why did i imagine the song bad reputation by our lord and savior shrek playing in the background looks great hope the loot is worth it getting huge borderlands vibes from this borderlands with better graphics i hope theres a mp mode or else its a no buy oh boy wide open world apart from that statement im okay with this too much doom too little fallout im not convinced yet yawn as fuck nobody cares about rage anymore this game will flop just like the first one im so excited for this been waiting since the first one its cool and all but im still upset about how avalanche dropped support on mad max so quick better not have a downgrade please be coop looks like this will fill my borderlands itch hope it comes out soon ish reminds me of unreal tournament and quake i cant wait to try this looks a lot better then the previous game lets hope it lives upto the hype this looks semidecent now lets pretend yesterdays horrible teaser never happened its like mad max world and destiny idea and fallout world and gameplay all in one place this game will be just like destiny nothing new just a mix but surely its gonna be fun and awesome car combat perfected looking forward to it so titan fallborderlands with doom gameplay looks fun with avalanche on this game fuck yeah itll be good i consume every open world game like a pig but this looks just uninteresting generic to me borderlands bulletstorm and mad max together hmm so if mad max had doom style gunplay cool idea but ill be honest it didnt really look that interesting this is the just cause 3 game engine wow doom fallout hybrid combat looks like a methed up bullet stormim sold is this another doom first game looks better too much action not enough of that wasteland feel but who knows maybe it will be good id and avalanche yep this is on the list for sure mad max in first person mode finally something other than fortnite to play okwhats up with the hipster tone change idk it feels stupid gameplay wise it looks great i love the 1st one to death dark and gritty this fortnite vibe even tho i like fortnite is not working out for me idk manmeh wow my first thought was why that said i gotta say judging from the trailer it looks cool doom x fallout x mad max what it looks like to me not saying thats bad it looks interesting avalanche studios is working on this well im pretty much sold is it gonna be a falloutelder scrolls style openworld rpg or more of a typical non openworld game looks like borderlands with realistic graphics xd will it have campagne cant wait to see more at e3 lets just skip the next 3 weeks and go right to june 9th great definitely interested looks good reviews will help my decision im going full price for it and for atomic heart 3 holy shit this looks good great trailer awesome song selection andrew wk rules holy shit its actually real now this is more like it fuck that teaser trailer this is awesome looking yeeeeess i actually loved the first game and im glad the rumor was true cant wait to pick this up i approve this message brought to you by andrew wk p man i havent heard andrew wk in ages the sequel no on asked for looks like mad max but it doesnt take itself super seriously im excited for it i prefer to play shooters on pc but idk if my pc will run it so i possibly will buy it both on my pc and ps4 cuz im hyped af d ok this actually looks pretty damn fun ill definitely be keeping up with this game until it actually releases looks good but not colourful than the teaser looks like they put fallout and doom in a pot mixed it together with some crystal meth and now its rage 2 so fallout with less nukes i think that game will suck no hud no gameplay vid so glad the wind stick is back love getting kills with it looks like fallout with cars and no third person view i wonder if this latest bethesda game will have mod support looks to much like doom rather than the good ol rage idk if i want this doom fallout mad max rage 2 never played the first oneis this game some kind of borderlands in terms of gameplay avalanche studios well this will be hell of a fun d gameplay thats not gameplay its idiot bait the first game was just ok it was kind of half finished and had some terrible pop in still it deserves a second chance as long as no lootboxdlc paywall bullshit gets added to the mix hope its good so avalanche studio the avalanche studio that developed mad max couldnt it be any better so many cool games but no money i like how a bunch of people were dissing the teaser yesterday but now see the trailer and say oh this looks pretty good yall change up quick fuck fallout 4 omg i cannot wait i was in love with the first one i cannot wait for the second feels like the intro of pacific rim d yo this looks wild af doomfallout 4rage 2 cant wait loved the first one and all its flaws borderlands 3 of bethesda ok this has my interest i see good stuff from other games in it like doom and mad max both kick ass games fallout 4 should of had gameplay like this avalanche and not id software this is not rage 2 its mad max ragerage has is hearth because the way of id software made the guns impact and gameplaythis look like more a justcause mad max gamemmwellstart to wait more info on this game as soon as that first 5 seconds of gameplay was shown i could only think i was seeing destiny lmao kinda miss borderlands tho slowly removed wallet sounds like andrew wk is that music andrew wk they have andrew wk as their theme im in destiny done right avalanche and bethesda worth it this looks great bring back fun i know a lot were not asking for or expecting this game then it got leaked and people were questioning it but now this trailer makes me want to get this one never played the first one but bethesda has been doing good with these reboots so to speak lately now when is it coming out ohhhh nice doom mod looks really nice a doom presentation of borderlands 3 this is exactly what i was hoping it would bethe driving from mad max plus a bethesda shooter its gonna be awesome ancapistan simulator 2018 this actually looks pretty good i wonder if this will pick up from the previous game or will we be given a new character is anyone else getting borderlands vibes from this i remember rage being unique from a technical aspect enemies would have a very realistic and dynamic response to being shot anyways it looks like they took a different approach from the first game which is good ill have to play rage sometime when its on sale on steam postapocolyptic games are my fav just cause 3 graphics and physics with dooms gunplay take my money as its coming from avalanche this will likely be mad max 2 not a bad thing actually bethesda whats that you guys want elder scrolls 6 ok heres rage 2 will it still be id software looks like doommadmax mixed together in an open world could be pretty awesome looks solid but id much rather play a new ip they are fucked if borderlands 3 is announced borderlands2 without the signature cartoon art style im sold andrew wk fuck yeah of course avalanche was working on this toogames giving some heavy mad max vibes kickass should have named it more rage they shouldve just shown us this instead of the previous teaser what a waste of money anything looks awesome in the new doom engine the only thing i like in this demo so far is the song of andrew wk if this was a third person shooter like mad max with rpg and loot base elements on it i would gladly be hyped would be awsome if there was coop reminds me of bulletstorm i hope we have starfield too way more promising than that teaser trailer i didnt think i would say this but i actually want to play this game i dont preorder games and i almost never buy games on release anymore but if the reviews are good ill buy this one on release good to see a developer taking chances these days if borderlands 3 comes out next year this will make it everything quite confusing okay so the car combat is gonna be handled by avalanche studios i am assuming its the same team that was behind mad max and ofc the fps aspect will be done by id hmm lets see how it turns out defently pre ordering this possibly digital tbf it looks pretty good open world rpg looter shooter with the gunplay of doom pre ordered where is the release date i hope they deliver a better game this time so all the people crying about rage 2 can shut the fuck up have they said if this is going to have coop its giving me a real borderlands vibe looks great but was hoping for a 1st3rd person switchable camera like on the fallout series doom meets borderlands with a hint of madmax wtf are xou trxing to do a borderands wheres the switch version lol sooooo much better looking than yesterdays teaser trailer im hyped now who else saw rick surprisinglylooks good better than the first trailer yeah not feeling it this looks incredible so more of the same but reskinned great looks like a cross between bulletstorm borderlands and doom id be super hyped but avalanche dropped the ball on just cause 3 in a major way game plays like ass on all consoles and i thought their mad max game was mediocre as hell so i dunno game looks pretty hopefully id software lent id tech 6 to avalanche to build this and hopefully theyre up to the task already looks like it could be better then the first one fully open world driving looks much more interesting as well as the shooting excited to see avalanche studios helping id id assume that lets id focus more on what theyre good at the shooting aspect of the gameplay and avalanche has proven themselves with just cause i had a blast with 3 honestly was not at all excited for this before now now im pretty interested the wingstick is back i am so happy they decided to make this it somehow still looks fairly true to the original wacky sure so was the original rage yet this looks like its not too far over the top to get obnoxious well find out but this looks very promising actually looks quite good i hope they shed some light of what happens in the ending of the first game its reminds me bulletstorm from the mind of david ayer and the far cry 5 arcade mode this looks fun looks like a borderland with a doom graphics looks like a borderline with a doom graphics sure lookw fun but nothing special will get when cheap 2019 hopefully it doesnt butt heads with borderlands 3 looks good but itll need to release before bl3 to stand a chance of succeeding bethesdas borderlands bethesdalands this like fallout and doom combine i saw the reveal trailer yesterday and wanted to wait for the gameplay reveal but im not impressed the game seems to be based on nothing but edge and already seems lacking in character and world building theyll surely show some gameplay on e3 but why they settle with mediocre is beyond me id software was the founder of first person shooters as we knew and know them and to see them create build this is dissapointing it seems to mimmick the character controller from doom 2016 and already doesnt seem to have its own identity but well see gameplay at e3 starfield at e3 and maybe some more what a fucking lost opportunity you have a chance to convince people that rage is cool you guys not like the last game you guys and you make like a serious trailer really make it fucking stupid like seriously fucking stupid and you grab people goddamn are the guys making games fucking re to the tar to the ded remember the fucking locked sewers damn i didnt even think there gonna made a sequel is that the same guy who was narrating elex another doom so its fallout but with cars and insanity weapon custom ooh look an open world post apocalyptic first person shooter i bet it has dull sidequests and shallow rpg elements as well on the meadows of fresh ideas like a colossus you stroll rage 2 zzzzzzzzz does it have multiplayer hopefully they fixed the end game this time destiny mad max fallout looks like doom mad max and borderlands had a radioactive baby fun looking game from id now bethesda show me starfield so this is fallout just scenes of guns explosions and shooting holy shit this looks amazing hype11 fallout of duty well its a lot more than they gave us with that trailer of cringe it looks good but obviously im unbiased since i missed out on the first due to the lukewarm reception it received i dont understand this notion that devs need a reason to build on its existing ip the fuck is wrong with gamers these days no wonder people dont take you guys serious i dont even want to associate myself with the community anymore due to how toxic it has become i feel fallout and elder scroll got overshadowed by decent good graphic game like wolfenstein doom and this latest game i can see these 2 franchise doesnt use motion capture model animation and too clunky just like valve source engine based game trashlike the original borderlands 3 is looking great seems allot like mad max which is good im still trying to figure out why bethesda the publisher reeeeaally needs to change their name to satisfy all the fucking dumbasses who think bgs is the one making all these gamesits also really not good for the brand recognition of the companies who are actually making these games that people keep linking bgs to them mad max fall out and borderlands could be quite a nice combo heres hoping really looking forward to this bethesda you might have done it again another great game no switch versionthis is sad rage 1 doom perfection this looks like the outcome of doom and fallout having a kid that grew up as a punkrocker iloveit bethesdaidavalanche just take my money i hope the gameplay will be amazing unlike fallout 4 but still i loved it despite its not so good gameplay gameplay looks sick fun just that the music and tone of these trailers really turns me off its so fucking cringe its like theyre trying to attract kids this trailer looks a way better then the teaser this looks like it should be borderlands 3 not a sequel to a game most of us forgot looks fucking great i loved rage but never thought it would ever get a sequel there we go this shouldve been your first trailer this looks so epic wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy different than the first overwatchdoomdishonoredmadmax giantinvolvedgamesdeath racecocaincrack rage 2 bathesdax100 i used to love this game no way i remember the 1st one btw people that worked on mad max help make this game before people start talking shit borderlands 3 with a new graphics design sold ive been playing through the first one for the 3rd time cant wait for 2 oh whooa excit this great rage mad 2 looks so great im recently playing rage for the first time and two things i dont like is that the action is awesome but there isnt too much and the enemies are bullet sponges for submachine and machinguns only the combat shotgun works well well now i have all the action i want it looks really good o not once did i see iron sights aiming thats disappointing so practically doom mad max edition i am really loving bethesdaid games so where is star field ok im on board after seeing this trailer i hope we get a sequel to the 2015 mad max game i like this you can tell avalanche and id made i havent played the first one but this looks really cool looks amazing but not really rage something not generic looks really fun never played the first game but this has my interest wow a video game that actually looks like a video game for once gears with some bulletstorm titanfall and mad max all mixed together where is the originality in todays games so much better than the teaser looking forward to it wtf too much casual i honestly didnt think rage 2 would happen i cant wait to play it another borderlands copy oooh colorful looks fun probably is it me or do those gun models vaguely resemble the new doom and wolfenstein gun models wow this is the same studio that made mad max better have coop more of the same its basically borderlands with a bit less cocaine i know people who wanted a sequel but i dont know anyone who asked for this weird and jarring tonal shift so rage is just fallout now bleh wow so much gameplay shown just cause first person the comments are cancer game looks freaking sick amazing cant wait im interested to say the least idk it seems good like a sleeper hit i mean t makes me excited for e3 because if bethesda was like fuck it lets reveal a whole fucking game before the show what the fuck do they have planned one can only hope another new vegas i know for a fact we wont see teasers for elder scrolls 6 until next year remember that they only show stuff that will happen or has happened this year at e3 so the only thing thatd blow my mind is either starfield idk its such vaporware that im hesitant or fallout we know that prey is getting dlc and only games we have left are doom 2 and thats really it idk why but not quite sold yet well at least they are trying something different fallout doom rage 2 the combat looks like doom if thats the case im sold honestly doesnt look that good tbh the only thing that stood out to me was that the boomerang thing seems to have proper physics like the axe in god of war thats it call of duty survive warfare didnt realise avalanche studios are making a mad max sequel rage 1 was good and i enjoyed it as a big fallout fan i hope this will be a perfect game for my fallout withdrawals it looks way better than what the announcement hinted atkinda sad its not coming until next year but heyat least its something to look forward to the style of characters is so cool looks interesting i see it even has a hint of doom 4s gameplay thrown in there if its good ill nab it another fps that no one asked for where is the elder scrolls 6 god dammit i played this when it was borderlands sorry bethesda softworks is not bethesda game studious this is made by the guys who made doom id damn this looks cool the first one is hella under rated awesome ive been wanting a rage 2 forever so excited to play this im gonna have to see more as of right now looks like someone spilled borderlands and just cause into my rage so kind of a turn off well at least it wont be all brown this time meet the gangs the village people the ymca the spicy girls is arkane studios makin this if so then its gonna be as good as mad max omg i went form the totally indifference towards rage 2 for the leaks to the massive interest after seeing this gameplay video time to replay the first now god so many good gems of games i have been reminded of lately why cant we go back to linear this open world games are getting boring there are so many good games releasing this year i dont even know what game to play first what about the guy from the first game damn it i want to know what happen xd bethesda out here doing the lords work holy shit this is the type of game i been waiting for really looking forward to this the old days hell yeah yea thats a video game alright huh gameplay look nice good job bethesda so this is what the just cause devs have been doing so rage rebooted looks great i played the first one so i cannot wait for what they did for the sequel looks very disappointing to say the least dont know how i feel about this imagine this on nintendo switch so fallout doom and borderlands with a tinge of saints row how much you wanna bet this game has a battle royal mode im excited finally another good looking post apocalyptic game wow i didnt knew rage was from bthesda bethesda give us the elder scrolls 6 not this pretty cool interesting first pin me ma lord first is it wierd that when i played rage 2 i disliked that the mutants could talk idk i kinda preferred the creepy sounds they made with the diffrent variants of mutants and looks also i kinda wish to see actual authority troops with mutants mixed in but otherwise i enjoyed it both games were really cool and glad rage got a sequal rage 2 really looks so bad everything in soap overall i preferred the first game i liked the second one but it feels lacking prefer the original rage one art style rage 2 looks like someone got carried away with box of crayons i like rage 2 more than rage 1 i just think the vehicles have better quality overdrive is insane and it doesnt look all depressing like rage 1 does rage 1 looks like mad max combined with borderlands while rage 2 looks like mad max high on crack and pink spray paint rage was a great game i wasnt impressed by rage2 i prefer rage 1 over 2 the first one feels like a fun post apocalyptic game with fun and creative gameplay that is unique in my opinion rage 2 just feels like a rip off of doom and is very futuristic and i liked the more modern feel in the first one rage1 better concept art style but i still remember painfully slow load times rage 2trash played both rage 1 is my personal favorite the atmosphere in that game is crazy good review i think the destructive environment characteristics of the second game make it much more fun to play i appreciate this vid after having just finished r2 i was thinking the whole time r1 was nicer looking but obviously time proves otherwise it was the npcs for melike you said they had more personality and they just sucked in r2 imo everything else though very nice rage 1 was a show case for ids shiny new game engine at the time the tech 5 engine rage 2 is reimagining of the old ip with avalanches latest open world apex game engine rage 2 feels very much like a just cause game its just a remastered of rage 1 its surprising that you spoke nothing of that beautiful skybox in rage 1 especially considering how often it was shown in the video rage 112 years old looks better rage is underrated game series in my opinion rage 2 is still good but still underappreciated much like titanfall game which are underrated as well rage 2 is a fail in my opinion rage 2 have fun colors and lighting correction 012 rage 1 was released in 2010 not 2011 rage first one is a clear winner by far whats happening with this generationsthe best videogames were done till 2013 all the gamers know it rage 1 was bloody and brutal rage one was clearly a labor of love pt2 looks like they switched development teams we can all agree that the combat in rage 2 is definitely the best rage 2 was seriously a blurry glitch mess i took it back 2 days later so disappointing rage 2s shadow reflection off the water in the lagoon are just down right laughable was somewhat disappointed in the all around look of the game especially from id hopefully bethasa dont drag them down with them i think rage look so great now because we have better gaming pclaptop and rage 2 is beautiful as well rage 2 is a beautiful game its almost surprising how smoothly the game performs direct comparison wouldve been correct if the same engine would be used in both gamesyoure comparing apples to oranges my only problem with rage 2 is that the main story is too short and feels kinda incomplete and the ending is even worse than the original the sky from rage 1 looks so amazing rage 1 has a unique art style while rage 2 is more bland but i love how the smaller details were improved but rage 1 still has a special spot in my heart did you turned off motion blur i wish they didnt patch the photo mode daynight bug it doesnt work for me when i try to make it night time i love the 1st rage but the 2nd does have more of an area to explore the cars and gameplay mechanics are way better in the 2nd i just started part 2 yesterday and loving it the sound design in rage 1 is much better in my opinion rage one is way better than part two but im sure both sold 1000000s of copies anyways the people in this comment section are dumbasses trying to find any reason to say the original is better to justify their nostalgia what are u talking about rage 1 chars looks way better rage 1 all the way baby i love the gritty feel yea the gengine in the first rage was id tech 5 and rage 2 uses avalanche apex open world engine to those that didnt know rage 1 a game what has a lot of detail of dead citys and wast lands and missions what you are in citys and more stuff rage 2 a game your in a desert with no dead city its and has a wast land missions you go in bases to kill these weird people rage 2 is full of ugly feminazis frankly i love id softwares original compared to this new one graphically it was handcrafted like most id titles were at that time unfortunately carmacks technological direction meant that the games scope couldnt be as big because of the ridiculous amount of space those textures took also the botched up pc release supposed drivers issue that caused textures popin along with those ridiculous space occupying textures not looking as crisp when looked up close meant that the title was doomed at release itself i have yet to play both games i wanna buy both though for my xbox one x so many whiners who think rage 1 is better in this or that then rage 2 i am soo in luck thet devs from rage 2 build the art style and visuals that suit me better then most of you hehe rage 1 had proceduralprogrammatically generated textures so there were no repeating textures in the environment eventually we will go back to that idea old classic rage 1 was more impressive for the time they made a large world run so smoothly rage 2 is like wellthe same as many games that can already do it moreso now rage 2 is a more colourful approach both games look like crap to me both my favorites so superior lighting techniques that add a more lifelike pop rage 1 reminds of how they light gearswhich is flat oversharp and boring i think that rage 1 is better oh oknow everyone loves the original rage i forgot its not cool to like the new thing i prefer the look and straight forward gameplay of the first game side note i also like the look of the mad max game over rage 2 its insane how good the racing worked in rage 1 despite it easily being the weakest part of the game and how utter sht it is in rage 2 its double the shame when you consider that mad max also had fun driving wtf happened to rage 2 not only would i be surprised if they ever make a rage 3 i truly hope they dont another franchise down the gutter and ruined by shthead developers who simply dont know what they are doing rage1 has been released 8 years ago and now you are comparing to the sequel to see which one looks better seriously i reallly liked the video me and a friend talked alot about the differences of the two games like how in 30 years the mountains and canyons seem to have eroded away i can get that after 30 years the towns changebut you cant even find hagar settlement or the outrigger settlement maybe its an alternate reality rage 2 is more technically advanced in terms of scale texture detail and filtering effects etc but what made rage 1 so appealing to the eye on pc on consoles it was a texture popping mess was the art direction and world design id made it a priority to make the object geometry extremely varied and unique at every corner of world they talked about how literally no two rocks cliffs or caves are alike the world itself is not a diverse landscape but the geometric detail is incredible this also had a lot to do with developer choice and engine being used rage 1 was developed by id software using the id tech 5 engine whereas rage 2 was primarily developed by avalanche studios using the apex engine avalanche is a great studio but ids style seemed better suited for rages world rage 2 change the graphics not like the new borderland the same graphics but looks better i never played the original i want to now rage 1 had way better soundsound is key for earsi still like rage 1 better no matter the fact rage 2 has a bigger mapquality is number 1 rage 2 isnt a rage game rage was a western scifi simply about just surviving and finding work rage was supposed to go the fallout route and give us a more detailed and living world and make choices matter but instead rage 2 just abandoned everything and became a mindless shooter glad i have xbox one i can play both rage games same with prey rage 2 looms like a combination of cyberpunk and made max is rage 2 just a remake of rage wtf flew by in 930935 i dont want to be that guy but playing on pc and using a controller for an fps game why rage 1 seem to borrow a lot from borderlands aesthetics rage 2 seem to borrow more from the popular doom visuals and gameplay nicholas raine must be 50 or 60 years old and dr kvasir must be last 125150 year and you see the hagar family in oasis durar hagar halek hagar loosum hagar phallinx hagar according to this video characters looked much better in rage 1 i still prefer the originals look and feel some things in rage one better more than the 2nd one like 1wingstick ammo 2 seal items 3 sentry gun 4 sentry robot 5 ammo types and more characters in rage2 look like actors in a cheap bmovie rage 1 was still better rage 2 injected to much doom rage 1 with rage 2 graphics rage 1 actually had sexy npcs rage 1 aged a lot better than i thought i honestly prefer its grittier look to rage 2s hot pinkneon vibe 124 sjw game design in a nutshell rage 1 creative wasteland rage 2 antifa riot in portland i was a big fan of rage 1 when it came out had it on ps3 and now im looking at buying rage 2 but after this video and seeing these comments i dont know rage 1 scavengers wasteland postapocalyptic rage 2 colourful vaporwaveish vipe neon postapocalyptic rage 1 ran at 60fps on ps3 0 we should theoretically expect rage 2 to look and play better in just about every way shows footage of rage 1 actually looking better im not realy focused on the art or lighting for me its the mechanics and the extra detail when you fought you had a choice to use more advanced bullets and the controls felt loose but refreshing you feel stale when you fight you overlap and accidentally move the cursor over the targets you gotta nit pick and tap the dual stick with careness so you dont end up shooting all over the place they took out some of the joys i had in this game like some of the rpg elements when it came to buying new armor and attachments for your guns waited 9 years for this game but im sorry guys rating 7610 rage1 post apocalyptic rage2 post lgbtq disclaimer a lot of hate imo rage 2 is a complete trash compared to rage the first game had an awesome apocalyptic environment and atmosphere it felt creepy scary dangerous and exciting rage 2 is a completely different game and doesnt deserve that rage 2 title and for gods sake these games have 8 years difference and the first one is much more awesome than the second one hot pink ugh got sick of that color in minutes but i see a lot of people like that which is strange to me xd anyways u like it u buy it just wanted to express my hatred on a failure i prefer the first rage better game and u can upgrade your cars better man sounds like kermit the frog hey you take to comparsion game what born in 2011 of course 2019 game have better lightinstextures modern graphic tehnologis etc too much time pass and its dont need to compare this is the same if compare textures from cod 1 and latest in this year cod 70 of the comments here rage 1 is better in every way too bad the comparison wasnt on pc why does id make these beautiful engines and then not use them in any games cmon it could of looked so great on the latest id tech engine jesus christ i miss rage 1 why are all the survivors feminist condoms the ps3 version of rage was so bad that i didnt even notice the cartoon style lol rage 1 will always be better so now there are pinheads rage 1 i feel is over all better than rage 2 can i have your computer please rage 2 is just on another level i played it and i was having a blast too bad the story is so short am i insane the original graphics on rage look way better and more realistic than rage 2 unless you are in an extreme close up on the textures otherwise human eyes cant tell the difference in pixels when youre talking about muddied earth tone textures but overall the faces look more finely detailed and crafted whereas rage 2 looks like marginally smoother graphics with far worse graphic design work on the actual character models as a result they look out of place and unrealistic and like their graphically inferior even when theyre not i also sincerely feel like the gunplay was far tighter and more refined in rage i was so horrified by how unbelievably awful the first hour of rage 2 was combined with the surprise drm i got my 85 special edition preorder refunded ill maybe try it again in 6 months or a year when no doubt it will already have dropped to a base price of 30 or 40 and ill get it 75 off for 10 or less by comparison i would have paid 60 nick i honestly love your videos so much your attention to detail is so inspirational i aspire to make videos as good as yours keep up your hard work rage 2 has better combat stuffs rage 1 has better story telling id software did not develop prey or quake 4 they used their engine but human heads made prey and raven made quake 4 rage 2 just looks so blurry compared to crisp rage 1 visuals i prefer the original look and game overall rage 2 is fun but the vehicle gameplay feels slow and weak plus theres only one race whats up with that bullshit rage2 exclusive for ps2 support my youtube channel its all about gaming and reviews support my youtube channel its all about gaming and reviews u should make a comparison of god of war 4 vs witcher 3 rage 1 looks better and more authentic the art direction feels better to me on the original one rage 1 way better for 2011 game rage 2 is pure scam pls make a comparison video on dying light vs dying light bad blood please compare assassins creed 3 original vs remastered both games look great i hadnt even heard of rage until rage 2 came out the only thing that puts me off is that it reminds me of boarderlands which i really couldnt get into when the rage 2 pistol fires i hear the tinkle of spent shell casings you wouldnt hear that with a revolver the second part is very boring and 80 doom copies rage 1 is always better for one simple reason it is powered from a real id tech and the ideas of a legend john carmack while john stay away from the studio id software never gonna be what should be not fallout 2 sometimes rage 1 looks much better could not even get half way with rage 2 gave up and sold it i spent more time driving than shooting the world did not wow me at all though the gun play was goodbut blink and it was over never played both but would prefer rage 1 sound better looks better rage 1 did not have preorder guns like the bfg9000 guns should not be preorder or part of a collectors edition for what purpose this video rage 1 2011 rage 2 2019 and cant help but notice rage 2 created on doom platform rage 2 obviously wins but rage 1 its quite good damn rage 1 looks better than fallout 4 lol first rage was okay game not good but if you like postapoc you might enjoy it rage 2 looks terrible why all modern games look like lsd trip like srsly 228 similiar to previous id software game at that time prey and quake iv prey isnt id game it was published 2k games made by human head studios with game engine licensed from id soft i hope they kept the post apocaliptic feeling the atmosphere and the imersive ambience of rage 1 the doom the lost and the survival feeling of rage one is found in games like last of us metro 2033 portal 2 deadlight hope rage 2 keep that feeling rage 1s character models were so much better in my opinion why is rage 1 so much clearer wtf rage 2 looks like a better game overall however i prefer the art direction of the original more rage 2 obviously has higher resolution textures when you look at individual objects but at the same time it looks less detailed if that makes any sense notice how the human textures for rage had very distinctly detailed skin textures yet everyone in rage 2 looks more fair and less wrinkled rage 2 looks like what far cry blood dragon is to far cry 3 or looks a lot like borderlands although the original took a lot from borderlands too the first rage is the art of painter the second rage is a sketch of newbie artist who only start work with 3d and painting software no offense but eight years between these games and art artdirection of the first game looks better and more complex of course if you have no reason to evaluate the game by resolution of textures how this doing many of people pink color nuclear effects that burn the eyes not enough to build things i call good style rage 1 win i miss some cool features in rage 2 the spider bots pets and the rc cars and the good old turrets now we get a simple drone wo explode after few seconds thats mad hope they will add this cool old things rage 2 is tooooooooooo far below the first one such a a disappointing and horribly annoying game theyve made incredible avalanche should change job erm rage 2 is not much better than rage 1 hahah rage had great experience i loved that game and it will never forgotten also it had more ingame fun such as every time u meet different giant mutants and bandits and u have to find mutant and other cards to play a card game and win the money or you can play in casino and etc sure that first one was unic and wont be forgotten on the other hand rage 2 graphic is better with vulcan and there is no doubt of that but in some case its so boring nothing changes almost same giant mutants easy to play and defeat them no card game no casino no unic and memorable features i guess this one is so dissapointing but u can play this game only one time because u will never want to play this again i guess so to my mind if rage 1 had more open world experience it would be the best one so far bethesda create 1 game and then rehash it to death why is the sound muddy in rage 2 than rage the new color scheme is fucking atrocious why is everything pin and blue the original had a real mad max beyond thunderdome vibe it looked a lot better guessing this is a love or hate type a game rage 2 vs far cry new dawn graphics comparison plz the rage 1 is much better rage 1s character design is better as is the amount of clutter in environments rage 2 looks kind of bland in comparison im only 2 hrs into the game though so maybe i havent seen the good stuff but still they should open up right away with impressive visuals and not force players to look for it the overdone bloom and lighting takes away from nowadays games atmosphere rage and rage 2 are such fun games sure they have their issue but they are fun af just shut off your brain and enjoy some run and gun carnage rage 2 is more beautiful those who say that rage 1 is the best its because they cant get rage 2 i dont know what title you were looking at but judging from the video rage 2s textures are generally blurrier whereas rage 1s are more detailed everywhere also characters are more detailed in rage 2 what where the only improvement may be lighting and the shadows im having fun in rage 2 but give me the original any day loved the look and was so impressed by the character models and detail back then and i miss the card game stum etc and i miss the old wingsticks spider bots and bomb cars plus the driving was way better why so many changes id i loved original rage game and finished it two times i prefer art style of original game its feels more realistic and postapocalyptic rage 2 is a good looking and fun game still should be better the optimisation is horrible i knew that id come here and all comments would be championing the first over the second the internet hate train is a powerful thing too bad everything else in rage 2 is awful why do all the npcs in rage 2 look like they were made by a sjw or feminist both games have a good graficstyle i like the old rage and the successor i want the death city for rage 2 smile i honestly prefer the look of the first rage game im still puzzled as to why it wasnt received as well as it shouldve been as it mustve done enough to warrant a follow up who actually gave the game a hard time as all my friends family members loved it couldnt wait for a follow up which has now come in the shape of rage 2 its over use of neon lighting maybe the developers thought the first game was too wastelandishflat dull to look at but not i figured some neon colouring was needed i still find it odd that even onky after one game that the look this rage game doesnt feel 100 connected to the original but maybe itll be fine once i play it as all ive had to go on is a few trailers on youtube ps its no secret that half way through the lifespan of the xbox 360 ps3 that multiplayer became more more the thing most requested to the point that by the end of their life span thats really all you got if you wanted all the good fun on the the art direction in rage 2 is perfectly finei personally dont mind the bright colours honestly it gets the job done in what it was trying to do visually however i cant help but feel that a lot of what made the art direction in rage 1 so unique to look at got a little lost in translation when rage 2 was being made its like theyvaliantlytried to emulate kenneth scotts distinct visual style but forgot to emulate the tone attitude detail and soul that his artwork usually tends give off in the games that he works on as well i just feels a little lessinspiredby comparison if you ask me for the sound of the guns i have to ask do u think real gun would sound louder outside or not are you sure that rage 2 has no self shadow why old games environments are incredibly detailed and very smooth by contrast to modern games look more blurry less detailed but more aggressively demanding rage 1 and 2 are good examples i mean look at the clouds man in rage they are stunning take a shot everytime you see hot pink unpopular opinion rage 2 is better in every single way i like how just brighter light should now mean better that previous one while grey and boring colors make it look more immersive kinda like gta iv had this story and all with grey city and gta v is colorful but story is im still looking for anything so to sum it up better on the technical side and worse on the artistic side the art direction of rage 2 is really disappointing if anything it was the art direction of rage 1 that was its redeeming factor whilst the fast paced shooting on consoles was a welcome try it failed to actually play well with a controller for me at least but the first games art style was hard to criticize diminishing returns on companies aiming to make games look better listen up scrubs how do we make this game part of the identity politics bs without pissing off gamers too much aaaa pink boss how much pink scrub lots gud then moooooar pink ive played rage 2 for about 2 days till it git boringits more like an indie version of borderlanddefinitely doesnt improve on the first onerage 2 is one of the worst games ive ever played liked rage 1s are design better actually i managed to make it through the 1st hour of the game then i refunded rage 1 seems allot smoother who said it was gonna look and play better tbh i only just started it and its reallyboring rages springs town looks identical to borderlands 2 town wtf rage 2 looks better just turn motion blur chromatic a dof off and switch to fxaa dont know why but rage 1 looks better imo or the difference isnt really that impressive and it kinda reminds me of just cause and farcry prefer the first ragenew does not make it better main difference is rage 1 was developed by id rage 2 was developed by avalanche with some help with combat from id i had to up the gamma and contrast on my monitor just to not get the environments to look like mushy mush on rage 2 i feel id gave rage 1 a more artistic quality while rage 2 feels like a product rage 2 is still a better game overall but you can tell that id wasnt really the developer its an avalanche game with ids name on it to sell more copies prefer the sky in rage dont understand why so many people are saying rage 2 visuals and art direction is great its tasteless lack of personnality and ugly looks like a battle royale game rage 1 was far away better in comparaison made me think abour metal hurlant french creator work like mobius or druillet is rage 2 openworld like the fallout 34 series or is there an open world but youre railed into a single story with quests to be done in one big order rage 1 goes for a more depressing post apocalyptic setting with a little a bit of mad max elements in it because everything around you is dry and lifeless while rage 2 goes for a more mad max action setting into it looking and playing better doesnt make up for turning rage 2 into a boring grindy mess oh well the skybox in rage 1 wasis stunning cell shaded games age very well imo hey prey is not a id software game neither the priginal one from 2006 nor the 2017 reboot i suppose nick930 was referring to the former which even so only used the game engine id tech 4 the same of doom 3 and quake 4 rage was a fantastic game people that hated it were just tripping rage 1 has a far more refreshing and inspired design the npcs have alot more personality in their appearance compare this dont buy it sucks rage 1 looks way better you can tell the devs put more time in when making that game rage 1 art style is better but rage 2 gameplay and open world is better and even know the story isnt that good but rage 1 story wasnt that good either rage 1 very impressive pc game mega textures is nice but rage 2 best i love the original rage and its art direction it was just a technical nightmare and even now after tweaks i cant get it to run stutterfree rage 2 is like a dream sequel in terms of improving everything and making it more engaging two very different art directions i wish they just expanded on what rage 1 was aka not just painting everything bright pink and make everything some wacky comedy skit with explosions blinding you every second i loved original rage so much that even side quests were fun to do heck the driving mechanics death race and shooting up muties in tight corners everything was done so perfectly while i dont really hate rage 2 but everything is mehh except for the gunplay which tries so hard to be a mad max doom child losing its originality how unappreciative many people are this type of people will always exist and will always hate anything new rage 2 look cool 8 years and this is what we get dasfuk rage 2 looks boring in comparison and the pink doesnt change that i dont mind the neon colors i just wish they would have done something more creative with it the gameplay of rage 2 is recorded at 720p while that of rage 1 is recorded at 1080p look at it carefully do not be fooled so much nostalgia from seeing rage 1 and honestly i think i prefer it i like how all the f4gg0ts are still whining about this game oh the story is bad the characters look bad i bet these little cock gobblers would have hated doom or duke nukem in the 90s here is a clue turd brains no one plays shooters for their stories no one ever has no one will doom and duke nukem had shitty stories the point of those games was the shooting that was great the stories were barely there rage 1 was a pretty meh game even the shooting wasnt great it also looks bad compared to rage 2 rage 1 was really cartoony looking fallout nv rage 1 cyberpunk 2077 rage 2 also rage 1 rage 2 there is zero progress blame big publishers for destroying videogames 9 years before rage 1 you were playing ps2 launch games and the sega dreamcast rage 2 looks like this pink post apo far cry 5 for kids nah prefered the old ones climate and mood rage 1 is very similar to borderlands 2 imho rage 2 is an art style disappointment the game is pretty good but the vibe is inferior to rage 1 plus rage 1 soundtrack was dope still listen to it from time to time high as possible 1440p is this a joke in rage 2 the car kinda sounds like the batmobile in arkham knight mad max is that u anyone knows i can get de pistol of first rage pleaseeee how i get the pistol of first rage does rage 2 have subway town if not i wont buy it because subway town was the coolest place in the game the original game looks much better the art direction is a big part of that but also it looks sharper and has a clearer image that is easier to read so you wanna tell me that the pink still water flat planked faced bozo cone hat at 146 looks better than the elderly man beside him yeah right at 931 can some explain to me what happened in the background they should add rage 1 to ps4 cuz it is much better the facial expressions and animations for random npcs were a lot better in rage 1 also driving felt a lot better imo so far rage 2 combat is 1010 the open world environment is exactly like red faction guerillas map design with different areas changing in color temperature idk about the endgame though what happens once i clear out all the bandit camps will it be like farcry and basically you killed everyone and theres nothing to do is the card game even in rage 2 that pistol looks blurry af so all around inferior sequel thats bethesda for yah rage was much better and drew you know more but rage 2 is okay great example of how art direction trumps technology rage 2 is no doubt more technically advanced but to me looks worse than the original one didnt really like rage 1 that much felt kinda empty ill probably get into rage 2 though the world looks more lived in and the environments pop more lets just ignore that the settler pistol used the same animations that the normal gun uses listen when you aim with it and compare if you dont know what im talking about first rage is a way better in all aspects including gameplay rage 2 almost lost identity lol or its just confuse with rage 2 you get less content game is catered to younger gamers who will play and trash in 3 days if you want the full game wair for the dlcs rage 2 has better graphics thats all you can tell bethesda didnt give them a good budget during a post apocalyptic world who the hell is going to run around looking for hot pink and purple clothes clearly rage 1 looks and sound better since they were showing off their new game engine even the comment section agrees it looks better overall this youtuber always agrees that second games are better overallsmh you need to stop sucking corporate dick man is it weird the original looks better its a weird feeling of suddenly gaining respect for older games i didnt like back then as the aaa gaming scene is getting worse and worse with every year i started to appreciate games like far cry 2 or mafia ii after playing their newest installments i wonder if rage 2 will be another one blurry crap with grandma looking npcs 1059 the old rages sky looked amazing rage is better than rage 2 in the art department and it has young loosums nick930 have you looked into the physics dunno why devs of rage 2 and far cry new dawn think pink graffiti is a cool new direction what a fucking disgrace 2 is no one ask for a rage 2 but lets look the bright side this way maybe encourage some one to make a revision of the first one reading coments i can see everyone stay with the first one so any one would be so kind to tell my if there is really a way to fix the poup textures problem y explore several fixes but that only improves a little bit the fucking trouble this game need mod no pink rage 1 chicks were hot yaaooooo p am i the only one that enjoys rage 2 more lol i think im gonna play the 1st one again as fun as 2 is i still prefer the first one because it still has the dead city instead of the gaping maw in the second game the thing is in rage 1 due to the fantastic art design your jaw drops looking at some of many places that are so beautiful but here its kind of really uninteresting to look at ginny from rage 1 was so hot their excuse for using the apex engine instead of idtech was because the engine could handle open world better but honestly i would rather have the same engine doom runs on and have a few loadingscreens than having this engine its not impressive at all rage 1 has better style and shooting rage 2 is blury graphics looks so bad for 2019 i prefer the way rage 1 looks rage 2 looks like every other fps on the market 1st one is way better i miss the skyboxes rage 1 had incredibly beautiful clouds i like both the same why thats the only question i have in a sea of utter pointlessness comparing something from 8 years ago to today is right up there let me guess looks better after 8 years of advancing tech right so glad i have adblock rage 2 is very colorful and full of rainbow fallout 3 and fallout 4 the same way rage 1 still looks good and it was really well done it could run nicely on an average machine 8 years is two generations of console and multiple upgrade cycles for graphics cards rage 2 looks amazing but does it looks 8 years amazing compared to rage the only thing bad about rage was it was too short a game an over priced dlc did not help boys choose rage 2 men choose the original rage 1 ran on the consoles at 60 fps rage 2 would never look or sound as good if it was altered to play on ps3 and those animations when you shoot the mutants super crispy in rage 1 i think rage 1 was trying to be more realistic i dont mind the rage 2 colour and art direction maybe a tad overdone but its meant to be ridiculous and crazy i cant help but think the town in rage 2 looks like sanctuary from borderlands now lol rage looks like borderlands it aged very well rage 2 is more modern in terms of graphics still prefer that borderlandslook tbh i am so fed up with this everything is pink in the apocalips direction i prefer the rusty apocalips much more the signature pistol from rage one is now a preorder bonus for rage 2 progress hahahahah you just gave me a great reason to ignore this franchise i dont support greedy cunts finally someone that notices players shadow dev either forget or dont added it cause they were not told to shipping product as fast as possible to please publishers is much more important i think the takeaway here is that rage 1 holds up remarkably well i actually prefer the character models and some of the environments of it i wouldnt call it celshaded at all i really loved the darker more lifeless atmosphere of it it somehow fits better with id software than the colorful and crazy world of rage 2 and the sound is better in the first game too in my opinion to me rage one is much better why rage one is darker and is more detailed rage two on the other hand looks like a circus clown and michey mouse would have made a misbehaved child the psistol on the first game sound like a real weapon first u hear the shot then the sound of the wave going back to u like 01 seconds later for me wins rage 1 i prefer rage 1s aesthetic design direction much more expected the visuals to be bumped up a whole lot more in the sequel i was really hoping to play rage 2 but decided against it after the mixed reviews might pick it up after a sale never mind comparisons rage 2 looks like trash on xbox one x 4k hdr10 tv my personal opinion anyway compare it with red dead 2 and they look like they are running on different generation consoles i havent played either of the games but i really like the new art design they have in rage 2 agreed its not as unique as the first ones but i like it more loved rage 1 rage 2 i really dont like the art style i wanna buy it but idk i find that rage 2s 3d character geometry not textures is a bit less refined than rage 1 rage 2 npc models have a lot of glitchylooking selfintersecting polygon problems that seem just a little bit lazy im fairly sure most offtheshelf 3d modelling tools allow you to have some degree of physicsbased tooling that lets clothes and other parts of the body connect in a more natural way talking to a guy with an impressive beard is difficult when all you can see is that ultrastiff and unmoving beard piercing through his chest because no effort was spent to model selfcollision into the animation either in realtime or statically baked into the animation i also see it in a lot of games where characters are clearly wearing metal armour and yet the animation was done so poorly that the armour is clearly bending like cloth because the modeller did not bother to accurately set up deformation constraints to properly separate hard surface vs softsurface motion of the geometry rage 2 is a good game id say but i dont think ill enjoy it as much as rage which i really did enjoy not much of a leap for 11 years in my eyes dos sound comparison rage 2 with max graphics is top the sound of rage 2 is basically your character being half deaf hearing only low tonebass frequencies yeh clothing probley because its 30yrs later dipshit the rage 2 characters look like they were at a fortnite cosplay god dam did i love the nail gun in rage 1 with the rebar altfire and all great video this just shows how superior the id engine is to the shity apex engine id software made a massive mistake of not using id tech 7 for rage 2 blehh rage 2 the game feel likes it was mashed together by an algorithm that just took tropes from previous open world fps the game takes literally zero risks and a result feels soulless and generic rage 1 looked more gritty and dark having a more muted color palette and i liked that rage 2 looks too neon and less complex its like they are trying to blend the synthwave aesthetic with postapocalyptic wasteland and it just looks weird and not appealing rage 2 is outstanding just like the 1st imo always been a fan of the 1st now i see reviews saying theres nothing to do in the second ive not been bored for a second literally something going on almost everywhere ive been rage 1 looks better and the atmosphere is better too rage 1 has aged relatively well for an 8yearold game its world looks more gritty and dirty in many cases rage 2s world on the other hand looks way more colorful and detailed with all the benefits of using a much newer enigine especially on the lighting i wonder what the game would look like if they used id tech 6 or 7 instead of their own apex sound effects are much meatier on rage 1 though thanks for the comparison the girls in rage 1 were way sexier i never asked for this now i like gritty post apocolyptic games but despite rage 1s good gritty textures i love the more colorful enviroments it looks so alive i mean its why love overwatch and tf2 over the cod and battlefield games i love color and rage 2 has color also the sound design of the weapons in rage 1 sound kinda light pitched kinda giving off a sorta weak sounding gun while the rage 2 weapons sound more meatier and actually pack a punch like a particular space marine with some meaty sounds anyway i personally never played these games but rage 2 is the winner for me rage 2 looks more like an improved fallout 76 that we should have had when fallout released my opinion i miss the feeling of danger you had when entering an enemy base in rage1 the new one is just an open world shoot em up i loved rage 1 and the changes are really disappointing think i must play 1 first again before i start my number 2which i havebut havnt played it yet just to get all that story freshed up again i hate the new hot pink colorful punk style in rage 2 the old dirty scavenger dusty style from he first game was pretty awesome such a shame they changed the style i liked rage1 i bought the special edition a while after its release and i thought it was great what i wish i saw more of was the tech from before the apocalypse the main guys nano technology and internal defibulator made me wish there was a lore section like what they did in doom i love both especially rage 2s something about bright shiny neonpastel color palettes make me happy especially when put in contrast to the world itself i love rage 2 but some of the character models and overall theme is a bit too much i really like the first games style but i get that they have to try something new would have been nice with a mixture of both and not just them going all out on the pink theme so 2 is identical to 1 other than the color pink that they added wow goes to show how stylistic graphics still outdo modern day generic look rage still looks better is it just me or is the face animation in rage 2 as terrible as mass effect 3 they almost look like someone is blowing compressed air at their mouth with a nozzle while they try to speak complete garbage also even on ultra settings i find the characters look very drab and lacking in detail its a serious step back compared to something like metro exodus for example this game does not stand up to games released as early as last year even far cry 5 puts rage 2s character animations to shame thoroughly disappointed rage 2 looks more like tech demo than a game i finished the game before the video driving in rage 2 sucked still have rage 1 on ps3might give it a shot again rage 1 looks better and is more unique imo the settlers pistol in rage 1 sounds more realistic and is more realistic the settlers pistol in rage 2 has the sound of the brass being ejected despite it being a revolver design and the spent cases still in the cylinders in the reload animation i bought rage 2 and hated it rage 1 looks better and neat this reminds me of halo wars 2 vs halo wars 1 similar in art style i kind of wish the they kept the general look and feel of the first game dark gritty and lived in i really enjoyed the original rage although i got bored before the end and never finished it the world building interested me im a sucker for apocalyptic scifi and art style mixed well with the decent action there just wasnt enough variety in the game play to really keep me interested though although it looks a bit better and has vastly improved shooting mechanics from the look of things my overall impression of rage 2 is very similari havent seen enough to know if the world building is better or worse does anyone get annoyed by the texture pop up in the first game two things letting down rage 2 are lack of texture detail overall it looks blurry and less clear than rage 1 for r2 i dont think it would have been very hard to at least add a sharpen filter if the engine is not up to producing a clear image they should throw in coop for story mode big amount of ppl lost interest when its single player i enjoyed rage 1 but what i saw from rage 2 didnt prompt me to want to pick it up day 1 will wait for it to go on sale while im loving rage 2 rage 1 has the best art style that represents a wasteland in decay imo the neon pink is more like a cyberpunk style tho amazing video dude cant wait to get this game rage 2 is clearly better but people will unconditionally like older things because nostalgia lol i hate the overusage of fog effects in modern games and the illumination of it its so far from realistic as it can come just look out the window do you see fog that makes everything appear soft no yeah i didnt think so its sooo fucking annoying i prefer low res textures and sharp graphics over this bullshit its even worse than the overusage of bloom effect when it was new yeah i will say rage 1 look far more better because its about survival and scavengingaka mad max graphicalrange 2 with that combination colors and characters design looks like a lot of clowns the people who has clown phobia can not play this game i dont say that is not a good gamebut they could do better then this bethesda should name this game rage of the clowns how can a trailer make me like the game like that but when i play it the dissapointment runs through my blood rage2 is such a disappointmenti prefer rage1 excellent video dude you really laid it all out in detail i will happily give you my like and sub looking forward to more content like this technically rage 2 has the upper hand but i prefer the dark and gritty art style of the 1st everyone is trying to mimic gta vs cartoony contrast blasted graphics mad max ripoff much as if rage 1 was any good what as made them think that the public wanted another one rage 1 is the best rage rage 2 needs a hd texture pack is it bad that im saying that the rage 1 design looks better than rage 2 design the first one as a game is 100 better i have rage 2 thank you and love you codex dark and disturbing in rage1 thats why i liked it better you had a feeling of sorrow in a evil hostile planet that is normal now rage 2 just seems to happy and bright boring the artstyle of rage 1 looks way more crisp i like crisp textures rage 2 looks bland and boring and that horrible chromatic abberation not worth 60 bucks short story crysis 2007 still beats both of them except cars are faster rage 1 non pbr rage 2 pbr rage 2 looks more cartoonish though colors too flashy they should have left it as rage 1 more realistic colors at 930 what is that completely disagree rage 1 to me looks slightly better the design is a nicer style and overall environment i like better as well i found rage 1 was actually more fun than rage 2 example in rage 1 when u drive to each mission there was always lots of bandits in cars that would come at you and start trying to kill u were i found with rage 2 the open world isnt so engaging and bandits dont even notice u so maybe the ai is not so good anyone notice this thanks avalanche lazy to reuse car sounds from mad max id like to start by saying great video ive been hoping someone would do a comparison video like this so thank you for that now to a couple points i think people need to think about rage had a decent story and pretty fluid gameplay it did have some graphical issues but lets face it the ps3 didnt have the capability the ps4 does ps4 is just an example i really enjoyed the first rage even with its quarks i think rage 2 has potential but i do worry about how its going to feel because it looks like they pulled it so much towards being nearly a rage skin placed over mad max i just bought rage 1 on steam for 499 so i can check it out b4 rage 2 prey isnt by id software but by 3d realms human head studios it uses their engine though 1440p is not a resolution i like more the design of the rage 1 i like rage 2 more colorful no need dark brow tint to be apocalypse far cry new dawn copy cat surprised how empty rage 2 feels just look at the sky in original rage its fung amazing so real this sky is just perfect rage 1 all the day the screen swaybob in the first game was really bad much better in the second game i personally think the locations in both games look bland i cant wait for cyberpunk 2077 we will finally have a more modern and advanced city to explore in an open world game the visuals in rage 1 werent cell shaded dont know about yall but rage 2 seems off rage the first one was ahead of its time graphically because i remember when i played the rage demo on 360 and i was blown away by the blur motion and graphic design compared to a lot of games out at the time rage was hated before and now it is suddenly for no reason loved by people rage 2 story seemed short when i played through it now im going and trying to do all the camps and stuff but the gameplay is very fun rage 1 looks much better the art direction and unique textures it is like an artwork come to life rage 2 just looks generic in comparison rage 1 had much better sound imho but yeah times have changed and rage 2s more dynamic environments are a welcome addition i hate when a game gives me a choice between a male and female protagonist the art direction suffering the sjwlgbt propaganda this kind of rainbowpocalypse just make me puke glad didnt baught that game youre calling things more detailed that really look less detailed than the original what a disgrace to id software this most likely is not the same id software from back in the day i personally dont buy the reason for the bright colours and change in art direction being due to the law seems to be an effort to chase the popular game trend of having bright colours everywhere something call of duty adapted in recent years black ops 4 is almost cartoony in its art style a great example of making it look prettier while not adding any mechanics i really enjoyed rage 1 and not gonna lie having a ton of fun with rage 2 sure 40 wouldve been a better price point considering how short it is but if you actually take your time explore and check every area like i think id wanted us to its a big game lasting many more hours than straight story grinding imo for what it is i say 810 as a story based hours invested game 710 loved this game on xb360 and replayed it a lot of times on pcs years later still great to play the first title while im not sure if the second one will be that great anymore in some years the gun fire effect is a lot better and smooth in rage 2 got the rage collectors pack still wrapped and sat on my desk for years never used kinda kicking myself now as it definitely stands for its age they should have just swapped the pretty depth of field effects from the guns over lol and new textures everything else seems changed for the wrong reasons why are games going backwardz yet teknologeeeez forward rage 1 the best by far the other is bulletstorm 12 rage 1 is so much better the style shift was horrid went from awesomereal to retarded why so much pink rage 1 is 1000 times better even with all the problems it has like the rushed ending the art direction of rage 2 feels souless the game is not even made by id software and it is not even using idtech engine rage 1 still looks good in my opinion why doesnt rage 2 have multiplayer though that would be awesome at the speed and how satisfying the gun play is itd be like a new unreal tournament we never got so basically its like mad max 2 considering theyre the same developers of both games and the gameplay is pretty fucking identical minus the perspective view but thats all idk how to feel about it to be honest i think what you meant about the detail in the first game on guns and environment being far superior in the first was supposed to come out as the contrast on edges and separations are more apparent in the first game where the second has more detail but softer edges awesome video man whats this thing of putting pink foken everywhere far cry new dawn now rage its the punkhipster revenge turning on player shadow is an option lol man rage looked great for its age i dislike how they removed the effect of the revolvers cylinder turning when fired in rage 2 i guess it was only a preorder bonus though though i think rage 2 looks better in almost every sense i still dont think any game can top rage 1s daddy skybox well seems like it is just me but i prefer rage 2 much more in any way graphics artwork style sound fx just everything i especially like that neoncolored expression of rage 2 theres a bit left in there of mad max as well which is one of my alltime favourites still i also like the color sceme of rage 1 which appears to be more serious and believable wasteland style but gosh rage 2 is done so much more well that feeling when sound of the revolver in the 2nd game is followed up by shell case drop i dont know what they want rage 1 looks great when it came out andstill looks good rage one is definitely a better game rage 2 looks like its trying to be every other open world game recently with its realistic art style but i like the style of rage 1 better i prefer old style to this new age bullshit pink and yellow crap rage 2 30 fps on standard ps4 serious fail i always thought rage 1 had better graphics since the reveal trailer for rage 2 for me rage 2 has this wierd blur filter thing going on maybe its the depth of field prevalent in games these days rage 1 just looks sharper and does have better character designs i do like the new color scheme rage is like the hot topic of fps going from drab brown and grays to neon pinks lol um sorry what so great about the blurry graphics in rage2 i loved the looks and feel of rage way more than this new game ive noticed that the game deaigners in these newer more complex graphic games they seem to make the npcs less natural they seem almost robot like they just stand there idling and waiting for you to walk up to them and talk i miss when the game would feel like an actual little world instead of just a game that doesnt have any intelligence with the npcs everything seems more like a arcade shooter youd find at a nickle arcade with every event set up to happen less naturally and seems kinda forced like its supposed to happen regardless rdr2 is the only game ive played so far that i can afford that has what seems like the npcs have character and are slightly unique so it seems like a virtual world you can plug into and have a second life kind of feeling to it the gameplay is decent but i like games that have destruction and gore if you can brutal kill people with explosions i want some body dismembering or atleast when you stab someone it leaves an accurate stab wound idk i expe rage 2 is a good game but rage 1 is a classic rage 2 doesnt feel great it looks muddy while rage looks crystal clear and you can see why the megatexturing was important back in those day i really hope theyll come back to idtech if theyll make another rage game prey and quake 4 were not id games stopped the video after hearing that dislike my main grip is i loved the borderlands mad max crossover not this doom with cars im a little disappointed of rage2 technical on onex is not the best some time theres wonderfull vision but overallnope the gunplay is fantastic and the best of the game but more like doom as original rage for me overall i like more rage1 the artistic of part 1 was way cooler rage 1 is too static just sittn here being ghetto waiting for that price to drop hahaaa these game developers dont even try to make anything new anymore part 2 is almost just a copy of part 1 but with newer graphics that really arent even that much better lol used to be part 2 would be a completely different game not a remastered version of the previous game there following bethesdas fallout 3 fallout 4 model 534 i like that swamp area very much i can play a whole game just based on that area alone rage 1 had megatextures while rage 2 uses regular polygons and texturing rage 1 could jam in more detail for less memory and better fps but it also had muddied upclose textures and terrible popin im not quite sure why rage wasnt popular i played it recently and it held its own against current titles just fine i had a blast and it was an adrenaline rush the details are amazing it was definitely ahead of its time the first rage looks the part the second got a softer filter and a paint job feels like far cry new dawn pink themed 0432 nicholas raine i liked the artistic wasteland look of the first one way morebut since time has passed i am liking the new artistic direction as well and the amount of fluid action and total carnage and mayhem you can create in this game is one hell of a ride i am loving it turn the difficulty up to hard or nightmare and turn off the aiming reticule and its good fps fun im enjoying rage 2 the graphics on ps4 are average at times they can shine but their is fun to be had with the gameplay the script is shockingly poor sometimes the dialogue is genuinely cringeworthy i prefer the art style of the first game rage 1 has the greatest looking sky box its static okay but nontheless absolutely great imo what was that weard interaction in 930 oo rage 2 feels and plays better too me however the game never looks sharp at max settings 60fps at 1440p it feels like im always running the game at 720p theres like an ugly washed out blur layering the screen that is quite noticeable during all gameplay on here it looks alot crisper but it sucks lol rage 1 has better animation facial animation and reaction animation especially better and consistent art design calm ui the new one in annoying its in my face every 5 minutes and doesnt let me proceed and that damn beautiful skybox also the first game had super cute spider robots rebar gun sniper rifle alt ammo mind controlling crossbow and john goodman same boring repeatetive hollow generic crap as the first part rage 1 used a procedural generation technique for the textures allowing them to look extremely varied the mouth movement is fucking awful in r2 i have not met 1 gamer say they loving motion blur please game companies remove it rage one is density and atmosphere edges it out for me well damn rage 1 looks a lot better than rage 2 in every way rage 2 pedestrians are from walmart pistol sounds better in 2 shotgun sounds way better in 1 but god now that i hear how it was car gameplay in 1 i love more the 2 feel the default car sounds deeper and better normal npcs in rage 2 seem very awkward the mutties look better i prefer the original rage human character models from a distance rage 1 npcs look far better rage 1s baked lighting on megatextures looks really great apart from texture popin which didnt really bother me its downside is that once you add any dynamic lighting or move objects things will instantly look weird its clear that rage 2 character models appear more detailed um mate i think you dropped your glasses lol the biggest problem for me are the aa methods rage2 uses fxaa and taa always is a bit blurry in my opinion rage 1 style rage 2s style overall rage 2s choice of colors make it look too fake for me it feels like they over did the saturation in rage 2 with some exorbitant amount of neon colors it looks pretty but throws me out of the whole this is a postapocalyptic world feel a bit and the outfits that the npcs wear look near comedic vs the originals i havent played either game but im loving the mood that r1 sets through just seeing gameplay of it it looks like a game that would be the result of mad max and kenshi having sex lol it seems more unique they essentially went far cry new dawn on rage 2 or saints row 34 on rage 2 went from serious to semiseriousfunny i think the bright colors are beautiful though on rage 2 and if you have a 4k hdr oled or qled tv the game probably just pops in all its cartoonyish colorschemed glory but otherwise id totally go for the first game side note hate how some buildings looked more detailed in the complex textures overall look of the baked lightning of rage 1 still looks very impresive at first look oh my godthe original was soo much betterand that pink againwtfmodern gaming its awful havent played either one but yeah im someone who appreciates the first ones arttone direction more it just looks more immersive or maybe not immersive but more realistic i can be immersed in either one but if i had to choose id choose rage 1 because it looks scarier and i like that rage 2 almost looks like a cartoon version of the original best thing i can compare it to is like saints row 1 to saints row 3 or 4 they did a similar thing with their series direction the average score from the top 10 critics i saw was a 710 i think they focused too much on having a big world with lots of activites and outdoors fps combat and not enough on story and linear fps combat sections everyone says the combat is great tho personaly i think overall everything imporved even though some things changed a bit except the combat areas and main story campaign which is a big thing cause it then makes the not great world the thing which carries the gameplay thought this was gta rage engine and thought there was news on gta 6 i would prefer art style of first rage with graphic enhancements of second one rage 1 had best graphics on ps3 in my opinion few games look as good as rage 1 tfw the original looks better than the second for period of 8 years difference is minimal i dislike rage 2 graphic way to blurry with sooo much neon pink it ruins the aesthetics of rage they didnt really explain what happened from the ending of rage 1 if you havent played rage 1 when did hot pink become to go to for post apocalyptic games the art direction in 1 is far better while the realism of 2 stands out i agree that theres so much less detail on things yet to play it so that will truly inform my opinion maybe ill reshade it to look more like 1 lol ive played neither but id prefer the first one the cars drove a lot better in the original had some drifting feel to them in the second its nonexistent which is odd since these guys made mad max which felt excellent wtf o angry joe played this game it sucks its just wannabe quake and a poor mans doom its repetitive and boring nothing about it is fun and most of the game is an ugly brown barely greenish color so do be deceived by the neon colors because its 90 brown rage 1 gameplay really sucks i couldnt even stand for more than two hourssucks as hell uhm prey 2007 was made by human head studios and quake 4 was made by raven software why did they have to change everything the doomlike gameplay doesnt belong to a game like rage first rage has still a much better storyatmosphere than this one i played thru half the second one and now i can say that the first one was a much better game overall kvasirs eyebrows are crazy 358 name of the store grilla gear swedes will get the joke rage 1 still looks better than fallout 76 i dont like the new face textures they seems so blurred out and that a 2019 game cant beat textures to face models off wither 3 is kinda sad i was hoping for a detailed world from rage 2 but it left me feel empty in this huge vast world going from a to b without enjoying the trip and worst loot system ever just boxes all over the place so sloppy of them atleast i got it for 40 dollar but feel this is worth only 2530 dollar i like the sky in rage 1 those clouds are amazing i really like how open the world of rage 2 is and how fun the combat and activities are i think if it had kept more of rages art style while improving effectsvisual graphics a little it would be even better than it is now of course a game that comes out this year is going to have very nice looking graphics compared to soemthing in 2011 but it feels like im playing a whole new game now as opposed to a sequel im a big fan of both but i think rage takes the cake for me aside of graphicis the game is fun enough to play the original looks better no one asked for rage 2 but now we have it i think its really disappointing how the art direction has somehow taken a step backwards the characters just look so much worse why all the pink far cry 5 vs rage 2 next please note they did use separate game engines the art style on rage 1 is too bland and boring all that brown is just ewww really small visual upgrade considering there is 8 years between these two games so its a remaster hate rage 2 and its art direction also the guns sound better in 1 2 they all sound like the same gun lol it was surprisingly bug free too the only major drawback that i could find was the fact that it didnt take you back to free roam after youve finished the story also the story was a bit short rage with shock pink everywhere looks like some teenager girl on her period having a rage so some good improvements considering there is nearly 8 yrs between them though i dont think its that impressive all this makes me think is how good the original looked for its time i remember on ps3 there was multiple disks is there a big city in rage 2 with skyscrapers like in rage 1 rage was an outstanding game considering i played it on ps3 its disappointing to see how much less this game appears to be i also like the weapon feedback and enemy ai of the first game and the cell shading too this game both of them remind me of borderlands 1 and 2 with the first being more bleak and the second more vibrant 940 rage 1 buggy sounded like pubg vehicles i like rage 1s graphics more than 2s stfu comment something original this is disappointing i am sure i would enjoy playing the game on the right but the game on the left looks better to me rage 2 looks muddy they have this weird filter over the game to hide their laziness note never played the rage series the rage 1 wing stick feel so good compare to rage 2 this is a classic case of if you prefer stylised or realistic games driving is so shitty in rage 2 why rage 2 looks like far cry new dawn i dont liked it because is a new game and all new things sucks and now if you excuse me im going to play pong a real game because all the games that come after pong are bad texture resolution was worse in rage but texture variety using mega textures and environment design was way better scenes just pop there is so much detail in geometry and texture variety no repeating textures very detailed gritty environment i like rage 2 but its environment design and art direction does not compare to rage 1 rage 2 made me think that our technology didnt go that far rage 1 engine is better than rage 2 but not suitable to make open world game the car in the first rage looks good and belongsthe one in rage 2 looks like something out of mass effect really preferred rage it was like borderlands and played alot better in my opinion and graphic wise just more appealing rage 2 is good also its like doom but im personally not into games that are too fast for me blow your nose then do the video for fucks sake rage went from the 1970s mad max to the 1980s90s tank girl in rage 2 its been so long since i finished rage i dont even know what happened at the end of it all i remember was i went into this big authority building with a bunch of mechanized mutants and was pissed off that i couldnt play it after i finished it in rage 1 the npc females didnt look like pissed of man haters the people were actually more attractive 1059 rage 1 looks insane for when it was released i hope they make rage 1 remaster in 2021 every comparison rage wins hands down over rage 2 they did a complete downgrade ehmm what just happened 929 matrix glitch cartoon design would look similar to borderlands good thing they changed that playing rage 2 now all seems to be a bit blurred on rage 2 running in 4k 2080ti all in ultra but prefer how the original looked like the texture had more contrast and nothing blurred more detail perceived by the eye even if it technically is the contrary will always prefer rage 1 just due to nostalgia all the game look great couldnt they find their own colors palette im sick of this magentacyan everywhere for no reason i loved the first rage and prefer the more serious tone then the wacky of new this gives rage a very borderlands feels in comparison to rage2 both are pretty good i dont get how people prefer the brown brown and brown palette of the original i prefer the darker segments but they werent the entire game by far stagnant and poorly baked brown desert lighting looks tired and boring yeah rage 2 overdoes the neon but the palette actually has some variety and ill take that any day versus yet another brown desert in the sun rage2 looks like a borderlands wannabe rage1 is outdated but shows effort with some graphic mods reshade it can be brought almost up to par with modern games and with much better art style rage 2 should add a dlc pack where you can change the artstyle to rage 1 alike but that would be a lot of work other id games prey and quake 4 neither of those are id titles neither i prefer the art style in rage 1 but especially on the open world rage 2 has far better graphics and details nice job thanks is this open world game like fc4 can id and avalanche just remaster rage 1 if its of course up to them i remember how exited i was about rage 1 after playing fallout new vegas never understood any complaints about that game why they make everything pink rage 2 has less interesting places than rage 1 dead city alone in rage 1 is pretty great are there any mini games in rage 2 im obviously going to prefer the old well whats its name lol because i had some of the most amazing roleplay in there but it doesnt mean the new one is all bad just obviously going to prefer the versions where my most memorable momentsmemories were rage looks x10 better then rage 2 im interested in the pc specs cpugpu ocno oc info for this video i think i prefer the older style and some guns sound better in the original than in the new one whats up with all the hate everyone on the comments seems to be bandwagoning the original games graphics are so incredibly boring it all looks exactly the same and has next to no variety the first rages design is so basic and straight forward theres no imagination to it its like every other post apocalyptic game i dont want to look at the same 3 shades of dirt all day rage 2 is just overall the better game by leaps and bounds theres a reason everyone forgot about rage one 826 look at the left can which moves less due to the pressure and high mass wow wait this the just cause engine rip frame rate rage 1 is basically borderlands 2 old is gold remember new designs and stuff only do few things right but back then they focused on very little things that are still damn good ubisoft is shivering right now somebody obsessed over toussaint lighting i like rage 2 so far buy the one thing i loved about rage 1 was main npc animationsfaces rage 2 just doesnt have the same wow factor for me in that area to me its very important from a story standpoint art direction is subjective but could be considered better if it matches the story rage 2 clearly has the better graphical effects but id say rage 1 had the better sound its sound was sharp and harsh just like its world design i am enjoying pretty much rage 2 but personally i preffer the artistic style of the first one all tha pinky style gets old fast but love both games great video by the way rage 2 is better in all aspects youre being incredibly nit picky if you think rage 1 was better in any way the game came out almost a decade ago the mechanics fluidity gunplay graphics everything was so much more satisfying in this game you cant just compare a few still images between the two games and derive any sort of meaningful information from it this comparison video seemed a bit meh in my opinion rage 1 has a beautiful sky and clouds this game needs hdr so bad on pc you forgot the animations and water effects both really big things in the first rage people complained that the first game looked too brown and didnt have enough color and everything looked the same so they fix that and people still complain and say the first looks better lmao i say that id tech 5 looks are quite good compared to avalanches engine wow rage 1 is still a great game rage 1 runs the best on xbox one x way better than the pc on ultra love that game if you get the scorched dlc for 499 you cant keep playing after the final mission and finish everything just like fallout 3s broken stell dlc i think rage 2 overdo pretty much everything not in a good way rather a cringy silly way i just know that i loved walking through the dead city in rage 1 and its dark creepy mysterious vibe rage 2 looks cool but its missing something rage 1 has a beautiful skybox it is funny that you can change the time of day in the screenshot mode and when you close it the time of day will stay as you set them in screenshot mode i play on hard but hmmm for me it was not that hard but hey i have to play more so see ya in the wasteland you should disable any sort of aa on your future comparisons to keep it more 1 to 1 rage 2 is fun to play but that filter or what ever it is makes it unsharp and a lot of flickering rage 2 looks like pink borderlands did they hire same 10 year old redditors to design it though rage 1 is a bit brown overall i find it more visually appealing mohawks are the future well i will say this rage have better car nitro when u boost u actually fell like ur going significantly faster where as in rage 2 it dosent feel like much of a difference also to anyone who is just experiencing the game now i found taping the boost button in 2 makes u go faster and farther i did a convoy mission once with the boomaaka tank on wheels and i just kept losing the convoy taking small shortcuts of off trail to taking completely different trials to catch them i started to see if just tapping multiple times helps and sure enough i then had no issue keeping up with the convoy rage 1 had a nice conceptual feel to it rage 2 feels like another copy and paste game its actually made me want to play metro now instead wtf was that in the bottom left at 930 rage 2 graphics 2012 lol got it on xbox 360 it had 2 discs the most bothering thing was loading times 200 them legs tho i like them more keynotes why rage 2 is became a decent shooter only 1just cause mechanics 2 farcry new dawn replica 3apex engine is design or programmed only on third person 4political battle between kotaku and bethesda the old art direction was great but the game was so damn lacking the new ones combat and gun gameplay is far superior megatextures which idtech5 pioneered are pretty cool if it was made for modern tech id like to see the quality of the textures now all that detail never repeating at a much higher res would be amazing did you guys found tim willits wellspring xd this guy sounds like kermit the frog the vehicle in rage 2 could use some engine roar rage 1 had a cool mix of scavenger and western vibe while rage 2 is just mad max on pink meth great vid i really like the new gun sounds it puts the old ones to shame rage 2 honestly to me looks worse than rage 1 who asked for a rage sequel anyway lol prefer rage 1 as the cell shaded art style looks great rage 1 was impressive graphics wise for its time while rage 2 graphics habe been pretty disappointing game has been fun to play though cant wait to buy a 7 bundle in 10 years is comparison necessary i dont think so the only thing i hate with newer games like this one is the guns sound unrealistic and muffled where as older games sounds for weaponry was louder and closer to its real life counter parts heres comes the people who were nowhere to be found claming they prefer the first game lmao i got a cyberpunk vibe and its weird but this video got me pretty excited for cyberpunk 2077 on pc im sure it will look amazing im a little bummed the art moved in the slightly cartoony direction i liked the mad max feel of rage 1 bro how do you not have 1million subs this is my favorite thing to watch while i eat food the game is a massive disappointment do not buy this game its way too buggy in its current state within the first minute of gameplay i witnessed multiple glitches that left me confused the pacing is terrible the audio is not timed correctly the aiming is sluggish the driving feels stiff and for some reason i cant turn right it hurts to say this but so far rage 2 has been an absolute chore to play and for nitpicking id just like to say the art direction compared to the original game is pretty ugly imo its a consistent theme its in our faces obvious we are getting games with less quality and less soul funny thing rage had absolutely terrible environmental graphics because the game engine utilized megatextures which are the reason why the game is 17 gigs in size environments look like theyre made from one solid chunk as opposed to individuallyrendered meshes covered in flat hideous ps2era textures outdoor environments look pretty but interior sets look like their textures were scaled to twice their original size like a bad photoshop attempt add in a lack of graphical options and an engine that is very particular in regards to what it considers a recommended gaming rig and youve got yourself a programming disaster is it any wonder why almost no one utilizes megatextures or idsoftwares shitty id tech 5 engine rage 1 was so much nicer looking or at least with a lot better art stylerage 2 looks less cleanmore of the mild style i wish they had deadzone sensitivity here comes the i prefer the old people not a fan of the pink n purple at all almost enough to put me off buying the game i prefer the overall feel of rage 1s graphics and would have preferred an improvement on that style with modern tech just like borderlands 3 are doing looks as tho crafting of rc car bombs and turrets is gone too rage uses megatexture thats why the textures behave weird im really hating pink color everywhere but does rage 2 actually have an ending rage 2s car boost sounds like the blackhole gun from quake 4 for me anyone i wish duke nukem is made with rage 2 mechanics and graphics i remember playing rage 1 with my old logitech g35 headset and the sound from the shotgun dear god the sound was great the shotgun sound now in rage 2 is meh need more boom bass is rage coop these comments make me wonder where the hell was this love for rage 1 when 2 got announced youtubers comments were rippin the original apart rage 2 is not id game avalanche studios created this sequel rage 2 made by avalanche studios not id software 904 why did they put a bullet dropping sound on a revolver personally i love rage 2 think its a blast rage 1 was so long ago i dont even remember how i felt about it all i know is this game is so different compared to the other first person stuff out there ive been playing at the moment first person shooter wise rage 2 titanfall2 doom2016 doom vfr re7 psvr are pretty much all that ive enjoyed the last 10 years rage 2 was better than most of the reviews ive read stated im talking to u game informer rage 2 is a copy of borderlands looking forward to the review man i loved the first one and ive been having an absolute blast with rage 2 the use of megatexture in rage was revolutionary too early perhaps therefore it had problems with quality and performance maybe we will return to them in the future on xbox one x the npcs look horrible also everything is so blurry lots of bugs in the lighting department as well literally lighting changes from one frame to another its a mess there is no reason to look that bad rage 2 on the whole looks brilliant but rage 2 has one horrid issue where the ambient occlusion breaks and dissappears from objects at the edges of the screen as the camera pans how does this seem to escape everyone am i the only one who sees it or should i say cant unsee it happen and thus is constantly distracted by it lol i loved the original rage and ill definitely play the sequel sound in rage 2 is amazing ive never played either but im loving the style of rage 2 the original rage feels like the original borderlands im glad they gave it a bit more 80s futuristic pop colours really helps to separate it from mad max which is another great avalanche title that game was beautiful the first one has a cowboy film feel its sad that there was not a community of modders who added things like skyrim or fallout they are incredible but have a rough gameplay i dont play rage 2 yet but i see it as a caricature of the previous rage 2 has nothing to do with rage rage 2 is doom for losersnothing else i am very dissapointed i click on the video i like the video i thought the video was about rockstar advance game engine aka rage hehehehehehe rage 2 is a linear game forced into an open world settingi mean seriously manwhen i saw all those trailers and gameplays for the gamei always questioned myself why in the hell should this game be in an open world settingseeing as how this game almost had 0 of content regarding the open world structure of the game except car combat and cleaning out outposts aswell as other enemy territories with additional loot pickups here and thereno wonder this game is currently underperforming on market and critic wise speaking and i seriously doubt rage as a franchise will have a future after this gamei believe id software should just remain focusing on the doom franchise from now on and maybe make a single player focused quake game here and there since they no longer make wolfenstein gamesbut in generali believe we should just let rage behindand yesfirst game is defiently better than its sequel in my opinion since it has more content and more weaponsalsowhat you can hear that there is a difference between the sounds of the settler pistol in rage 1 than rage 2 the art style is way better in rage 1 as well as the weapon design looks beautiful but not my kind of game great video i notice that you sometimes make a very wrong assessment detail quality this is wrong detail grabs your attention and should be used when it makes sense for example the detail in the rooftops of the buildings in rage 1 is bad detailing it pulls your attention away to that what matters the city and the streets great video comparing the quality of both games couldnt be more clear thanks rage 1 looks so much better then rage 2 its like the difference between doom 3 vs the latest doom the older looked more creepy and dark and the new one is more collorfull and cahotic i like both in their looks i miss the trophy room rage 1 the best i have to say rage 1 looks incredible on a pc that can handle it although im sure rage 2 is more fun lol rage 1 is far superior in all aspects rage 2 is a completely piece of junk the first minutes gave me depression 2019 has being a very bad year in gaming thank you for the video nick rage 2 really doesnt look appealing to me and with your comparaison i understand why rage 2 is surely more advanced in technology but the art style was so much better in rage 1 everything looked more interesting and detailed the open world of rage 2 is surely bigger but it also looks terribly boring and empty i feel like guns at least pistol and shotgun in rage 1 feels much more powerful compared to rage 2 the sound comparison shows rage 1 to be better in that category also rage 1 is supposed to look more cartoony than rage 2 hip firing is so disturbing when you have a scope can someone tell me if its the same character and map realistic bloom effects i prefer the beautiful sky box and art style of rage 1 than rage 2 rage 1 is memorable and r2 is forgettable rage 1 has a focused art direction and r2 is trying to please everyone yes you can easily find better screenshots in r2 but they dont mix well together its all out of places and styles ive never played more than the first half hour of rage because the texture streaming issue makes it unplayable is rage 2 essentially a rage remaster rage 1 was an oddball game but it had some personality rage 2 lacks exactly that and will be quickly forgotten like rage 2 better in every way its a huge improvement can an 1050ti 4gb with i77700hq run it properly come one we got 2019 year and this game dont have 4k and hdr come on no buy the art style resembles to me a little tom clancy wildlands vs fallout new vegas dustinessany thoughts rage has the best skybox in any game ive ever played rage 1 was made to run on consoles that only had 512 mb of ram i played rage but never finished it after finishing nearly half of the game i am starting to get bored is this mad max fallout 2 i prefer the more stylized character designs from rage 1 and the facial animation is half life levels good i also prefer the drabber color scheme i really dont wanna be that guy but i kinda prefer the look and art direction of rage 1 not to mention the sky and clouds in rage 1 look very cool i know both games are using completly different engines but i think in a direct comparison you cannot see that there are 8 years between fun fact your video made me more interested in the game then any other video so far no matter if official trailer or test video and yours is only a graphic comparison walking through someones concept art is how i will describe rage henceforth i could never fully fix the texture popin on rage 1 rage 2 is not a rage game rage 1 still looks much more badass than this fake one despite it is 8 years old to be honest rage 2 looks blurry during majority of the comparison idk wtf the game devs are doing rage less detailed but sharp rage 2 detailed blurry models rage had sharper texture detail and massively better npc animation particularly in conversations rage 2 particles are amazing though love the smoke and explosion effects how does the game look on standard ps4 tho realistic realistic goodness what is the obsession with realism i think the first one had way more style and the shift towards more realism in a highly unrealistic game world was a big step back visually speaking bathesda have to put games out with a difrent graphicsall the games looks the same rage 1 borderlands rage 2 far crydoommad max hi nick can you do a comparison between fifa 2011 and fifa 2019 to see how lazy ea are d this game sucks kong dick depressing as ever graphics in rage 2 looks generic the first one has a unique looking wellspring has more geometrical detail in rage 2 the detail you are pointing out in rage 1 is related to the art design of the texture the textures in rage 2 are of higher resolution in wellspring both games look great rage 1 still holds up thx to art design and great character animations imo i dont know what game to buy rage 2 or plauge tale innocence because rage 2 i fear that it may be boring really fast and plauge tale once i finish it there will be nothing to do after watching this video now i wanna play the rage 1 for some reason it looks really interesting rage 2 is awesome and i am enjoying it but rage 1 looks like it is really dark and interesting everything in rage two looks blurry how is that better than sharp grafics i do miss the whole ammunitionchange mechanic i loved loading in different bullets for different situations and it sucks that they didnt add it in rage looks incredible even to this day rage 2 looks and sounds better i still prefer the originals look and feel i heard its all the rage theese days this makes me want to play the original again rage 2s art direction of the character is pretty meh theyre overdoing it on the hot pink the graphics in rage 1 looks better not to be that guy but the original looks better excellent quality as always rage 1 still looks good against rage 2 thnk you for the comparison man i sure hope theres one guy in the town making fun of the cone head people what a downgrade i think one of the reasons that they worked with avalanche using the apex engine is becaue the tech engine doesnt seem to work so well when it comes to massive open games when gamers want half life 3 but got rage 2 hey nick930 try to give your opinion at the end of your videos you know maybe rate the games and how you like them that would be even greater to watch i like more the old rage for some reason i commented early i think graphics wise its a mixed bag rage 1 seemed to have some advantages in detail where rage 2 seemed washed out and blurry but then there were other details where it was vice versa sound wise rage 1 all the way rage 2 sounded like someone ramped up the bass then stuck a thick pillow over top of the sound design palette alway nice to see you uploading a new wellmade video keep up your great work greetings from germany m e g a t e x t u r e s son hahasha almost 9 years and they give shit game i have realy good times with rage 1 and what i watch from gameplays of r2 i must say nahhh boring story gameplay mechanics etc rage is basically a lower quality borderlands i never personally got into rage 1 yeah visuals were nice but never enough to got me invested in the mess the story was so i skipped on rage 2 but i gotta say that the more colorful and bright presentation and praise the combat is getting im really considering picking it up it looks to be a fun beautiful open world game ill wait untill your review to see if i buy it or not great video as always nick ive been waiting for this getting new releases out faster than df in rage 1 the npcs look like theyre having constipation problems how about a comparison video between cod mw3 vs cod mw4 i still wonder to this day why dont you have more subs your content is something that is hard to find but youtube would rather recommend garbage you should do ghost recon wildlands vs ghost recon breakpoint great comparison did anyone ask for a rage sequel first first to comment burger is part of a complete breakfast bajur speaking of doom the first ad was doom when badger doesnt realize that rage is in the doom universe and the bfg is in the game he convinced me to buy the game and its definitely not worth it and you still get to play doom eternal early ima use that line when i rampage on zombies burn the wolrd boil the oceans badger please please i beg of you play borderlands with geuce and heavenly should i buy this game ai the stronger the connection the stronger the force my reaction it is the force is it just me or would doom guy fit right in with the space marines of dawn of war so what youre saying is youre basically playing as angron from warhammer 40k if angron was enough of a pussy to use firearms instead of ripping his enemies limb from limb with his bare hands shatter is the most fun shit ever is it just me or is this game criminally underrated i watched this to decide if i would get it and nope its not rage and it shouldnt have been given rage 2 name i would prefer just to play the first one again this is legit what happened to saints row is they decide to completely change the game thanks for dooing this video i am now buying this on my new xbox 1s grunt used rock mr president used vehicular manslaughter btw they put the bfg in the deluxe version i think that was on the weapon wheel when he pulled it up howd he not say anything i love the the term oxygen thief im going to use that now i think the bfg from doom is in this game i wonder what jdawg was like during this hey badger how u doin buddy anyway great video this video is wat definitively made me wanna play rage 2 and i didthanks a bunch but two questions wen are u gonna do the video for the full version of this game and wen are u gonna do doom 2016 video in ur style cuz common dudetheres a hella of a lot of ppl who are literally waiting for that to happen since three fucking years brawther see wat i dd there anyway please good sir consider making a doom 2016 video who the fuck went to an id meeting and said you know what sounds cooler that mr president walker and every one just agreed basicly destinybut moreangery this is so much fucking violence that even my phone drops frames game is just too boring and repetitive yea this game was garbage rage 2 is literally just played college ball senator i forgot his name b 837 oxygen thief 204 is that gigan from godzilla man i have not seen that fucker for wuite some time maybe like 3 or 4 years think about this guy breaks into your home with chainsaw arms and destoys everything and runs away screeching so basically rage 2 is a mad max mixed with farcry mixed with doomgive me some fucking heavy metal lets tear people limb from limb and turn them into blood soup yeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaah i want this to be in like a war hammer 40k setting bc with bolters and vortex cannons man you can literally rain hell when i look at this game i see far cry doom and call of duty advanced warfare edit forgot to mention cocaine lots of it i thinl its a cobination of farcry red faction armageddon and fallout is nobody gonna talk about how they changed mr president to walker lol what happened to the order or the fact arks were just cryo storage for humans such as the main person in rage 1 doom plus crysis is all i see and its great edit forgot farcry as well the whole game is just hoes mad i just realized that badger in this video mostly used doom models everyone liked that all do respect but you look like the bag guy from lazy towns special needs brother if you link rage 2 with doom you can get the bfg 9000 in rage 2 athis game was actually really good are you going to play doom eternal tho get boderlands 3 not this it will break on you 100 omg i got childhood flashbacks from gigan everyone gangster till badger pulls out the shotty 1053 when you need an angry retort i was disappointed to hear that rage 2 didnt live up to this most of the time come to think of it why havent you done a video on doom the concussion cannon already has been done cod zombies zeus cannon 015 then he says he gets to play doom eternal early holup searches the steam store and sees that the publisher is bethesda softworks and remembers fallout 76 and knowing damn well i prepurchased doom eternal oh no what is that doom remix cuz i really want to here it dont get me wrong i like badger vids but this game was so terrible it was funny the guy who set the game up is just me personified 931 i see what you did there my guy i can do whatever i want yes you can do anything you want its your video lol fus ro dah ps play skyrim purge everything in great holy fire d master flex is my spirit animal what about the bfg doom guy what are you taking about id is such a good company this game looks sick 246 did you know thats gigan basically a villain for godzillas 2004 and the 1972 gigan 240 is that the rocket alien demon thing from doom i feel like this is borderlands on 40 pounds of crack rocks so basically the firestorm is jojo refrence you have such a wonderful vocabulary i wasnt a fan of rage the story just like wasnt interesting anyone got an update on d master flex to me the firestorm revolver just turns you in to colonel mustang from fullmetal alchemist who would win 500 space marines or one ragey boi and one doomer boi bethesda hey badger ya want to play one of our games early badger okay can you give me one minute turns into doom guy doom eternal early bitches woo bethesda wanna play rage 2 badger oh uh yeah sure sad doom guy noises notice how the bfg

quote ive ever heard burn the world and a boil the oceans do part two on other guns vehicles and story i still play rage 1 the thanos snap tho the ark ai voice is failsafe from destiny 2 i instantly im going to get this game because i love failsafe on nessus 206 final wars gigan why you here boi yo no hate cuz i like ur content but why u got the same hairline as magic johnson rage 2 looks way better than the first one jim sterlings look at this game made it look boring as fuck generic open world gamethis is the kind of shit that makes me buy games seriously it looks like playing bulletstorm as the doomslayer when is our next rage 2 video 207 soooooo burning modified gigan to quote grayson hunt from bulletstorm killing is an art form too bad they put it on the epic games store 820 hey badger if you saw the el wey briefing in ghost recon wildlands i think thats the same some asshole maximum override hyaaa runs of into an army while lit on fire with chainsaw for hands 408 hey its roy mustang from fma this video is way more entertaining than the game it self xd 236 sponge bob movie remake confirmed is it just me or does the firestorm revolver turn you into roy mustang from full metal alchemist i need to buy a bowl for some hot and ready soup wait are you sure this is bethesda im not seeing the normal microtransactions im happy to see that they arent inputting them in their demos yet this just gos overbord they went far cry new dawn on this like go play 1st game its alot better in ways 1010 it was super effective when you do get to play doom eternal guess what shtfu he protec he attac but most importantly he use thuum attack only true gamers have played rage the first game not when i shift into maximum overdrive hiya i get that this video is a lil old but did you know theres a bfg from doom in rage mildly aggravated the second anthonypit in the future 941 ragefull concern intensifies crippling depression in 3 2 1 029 yall do know that the bfg 9000 is in rage 2 what is the song in this outro reinforcements hey did these guys get claped or what last remaining survivor nope this guy walked in with some dumb a pistol and snapped everyone on fire reinforcements httpstenorcomviewhibyehomerthesimpsonsbushesgif14459532 wait wait wait is it just me or does the ark ai sound like failsafe from destiny 2 dude the pistol concept is stolen from resistance 3 is it wrong that i have a boner about this game right now ngl i fuckin love ratm 208 lol gigan is packing the heat i want this game badger activates overdrive the weapon is now harder better faster and stronger get it mr president is gigan eat a snickers why hasnt he played doom 2016 you can get the bfg firestorm revoler sounds like the horrible pistol in apex legdens 943 is this spider man whats the doom song called that plays in the beginning that looks fucking sick where can i find the doom guy photo this game is amazing and it has already come out so leave a like if you want badger to play this again why you use thanos as model for snapping fire that is all colonol mustang is good for taking the word killing machine and turning it into a game clap absolutely clap genius i just heard about this game and i love it okay good i wonder if jdawg was actually jbird only jbird would get that so hey jay watching this i realized that when u go overdrive it sounds like fallout 4 when u use a a phychojet even though the gameplay is great rest about it is shit and boring you would be a good actor of joker its awesome that still have mutant bash tv well ubisoft gave badger a screen tearing game to play anyone using this video to decide if they want to buy this game keep this in mind the combat is superb however the world is empty boring and uninspired the story is also very lackluster badger gets call from bethesda also badger guess whos playin doom eternal early bethesda well actually we were thinking about rage 2 badger am i a joke to you rage is literally just borderlands except borderlands is better in every way od on overdrive the entire video i was just thinking someone should make him an action figure of himself with some of those oneliners lol new monster coming to godzilla burning gigan bethesda hey id want help with doom 2016 id in the corner blood murder death hahaha kill them alll death guns death bethesda fuck this shit im out the firestorm revolver was already done by resistance or something like that cant really remember the name or which game it was in but its m pretty sure its in the 3rd but rages is better just not original so y didnt u use the grav gun to smash one guy into his friend real hard effectively killing them both i love how you used gigans model to show youre description of how dangerous you are in that game clears throat so uh how do i get this game chief somthing like space marines but lamer my everything watching this owo this is the dakka i need 139 your getting that all wrong its doomslayer

capt price to pop out and say righthow did a muppet like you pass selection u gonna come back and have some full gameplay you didnt got the bfg9000 you are not worthy ok so all i got from this video is bager likes doom i thought rage 2 was a madmax clone but its better then i thought grabs vent gun and shoots shock wave fus ro dah the grunt used rock mr president used vehicler man slaughter this is so unlike the first rage game i feel so old for even knowing it exists this game looks sick as frick then there is me over here it took me 5 hours to compete the game he fucks around and does it in one hour and 30 minutesgolly i suck at games bethesda is getting a kick out of this video oml we need a series thats just badger playing siege with his friends i got a rage 2 ad lol definitely gonna get this game 943 peter what happened to you the one liners are great mr bajur so glad you recomended this been playing it all day you forgot the big fing gun the bfg 9000 is in this game boiii is literally nobody in the comment section a rage against the machine fan 930 so basically doom but in a fallout world why was were more then half the enemies female 1007 just have to watch it i never

destroyed if one puppy got him mad you bet a bunch of lovely floofers dead will make him mad rage 2 is so different compared to the first one im confused imagine the dude paid to set up the game hearing badger yelling like hes raping someone with a chainsaw someone pls tell me wtf the storyline in this game is is there a coupon code or na i can just imagine the guy listening to all the one liners you said worrying if youd gone insane more i need more now pretty much a futuristic farcry awesome i want to steal laptop mans microchip already burn in holy fire i did a doom multiplayer demon change into a buff boi with pecs thiccer then the fog from madhouse from the testosterone this was giving me the revolver is literally the design from the resistance game what difference does overdrive make for the gravdart launcher im like 90 sure this video is sponsered 845 hold up one gad dam minute is badger a fucking hk droid from star wars dont high five russian or youll get clapped to the moon man badger needs to do voice acting for games but what about the end game what can you do when you beat the story you can get the bfg from doom in rage 2 btw the shotgun altfire is a slug round fucking retard good review tho this what i want to do to everyone what is funny is that in the scroll wheel you can see the outline of the bfg 9000 which is in the game he was talking about doom enternal theres some new operators in r6s 1124 um but then what would even be the point what happened to your family random npc no i have no idea where that mass murderer you are talking about is at while i was watching this i got a add for this game still waiting on a doom video ive missed you i havent watched you in a long time guess what shit fucks i jus ok so basically according to the model you provided you turn into gigan so the gravdart makes ya a watered down magneto what is the song on 022 ive been trying to find it but i cant mrpresident is actually black im not going to play this game just because its not my style but hot damn you make it an awesome looking game love the content and editing keep it up 418 and with a snap of my fingers i can erase half of all life killer queen

cant wait to get it new sub fan and all around lover of your videoscan i get an amen brothers surprised you didnt play the version with the danny dyer voiceover is it just me or does the lady from the simulations sound like failsafe from destiny 2 for anyone wondering the chainsaw robot mcgee lookina at 206 is gigan from godzilla final wars j dog sloop is the next person to get shot by some rando does badger watch merkmusic this guy literally makes any game that im not interested in into interesting ive played a lot of this this is by far the most accurate first impressions video i have ever seen oh how badger is trying soo hard to sell this to us i tried to play the game with stealth total failure you are like the end of the world with legs id like to imagine the bethesda guy listening to this commentary and thinking he didnt seem this high when supervised him playing it can you please be one of the future cheat codes like hes on fire lol anthropomoorphised chainsaw you sound like boomstick i think thats his name i forgot p from deathbattle snarling oxygen thief my new favorite insult imagine what jdawg was thinking when badger was saying random shit that revolver is how all boltguns should be in warhammer 40k games overdrive mode that is should we give em grenades nah give em a black hole congrats i am now excited for this game and salty that i am too poor to get it if doom and crysis had a baby lol nice shot gun looking forward for the doom eternal video with the dumbest shit imaginable with the combat shotgun with rolling barrels mod that ark ai is destiny 2s failsafe and you cant change my mind i want to see you play more of this its hilarious i was eating soup during this most crazy video i ever watched half the time i didnt know what i was watching so much crazy loved it dude this hilarious mf looks like nph you can find the bfg 9000 grunt used rock mrpresident uses vehicular manslaughter gets me all the time i got an ad for rage 2 in a rage 2 video ok god i love bethesda play more hard line plz sick shit nerds literally lost it if you get the deluxe edition of rage 2 you can get the bfg 9000 the nintendo ds looking magazine was small as fuck best line out of the whole video 1010 badger p i z z a t i m e me i dont think ill buy this game sees that you can snap me in second thought id wanna play a game u es get it im playin doom id yeet heresy intensifies anyone remember the 1st game post apocalyptic now its mad max on steroids without the cars crossed with doom with the gravity gun you try pulling objects to a person instead of person to objects my monster bro gigan going crazy with the flames and chainsaw hands free rage 2 on my channel i was thinking about getting this game a i found you made a video and i can now confirm i am getting it donald trump if he was somewhat athletic rage 2 finally someone that thinks mad max is underrated this game is like if doom borderlands and bulletstorms had a child that does crack i can only imagine as j dawg sloop peeks over badgers shoulder asking him if the game is good while badger continuously spews random quips as he shred ass as mrpresident he really used mother fuckin gigan woooow that final wars gigan model xd this is like bullet storm on steroids anyone watching this before you play rage 2 did that buffalo just laughed at me why not do play through or funny moments of rage 2 then they dont trust you with a file because it could leak they send a guy with an actual laptop to your house to play the game for security reasons game comes out and gets cracked in less than a day bruh too bad that the only great thing about it is ids side of the game the guns xd 824 is it the worlds worst highfive or is it the best and they cannot handle it i like the game a lot whats the name of the song he used for doom eternal was that a tf2 laptop i literally had no interest in this game until this video now i need it thanos but that soundtrack yum eh the video was good the game tho playing it actually sucked in my opinion i kinda wanna see another episode of this guy playing rage 2 i was giggling throughout the video but i well and truly lost it at channel my inner dick cheney thank you but what about the music is it good does it complement the gameplay like dooms hm reminds me of bulletstorm oh hell yeah you should definitely do more early access gameplay oh boy did this vid not age well the firestorm revolver predicts the ending to infinity war 416 the quips are so bad theyre good maaan im gonna buy this game i found a subreddit for rage 2 t doom eternal is a hot game this looks liky the game that jimmy plays in gta 5 when franklun sneaks into micheals house to repo the car space marine screams the game 1053 burn the world and boil the oceans 206 when russianbager uses a gigan 2004 model with chainsaws for hands to explain the metaphor xd better review than gggmanlives this game sucks i mean the story and the tutorial and the fucking dialoge just nonstop like shut up already i wanna purge the heretics not read about the crusades gameplay looks fun but the start is just too boring it does live up to its name i was raging at the fucking uninteresting characters not shuting the fuck up how did the same devs that made doom the masterpiece make this peace of dog shit idk man dis shit straight up trash when you said on a laptop i really started to worry about the quality of this video buuuut it seems like it was a rather strong laptop that was able to handel such a game you get to endgame and mr president grows lancers from gears of war j lord sounds like a pretty cunty dude it came out while i sleeping so i just gotta get school done today and get home and do all of my shit fast now i am definitely going to keep an eye on rage 2 im all about cathartic murderrampages rage 2 is like doometernal far cry 5 and mad max mixed together russianbadger on drugs this video is susie failsafe from destiny 2 this the president bethesda watches video what the fuu i want this game so bad now when you meme doom 200 is what happens in any round of apex imagine if j dawg watched this was the redacted part a scp foundation reference so no doom bfg showcase unless you have the preorder or deluxe verison hmm 915 to 925 did badger say od as in online date 407 badger is thanos this feels so much like bullet storm not gonna lie this game looks fuckin awesome the shotgun is bucks and no nomans kid anyone else get super happy when he made the rage against the machine joke whats the song at 021 dumb shit intensifies ok so its doom but not doom if this was cd projekt red and not bugthesda id be all over it so rage 2 and boderlands 3 you missed a massive opportunity to name the video electric boogaloo why is the protagonist of rage 2 not the united states president mister torge abroves of this shit its bordolans its bordolans its bordolans i think this game is best played and displayed by a total adrenaline junkie yeah this will be fun imagine what it would be like if you played this game with grouse rage 2 is doom on heroine would be a good description i love the beginning fus rodah also the mutant said pizza time it was very funny so serious sam iii rage must be the first game that made thanos gaunlet into a gun so rage 2 is doom but without the demons ok time to go back to my calculator and play doom on there rage 2 will release in 4 days or for ps4 its probably earlier 304 who also heard youtube money instead of you to buddy when they didnt read the text only heard what he said welp im sold gonna buy this definitely now the trailers made it look like a wannabe borderlands but hell yea doom style gameplay with insane weapons and made by id software fuck yes what thats the left arm i think every thing you just did in that game was maybe a war crime i had a negative feeling about this game due to the last rage being a generic shooter but now i see rage 2 looks a lot better and has grabbed my interest badger the type of person to activate overdrive but not use the weapons correctly best game previewreview 2019 there i said it thanks badger its hard looking at this vedio he talks a little to much and hes not really that funny but i no kids would really love this type of video dude this guy is good at editing and this guy looks like villian the from the number one clip wow they ruined this game you mean nail guns with magnets quake wants to know your location where are the siege vids at badger 1 year since 1 mil 2 million so this is just a standard powerthirst overdose the shotgun is just nomad and buck thanos 20 doom meats mad max destroying opponents with style driving around in an open map literal overdose of testosterone sold hey badger how come dont try and get into for honor youre still bad at high fives borderlands crysis edition got a new channel please check it outstill figuring stuff out yo id love it if you guys could check out the petition i created to get badger to stream a bl3 playthrough if youd love to see it please consider signing or sharing it idk how to get it out there other than these spamish comments t god they better give you doom eternal like fuck badger should do a compilation of geuce and everything he says in his deep southern accent this is like my 5th time watching this because the intro is so damn funny how do we actually get moar badjur 2 videos a week hey try this game warhammer 40000 eternal crusade 412 is the sound u never thought u would hear from badger i swear to god if the next video isnt siege im going to do absolutely nothing about it hey badger you no that game crossout that you made a video on you should really make one more video on badger i dont know if you will read this but ill try anyway theres a channel called jeager himselfjeager himself too which has fallen on some pretty hard times and to show that we all stand together i was wondering if you and your fellow youtube buddies could make a video supporting jeager for anyone in the community jeager himself was a youtube who put others above himself and made videos such as why the r6 community loves badger and other content creators so as a fuck you to google and youtube i ask that we all support him and donate what we can to support him until hes back on his feet savejeagerhimself i also ask that we start the above to help as well many thanks just another siege player badger upload plz its been so long also if i sound mad im realy not 111 is that the team fortress 2 laptop i came for rage 2 gameplay but instead i found a legend suck shit nerds guess whos big now this guy lol keep up the good work buddy 943 no i did not need to know the time did you ever do a rainbow six video on valkyrie hey you should make a video on world war z im imagining doom guy coming to this game the demons following and doom guy laughing with new ways to slaughter house since he mentioned doom he just got a subscriber this game was in no way sponsored the publisher just went out of their way to give me early exclusive access to the game under the direct supervision of their staff so that i would have a positive initial impression i meandudecome on if anything them not paying you just means you took part in a shitty sponsorship this is still 100 sponsored im just sayin badger have yoy seen jager himselfs latest video you need to brimg attention to youtubes bs a bigass youtuber like u can spread awareness and get dat mans some help we need to save jager himself too i want more of rage 2 from you so badly tbh vegeta is sad that he didnt get to play doom eternal so he becomes the president and kills off the lower class guys jger himself too got screwed by youtube go check out his latest video he could really use some help u used rocket league music ahhhhh 422 if thanos was american you should play metro in all honesty i dont care for story very much and i played all of mad max and it was just a slaughter and i loved every bit of it and this game has the exact thing i need in my life to deal with my problems slaughtering people very helpful video you sealed the deal for me and i am definitely getting rage 2 now i was leaning towards it before but now its basically a done deal also gigan fuck yeah badger mini ladd skippd one of ur memes on his meme stream you must retaliate hey badger could you check out the game huntshowdown i think its right up your alley like me if you wanna see badgers new setup i personally am very curious about his setup i continuously go back to his old setup video i have been building my own pc and have gathered a lot of knowledge from all these videos of pcs i have made too many mistakes while making my own lol i put a gpu that was too big for my case in and now i need another case i think im just gonna buy a pc from ironside because their site is very simple and easy to use the pc i am building right now is 900 dollars but has 16gbs ram and 8 gbs gpu it is technically 4gbs but i had a 4gb one already so im just gonna slap that in there too yall should play mordhau badger you should try going back to star wars battlefront ii its really fun now no micro transactions 029 when you thought you was about to play doom eternal ok this is amazing can you make a review on star wars republic comando brother get the flamer the heavy flamer whats his discord that revolver reminded me of yokoshige kiras stand killer queen and thier ability bites the dust thanks for making this video saved me money just another boring generic fps badger put the laughter in manslaughter in this video bethesdaubisoftea all in onejeez you can smell the trash consumer service and massive bugs and crashes you low key sounded like handsome jack from borderlands 2 to me for some reason was the great balls of fire a reference to jerry lee lewis guess what shitfucksim going to do the dumbest shit imaginable you made gigan even more awesome by covering him in firedang something something crack is whack mr badger jager himself needs help check his vid and if you could give him a shoutout that would be pretty ebic btw idc if i get hate for this im helping out a guy that would really need help with income glad to se youve grown out of battlefeidl 3 unlike lvlcap do you still remember mi hee hwang badger you shouldve gotten the turbo doom overworld edition hey badger you think you could play the dishwasher vampire smile its a old game but it is absolutely awesome and only 10 on steam i absolutely think you would love it wen badger smells heresy this game as a hole they need to make a quake 5 too right hand this is doom but on the planet of the living is this going to be on epic hope not he badger can you try to help out jager himself youtube made him delete almost all of his videos and now has no source of income far cry jet simulator 430 that would be the outcome if colonel mustang had a custom pistol made dude only 3 videos of the last two months are on rainbow six i need to see the next operator you cover boi will you make a video about just cause if i give you a cubic foot of lasagna dawn of war space marines in maximum fury modeexe the revolver reminded me of the he magnum from resistance 3 idk if the magnum had the same triggered explosive bullets in the first 2 games cuz i never played the but yeah resistance 3 magnum confirmed in rage 2 im hooked okay badger i only got i thing for ya moar 40k now dont get this wrong this isnt a want this isnt a need it is a fundamental of my life now i watch both your space marine video and your death watch video and at the end of each of them once the laughing had subsided i was lefting thinking only one thing moar also btw not saying i dont like your other content or anything your siege stuff as me in fits every time you upload more so in general i just want moar badger you fool my firestorm revolver has no weaknesses seriously even rage 2 is a jojo reference what would your hero name even be badgerboi or manbadger i think russian drunk skunk would be the choice though 1010 right chief nice use of upgraded gigan youre so over the top i fuckin love it i need this shit in my life now remember back in 2015 xd when you couldnt imagine that rainbow six siege will be a great game doom i will kill all in my path mrpresidenthold my beer wait gigan what are you doing here xd this video is hilarious proably my favorite video to quote the emperor doesnt mean its stupid its dangerous its stupidly dangerous and its dangerously stupid works for me i just reached the part where the shotgun has gills i am now suitably erect for this game edit i have now watched the entire video i think its permanent badger youre always referencing tf2 why dont you make a video about it its still alive and well the fucking sfm visuals are top tier the 1st one was pretty fun but his one looks so fucking good you should do a vid on elas shoty you should try natural selection 2 kinda nice of them to let ya play it early the next game ill be getting lol how does badger get his images by any chance does he photoshop them can you punch everything so are there only a few guns wow one of the funniest preview game i have ever watched if before i was hyped for the game now im 200 hype for this game only 12 days away does he not know the bfg is in this game the first rage it wasnt great but it was good i had good storytelling elements and good gameplay mechanics they just turn rage 2 and to destiny on steroid flame alchemist type shit lmaoo so vengeance launcher was kind of like this at first huh i didnt expect that hey when are you doing just cause 4 wow this does not sound like the first rage at all now i see why companies want to sponsor youeven though this isnt sponsoredu make any game so funny and fun to play outro music name snavs us russian badger im just a 13 year old with hearing loss and might be totally retarded thats not the point though if you ever see this just know that youve gotten me through and other through some ruff times and even helped me get better at rainbow so just know that me and everybody who subscribes and likes your video knows your gonna make it in the world i kind of want badger to go over ace combat 7 at some point but i have no idea if hed even do it do i hear far cry still my game tho grav dart reminds me of the magnet gun from red faction armageddon if the game has no newgameplus how do you think the endgame looks how high was i when i subscribed to this retard that intro soundsfamiliar dude you look like justin from parks and recreation i loved this video so much im watching it twice and liking it again with my other account should do a vid on dreadnaught its like world of warships but the space dock makes sense lol play doom 2016 shitfuck why did you show your face at 1055 it was going so well before that new r6 update check it out badger rther wheres the heresy the third game is called salt because

for mozzie and big ronda pls 417 mr president i dont feel so good loo lets hope you werent paud to lie about the game looks pretty cool tho man they really took the revolver from resistance 2 xmens juggernaut the game this game is like if doom guy found power armor and took steroids and psyco jet with a very bad but good drug trip soooooo basically satin and god at the same time the amount of dumb shit this video has is dummy af lacking good content i miss the old badjur the one where it wasnt just game play commentary where he made actual videos and had musical intros badger can you play warframe u shud do world war z kinda like if bullet storm and doom strolled into the bar how do you add text to your videos hey badger i heard in like almost every video that you want to improve your

so i can gather from this video is basically rage 2 is going to be just cause 4 and doom mixed into one ill buy it cant wait to play this so the firestorm is the revolver from resistance where is clarence badger u should do more old school and face cams and clarence so youre a god and the game presents no real challenge great my ears badger is it only bullying if you cry ze actual president we will build a wall mr president how cute 408 oh there it is ehehe phbbb i havent payed my taxes for 11 years is there hard mode 016 did anyone else feel like badger was about to start rapping so this is basically borderlands badger would love to see you and the guys play some vermintide 2 this was my favorite badger video in a long time i love these 1 off videos for a game you havent played yet i dont even care if they are sponsored or if you have to let demons into your house plz give me moar i played the first game i want to play this game hey badger you should try a game called warframe why you may ask 2 words space ninjas you can thank me later that pistol is the exact concept of the magnum from resistance you warmed my heart with the gigan cameo so the character can become gigan awesome im sold ah hell yeah badger idiocracy is a fantastic movie its basically doom just cause and far cry had baby and was born in black tar heroine cant help but wonder what a video on monster hunter world from you would be like i think id be pretty fun ok can you make another far cry new dawn vid pls badger you should show us who d master flex is if hes fine with it mr torgue now punch him so hand that he explodes sick guitar riff im buying this game solely for the roy mustang revolver before seeing this i wasnt too sure id play rage 2 afternow im definitely playing thus when it comes

break any rules i cant even join with an alt because the invite link wont work what gives bethesda sucks as a developer but is one of the best publishers in gaming this channel has become a add frenzy and its crazy but you do you still love your videos but i hate all the advertising and shit that was great systematic sheet here you think your playing doom enternal nope but you get rage 2 the best thing about this is that i can imagine badger acting like that when bethesda called and when the guy was there can you please play the surge i think it would make for a good video i honestly want badger to narrate over the character in rage2 i just found your channel today and i already love you i wish you the best 405 early thanos stage fukin hilarious got it so the game is nothing like rage 1 we need russian badger to voice a video game character what therussianbadger you didnt use bfg in that playthrough that is a crime this game gets me in the mood to light fire on fire a friend of mine said he was in the army anyone know if thats true lol lol came back to this video again too funy so i take it this is the salamander video we were waiting for the hipfire shotgun sound is the same sound as the tank in starcraft 1 thats itim getting me wallet dear badger your videos are cancer and i love them this seems like the most testosterone fueled angry boi game since doom but i want it the grav dart launcher is like one of the guns in red faction gorilla who done the outro song please you sir got a subscriber awesome video if there was ever a video to make me buy a game this would be it second time watching and i just noticed that badgers model is floating after he imagines all the dumb stuff hes gonna do less what happened to your family random npc and more what happened to your friends arms and what do you look like without legs when is he doing the nomad video so is rage 2 part of the main story or is it a new character story line am i the only one who tought about in bulletstorm the mr president reminds me of saints row i can play doom without pentagrams every second this looks extremely different from the first one more high tech brawndos got what plants crave it has electrolytes damn this is almost nothing like the old rage it should be fine though it still looks like a really fun game the only negative is no molitovs to yeet every and turn the ground into micdonalds oven badger i dont know if you ever will but i have a request could you please play for honor i would really like to see how you would do everything avalanche studios creator of just cause series mad max rage 2 micheal bay but for games aww man you get it early hears about revolver kiras theme plays 408 like from resistance2 the revolver with exploding ammo 104 j dawg is from hollywood undead the fact that bethesda was willing to let you do this without any contract and give you free reign leads me to hope that theyre making up for 76 with increased transparency at least they have the sky until we get to them idk if it was badger or not that did a sponsor for a 3d fighting game with cac play world war z mang man i would love the profile the fbi has on badger because at the time of writing this it isnt in the description ending music is us by snavs badger play mk11 please explode with the snap of a finger killer queen confirmed greetings mr president lets make rage great again i want dmclike game with your oneliners or doomlike just i really want a game with your oneliners love your video your sense of humor and the overall tone is definitely worth a follow from me cant wait to see more videos of yours i get you but it has bethesda dirt on it its a mix of bullet storm and doom ughhhhhhh badjur why tf you look like mr brown from reservoir dogs so know one is going to mention that the pistol is basically killer queen from jojo bite the dust nice great video i even downloaded a free game app and decided to give rage 2 a try even tho i know nothing on the 1st one lol honestly this game is a downgrade from the first game the first game wasnt know but it sure as hell was fun and creative the story was amazing calling someone an oxygen thief has to one of the worse insults this seems a lot different from rage 1 i cant wait for this game this game looks so bad ass also i cant wait for borderlands 3 and the last of us 2 in the fall and hope to see more on them at e3 i cant wait to turn people into human magnets reminds me of the gift of eden from farcry firestorm revolver basically turns you into colonel mustang man they made you there bitch ayyy theres still mutant bash tv i just love burning the world and boiling the oceans sup with the screentearing my wallet i dont feel so good vanishes the fire storm revolver is just a cooler version of the halo sticky detonater reee anyone else buying this when it comes out that alcoholism shade throw so i play a lot of krieg from bl2 and you saying you set yourself on fire and pop drugs to get angrier really tickles my fancy badger tries to high five to freind breaks multiple bones man am i bad at high fives the into hit me harder then a fucking grown ass man flying through the sky and landing on top of me with a fist through my face play war thunder i expect bulletstorm meets fallout if they deliver ill just love this game badger needs to play bulletstorm that game is funny as hell fockin ad i want this game now watched this video for some rage gameplay was pleasantly surprised by how obnoxious and pretentiously quippy the commentator was being i was only able to watch the video muted just so i wasnt interrupted by some lousy unfunny person who wouldnt stop over exaggerating everything on screen when all i wanted was the gameplay just dont overdo your reactions because it sounds so forced and disingenuous its like you dont give a rats ass about whats happening on screen is it sad that i think this is the best thing to ever be put on a screen or is it just the truth okay please make the burning dragon made of chainsaws a recurring character that thing was too awesome to never return youre the reason i got far cry 5 and now youve made me wanna get rage 2 when i literally didnt care about it before burn the world and boil the oceans best line ever created most dangerous weapon in the game your fucking arm this game looks dope even though i hate games like this i love when devs use the people can fly handbook all weapons have altfire modes rage was fucking great but this shit looks so fucking out there its not even a part 2 now we need a doom 2016 video bajur imagine having a dude study your gameplay for 90 mins and it was your first time playing and your getting judged got damn not only i want doom eternal and play the hell out of it pun attended but i want doomslayer in mk11 which i think they might confirmed that okay so doom but there not demon vehicle practiceand its not hell okay i want it now aint nothing like ground beef sold now where is doom well these are just doom weapons the ace ventura reference doom guy has a new brother it seems i could watch that intro forever xd the game is literally far cry during the unreal era i got ptsd from this shit so they didnt show the microtransaction store dissapointed sry this game looks cheap and poorly coded just like rage 1 i even bet this will have the same route like 1 month full price and after 2 months damn this game isnt good at all gimme 10 and you can have it after f76 bethesda really are having a laugh with the way they did this like hey badger were so scared our game will be leaked early pfft its hardly elder scrolls which i can only assume theyll fuck up as well id play this game but i think it would shit all over my epileptic self this is nothing like the fisrt rage when i first saw rage 2 trailer i thought it was farcry new dawns version of the mars dlc but that it was more fun to blow stuff in hey stole the idea for that revolver from resistance 3 play witcher 3 i would vote for this president immediately and makes sure he gets re elected multiple times i can just imagine the guys face that installed rage 2 watching badger yell weird thing at the game no multiplayer though this game is beutiful too bad i cant play it when it comes outmy computer is a legit potato at running games the shotgun is a nomad in a transformer who else wants a donald trump mask to wear in game looks absolutely boring only some of the weapons are kinda interesting 12 minutes well spend good stuff what model was the black and white solider i really hope he was sitting there yelling all this stuff in front of jdawg local man literally to angry to die why is no one talkin about doom eternal i think badger is like one of the few people to even mention it if you didnt call the game rage 2 id have never guessed it was related to the first one looks a lot better though and im glad to see an old guilty pleasure of mine get some love in a sequel even if the original was like a lesser borderlands so happy to see that mutant bash is back too wadu heck bethesda you should be working on elder scrolls 6 reminds me a lot of bulletstorm damn was that game cool i feel like you shouldnt play this if you have epilepsy i was actually surprised when a friend of mine told me that rage 2 would be coming out i was quite ecstatic about it due to the fact after 14 grueling hours of completing rage on ultranightmare mode i was hoping for a continuation of the game since it didnt have exactly the best ending though it was fun to play and had a good world building imo after seeing the rage 2 trailer my heart sank mainly cause of the bright colours and fancy jump abilities which made it seem it had been ripped from cod advanced warfare not including of course this along with some of the other abilities that are available it felt like the trailer had lost the apocalyptic survival that you were supposed to be in and focused more on making the combat more diverse sprinkling some other whacky stuff in there as well not like the first rage didnt have that it just doesnt seem like a good sequel to the first rage which makes me worried that one of my favourite games could be have a sequel which j the name suits the game i want this game now its not inhumane if i set myself on fire too 205 gigan damn its been a long timehe was my favorite still is i suppose the overdrive when bagur says it a white monster can thats made to power a fleet of m1a1 abrams and cobras 500 decibels of gunfire beer made for a battle harden militia and probably 120g of cocaine somewhere in the mix doom eternal and now rage 2 its a good year for testosterone play destiny 2 you wanna grenade nah fam launch a focken lightningh storm at em you wanna ar too bad fire a laser of concentrated sun energy at frikin dark mater aliens master chief hhhmmmmm duke nukem not bad doom guy hold my beer so this game about having an absurd amount of guns multiple guresome ways to destroy your enemies and being an unstoppable killing machine with testosterone set to the max sounds familiar i would love a game where badger is the main charachter i mean your catchphares are h e l l a d a n k is this flipping michael bay the video game this looks epig camer style mrpresident is probably doom guy come back to earth tbh imagine an overdrived bfg 2000 they better as that multiplayer you should play tarkov that ace ventura joke made my year thanks the revolver is like the revolver from resistance 3 953 reminded me of how dudes in honda civics drive by iiimmmmmmmmmm gay he made a jerry lee lewis joke rage 2 used advertising it was very effective russianbadger looks like the guys from the we are number one meme rage 2 is like rage except not shit i sware to everything your videos are the funniest things on youtube broke my mouse smashing the subscribe button and im completely okay with that the way he says krabs and cuts off the hyaaah has me rolling on the floor never fucking change badger xd badger is the doom eternal final boss there should be killerqueen joke somewhere so the revolver is basically thanos rage 2 is fuckin awesome all this games post process effects screen effects blur shake chromatic aberration and glitch effects really hurts my eyes bfbc2 video when we find a berrer battlefield game which will be a while foreshadowing owo badjur whats this uwu notices your video i mean this game seems cool and all but i think it needs mor daka when this game comes out doom was exactly what people expected of it seeing a more over the top hybrid like rage 2 gets me both excited and uneasy cause nowadays i am not suprised if we just saw everything rage 2 had to offer and stick it to repeat mode still the weapons were cool the video was ones again great so i subscribed for more goodness d should we just deep fry the ocean not boil you dont get any fryed fish if you boil them did you know fryed fish is good for greasing up the noses of tanks to help firethats why we like kfc in that bitch i cannot stress this enough yeet play warhammer 40k freeblade mobile and also warhammer 40k space wolf also mobile id doing their damnest to fix todds fuck up of bethesdas reputation oh companies just rolling up going hey badger play this piece of crap instead of other stuff well we hope this at least gets you some dece sponsorships down the line badge this feels like an updated bulletstorm with god mode yo anyone got the link to that doom song cuz badger doesnt it is litterally borderlands 2 1053 quoting isic are we do mk11 you shtter bruh how tf am i just finding your channel the firestorm revolver basically makes you thanos the spongebob reference is so beautiful maybe im just super drunk but your mic sounds hella weird why is final gigan mk ii on fire did you do the voice over in front of the guy sooooo youre telling me that the revolver thing is killer queen from jojo bizzare adventure diamond is unbreakable maybe an unpopular opinion but im pretty disappointed with this game i was keen for rage 2 as an actual rage sequel with a similar style to the first game not an overaccelerated doom remake shunted into the rage universe any game that makes me feel like im on a permanent time crunch to find the next enemy has lost my vote especially when its meant to be a sequel to a game with a totally different pacing soooo crysis for those who cant stealth think you can do a review on warhammer vermintide 2 your w40k game reviews are glorious and i was thinking maybe you can do a review on that game as well which i think would be epic so its doom but from skrillex instead of ozzy plot twist the game was actually just a futuristic version of skyrim without magic except for the new dragon borne remember kid dont do drug unless if your in apocalypse and have a badass name like this guy this is great and all but just pray this isnt a epic exclusive this better come to xbox one dude i think badger real name is kyle when he says sticking yourself with adrenaline all i imagine is ellis using an adrenline and going oooooooooooooo and running fast as fuck iron man was a crippling alcoholic in the comics and hes still a hero so your old roommate is good you really should have raged out and crushed the laptop for immersion lmao more gameplay plz hey therussianbadger whats your opinion on the egs exclusivity deals found the end song if anybody wanted to know snavs us is that a killer queen reference its not ragey enough get the armored core grind blade tear your arm out get real mad run with a huge ass chain saw claw turn them into ground beef profit badger has some of the best commentary known to all of youtube i counted 289 unfunny jokes thats fine its youre video you fucking did it you committed mass genocide im so proud now wheres the days gone gameplay aw no it doesnt look at all like the original game my only point of reference for rage aw i basically russian becomes thanos in this video so its doom just without the monsters what was the effect of overdrive on the gravity gun i feel like they just made rage 2 to hold us over until doom eternals indefinite release when doom and farcry have a love child berjur sponsored everybody d berjur not sponsored everybody d iron man and black widow die in endgame and everyone comes back to life and yeah i watched the movie buddies you heard in this video yellow green turquoise dude im so buying this sees the firestorm behold the power of my invinciblekiller queen documents youtube therussianbadger bad videos this folder is empty play a borderlands game what a nice alpha version of doom eternal 408 killer queen has already touched those bullets why the fuck would you make a shotgun have an ability to move your targets outside its kill zone stupid yep forget about nomad wait wait wait so rage 2 is actually good right so theres hope red faction called they want their magnet gun back thanos made dust this a snap of his fingers i know you probably have got this before badger but you look almost exactly like the default bloodborne character model 207 dude nice use of gigan from godzilla wait was my dude jdawg just listening to you in your extremely hyper recording state i just imagine him laughing the entire time that firestorm revolver is like the vengeance launcher from space marine would consider a superhero if it wasnt for the crippling alcoholism my dude have you perhaps heard of tony stark he is better known as iron man and he suffers from crippling alcoholism literally better than far cry new dawn the movement looks a lot like doom which is a very good thing i want it lol am i the only one that thinks that this game is like bulletstorm i love rage so hopefully this will be as good or better this guy looks like quentin tarantinos son me wants actual rage sequel that has the same feeling but is better than the first lets be real the story was crappy and short bethesda lets have them make a doom copy nooooot interested yo badger where is all of the new battlefield 5 vids cause u played the hell out of battlefield 1 i honestly wasnt really thinking about getting it but seeing you review its like the creators were like well sequels usually end very badly so why not give it a name add the 2 not go to in depth with it try not to out do the first nor make it the same so no one gets bored intensify what made it great and put a little doom effect over it give it steroids slap its ass and send it in sarge i had some doubts because i played the first and loved the shit out of it so you can see how i could of been 2 one finally eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkkkkk see the trailer n end up feeling like umm hmmmm why would you change what was great if it aint broke dont fix it aaaaaaaaaaaargh and thinking well they cant just cut and paste n it has been a long time so giving me the same meal with whole new different seasoning and toppings i got to say aint half bad so bring it here boooooooooooooy play scp secret lab with the lads itll be fun firestorm revolver poor man thanos infinity gauntlet rage 2 from what i see on your play i say its like doom and because of that magnedart launcher just causealso i am starting to like that launcher sir this isnt military abuse its governmentinsured terrorism badger has the best voice lines do a video with the gf the new superhero crippling alcoholism holy shit i forgot that form of gigan existed for those who dont know that monster with the chainsaw hands is a monster from godzilla final wars not the best movie but its fun lol outro music good as always wish you had a spotify playlist i preordered the deluxe edition and it comes with the mother fuckin bfg outro is us by snavs for anyone wonderin holy shit thanos got a gun i bet they dropped badger at max level because the grind is painfully padded and the micro transactions are gonna be spilling out of store selling some stuff like rage coins rage boxes and player choice sorry cant trust bethesda anymore game looks amazing so far though i do hope there are no issues upon release this is doom but without the gloykills and you also have maxem overdrive and you also put yourself on firewow that alot of yeet fire storm revolver sounds like full metal alchemists to me not all youtubers are shitloards whats the ending music this doesnt look too bad tbh how did you do all this in 90 min sooo the firestorm revolver is thanos gun got a borderlands ad and im in love now bajur early access game given to him also bajur fuck you neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerds press f to pay respects for gigan they recycled doom weapons and mechanics with reskinsi am ok with this this is not a sponsored video proceeds to make a sponsored video angry joe the videogame ive been watching you for like half a year and i gotta say ur videos are dummy fun u should do like sum kind of show but seriously keep up the good work this really reminds me of sunset overdrive like holy crap cant wait to pirate this game fuckbethesda bethesda we want you to play one of our games early rage 2 burgor cries in doom slayer suit somewhere dio seeing name of the video za warudo i w a n t wait a minute loot what what kind of loot are we talking about lamo love the ratg reference looks like my fellow space marines needs to upgrade to purge more heritages 128 treated the tutorial like a frame perfect speed run i fucking love this channel can we get more tom clancys the division two please i still want to see the story for rage 2 as i really did like the progression and story of rage when i played it so long ago for the emperor looks at rage one looks at rage two realises it is completely different then what the first was and is more similar to something like bulleststorm or doom they didnt pay you for video i aint buying it more so now this game needs a bulletstorm skillshot system i want cooooooooooop anyone else think the firestorm revolver snapping is referencing the original bioshock so since the protagonist is named mr president could we get a keith david voice over the revolver is mustang from fma i might get it now thanks badger and bethesda i kinda waa know what bajur thinks of days gone though that detonatable bullets gun is a resistance thing 253 that is the definition of america every american god it feels good to have freedom america fuck yaeh time to save the motherfucking day yaey he seems pretty cool and you should in enclud him in one of your videos hi jdawg and the bethesda marking team so why not channel my inner dick cheney had me wheezing you should do a vlog like this for a vlog so he will see it the pistols literally made for the roy mustang wannabes you have succeeded in making me excited about this game i am hyped its his left hand fucking gigan budgair finna see globkilla lord of the thundercats this strays way to far from the first game not sure if i like it you are a living breathing whirlwind of violence designed to eviscerate anyone and everything in your way with extreme prejudice i thought you werent playing doom what about the story i need to play rage again now thanks badger i dont understand how this is a sequel to rage ive rewatched this about three times resistance did the revolver that shot detonatable explosives first edit never mind resistance did pretty much all these weapons first the firestorm was a free jojos reference killer queen but bajur prooobably isnt a weeb can someone tell me what software to make that characters stop motion for his intro doom guy bfg overdrive what could go wrong trying too hard fucking shill im at astros what does heavenly want rage 2god i hope its good i loved rage on my ps3 good memories 3 i watched endgame but i aint gonna spoil why does badger sound like a stereotypical blood games announcer now is the defibrillator back im suprised you dodnt pull a space marine joke i get seizures can i play this game so basically this is what happens after doomguy kills all the demons and finally retires from being hells baba yaga the answer being earths baba yaga bethesda turned yeetus deletus into a gun i miss the old rage at 251 gigan be lookin woke also the revolver is like the one from resistance 2 time to file a law suit 90 minutes to play 12 minutes of video1010 thank you bajur i want to buy gaem now id love to see him fight doom guy ive never heard of rage or rage 2 but oh my fuck does that look good hey badger do you still have that promotion going on with harrys looks like typical shooter trash yeh looks pretty good no random loot looks pretty great graphics that make an average man foam from the mouth because he contracts a susceptibility to seizures this game i kinda wanna play it a lot now its a shame the turned the game into a borderlands knock off by completely invalidating its tone and presentation to appeal to the sincerely cringy bl community will it become multiplayer tho i love how you can actually make people into soup with a single punch first rage was amazing in my opinion and i can tell the second one is going to be just as good that is a sponsored vid done right so excited for the game but do i have to play the first one to know whats going on in this one i found it both entertaining and helpful also had to pause the video after ya and i cannot stress this enough yeet i was laughing so hard i forgot this game existed im defintely gonna buy this unban me from your discord that damn cliff the weapons remind me of turok evolution i need this ok this actually looks fun so this is basically what if doom guy had a little brother and he was dropped in mad max im in why do they have failsafe from d2 in there so this isnt doom rage 2 now doometernal when 150 so your average angry marine badger is now such a top tier youtube cheeser that game companies need to send body guards for the games just so badger doesnt destroy the game in a run up of fuckery blackhole grenades a magnet gun a force cannon did bethesda just take the arsenal from red faction armageddon what i like to imagine is that jdawg was just sitting behind you the whole time judging you that was a really good video are we sure this isnt just kreig the psycho from bl2 dude this game is gonna be maximum manslaughter literally i already preordered it xd so its basically doom but in digital overworld im watching this at the orthodontist and im pretty sure they are concerned bc of badgers bang noises ive been burnt out on game lately but this one seems like the fast pace gory mindless fun i need wonder if borderlands 3 took inspiration from rage 2 or rage 2 took inspiration from borderlands one of my top lists in coming games right next to the outer worlds rages redemption status accepted man this looks absolutely nothing like rage 1 lol thbthe whole video looks so awesome and the editing is so fucking good that i dont even care what the narrator is speaking i mean the speaker is great sounds entertaining but no i just wanna watch the thing using blackhole as grenade smithing 100 destruction 100 enchanting 100 brother get the heavy flamer that revolver is like something from resistance 3 and i thought i was hyped before n o w i a m jeez mah dude dont forget to breathe you need it to live this is randomly in my suggestions i didnt have any inclination to get rage 2 because of rage 1 but holy shit am i hyped for it now i am gonna buy this game as soon as it is published that decision is not changable now anymore the only thing i hear here is that its stupid fun god damnit badger you didnt do the killer queen effect when you didnt the detonation of the revolver excuse me sir thats dimma dollars as in doug dimmadome owner of the dimsdale dimmadome i didnt think it was possible that any human on this planet could have the personality of andy sambergs character from parks and rec but i was wrong and hes just as annoying it was both entertaining and helpful cause now im gonna buy a copy of this game on every platform insteas of just 1 wow didnt know doom guy have a kid already so the game is doom with drugs why does that seem like a mixture of crysis sanctum and planetside ummm question wheres the gridlock video the firestorm revolver is just a weapon of colonel roy mustang ill wait till its on sail dont look like its worth 60 doll hairs how bout shoot the magnet on other enemy sooo why have they been working on this and not doom this gave me a pain full erection i need this i want this game so bad but im poor bulletstorm meets doom basically so thats were spiderman went after infinity war so youre telling me crushing a monster and lighting yourself on fire isnt something everyone does that visual effect in overdrive is gross reminds me of kane and lynch 2 yeah someone played that game its not a good comparison rage 2 where you can be thanos if only they added a knock off avengers and will be good after hearing pizza time my hopes are getting higher of all the images you could pull you went for gigan im seriously impressed good sir jay dawg dying of laughter i would have liked if it was doom but its nice doom far cry blood dragon gurren lagann fist of the north star mad max rage 2 my pp is on fire and covered in chainsaws the disappointment when its rage 2 and not doom cant wait to see what kind of doom eternal video will happen when you get it hey badger ol pal quick quesh have yall heard of generation zero or warframe both are really dope games i think you should give a try love the content keep it up this goes to show that the world is messed up and i fuckin love it this is how saints row 4 shouldve been why does this remind me of gta when michael went into his son watching him play video games very nice video badgerhad me laughing the whole way through 055 what are you talking about thats the main part of a superhero just ask comic book iron man bethesda makes good game those fuckers are up to something 507 is that failsafe ive had this game pre ordered since september thank you badger for no spoilers please do a collaboration with sovietwomble heavy breathing thanos gun disturbing panting sees finger snap busts a fat one bajur is basically spiderman if he was a real person and a youtube content creator badgur you need to write some lines for a action movie preferably set in the warhammer 40k universe cause you are bloody hilarious mate crikey funny enough rage 1 only had about 90minutes of total gameplay its got what plants crave i think we all know borderlands 3 and cyberpunk 2077 will bury this game lewhozaher mr president wants to know your location its been a long time since badger made a legitimately funny video this was very enjoyable i feel like his own vids and humor is pretty fun but his friends make pretty cheesy and lame jokes just an opinion tho rage 2 day holy sht of no nut november f that was funny as shit you are master hyper 2000 and extra hype included 416 thanos you should make a video about doom 2016 its got good story gameplay and plenty of murder what a game damn it i wasnt interested in the game before but now i am great video after fallout 76 it better be good cuz everyone will compare any rage 2 bug with the aforementioned cluster fuck of errors hey badger i was booted from your discord for reasons i do not know also tell heavenly cause he did say we would play seige and i cant exactly say when if i cant message him man i used to have an action figure of that gigan 415 so thanos but instead of ashes its body parts edit i just saw he made a thanos joke after my comment god arent i stupid what is the outro song this is so fken fun man i want to play it buck naked i saw the first thirty seconds of the revolver amd immediately thought killa qween bites za dusto always trust id software so you telling me smacks lips the grav dart launcher is the same as the grapple hook from just cause so much thanos snap this video bring back the music intros pls badger holup bethesda published this badger better not diss this game otherwise your boy todd howard will leak his info i feel like this video can be a perfect jojo reference why do i feel like the blood marine dialogues would fit very well huh i might actually pick this up now looks like actual fun and i laughed really hard at the visual of some guy showing up at your house like yo lets play some games this is bulletstorm 2 with the doom polish set in the rage universe badger pls play the division 2 again soits basically bulletstorm love your videos the random monologue you through out is absolutely hysterical keeps me rolling with laughter in every video keep up the awesome work man much love from missouri does anyone know the name of the outro song so its gone full 90s power fantasy great i just remembered that rage 2 was announced in e3 lol fallout 76 overshadowed it and we know what happened to fallout 76 this game is developed by the swedish developer avalanche id software are working on doom right now i just woke up and was not ready for this bs if that was 90min holy crap its going to be good that dart gun sounds like it could be my favorite weapon of any video game ever oh sweet failsafe is in this game am i the only one who thinks this guys voice is really annoying he sounds like an edgier 2019 youtube version of those super annoying 90s infomercial hucksters if your so tight you should get us ghost recon future soldier remasterd play the original rage please the revolver is like an infinity gauntlet that you can bring to school so futuristic rambo on copious amounts of cocaine consider me intruiged deathtothegoblins will rage 2 have multiplayer this looks like a good game to play when youve had an excessively bad day at work what was that outro sounded great did badger breathe at all during this video please when u get your hands on this stream it im getting huge bulletstorm vibes outta this game suck shit nerds the firestorm pistol is just 1 of roy mustangs gloves stuffed into a gun and the other is still on ur hand roy mustang is from fma just sayin local man literally to angry to die kills everything i dont care what anyone says the first one will be always be on top i want the thanos pistol if there isnt a mod within a week of launch to let you play as mr president with trump voice lines i will be sorely disappointed all i can say is watchvrfh1hcluqti i dont know rage 1 was probably my first actual video game and i played it with my father whenever i would visit him when i was young i loved it and played through it countless times but this just seems nothing like it granted i havent seem much gameplay or the story but it just doesnt seem like it should be called rage 2 i was super excited when i saw the trailer for this game i dont know anymore if only they could put the tether grapple hook thing from just cause in the game somehow two words quality content brother get the flamer the heavy flamer something something soup time underwhelmed warfram player i dont know how to feel about this game i loved rage but goddamn does this game look like a whole new ip has badger not heard of chainsaw man cause if not someone pls send him a pic so he can use it in a vid firestorm revovler i tot it was the he 44 magnum from resistance 2 lmao u cant do us like that with doom etranal it is almost like just cause 4 crysis and bulletstorm on steroids its like rage mixed with crysis i like im getting this shit 1053 burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from meee dont worry then in that case im only going to do the dumbest shit imaginable is this how casual people play games rip and tear why is the ai for this game just failsafe from destiny 2 i mean she is really good at that role but it kinda stands out when it is in 2 big shooters i meanrage 2 seems cool but my opinion rn is that they should have kept the theme they originally had with mutants and no power ups that revolver is like combining the emperor with killer queen and i want a gun that makes me snap people to nonexistence wait wha bagel should try generation zero i just imagine all the comments badger makes was making them in front of jdawg and hes just losing his shit while watching this bullshittery happen lemme go full dick chaney on these mfs did any else hear that faint whisper at 120 and of possible understood what it said edit i think it was samurai or something close i cant fucking wait to play rage 2 rage was one of my favorite games back on 360 also need doometernal baggur yo badger whats the outro song the part you said moar exploring moar exterminatin and moar arking that gun is from 2016 doom this is the best game that literally no one asked for wait is this video trying to tell me that doom eternal isnt the only game releasing this year i dont believe you this seems a bit to similar to bulletstorm even the weapons abilities are similar you are the best person to see play this game good golly gee this vid made me want this game gg bajur soits like doom and farcry had a baby yknow i wasnt initially interested in this game all too much especially after the first rage but then i saw this badger video and realized that this is the one thing i need in my life hawkeyes family dusted by the snap captain marvel saves tony and nebula in space avengers along with captain marvel killed thanos who used the stones to destroy stones 5 years later antman got out in the quantum realm for 5hrs antman tells steve and nat about it tony stark has a daughter they told tony about antman he refuses to help steve nat and scott seek for bruce banner bruce banner has the body of hulk with his conciousnes intact bruce help them build a time machine tony help the avengers in building a time machine rocket and bruce recruits thor who got fat and is emotionally unstable thor joins they plan to borrow the infinity stones to undo the snaps they split into 3 groups steve tony scott and banner in battle in new york in 2012 to retrieve the space mind and time stone nat warmachine nebula and hawkeye in the space to retrieve the power and soul stone gotg vol1 thor and rocket in asgard to retrieve the reality stone thor the dark world steve me before watching this huh rage 2 seems cool me after i want i want must have im gonna need a heavy for this heresy wait never mindgrabs gravdart launcher inhale perfect fills enemy with metal spike sends said enemy flying yeet welp i missed my chance to be pinned badgur real talk this was a great video with some of the best jokes ive heard in a while i loved this video and i love you what did you do with your bed hey man you try out smite i gotta say before i wasnt very interested in this game but now after watching this im starting to get on board with it so basically rage 2 is far cry meets doom meets mad max i imagine the guy who brought badgur the laptop was watching over him the whole time scared for his life at the shit coming out of his mouth is it me or does the game seem way over the top i mean i know thats the game but still why is badger getting more cringey still good content though was that gigan this is goin to be a good battle royal some day soooooo dubstep crysis badger you should do a video on doom if your excited for doom eternal liberty prime monster truck paint job looks ok but will be shit badger making gigan more deadly than he already is everyone elsewow a shoulder cannon thats original destinytractor cannon bitch if i cant mod the hell out of this game and put a fucking funny valentine skin on the mc imma have to pass cheif on the other hand if that is on the menu this will be easily the most worth 60 bucks ive ever spent on a game oh so thats where the revolver from resistance 3 went what if we combine monsterpsychojetoverdriveblissand edens gift into one super steroid seems like a good game but it shouldnt be 60 dollars 3040 so basically free advertisementat least get paid doing it gigan was the perfect way to demonstrate this all this with only 90 minutes welp thats another game to add to the wishlist still looks neat but ill wait for a good sale anyone else think of colonel mustang when he brought up the revolver 112 jdawg sloopyou can do anything badger goes over 9000 veiwers no vertical sync so shutter what song plays in the outro you put gigan in the videoi love you subbed4life why didnt you make jdawg go to the restroom or something and then send that file to google drive and leak it to all your friends family and dmaster flex smh oh wow booger is playing a different game oh god the idiocracy references lmao 331 is that screen tear btw if you heard somebody doing commentary it was a person that goes by yub hearing the word overdrive thrown around that much made me think of sunset overdrive should play that sometime its extremely ridiculous florida man the game the first one was super unpopular i mean i personally liked it but this ones nothing like the first one im super hypedddd i like how you put jdawg as a doom elite guard instead of a regular white home boi dumbest shite possible mrtorque approves final wars gigani see badger is a man of culture grunt used rock it had no affect mr president used vehicular manslaughter edit my comment is at 690 likes no more likes this doesnt feel like rage anymore its just a doom rip off 507 ark is just failsafe from destiny 2 cool game too bad i dont want to support bethesda anymore bye bye bethesda the rage cage badger what recording and editing software do you use im looking to make a channel for videos for my entertainment and to maybe become semipopular could happen but who knows anything can happen ps thx if u respond and love ur vids when he actually used to play the games enjoy them without being paid to do so it was alot more entertaining genuine to me personally that being said this game looks generic as fuck overly repetitive its like someone gave serious sam a reboot eh not interested cocaine addled doomfarcry game if only rage 1 was like this black widow dies as well as ironman black widow dies as well as ironman is it just me or is that revolver really similar to the one from resistance 3 looks like fun although to me it looks like a new map on apex legends im feeling a bit of doom guy along the lines of this man holy shot this looks so much better than the first wait is this not just crisis all over again is that monster form godzilla toho what is the song in the doom eternal bit i was the 73th viewer your bloodlust is contagious mr president its a far cry from the first one but it looks good doom meets bulletstorm meets blood dragon the real question is did you use the bfg 9000 i really want to get this game i definitely want to see more rage 2 when it comes out love ya bajur god i am so excited right now yall got any more of that vsync the shogun reminds me of minority report for some reasonidk soooo this is a commercial that you didnt get paid for way to get ripped off please turn on vsync i want more rage why did this make me think of destiny ahh my badger coming through thanks ye very cool badger you need to start linking the name of your songs you use in the description endgame tony stark dies and captain america becomes super old and crusty also ant man uses time travel to save everyone legit just watched the movie xd oh and thor is fat like seriously its soo weird well you kinda just threw jdawgs standing in the company under the bus was he really that bad oooo this is gonna be a good game to play hiiiigh my question does it have anything to do with the first game looks amazing but 2 implies sequel andlike my complaint about rage was it ended on a to be continued basically bad at high fives or the absolute best both points are arguable at this point in time 263 people have never experienced fun oooo i need that outro sonh calm down plankton also invest in the turbo man this game looks very fun its a free roam game with dope ass vehicles im hella getting this game i cant wait for doom eternal either so its doom reskinned and added cars i liked the first rage just wish it was larger i cried when gigan pulled up on the vid shit hit hard godzillas my childhood and seeing from the fact that he knew gigan had laser eyes makes me think he was a fan too i love you badger i alway hear goobysoft not ubisoft why its kinda like doom met mad max and far cry on a romantic lsd trip and this came out of that devils threesome secret service get down mr pres president bitch you get down im about to thanos snap 50 guys into paste doom guy is still more bad ass hey you dont know mebut i know youand you said the term meatbags please for the love of god do a video on kotor 1 ohhhh please loorrrdddd rage 2 is just bethesdas way of saying we need more time and money for doom eternal does anyone know the song on the end its not stated in the discription anybody know what the song is at the end no link in the description badger in one video you said you were going to play rdr2 you still doing that i appreciate the rage against the machine reference 1017 man doom ethernal looks great that intro tho xd bro sometimes its look like crysis in maximum overdrive just my opinion and i want to say great vid and you make such great content keep going m8 sounds fun so youre not a shit lord 6x times as much skulls for the skull throne me first 3 minutes of the vid fucking harder fucking better frusroda when are you gonna do a collab video with jdawg tho local man is literally to angry to die so almost a free roam doom have you even played the first rage game rage 2 the game where you meetfus ro dah people by hifives was todd howard ar your house also why is bethesda acting like the cia gonna play the first one again again im sorry but ive been waiting eight years for this and i want to know how he got it before me i know he has pc and i have ps4 but please tell me is the firestorm revolver a fmamustang reference or jojokiller queen i played rage and it was good i see rage 2 and im saying hallelujah they made a sequel purge i holy fire normies this changed my auto 780p to 360p its a shame you couldnt get the bfg in your run some men cant be reasoned with some men just want to watch the world burnin the most visceral and satisfying amount of artistry possible im soo excited for rage 2 i played the first one the guns look like the game bulletstorm imagine if badger got early access for doom eternal how do you do all of this in 90 minutes did your pc go overdrive because i cant tell what was happening during the fighting boi doom but theres cars so mr torgue from borderlands gets his own game its fuking mad max on steroids this is violently american or just violent in general the main character is if optimus prime became the dragonborn and learned how to do gandalf magic on steroids made by energizer did you reference the band rage against the machine is rage 2 giving anyone else crysis vibes or is it just me rage 1 was mediocre badger just do a video on dawn of war ultimate apocalypse already with how much 40k you do also the tau are space utilitarian fascists not communist get it right mrsmurf music of the video is us by snavs i love the e1m1 remix you used at the beginning so what was it like to have a guy there watching your entire process of getting content for your video the greater the creativity the moar power badger has so just doom slayer on crack then and has super powers now fuck yea doom rpg sandbox lets do this wait is that wow thanos would be proud i have a feeling you would really like rimmy you should check him out 254 final wars gigan is at maximum overdrive is this a game you will buy badger should have definitely crushed the laptop burger is the only breakfast heres doom but more colourful oh and with unrelenting force coming out of your hand i think this is my favorite video you made yet song for outro snavs us i would play the fuck out of this game i think the real hazard is therussianbadger himself just had surgery done and i have a shoutout because i can close to death im just after watching the new avengers and i come home to see more explosions at the flick of a finger i have the 1st rage for xbox 360 omfg whenever my cousin came over i annoyed him so much to play the story mode bruh its be dummy fun its 4 playeri think gigan set on fire being force fed gasoline and monster is probably my favorite visual for a protagonist ever do bethesda make any other game except doom and this their name sounds very familiar that looked awesome and actually made me consider buying it im really done with open world games especially after days gone but this one looks like mindless fun soooo i guess it will be awesome was that mech gigan please play doom i would love to see you purge i agree with you on mad max just needed more content wait wtf this isnt pokemon if you like the revolver try the 44 magnum from resistance 13 which is where they copied the idea from this game is gonna make me feel like a world eater with drugs well blood for the blood god i always yeet when watching badger is that really all the weapons doe play more cross out im sad because they removed the ak this reminds me a lot less of the original rage and more like a second bulletstorm i like it ayy bajuur i know the game is old as all hell but try out arma 3 with mods preferably with jello and friends there is even a warhammer mod so you can purge foul xenos and kill commies at the same time i have been waiting for this game for 6 years catholic church indulgences are like christian battlepasses too fast and too loud imho only badger can make rage 2 look somewhat playable hell the fuck yea a shit version of bulletstorm killer queenandthe emperordid the potara fusion bro that revolver turns you into colonel mustang the grav dart gun is like a needle from halo i feel like the guy that came over was watching him record and was thinking wow this is what youtube poop is now one thing neededmultiplayer with team kill i need to see badger and friends accidentally obliterate eachother xd sure hope this game comes with a big fat seizure warning on the box cuz my head was buzzing during the overdrive moments in this video it really be redacted hours in here huh this game looks sick annnnnnd theres the obligatory warhammer reference you need to get down when this president rolls up on yo block 507 failsafeis that you its a farcrydoomfallout mix 415 killer queen has already shot you click that revolver copies from resistance 3 in the game their is the he 44 magnum that is exactly the same this game is now ass to my eyes now i loved the original rage it was so fun i loved rage 1 and i hope rage 2 is just as amazing socrank 3 cool why use conventional weapons when you could commit war crimes sounds like borderlands with more mechanically heavy guns no looting and without that weird comic book look it also has something of a older game feel to it idk how describe it properly i just know it didnt give me a very good impression of things like the mechanics wont play very well together can we all just appreciate the grunt used rock mr president used vehicular manslaughter its all the rage killer queen has touched the dislike button 207 my god its a godzilla reference i said before screaming 10 octaves higher than humanly possible i want red dead 2 badger yep thanks for the seizure i wonder how many people know that chainsaw wielding dragon lookin ass is from godzilla final wars i hope badger knows that or im gonna be sad good good looking forward to this game lest we forget bethesdas tech test 2 or bethesda presents bulletstorm 2 wheres the video with 2016 doom you should make a video on world war z badger so i get90 minutesto do whatever jdawg yes badger proceeds to do the dumbest shit imagineable jdawg oh dear lord what have we done fake and gay more rainbow please just funny random moments s o u p t i m e badger we need to have a serious talk when is gearbox going to sponser you so you and your friends can play borderlands 3 watching it did remind me of farcry but the bfg is it multiplayer i wanna smash my friends literally doom but ur enemies are humans in conclusion rage 2 is doom with a side of borderlands it was helpful i think i might get it now badger your oneliners hurt physically hurt xd does this confirm badger is going to play doom eternal badger stealing that laptop like youll never catch me jdawgnot when i shift into maximum overdrive andromeda but good hey look its final wars gigan im here for the nice brutal high five that kills everyone with a few baps its better than fallout 76 so i think berthesda did a good job get bandai namco to do this do ace combat 7 this is good content subbed i didnt knew rage 2 was even a thing was that an oblivion joke i pre order this game now that dick cheney joke was amazing wait a damn minute was that failsafe i heard as the female ai voice did far cry and bulletstorm have a baby brawndo its got electrolytes its what plants crave so are you saying that with the fire revolver i can become colonel mustang the shotgun is a stupidly worse bfg i was crying at the maximum overdrive part yall remember that fantastic game bulletstorm im feeling those vibes this game is going to need a coop mode everything is better when you have a friend to blow shit up with what is that outro music my guy have you seen the hes on fire cheat code ad for this game this looks nothing like rage 1 rage 1 made you rage and you needed to go corner to corner taking out people one at a time sounds like i must need this game im so happy i found this channel 700 is that muhfuckin failsafe from d2 i want this in vr so badly this man has to much power so what im seeing here is far cry blood dragon x doom x crysis so whens the badjur cheat code the revolver is from resistance fall of man and i love it lol when you said to the moon i lost it it shouldve been the yoshikage kira explosion activation meh doesnt look like anything we havent already seen another comedic aaa open world game why is no one commenting on how a freaking gtx 1070 is recommended for this game thatd better be recommended for 1440p or 4k because thats quite high for games releasing this year running in the 90s except its every time badger has said bang 256 i think you just explained my gf if she had her work out and had plastic surgery all in one go why not do a vid on doom 2016 my guy id has mastered the single player experience the fact that the bethesda guy is represented by those dead guys with chips you pull out in doom 2016 cracks me up so how about those division 2 videos sounds like a good far cry game who else finna cope this and only play it i when u rage in rainbow 6 hell yeah now that was delicious content well always is legit i always end up finally inviting friends over to my appartment and then boom flex that hdmi cable and lets rock some badger videos theyll have to stitch you back togetherin hell let badger showcase doom the real angry boi of bethesda russian badger the human energy drink did that screen tearing give anyone eye ball aids okay badger is getting me into all kinds of games siege the division 2 now rage 2 my wallet is thinning they ahould let badget voice the character in a rage 2 cheat code it would be f awesome i dont understand whats going on but i i like it a dart that can attach to people and connect them to objects that sounds a lot like just cause 3 and the grappling hook hmmmmmmm thats pretty cool but the scary thing is bethesda will literally send people to your house now man this is looks fun afcant wait to play it if the halo 5 ground smash thing was like thing ooooh boy say that firestorm pistol looks veeeeeerryyy similar to resistance 3 explosive revolver i love rage 1 im both excited and anxious for rage 2 im afraid for microtransations to ruin it but excited because it looks fun damn im surprised its not sponsored why arent there any of your doom videos your a funny guy oh and stream more on twitch tv will ya peace i hope you have cushions for those deck chairs love the work gotta be honest this looks like it would be really fun for about two hours before it becomes repetitive beyond fucking belief probably why they only let you play it for 90 minutes people thinking of the explosive revolver as something from resistance or any other game and i am here thinking fucking bulletstorm whip em to a cactus yis just and only just yis this game looks sooooo fun one thing and this game would be complete multiplayer 210 gaaaiiiggaannnnn rrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssseeeeeee1 plz tell meh you got that reference lol also bagur will you please make a video or two on the godzilla ps4 game bad company on crack in avengers endgame the movie starts with iron man brought back to earth by captin marvel a 5 year time skip is initiated and then antman is brought back from the quantum zone by a rat accidently turning the machine antman tells the remaining avengers of his experience in the quantum zone and how he thought it was only 5 hours bruce banner now combined with the hulk and with iron man who has a daugther called morgan figure out a way to send the avengers back in time to secure the infinity stones for a new gauntlet to snap shit back the avengers go back in time to get shit right however nebula is caught by thanos in the past and is replaced with past nebula who infiltrates the avengers when they come back to their current time the avengers put the stones in a new gauntlet and hulk snaps the rest of the world back past nebula then summons past thanos into the present and fight begins between the old thanos army and the avengers included those who were snapped at the end iron ma now they need themes like some ninja sorta perks and stuff and heavy boy sorta stuffs like an off the wall kick and a wall smash im guessing the title is your warhammer talking but no crusade or brother resistance 2 had the same concept with the revolver in whisper badger resistance trilogy they are great anyone else here used to play the flash game rage 3 my dick grew by 3 inches due to the amount of testosterone its almost sickening but are there still combat races like the first game what are the models that he usrs from not the doom ones the soldier ones they always make me laugh am i the only one who realized that susan from the gravdart launcher part is failsafe from d2 this game is nothing compared to doom song at the end dont rage against the machine just kill in the name if you pre order the collectors edition you can get the muther fucking bfg from doom the gore in this game looks incredibly underwhelming what a shame with meaty weapons like that doom level violence would have made this a masterpiece for sure firestorm revolver aka thanos with fire the gigan visual was omg a non sponsored non r6s video is it christmas already should of had tyler1 review it rage 1 was too emotional for me idk why nobody talks about rage 1 cause that shit was a great fucking past time so rage 2 is basically what would happen if doom guy decided fuck humans what i think when i see so much blood blood for the blood god when does doom come out anyway holy fuck this was hilarious i would love a game that looks like this game with the combat of this game but the lootxp system and coop of borderlands this does still look pretty fun though kharn the game rage also known as a jager main after they get counter spawn peeked in the beginning of a match mad max was underrated whats the outro music im sorry but werent you supposed to make a rdr2 video i hope it will be a blast please dont make this a half life thing can i just say resistance did it first for the revolver that has detonating rounds i think in the last resistance game the last upgrade catchs enemys on fire well theres my bit the grunt used rock mr president used v e h i c u l a r m a n s l a u t e r when is doom eternal coming out doh i hope you get to play doom eternal early so you can have fun so bulletstorm meets doom sounds sick ah yes the legend himself redacted so like am i crazy or just didnt play enough of the first one but it looks nothing like the first one they stole that revolver from resistance just saying i did not play the first rage but bulletstorm seems similar and i love id software bethesda on the other hand meh they are almost at ea levels of not worth my money who disliked this i will find you badger only makes vids when companies pay him change my mind tbh all you had to say was that this game was made by the same people that made mad max because that is my favourite game of all time this is heresy looks like bulletstorm with less camp but more guns wait the world worst high five you ever heard of a warlock man i miss not sellout badger looks cool not gonna get it tho i got a save the oceans ad just before badger said boil the oceans sooo its colorful doom if it aint broke i guess something tells me badger is going to make a video about doometernal mr president use vehicular manslaughter as i listen to this in drivers ed which tells you that is bad but badger says it good 416 is that a jojo reference anyone else tired of the there it is its almost always in his videos i had no idea rage 2 was coming and you just already sold one to me comes out 4 days after my day im set so bethesda took an originally subpar meh title and made into meth just the way i like my sequels everybody going to russians badger house for that wholesome pizza party yall remember in rage 1 where fugin armored unit would slap your shit into another planet it looks like doom which i dont like a living chainsaw with chainsaw limbs bethesda publishes promising games bethesda makes a shit game god i hope i this was a late april fools and he was playing doom eternal at 1023 did anyone get some serious apex legends looks there whats the music at the end if you dont make a doom vid ima burn clarence to ashes 408 badger low health also badger you shouldve aimed for the head i wonder if you can use the gravdart launcher to send enemies into to other enemies nice use of gigan try blood bowl 2 the random gigan made me very happy you can blow limbs off im sold that screen tearing made me fuckin cringe in actual physical pain jesus this was a fun video is this just a doom 2016 reskin pink is an evil colour now damn you now i have to buy another game upload more division 2 hmm rage against the machine is doo doo i cant wait for doom eternal this game looks dope af it looks like that game bulletstorm on crack me sees what the firestorm revolver can do also me a jojobro bites za dusto click boom avalance made mad max no love for just cause dont you love explosions 3 mins in i yawned and cringed oncetime to unsub this isa fucking technical test for eternal and a dlc for doom 2016 in one game jesus christ if this isnt doom so the revolver turns you into roy mustang you tell them you sold it to me badger presentation was the best sold badger you should probably play warframe its a free syfi game which is fun af and last time i checked it was in the top3 in steam this would be amazing if it had the stardust crusaders theme just sayin did i hear fleshy mammalbadger be giving me a shoutout if u dont post i will eat clarence wheres big dicc marty nice screentearing dummy channel my inner dick cheney who eles got resistance 2 and 3 vibes from seeing the firestorm revolver ability mc odd on coke and is just lying in a coma im the hospital to say such good things about doom brings a tear to my eye feel like i dont wanna buy the game anymore hahaha looks like ive seen it all cant wait to turn my enemies into soup bajur you have been bought by ea i think your being used you took 90 minutes of recording and made the best of it kudos to you im sure as hell not that good this sounds like doom with extra steps i wasnt that interested in rage 2 when i first herd about it but now that i see gameplay i want it loved the original let see what this one brings gridlock and mozzie operator vids r6s its safe too say imma get this game chief please play mortal kombat 11 next you wont be disappointed jdawg in his mind this dude is a complete idiot why did we give a prerelease trial test therussianbadger yeet first monster in videos than in a living chainsaws mouth chill so basically farcry mixed with bulletstorm firestorm revolver is literally killer queen the world was burned and filled with monsters but now the world filled with monsters got another monster and that monster is armed with more monsters to kill said monsters i am sorry to say but the average person may cry and scream to getting raided by bandits but the bandits will cry and scream due to a dude in heavy armor slaughtering the shit out of them not for fame money or women much like doom guy much like goblin slayer im just imagining the jdawg just being terrified of badgers commentary me is it mozzie or gridlock video russianbadger this video me noooooooooooo and no im not trying to rush mr badger hey spencer did you ask what they were planning to do with fallout 76 if you liked playing this i think you could make a good video out of bulletstorm for the president burn them in holy fiiiiirrrrreeeeeee i am become wingstick god in rage via choosing the fabricator class now i can can become even more of a one man army and maybe one with many many many many many many sentry bots in my inventory for a robotic army to tear into my enemies with bullets 923 did he really just say enclave and oblivian in the same sentence i can just imagine jdawg watching you play and starts to loose faith in humanity more and more 418 holy shit your kira from jojo part 4 not gonna lie actually want to play this now fire and death is left behind when badger get a game called rage i guess you could say u where killing in the name of youve sold me on this game had no plans to buy it till you showed how cool it is honestly this made me want to get rage 2 so amazing job 1010 should we give them grenades naw lets give them a blackhole your speaking my language do we call the character kyle gigan confirmed to the source of pure primordial d a n g e r 418 boi that dood just thanos snapped people into flames whenever badger uploads it makes me happy remote explosive bullets in a revolver resistance 3 vibes anyone it might just be me but i see a lot of screen tears probably because its still not out yet what did that guy think when he went in and saw all your pictures of fancy frogs i dont like it nothing like the first one that revolver is literally a thanos snap killer queenhas already touched the bullets this scene killed me 020 you are an poet with your phrasing how did this man die well he was set on fire and then had gas dumped on him and then he had a monster can with a lot firecracker shoved down his throat yeah this is not what i signed up for im sorry i just involuntarily supervillainlaughed you didnt hear that did you this video came out on anzac day but alcoholism is just a superhero feature these days bruh rage 2 is the walmart value doom you really had a super hype for doom eternal wow soo i can see the future video name how to rip and tear doometernal gameplay this is nothing like the first one dead ass im just imaging u shouting cooler gravity while j dawg just is like wat this is like if crysis and doom had a baby 308 just a random guy flying by just some casual thursday stuff nothing unusual nothing too see here please move on i need jesus after this badger youre one of the most consistently funny youtuber i watch props for even making world of tankswarships fun to watch i love the gigan stuff except gigans head exploded and then he was killed by mothra hes just eye candy i can just imagine the bethesda representative looking at badger like a psycho as he yelled yeet and boom as he slaughtered enemies so this is a chainsawman video game nice super hyped pre ordered digital deluxe edition laptop guy definitely does not know how to set up a gaming rig screen tearing micro stutter etc badger get the bfg edition and yes its that bfg more space hulk deathwing funny that you used that gigan model cuz thats actually what happened in final wars boycott iluntill bethesda gets put on grial for the illicet anticonsumer participations and the crime that is fallout 76 you can kill people with finger snaps preordered if only someone like jdawg would come to my house and let me play video games im upset the ozzy man voice thing wasnt a part of your early access experience i wonder if he plays skyrim aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa i cant wait for this game this is just like the division 2 it had a shitty first game and then a game of the year sequel game there was a first rage and that game was shitty af gravlaucher this is portal 3 anthem comes out i dont need it world war z comes out i dont need it days gone comes out i dont need it rage 2 comes out i neeeeed iiiiiiiit youll never catch me crabs not when i shift into maximum overdrive rage 2 is basicly the fusion of doom and 40k overdrive is psychojet with extra steps 237 i was this close okay vice president mr president were getting attacked by hundreds of armies what should we do mr president give me overdrive and five minutes im pretty sure rage 2 stole the detonating revolver from resistance wouldnt it be vehicular assault gigan with all of that scares me ive learned two things from this vid 1 this game looks amazing and two this guy is hilarious subs that screen tearing oof 945 crossout in this shit correct me if im wrong didnt they also make the shit storm known as fallout 76 far cry new dawn if it was good i would also like to mention that the grav dart launcher is a ripoff albeit a badass one of one of the guns from bulletstorm everybody talking about the jdawg guy but can we acknowledge badgers new camera hi welcome to the scp foundation d3967 aka badger we need you to play this game what hardware did they provide nice vid btw very nicely done thumbs up bethesda isnt as great anymore so its not a big deal anymore i actually really want to play the game but then i realised i own a potato a rotten one soooooo youre telling me that the revolver is a thanos snap gun ill take your entire stock so you become an angry marine always angry all of the time yaaaaargh ahem sorry i dont know what came over me you become an angry marine and fuck shit up all of my yes ive just witnessed the dumbest shit imaginable i want it because my dream to murder people ai in the most hilarious way ever and splode shit when baddgur doesnt upload doom eternal my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined its not rage its bulletstorm 2 meh ill take it anyway love the vid have you ever got that feeling of deja vu graphics look like shit how i not heard of this game till now the secondary fire mode is copypaste from ressisstance fom my dude that is just a thunder shotgun fortnite save the world rage 2 burn the world did someone say war crimes the best singleplayer game so the living man literally to angry to die meme love the plankton quote minor hazard im pretty sure if it can kill someone with relative ease its not minor yall know im gonna shoot half the people in a room with that gun then snap im getting this now for sure you should play risk of rain 2 just saying badger bager guess what nerds guess who got doometern ea its rage 2 where is far cry new dawn new video i choose to believe that every time badger is yelling at things in the game that its from the raw footage which means mr jdog witnessed all of it and was just there thinking to himself what is this guy on i dont think ive laughed this hard in a while redacted wait a minute is that a scp foundation reference firestorm revolver is like mustang on crack when i heard rage 2 i wonder what is rage but i actually forgot i played it i started to remember that game when i saw the boomerang i was expecting him to say something something crack is wack but he made up for it with the plankton line firestorm revolver is a missed opportunity to call it killer queen worlds best highfive 400 is that a jojo reference you had a blast with that 90 minutes literally you fool i already touched that bullet so youre saying its basically crysis but with steroids is it not hey badger i think you and your boys should try world war z out so some guy just stood by while you gamed with a laptop dang thats weird i hope you did get some sort of payment whether it be in cash or coupons for a faster food restaurant rage looks fun though i thought it looked like mad max so much 203 gigan from godzilla final wars dat gaigan has got to be in the next godzilla lol so they took a relatively generic shooter and made you a super hero now i wonder how theyve ruined it just subb3d yer funny brah badger youll never catch me krabs not when i shift into maximum overdrive hyaaaah did you buy some pizza for jdawg no badger not a bigger notre dame incident there is no stealth in rage 2 only 100 all out assault and combat its time to party whats the outro song not listed okay ngl this is probably one of my favorite reviews of rage 2 tony stark and natasha died man this video is getting me excited to try this game out its too good to be true im expecting a doom eternal video when it comes out mr president sets himself on fire forge father vulkan slow clap ooh im early nice videos its always welcome to have moar badja 830 i love the way id software thinks you wanna giveem a grenade nah giveem a black hole ah good a new berserking game for me to relieve stress and aggression on cant wait this actually looks tonnes better than the first rage and i quite liked the first one im gonna love this one buddies in the video yellow green turquoise id just understands games and why i play them so much s o u p t i m e and rip n tear space mariens need this technology to burn heritics i seriously can not wait to get this game id love to see badger play borderlands 3 my god that looks friggin awesome yes please pretty sure if you preorder you get the bfg i may be wrong so i play as gigan from the godzilla franchise as a human and is stronger im sold that looks awesome game looks cool and all love the acrobatics but this really reminds me of bulletstorm with a lot less swearing i dont event know who dis guy is but he won me over at the man i am bat at high fives after launching guy into the oblivion with a high five no one 633 brother i have chainsaw limbs and laserbeam eyes preordering intensifies badger you should totally play some midlow tier war thunder w ya crew so where is the music link did they get the idea for the firestorm revolver from resistance so basicallyand i mean this in the best possible way its farcry blood dragon with the grappler from just cause and the enemies from borderlands my favorite part is badger floating at 120 jdawg in his mind how the fuck can this much shitposting be done in 90 minutes this game comes out on may 14 right thats my birthday is this some heresy or is this some really koolie aid shit its actuallyt fur so dah honestly doesnt even look that interestingi think looks shit for a 2019 game no sethical referencedisrespect range is alraady out its far cry but focused on what players really wanna do and with doom gameplay yes badger aint selling himself fuck yeah resub soop time the whole time whilst watching this video the only thing i can think about is how jdawg sat next to you with you making all those stupid ass one liners and meming yourself into rage hell and he is just sitting there like well this is my life for the next 90 minutes thank you for showing me this incredible game papa bless this looks like borderlands but with cocaine and fun progression i have concern for this movement of the second rage game the other was gritty dark and the mutants scared the fucked outta you and the big ass one was scary the enimies were smart and actually hit me a good number of times i just hope this one eighty of design and setting is good i have now seen it all an anthropomorphized chainsaw this video makes me feel like if i drunk 30 cans of red bull snorted 10 pounds of heroine jammed 5 adrenaline needles into my heart at once and had a cheeseburger so in other words pretty good this game is fucking awesome most of bethesdas games are crap i think theyre dead looks like far cry and doom and all that but still looks fun i need moar oh boy a new badjur video homework can wait its crazy how much content you got out of 1 hr and 30 minutes we got a badass over here colonel mutherfucking mustang this is so so so cringy why do you use voice editors it fucking cringy unsubbed so you get a revolver that turns you into roy mustang sign me up plz revolver that fires explosive bullets that stick to enemiesresistance did it first xd but chainsaws were created to do c sections ur the best ur vids are so funny and well made ill never unsub evvveeer the monster with chainsaw arms and laser eyes is from godzilla final war its one of my favorite movies although it one of those kinda shitty older movies ya know but if you were wondering where thats from there yah go i will build the most nasa ass computer buy the most nasa ass headgear and peripherals and play this shit like it was the oasis from ready player one good thing i pre ordered this this looks like new dawn badger do a warframe video bur if you do make sure you play it for mmore then jusst a couple days before making revies its a game that takes time dude your videos are hilarious this actually changed my mind and made me want to get rage 2 when it comes out someone once told me that russian badger is a beta male and that american badger is alpha holy cringe this is going to be a big yikes for me ima spend my only 50 dollars to get this game and a monster when doom mixes with farcry and crisis we get this i was probably gonna play this game anyway but with this video being the hardest ive had to try to not laugh out loud at work this game has definitely moved up a few spots boger you better play killing floor 2 or i will become a furry that revolver is a rip off of resistance im sold on this now imagine having a hairline that looks like the bottom half of the 60s batman logo that would suck badger burn the world me another warhammer video ubisoftgives badger rage 2 and not doom eternal me cam awn goobisoft we wanted your spicyest meatballs i actualy watched this drunkshits lit as fuuuuuuuck just imagine badger being a total dick to j dawg while screaming at the laptop i played the first rage it was pretty dope excited for 2 now though honestly wasnt too interested in rage until i saw this video consider it piqued now pours one out cause jdawg wasnt in the video feelsbadman this video gave me fuckin adhd i am suprised i dont see any forhonor endorsements from ubisoft you and marco yolo would be a beautiful duo 99 editing 1 of the game what bethestha and ea can make a good game watches your friend get pump shottied pizza time i just realised this is bulletstorm with abilities and less cacti so its farcry high on every possible drug with some sprinkles of doom and mad max neat so they took rage1 and turned it into doom without demons k some men just want to watch the world burn wow what a shitty game i see nothing really changes in modern big studio game development oh my god i fucking need it im not going to refer to dilladollars as such im calling them dimmadollars now with enough ammo we could kill thanos the firestorm revolver i wonder how much is going to be changed and where the pay wall is in that gameyou know bugthesda is going to have a pay to win aspect badgers hairline subliminally pointing towards the subscribe and merch section well played badge you marketing genius d master flex and jdawg snoop are now canon characters that need to appear in other videos as well as clarence didnt think i needed to see you play rage gotta say im happy i seen ya play rage whoever said you cant solve everything with fisting they deserve to burn what do you use to make those visualization what the fuck bethesta i have 40 pounds ready fresh from my wallet now hand over this game or we will have some issues involving fists firestorm revolver in a nutshell killa queen already touch the bullets i need this now is it multiplayer oh he changed his room looks good from cam on computer i was hoping badger wouldnt crack a snap joke is it me or does this game remind anyone of jack and daxtor pizza time was the best part of the video i used to have to do drugs i used to do drugs and i was so good at drugs i got more drugs i dunno whats up with the stars but something glitched when he says jdogam i the only one who thinks of that singer from the band hollywood undead feel like its going to get massively graphically downgraded if just cause was an fps game you will never catch me crabs once im in maximum overdrive bugs mtx overhype bethesdumb so its an open world doom wow the one time i want the outro songdammit i guess you could say this game is all the rage 2 jdawg is the best i can literally see jdawg sitting next to badger not understanding whats happening i now want rage 2 yummy yummy in my post apocalyptic tummy nerds bethesda knows your location hyper eyes i am exponentially more interested in this game now than i was before thanks badgur and id software did the gameplay feel optimized enemy pizza time me hell yeah badgur will you make more videos on rage 2 im on a badger big run ive watched 104 of his videos i want this game now how remember when badger played r6 120 so thats what happens when the on screen models get a close up oh up this shit only god 89k views youtube yo ass better fix this fuck yes i may not get to play games early but i did get to watch endgame early thanks to a friend who works at the theater one of the greatest movies ever 1110 will take antman up the ass again always more brawndo badjur your upload schedule makes my wee wee hard play tf2 why does bajur play terrible games plz play tf2 u will love it this kinda looks more like a new crysis game rather than rage 2 i cant wait for it thats just that pistol from resistance great video as always for info the end credit song is snavs us if someone is in need since this time he did not put it i would like to unload a clip of the gravity dart gun into one of the giant enemies and fling it into outer space that was amazing you made my day sir heart react bajur this was freaking awesome shout out bethesda for rocking the campaign world i love badger picked him up from his warhammer videos but this doesnt really feel like rage ya know it feels like its trying to be a mix of borderlands and doom i love the weapon designs tho planet literally too angry to die what have they done to my baby this game looks so fucking epic def will buy on a real note this game looks like fun if it has multiplayer im down if theres no real story then theres no real point in it being a single player experience imo definitely a helpful video saves me money its just bulletstorm 2 this game looked epic in commercials and now im sold on it wow not only does rage 2 contain weapons that allows for some creative and fun shit but you can also shift into maximum overdrive and cause your gravity metal stick magnet to shoot at the speed of light have your rocket launcher multiply itself by 6 and buff yourself to above power levels thought possible just so you can make stew out of your enemies yeah thats sounds pretty fucing neato stop releasing content you giant nerd bucket im getting overwhelmed by the amount of content finna grab all of those dilla dollars badger has to play doom eternal now i channel my inner dick cheney all the time badger badger badger you couldve done this for the emporer ahhhhhhhhhhhh is that gun a jojo reference oh its not doom sadly turns down the deafening theme song bethesda will remember that so in essence rage 2 has become a more playful doom hm thats intruiging you can kill half the universe with the revolver bruh this is the shit you play when you pissed off af burger why no burnt horizon vid i wish the hyper cannon behaved more like the sleeper simulant wait do you have a revolver that transform you into killer queen badjuuuuur could make video about ring of elysium rage 2 does have character development its called weapon upgrades alright badger ill get rage 2 for the sake of the finger snapping revolver im glad i didnt preorder this thank god for badger alert my new favorite badger quote burn the world and boil the oceans man i wish there was a warhammer easter egg like the chainsword or lightning claw or the thunderhammer what is this outro song reminds me of crisis and doom mixed well i got a new addition for my wishlist badger u make my shitty days better thank you and keep badgering can anyone else imagine jdawg just standing there like what the hell is this man foing american school simulator my boy straight booling in 2 mil 406 yo thats a gun from resistance 3 that revolver reminds of the revolver from resistance 2 and that grav dart thing force gun from half life nice portal reference aswell ohh the nostalgia i cant play this dangerous game i cant even hurt a fly how can i play this rage 1 mutant remember the giant one rage 2 mutant eyes glow stands up and drools p ve channel my inner dick cheney lmaooooo one of the best burger videos in a bit robot lady is the va for failsafe they alreadt have my money looking like far cry newer dawn gonna need at least a co op mode so people can play basketball with the slingshot thingy shoots the revolver hit you with it oh god please dont killa queen click another one bites the dust please just play siege this is just literally the sequel to bulletstorm and i fucking love it yall need to play more bulletstorm that game was probably the idea behind this slugfest 3 forget far cry when you have bulletstorm and rage 2 feel like game build arround doom systems o aint sying like a bad thing just saying first three minutes in the video and his discriptons are the best can you rename weapons give weapons custom names i really wnat to name the firestorm revolver into the thanos gun because 1 snap 2 it sets stuff on fire and fire burns stuff into ashes and ashes are like dust edit just realised you used the joke before me i was like 5 seconds away from when you made that joke you all have the right to complain to me about commenting before watching that innocent laptop guy had no idea what the fuck he was in for the russian badger you need to do warframe new badger video great but the game looks boring like a crossover of crysis and far cry hmm this looks like an interesting mix of the original rage and bulletstormcolour me intrigued rage 2 aka far cry blood dragon 2 well i know what game im going to get next is that a motherfuckin jojo refrence this game is really more like a bulletstorm sequel then a rage sequel and frankly im not disappointed basically doom eternal is not gonna come out soon rage 2 the game where oding means that everyone but you dies i love that heavy metal band rage against the machine i wonder if you get yelled at in the comments by your siege cult followers of not playing enough and now ill probably buy it goddamn id thinks the exact same as i did when i was like 13 with that magnetic gun thing except my idea was just the skeleton being thrown around and everything else kinda being everywhere play the original no powers but still plenty fun rrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaage badger when are you going to do another war thunder vid they now have supersonic jets and are about to add the a10 warthog god i hope they give u doom and halo early just so i can laugh my ass off while i grind for the money to go out and buy these games i didnt know kraig from borderlands 2 got a spinoff next time when we dont selfimmolate that statement gave me heresy i can already see the thanos memes that the community is gonna create with that sick revolver i thought this game was going to be stupid amounts of fun i was correct this just looks like doom but a cheap far cry copy i guess it works badger thats pretty edgy i have trust issues not to mentioni have a big toe infection am i the only one that recognized gigan at 204 and 242 screw school i gonna watch this on the class computer it isnt dilla dollars its doug dimmadomes doug dimma dollars thank god you made a reference to gigan why i have this feeling that almost every badger video now must have some 40k puns or sth its not bad at all i wanna say your so hyped in this video i love it is like doom and halo in 1 game cool btw waiting for that mk 11 video no link to the outro song not a single negative comment about the game interesting still gonna wait on this one even if its not made by shithesda its still published by them and thats good enough of a reason as is to dump a truckload of salt onto this game before consuming it or any reviews about it is there a way to get rid of the seizure inducing colors now i want to see you play the game from jdawhg perspective oh shit its kira and his stand killer queen i am 1000 gonna buy rage 2 now holy shit badger you made it look amazing burger and rage 2 the most ambitious crossover event of all time can you play it in vr soup time when i saw the intro i thought it was far cry blood dragon 2 i played rage 1 and when i heard there was another i was happy the disappointment in your voice as they told rage 2 instead of doom eternal b u r n t h e w o r l d b o i l t h e o c e a n tbh this looks moar fun than d00m also b0rger ur face hella sweat killer queen bites the dusto so doom meets far cry is it the fact this game is a war crime or the fact that you can become a war crime this vid is when bajur ups the shitpost level to maximum overdrive assert dominance by setting self on fire life hacks is this khornate berserker simulator 2019 bethesda may have messed up fallout 76 but they didnt mess up on getting badger to sponsor rage 2 whats up dog soooo basicly doom on meth looks like a doom game with another skin and special powers or is it just me eat a booty let me tell you spoilers of end game tony stank is gonna die and he will steal all infinity stones from thanos during fight and snap his finger wiping thanos and his shit crew cap will become old and will finally die of old age lul just wait for nightmare mode will be top notch any one else get the bulletstorm vibes so doom now open world man badgers humor is really forced and unfunny shits dumb as fuck idk why wen you said jdog only thing that i was thinking about was fallout 3 strange that they would make a rage 2 when the first was such trash ids version of bulletstorm minus the skillshot mechanic looks nice but not quite what i expected for a rage sequel i hope coop will be handed better this time the coop missions for rage were fun but far to short coop campaign would have been better saw that big boss like enemy grav darts on each hand make him clap himself too death ok its a good game but its not my rage my rage is the original one i have the first rage it was just 25 about 3 question is is it the same old engine used for fallout 76 otherwise it looks fun i love they it software thinks wanna give him a grenade nah give him a black hole just made my day the first rage was criminally underrated but it was almost all story and quicktime this makes me happy basically doom and far cry had a glorious hate fuck and the baby grew up and had sex with bulletstorm this resulted in the slightly special rage but the parents didnt like him much so they gave birth to a sister game they put more pizzazz into their sex life this time and it worked i just think its too far away from the original game heck yea i love russian baggers badger has ascended doom eternal vide oh also badger has almost as many subs as grandday holy shit the ai voice is failsafe 335 game better not do that stuttering shit did u crack all these jokes in front of j dawg so basically they made you advertise this game for free of cost 405 so basically youre thanos you better make a doom eternal video as soon as it comes out no mans power fantasy is complete with out grunts yelling pizza time like how no man is a whole man with out a pork bun in their hand so youre telling me that you can go full roy mustangkiller queen with a revolver my bank account is going to hate me i got banned from your discord sever for no reason please help too bad youre not cool enough to know what gigan is because everything you used him for an example for he essentially is so a guy pull up on u and let u play rage 2 early k then fucking hell thia is hilarious mrpresident used vehicular manslaughter its super effective it looks like they took the doom engine and put a rage filter on top i love the ace ventura when nature calls reference what about big fucking gun doom waiting for doom eternal looks pretty good oh the pain oh the pain that is some super blue balls for doom eternal bethesda you cant just leave a guy hanging like that does this game have anything to do with rage 1 i just wonder what the person that gave badger the game like wtf when he was screaming something rage 2 clash simulator guess we know who burned notre dame now bruh i asked you to play skyrim not angery twomad am i the only one who wishes that they make the outbreak zombie missions a permanent section or game mode to r6 please reply with your thoughts and opinions now this is d a k k a i signed into two accounts to like this vid twice the grunt used rock mr president used vehicular manslaughter i dont want to set the world on fireee but my revolver does so burn in holy fire this is that high quality shite i subbed for just glorious a love child between far cry and doom how many copies can i buy running thumping fun i feel like the characters in this game is what you would get if you took how jockies from l4d2 act and gave them dooms vengeance and just gave them superman cocaine badger has now the power to summon jdawg the laptop holder cripplimg alcopholism is totally a superpowe get fucked scrub sim friend asked for high five badger fus rou da id looked at the game they made realized it was basically just destruction on a massive scale and realized badger would be the best promoter they could find for it whats rage 2 nani yeah i only need the right video to make me interested on this game oh i forgot about this game badgur you should try the first one even though its boring but you should try it 226 theyre going to bury whats left of you in a soup can man i wouldve loved to hear badger say that xd where is the payday video im trying to clear this bandit camp but theres just soup glad to see that id made a good game in spite of its publishers history the past year vehicular manslaughter that got me more than the ace ventura i loved mad max that shit was dope a bit simple in some mechanics but damn was the driving fun gravity gun on crack made by elon weed id love to see badger and the guys play borderlands 3or any of em for that matter would love to see you play wwz would love to see you play wwz basically your job is to make a khorne berserker like a fucking pacifist a badger video thats not wargaming or ubisoft what is this 236 youll never catch me krabs not when i shift into maximum overdrive so a game were i can be just me a crazy ass mother fucker yup i am getting it i liked the first rage rage 2 kinda seems too sciency tbh but does it have battle royale 1110 the fuck is this this is a complete upgrade to the first rage if you dont believe me look it up brother you really oughta do a doomskyrim video i goddamn miss your reviews 332 that tear tho that fucking doom eternal bit my sides are in the stratosphere help will you actually do a video on doom eternal when it comes out shut up and take my money badg i mean bethesda badgers description is wrong because your man is a nuke with legs local president literally too angry to die bethesda i recognize that name yeah god howard works for bethesda and created a monstrosity of a game called fallout 76 fallout 76 dogs with long necks that giraffe dogs tbh it looks worse than the trailer insanely obnoxious so basically crackdown guy far cry and prototype incoming shitfest alert snavs us is the outro song i mean rage is still a good game dies internally because he doesnt get to see doom eternal gameplay badger what goes through youre head lol i love the beginning where you thought you were getting to play doom but instead its rage xd tbh boil the oceans seems like something dick cheney has definitely said on more than one occasion the grunt use rock mr president uses vehicular manslaughter the revolver is the same as the one in resistance 3 play titanfall 2 you get to use guns that go pew pew bang bang and kthunk boom the thanos revolver thanos revolver thanos revolver thanos revolver thanos revolver

videos im not bullshitting socrisis 4 i need this game a game that focuses on gameplay and not ramming politics down your throat sounds good to me holy shit this looks 100000000000000000000000 times better than the first rage game this is how you do a good sequel i knew this game would be downgraded oh waitim watching it on 480p and you cant change resolution on a fucking nokia phone what was the song at the end that revolver is the one from resistance 3 017 that moment when you realize the armor in the background is just hellfire power armor from fallout 3 ahhhhh just what my depresion feares the most your videos 740 that smug cliff that was a fantastic video dude 90 minutes is clearly plenty fire starter revolver anyone else immediately think of the resistance games firestorm revolver you

dumbest way possible and watching you like mark zuckerberg watching his simulation does this game have female characters just kinda want them all to be ones with armour for no reason totally not for their clothes to dissapear now im intrigued by this game if crysis and bulletstorm had a baby you would get this so if im understanding this correctly the explosive revolver is just a walking jojo reference badger that aint just any revolver thats motherfuckinkiller queenif it was a gun ninjas cant catch you if you are on fire is this the same president from metal wolf chaos you might wanna take a quick look at fortnite at the moment badger badger did you have your daily dose of iron this morning me no pumps me full of iron with gravlauncher this game looks so fucking fun badger happy

of a gun d man i wish it was doom eternal which is the only game im considering buying full price doh well fun vid badger this actually looks better than doom already honestly the best ad rage 2 couldve asked for when you rage and after that you just rage 2 god i love you was he a cool guy wearing a neat cowboy hat a dynamite firinggg revolver hell yeah so the main character is basically a space marine without his anger management pills 852 gravity 856 the cooler gravity man is this game notre dame cuz it looks hella lit rage ill have two please imagine not being trusted with a game i want doom eternal so bad gimme fooking doom eternal can you stop playing games early and play them earlier you toxic fuck thank you there it is bttttt how dare those freedom hating communists not give

could be detonated remotely and was stupid fun hey badger i know its not ur style but you should check out dwarf fortress its interesting to say the least so basically its doom far cry excitement for rage 2 increases grabs mouse with malicious intent looks at the pistol shotgun mozambique here im pretty disappointed to see this honestly i mean for anyone who played the first rage this isnt rage

first but i cant be bothered not first im excited first first first thirst first first first easy first see our e3 2018 gameplay presentation now httpswwwyoutubecomwatchveluxrbcdlre 3 to 4 months later and its 67 off on steam lol wtf no base bad trailer looks cool tho idk but it looks like borderlands and far cry at the same time i was looking new game to play but then bethesda namedropped themselves no thanks your track record is shit and games buggy af search for micheal ezeh and like search for micheal ezeh and like search for micheal ezeh and like is there pvp my friend loves rage 1 and he did not know that rage 2 came out so im gonna tell him and i really want the game even though i play the game fallout 4 and this game looks awesome and it has twice the bloodsplatter and madness crap gameits good that someone buy avalanche after just cause 4 crap now this crap over 20 member leaves avalanche rip avalanche is that real gameplayor is it another anthem the music is terrible ruins the video awesome as the first one so this is just a shooter game instead of a full exploration survival game like fallout right too much colored an apocaliptic world have to be pure evil too many lsd in the producers head are these superpowers or technology i was really hoping for a super power game and if this is it im getting it what song did they use for this trailer did borderlands 3 come out already that what this video remind me of i always prefered rage over borderlands this looks way better hype bugthesda new failure nice the narrator sounded like cole macgrath from the first game you guys see that beta brumak lol mad max 2 looks like a straight up copy of it same developers looks like the same sort of enviroment and gameplay amazing looking game cant wait to rage punks and rage i wait on tes 6 id say it was a good trailer if it hadnt had the vb bogan music in the background so its destiny meets mad max sigh me up im totally down whos hyped this is awsome id software are the company that defined this genre every game they make is epic if you had a pc in the early 1990s youd of played wolfenstein spear of destiny doom etc all by id that was a golden age of gaming they are not copying anything every game by anyone else after is the true fluff nothing of any real consequence i mean look at the call of duty franchise that game still uses a heavily modified quake iii arena engine to this day bethesda though 046 this game looks soo fucking nuts and god fucking damn do i love itd bethesda please dont fuck this up is this borderlands 3 why am i still banned just why should i spend money on this it looks like junk imagine imagination the first rage was the holy grail of games soooo steampunk i think they should just give it away it might make a good door stop just what are they thinking really are they only time will tell i think the movie bruno might have better reveiws neat now fix fallout 76 lmao who the fuck asked for this after fallout 76 im gonna buy far cry new dawn just out of principle get me my wing sticks and shotgun and we will conquer the world official gameplay trailler shows no gameplay is whatsoever yea great is this solely online or does it have a single player campaign 044 im seeing rich sanchez hes in the background is that rick or someone else bethesda make something realisticwhy almost all games are alien or superhumans based onlywhy not something like gta or rdr ill reserve judgement because the first game had so much potential just way too short holy shit i remember playing rage such a long time ago man i actually enjoyed that game and now rage 2 is coming out looking forward to this game this i cannot wait for hell yea you know its real when your device cant even handle the graphics quality my god thats even faster and crazier than doom 2016 was totally looking forward to the sequels for doom and rage looks really good enjoyed the first game but not holding my breath on bethesda published games for awhile whats the song in this i see alot of influence from red faction guerrilla which is a super underrated game the dudes that made doom the dudes that made fallout and the dudes that made the mad max game all working together this cant possibly not be good this looks pretty dope anyone making a return in this game authority dan anyone i wanna know more details do towns still function the same do vehicles operate the samei saw mutant bash tv so that is cool cant wait to get the sequel this fucking punk ass boomer shit again please let us have non cringy post apocalypse ffs is pink and turquoise the new black now or what everything looks like it was fortnite colour apocalypse infested look at this incredibly hideous fc new dawn by ubi and then this whats wrong with the industry new games look like made for pussies and pancies nowadays and dont forget to implement some more rancid horseshit like these ridiculously laughable looking mutants if not them then deadly boring zombies im so glad this is finally happening the first game was amazing ive waited a long time for this i seriously cant wait welcome to mad max but youre a fucking wizard not coming to steam so im pirating this does anyone else think the girl at the end looks like pink the story of raider gameplay trailer this is not this should have released instead of fallout 76 is it just me or i see a small click of borderlands 2 only found this today i really enjoyed the first game the ending was disappointed but had so much fun playing back on my xbox 360 which i still have i played it so many times hope this one is just as good or better hopefully the glitch infested hands of bethesda are staying in publishing this time around rage was a game what suck now they did some changes to ask for more of your money dont buy it first test it many games from today are different trailers from true gameplay trust me dont buy it until you play it looking forward to this loved the first one couldnt put it down my only complaint would be the story line could have been a bit more in depth and it was too short imo it finished and i was just like is that it only 9 years later glad too see that rage didnt go to waste with that story and all it had some metro 2033 feel to it with those big cities interactions and races it was such a fun game hope they follow the story is all omfg i love seeing old things appear in the new game wingstick some other thing why am i just now finding this yes yes fucking yes edit this was my fucking favourite game years ago can i not play as the blue mohawk chick though its my favorite game there were some legitimately amazing moments in the first rage game but the game fell apart the longer you played the driving combat mechanics and the gunplay were amazing though as were many of the items the poor plot and lack of interesting characters really hurt the game overall though reminds me of mad max been waiting 8 years for this shit rage was so fucking fun shallow but fun i fucking love id soft theyre finally did it i kinda think they shouldve also made that cancelled doom project too it actually kinda looked pretty decent first one was one of my favorite games i hope this one does well too missed opportunity not going with suicidal tendencies cyco vision in this rage is punk while doom is heavy metal doom mixed with mad max epic this is going to be awesome my body is ready and my wallet is open this is not the rage i know i feel like you better get ready to die would have been a better song for this looks like some mixed sunset overdrive and borderlands in a blender drank it then shat it out love it will buy it one question will it be cannon with the first rage i loved the story even if it was incomplete wheres mad max he is missing out this looks so fun and insane definitely gonna buy it hopefully the story and characters will be as good as the gameplay looks maybe its just my nostalgia but rage was the first game i bought for my xbox 360 when i was young and it stuck with me and thats why this fucking trailer confuses me because it doesnt keep its consistency with the dark and dreary backdrops of the original game and decides to just fling vibrant colors all over the place like a contemporary millennial artist for some sort of appeal most of this gameplay trailer is fucking cg and the parts that are gameplay hardly tell us anything about what the game will feel like just cutting every five seconds which might imply faster combat along with the abilities making use of cover irrelevant it honestly fails to capture what i enjoyed about the first game so much as i remember heading through the city weary of every sound searching around the dark and drab environment of the fallen city also huge thing the ending to the first game is something that doesnt seem connected at all to this fucking thing so am i to expect tha i really hope the controls and over all motions in the game have been improved in rage 2 theyre really bad in rage 1 the game has more color in it and definitely looks like rage 1 never happened hello im luda im one of the owners of the new rage amino a community centered around the game franchise rage come join this new community and post chat create content and a lot more httpaminoappscomcrageamino it will playable offline or always online like quake champions so much pain with always online games why the fuck my pp hard the new mad max game is sick just kidding rage was my childhood ya loved the first one first impression a really good game but based on gameplay trailer it doesnt feel like a rage game rage was pretty much a spinoff of another evil doom set in a modern postapocalytpic setting back in 2011 rage 2 looks like a mindless fun and color packed borderlands 3 rage was pretty much john carmacks vision of another story of doom ii hell on earth with 60fps in 2011 first rage was alright this rage looks like itll be the same just with better gun play i dont however like the raider looking thing too similar to fallouts raiders while i played rage 1 i felt like it didnt know what it wanted to be and im getting the same vibe here i guess we will wait and see rage is now doomed fuck to the yes sooo basically its mad max my childhood is coming back to me why cant bgs use this engine on fallout and elder scrolls just modify this one instead of using that old junky creation engine mmmmmmmmmmmm was excited to see a new rage but this looks like its gonna be painfully casual it looks like its taking everything that went wrong from rage 1 and turning it good this shits got me pumped the music the gameplay cant wait 8 long ass years and its finally happening thank you bethesdas i loved the first game this one is no exception sure ill buy rage 2 d has anyone notice doomguy how come the badguys only seem to move when youre shooting them away so there are some animations the ai does like play with a baseball bat but otherwise they just stand still this sounds horrible i see they hired avalanche studios of just cause fame to make their game more fun im glad youre making the second one the first rage was highly underrated thanks bethesda for making another apocalypse to compete with your terrible concept of what a fallout game is i doubt anyone wanted rage 2 after that first mess and now with 76 coming too i have no idea what game to trash first uh doom meets fallout i never knew i wanted that welp not really sure it could be worse than the original so theres that that looked awesome i never liked rage 1 but this looks cool too much crazy metal rage could have been a nice game but it was to shortsmall rage why so colorful and progressive lol now jesse can get ptsd from killing gale again the memories needs more punk woman and im down sjw unite doom and just cause 3 had a baby im going to range the hit out of that park i remember the first rage had huge graphics issues have they ever fixed them i must say u reminded me i got rage installed some where gonna check it back now streets of rage 2 looks amazing fucking insane big guns yep this is id about time bethesda i loved part one and have been waiting for this im waiting on dead island two aswell yesss i really hope we get a full legitimate game this time unlike rage 1 im hyped but cautiously so everyone complaining clearly hasnt played the original play the first rage then complain about doom copyborderlands copy ive played and enjoyed both borderlands and rage and i enjoyed them both yes i loved the first game nice its a probably get for me whats the song omfg my next game love besides fallout and elder scrolls the creators of singulaity need to bring a sequel since it was awesome aswell as this gamethe only thing bad about rage 1 it was that were pretty short what is this mad max horizon with the doom dlc pack still looks interesting though might try it mad max fury road meets gears of war ill give this a try doom mad max fallout rage 2 this game looks sickkk d rage isnt that good of a game rage was just a combo of doom and quake with mad max art and idiotic fallout crafting i hope theres some new kind of gameplay element that really sells it the only reason i never played borderlands was because of the lame graphicsthis fixes that problem its like call of duty mad max and borderlands all in one omg i played it on 360 cant wait for it on one when you live at dusty depot is this continuing the story from rage i loved that game and this game looks really good too the original game was good but the controls left a lot to be desired i hope they fix that in this game for honor 2 gonna rock fucking finally dude i want it is it free why does it say barbie fashion show an eye for style in the description lmao anyone realize game category barbie fashion show dafuq beth i hope their concluding with whatever the fuck happened to the authority lol it shows the game as barbie fashion show an eye for style in the description ill pass first one was so so question why the fuck does it say barbe fashion show an eye for style in the description they knew they had to integrate rgb mainly pink lmao what im saying is bathesda realized they had to include a whole gamut of colors since everyone from pcmr to console trash peasants have rgb lighting on everything now so mad max with more guns and less sand sounds okay to me the first game was such an underrated diamond in the rough its ridiculous this is basically another game like the division so heads up guys this might suck finally the 2nd game i loved the first one but it left a sense of u saved humanity now roll credits this looks great anyone notice it is a rage 2 trailer but the youtube gaming thing says its barbie fashion show in the description game barbie fashion show an eye for style 2008 i hope this gay ass gabe gets major backlash well see more of it at quakecon along with fallout vault 76 i will have to stand in a long line to see the gameplay previews i want this game for my xbox one whole i think the first rage and i prebought it was a terrible game with great concept art as the only positive if the gameplay is tight and its les on rails this time id give it a chance will wait till i see the reviews tough streets of rage 2 1992 i dont know what to think obviously it needs to be upgraded from the last game for the demographic but i liked the darker atmosphere like dead city and while not everything was certainly realistic it wasnt over the top like in the trailer crazy stuff is more for fallout i think bethesda will always be the bestthats a fact been waiting sooo long for this thought the first one was amazing easter egg heaven awesome now will have 1000001 first person shooters let me guess its a little different did they fix quake already anyone here played the first one bethesda softworks support 219 ultra wide format with rage 2 remember rage 1 yeah me neither looks amazing the only thing i hope is that the storyline and gameplay is longer than the first one it was over way to quickly this is a combination of doom and mad max set in fallouts world omg i cant wait loved the first one greattt story epic gameplay and the wingsticks were sooooo satisying definitely preordering looks epic if this will not have mad max game car upgrade features and even better its a no buy for me alright ill be the one to say it this is just non cell shaded borderlands this looks awesome whats with the stupid music wow this game blows destiny out of the water if its as good as it looks i wont be buying the forsaken expansion this game looks like battlefield v will there be a main villain i can listen to the music of this trailer and not get sick of it shovelware glad they are done with this game so they can get back to making an actual game we want yes the first game had the best most satisfying gun play ever everything had weight to it and the hit detection along with the enemy physical reactions were superb you could almost feel it when you hit someone or sent them spinning with an explosion i do enjoy rage very much while here i do recognize a few things from rage but overall it seems to be building up from the last game in a large fucking way yea rage was generic but it was the safe kind of generic the new borderlands looks lit i still remember the first rage like yesterday ok bethesda you have my attention its a mix of borderlands mad max and wolfenstein game play this looks at a good game i hope is it a gooood game a new borderlands that game looks awesome is there an online hell yeah loves rage so much finally one of the most underappreciated games gets a sequel feminism 2 the gamei mean rage 2 the game looks way too close to borderlands down to the logo lmao looks so much better than cod bo4 shut up and take my money for 20 euro game disk i would take it not 60 because i know it will not be 60 fps on my pc this remindes me of fallout and lawbrekkers if they had a child and its was not a horrifyi8ng monster its just skyrim with guns oh so a borderlands clone wait a minute fallout borderlands rage i legit just bought rage on my pc a few weeks ago because i never beat it on my console wow this game is so old and were getting a second one fuck yeah so is this open world like sleeping dogs i know there completely different and this isnt in hong kong man i cant wait to play borderlands 3 the shaved colourful hair bandits look like scorchers from rage 1 the guys with the grey armour yellow robes and helmets look like shrouded from rage 1 the helmets look the same the bare chested swamp guys with animal horns and skulls look like jackles from rage 1 the mutants authority and authority mutants look very similar to rage 1 theres new types of authority mutants and behemoths the car at 120 looks similar to the cuprino in rage 1 yay finally but also damn cuz that mean there might not be a doom 2 til next year or 2 i hate how doom 2016 was left on a cliff hanger glad theres a sequel i hear its in a different engine not an iteration of the previous i hope it maintains 2 things from rage it had some of the best enemy ai in an fps ive seen and the best gunplaygunfeel when borderlands fallout and sunset overdrive all have a baby together boycotting this game because it does not have a nonbinary pansexual black mexican immigrant muslim lesbian with one arm who is transitioning into a man as the main character boycottrage2 anitasarkeesianrocks andsodoeszoequinn fallout 4 with cars and gay colors i love that they are making another rage game i love bethesda and id since doom its pretty but has way too much shit going on and looks like it has no idea on what it wants to be 049 damn it junkrat what did you do to make those guys its about fucking time can yall sub and watch my new video the bastard son of doom fallout and mad max 044 spoiler alert the bad guys in this game are actually a less insane version of the rick and morty fan base watch in 125x so going to play this so in other words doom meets mad max how honestly boring i want something interesting to play not some generic bullshit psychojet intensifies about fucking time leave it to id to make amazing games hype oh my god hell yes i cannot wait whoever said bethesda games are becoming badrethink your statement lol up the punx i can so see ids early doom and quake influences on this game i never played the original rage or rage idk whats preferred in the community but im excited to see how this game will turn out bethesda read all the borderlands 3 complaints and made it themselves i guess this looks amazing dammit walmart canada lots of fun pc players want the best deliver im more hyped for this game than fo76 and thats a bad sign ive waited 5 years thank you their finally getting into mad maxism im feeling it when i get my consoles im getting this im so into fastpaced games bethesda only made one game that i liked and that is doom hopefully that will change with rage 2 this game will do while waiting for borderlands 3 this game looks like if just cause 3 fallout 4 and destiny had a three way love child i loved rage definitely gonna love this game more now btw good job on the graphics like holy shit loved the original and i think im gonna love this game as well it looks like fallout has a similar gameplay feel of doom and it reminds me of mad max type car system that i loved about the first game love what you guys have been making so far and hope you make these next games fallout 76 eso summerset dlc and rage 2 better than we all hope this looks like destiny got raped by borderlands 2 and somewhere in the mix bethesda got custody and named it rage because it wasnt like its siblings 143 i hope thats not the player character i like my hero to at least look like a hero not a freak well might as wait a while if that is the default look hopefully they will let us change it btw super pumped for this game i hope its a lot bigger more openworld and more stuff to do i would grind mutuant bash tv just to get the stuff i waned i hardly used turrets and sentry bots cause it felt like i was wasting precious finite resources the vehicle combat i love but multiplayers with monarchs were too op i hope they bring in slot machines one of my favorite things to do in games is gambling especially when i can go to sleep and just keep pressing a or x to make the slots spin i didnt like that my second favorite gun from the first game was the very last gun you got my fav was the shotgun but it seems like the battles are bigger more customization for weapons and especially vehicles one thing i hope they dont do is that warner brothers games di how gutted has id been by bethesda that it needs avalanches helpah liked the first rage its weakest point was the thats it ending and scarcity of enemy types it shone in appearance except spritetrees and animations of enemies dragging their injured buddy out of combat a mistake in the original rage was taking its evil dudes design inspiration from borderlands the presentation of this game with its freezeframes with text ontop is copying even more from borderlands thats not what rage needs it needs to be its own thing not bethesdas borderlands with the newest mad maxs color saturation gameplay clips in this trailer like circlestrafing a bunch of dudes while tossing the glaive and vehiclecombat look fun no one has done much vehicle combat outside of halo and far cry im just hoping the borderlands influence doesnt go further than the marketing it will ruin this game if it has cringey sjwriting like anthony burchs memefest a little late just came here to say elder scrolls 6 where is it we could have got borderlands 3 this year if gearbox didnt waste their time on battleshit i mean born im knew to this game and the whole bethesda thingso is it a rpg like fallout cause im hoping its like a rpg borderlands that would be awesome honestly i loved the first rage it just seem to fall kind of short by the end with the gameplay but this looks great were going to need a stealth cloaked assassin class its like heres my homework but switch it up a little bit with bl2 multiplayer nintendo switch please bethesda is it multiplayer im hoping they bring this to the switch who else played this on the ps3 and saw the add and freaked out to go and find the trailer fuck yeeahhh ragee 2 they sould also do doom like this open world and shit rage vs fallout which is wacky and which is more sad hyped wait so there are 2 studiosdevelopers involved just what i like to see and hear big fucking guns is this multiplayer wow looks awesome im definitely going to try and get this omg they actually did it fallout 75 am i the only one whos tired of seeing companies use an open world as a promotion for their games almost every game that offer open world gameplay has very little content and relies heavily on the size of the world to distract players and pad out play times id rather have a good content laden straightforward game than an empty massive world rage 1 was straight up my child hood ive beat it over 20 times and i still love it all the little jokes and mini games in the game were amazing and just how it looked it actually looked like the world was broken it was amazing and ill never forget it also yall better keep that wing stick in 2 trailers and a couple of leaks in and some people are already judging the game like it was out for 2 years and they played it for houers can you people have some fucking patience well its not blackmarsh and i certainly didnt expect it but i am impressed and very much looking forward to it fallout without vats is it going to be delayed 100 times like the first one i have preodered or bought every game they have released in the past however given the history of the industry as of late thoughts days are over i will wait for them to fix the bugs you all know it will have before i give them any money im not really into rage but this genuinely looks like fun real genuine non grinder style fun better than fallout 4 take this games engine with its lovely graphics and apply it to fallout or the new elder scrolls and we will be on good terms bethesda looks beautiful just like the first one still does this needed a sequel finally getting one oh man i actually forgot about rage gotta love andrew wk so you took the fallout and nuka world post apocaliptic theme the dooms dynamic action and the wolfensteins technology and made a mad max set to 11 experience you know what im looking forward to it i wanna see where this goes not gonna lie i think a little something came out worst part is i dont feel guilty about it im excited holy shit announce a new series pls if you just listen to the first part but replace asteroid with nuclear bombs it sounds like it would be on a fallout game meh too much unrealistic crap it reminds me of mad max pvp multiplayer the pc release better be better than last time i had to spend 3 days rewriting files just to make it playable and then post those to community boards to help other players out better than battlefield 5 rage is a game where you just jump right into it the folks at id better be pulling out all the stops to make this game actually good since the first rage had such an underwhelming presentation when you looked beyond surface level i hope it not lagging like some of the games have been borderlands 3 from a psychos perspective looks fucking sick so out of ideas literally the pack from fallout 4 nuka world bethasda sucks what you guys did to rage the first one was a journey full of mystery a very dark tittle that scream at me caution at every step gore was this tittle last name during that journey but this that you show us now this is yeah lets do this guys whooo hooooo borderlands wanna be bullcrap that only michelangelo from the ninja turtles would truly love just an honest question what the hell happened the first rage could have been like this brink 2 or doom 4 too bethesda and 2k the best companies another bulletstorm tryhard clone best game i seen so far and if its multiplayer i would definitely but it will we ever see a brink 2 bethesda do you play as the same character from rage 1 wow very interesting new game when does it come out looks like mad max and fallout had a love child looks like my kind of fallout so this is where bethesda has been wasting their time instead of working on elder scrolls fallout doom rage math is real looks like theres 12 different guns in this trailer 4 the player uses which have a similar style the shotgun and rocket launcher from the last game seem to be in this and theres a gun that looks like the authority rifle theres also the settler pistol that isnt here the videos vibe is a far cry from how rage 1 gameplay actually was so excited for this fallout doom rage loved rage and this looks better than i could have hoped hope the multiplayer is good and that the campaign can be played with 2 people i didnt see this one coming what fallout 4 should have been this game will suck like the last one where the fuck is fallout 5 hurry up bethseda shut the actual fk up and take my fking money anyone remember a fairly old game called defiance kinda getting those feels here just a bit when is it gonna be released fallout 45 please be atleast coop i wanted a mad max sequel this will do i love rage game 1 but when rage 2 comes out im gonna go in rage cant even tell you how long i waited for a sequel didnt even think it would come true so pumped for it this needs to have multiplayer it looks fantastic i loved rage people had mix reviews on it and i can understand why but this looks fking awesome it looks a lot more colorful and more intense than the 1st one i hope this game gives me that doom feel with mad max world to it cant wait gotta love the wingstick best weapon i love bethesda studios but i want fucking borderlands 3 ill pass on rage 2 looks like theyre killing what i enjoyed about rage how much effort it takes to kill a single enemy as opposed to insane action where it doesnt take much to kill a single enemy but you have to kill dozens of them at any given time good if im wrong though where is fcking fallout 5 xd just give me tes already fuck bethsoft only reason to play this is because of id even the sub missions in the game where amazingly fun i cant wait one of 2 games ive actually played through several times the other being mass effect though the sub missions could get boring in mass effect i want it mass effect andromeda looks really choppy guaranteed disappointment considering bethesdas track record i just hope they have a nice intro that explains what leads to rage 2 from the first rage jack black approves looks gay as fuck they better keep to the original lore and story instead of throwing it out and starting from scratch like a lot of sequels that take a decade to release cause the original story characters and antagonists were awesome this game actually looks kinda fun looks like borderlands 2 and fallout 4 had a baby oh no open world welp goodbye good game design seems like your taking lessons from all your other games i think these games are trying a little too hard hey bethesda qhen usted going to be launched on switch this game looks cool the silent majority really enjoyed this first glimpse into rage 2 its a wonderful exciting and vibrant breath of fresh air the vocal crybaby sissybitch minority literally complains about anything and everything they can because they are inept basementdwelling prepubescent degenerates who resent their mothers ive honestly never been so eager to play a game since the last of us was announced on the ps3 i want everyone to listen here ive never even commented on things like this before in my entire life but in all my years i have never seen such spiteful insipid reactions to a glimpse of a aaa video game in all honesty every single naysayer should be ashamed of themselves next time i suggest you hold your tongue before condemning something that is far beyond your ability to comprehend and enjoy you negative little children are writing the same condemnation of battlefield 5 too both of these games are a wonderful breath of fresh air the kind that everyone i know is looking forward to when i saw this debut footage of rage 2 i was in awe of how fun amazing and unique it looks in all seriousness the majority of you naysayers are insecure betamales who cringe at the random showing of pink or orange as in rage 2 which looks phenomenal a new world that i cant wait to immerse myself in its an incredible showing for a game that wasnt even on my radar but after the this is some badass fun i can get behind well its about fucking time ive been waiting since the ps4 was announced i still have the first rage playing it every once in awhile this is like visual pornography for me oh my goodness is this real i have been hoping and praying that you would make a sequel to one of my most favourite games of all time rage even to this day i still play it often and over and over again as i can never get enough of it will the story carry on from where it left off this is so awesome and i cant wait thank you so very much bethesda softworks you have made one of my dreams come true its like mad max and borderlands had a crossover has good potential cant wait to play it hopefully the second one works for amd cards we wanted elder scrolls 6 not rage 2 wow fallout space looks good instead of nuke the asteroid hit the first one in my opinion is better then this one because im not into the wide open world but why why make sequel for the worst game id ever made please add fov slider loved the 1st it had so much heart craved a 2nd as soon as i beat 1 glad as shit doom earned my respect rage had solid animation work and gunplay and the mad max theme is badass yep im hyped only thing that worries me is beth open world makes me fear for story and if thats not the goal for this game i worry that the worlds gonna feel pointless hell yeah this will be more popular than fortnite this looks so sick and insane i dont understand how people dislike this it looks amazing definitely looks awesome but is it just me or was there a grand total of three playable weapons in every gameplay scene every first person perspective showed the same weapons looks like mad max but with insane creatures and crazy humans really like it yes a remake of destiny this game looks great rage 1 was a hidden gem ids gunplay and bethesdas open world i swear to god its like the game ive been waiting for my whole life accordinglyplease please dont screw this up anyone everyone with something ugly to say prerelease just shut your mouth bethesda dont shove the creation club into this just everyone please dont screw this up this game needs to have a flawless launch so that it gets tons of postlaunch content and such so everyone just stfu if you dont love it and superextradoublestfu if you have some sjw issue with it nobody ruin this for me cant wait so weve got the guys who made fallout doom and just cause all working on the same game im interested driving a car in a bethesda game what so battle royal i hope we get to choose a faction to join i think that would be neat because it looks like there are some interesting ones does it have mega texturing still this is actually a real game oh no shades of brink please be good please be good i dont even know what the fuck is going on but i love it my question is is this the id tech 6 engine or an id tech 7 engine or maybe theyre updating avalanches engine because i think the id tech engine just like the frostbite engine isnt built for open world cant wait theyll miss an opportunity if they dont make this optional multiplayer really enjoyed the first game looking forward to this only just found out that this was a thing when browsing the bethesda tshirt store and saw one called rage 2 lol oh bethesda youve done it again an awesome ass batshit crazy game i cant fucking wait for this may contain content inappropriate for children may rage is in my top 10 fav games of all time i was worried it wasnt going to get a sequel from the initial reviews phew theres just too much creative potential to let this ip go to waste if rage 2 doesnt have the monwrch ima be mad fallout 5 is looking like a snacc xtra thicc this kind of reminds me of turok on the n64 with the weapons i predict this game will do very well i already know ill buy it whoever is in charge of this game made the right choices i had no idea about this now it looks like a must buy im a graphics person and if the graphics arent good then i have no interest this looks amazing the new consoles power is definitely helping with graphics did not see this coming i hope there are hot babes in it like the first one but preferably hot babes with a bit more depth and a decent ending this time and nonrepetitive gameplay oddly enough im wondering if well take pity on that gigantic behemoth that looks all lonely maybe one of the quests will involve a semi intelligent behemoth that involves the bugger who looks like hes just wandering around the wilds maybe have him as a city mascot p finally after rage 1 disc 2 left us with a cliff hanger i was scared they werent going to make another rage i hope they remaster rage 1 i love that game just make sure it runs well on my computer you know not having to load and unload lots of textures just because i decided to turn my characters head 30 degrees to the left i really hope you can get the settler pistol without preordering why are there ads for this on youtube when it comes out in a year doom on earth gameplay trailers are lies fallout on crack cocaine yes but the question is is it multiplayer i hope this one is as good as it looks unlike the first one which wasnt damn if this is just a multiplayer shoot em up im so in if you were hoping to see borderlands 3 at e3 2018 then you might have to prepare for the worst according to shacknews a representative from gearbox told a room of journalists in may 2018 that a third borderlands entry will not be present at the show in any form but they will have other games to show off i havent been this excited for a new game in forever im still playing the first rage on steam im way too ready for this the first rage was like a piece of shit covered in chocolate sprinkles beautiful animation amazing ai and superb ballistics buried beneath claustrophobic level design hideous graphics that wouldnt pass on a ps2 and a horrid badlywritten plot with a complete shit ending now theyre making a sequel to it becausewhy again ever heard of that old saying fool me once looks more promising than cod black ops 4 this is insane class geez these comments from folks trying to trump it up by describing it as a combination of other games its mad max meets borderlands its doom fallout with a twist of wolfenstein you dont see comments to red dead 2 calling it gta with horses ffs its a sequel to game virtually everyone forgot existed 99 never even played its a game that was completely off the radar of every single video game website in all the speculation of bethesdas next game there was not a peep of rage in the chatter of elders scroll fallout new ip starfield that is how not even little but literally zero anyone gave a shit about a follow up to rage its also a game that running on avalanches apex engine will only run at 30fps im not hating on the game the rest of yall are sucking its dick gagging saying how great it is to be choking on the overinflated hype this looks like doom set in the mad max universe and that makes me 100 more excited for it huge fan of the first game and all i have to say is about fucking time yaaaaa i enjoyed the first one despite it feeling too short weak story and not enough worldbuilding im very willing to give it another try if i wanted a fps smoothie id put borderlands fallout and destiny into a blender and this would be produced the game looks like itll be a blast to play and love the different types of enemies and combat on show weve reacted to this trailer too and would be grateful if you guys checked it out if youd like to hear what true happiness sounds like haha the first was boring and forgettable so now they tried to make bulletstorm 2 no thanks fallout 5 avoid games from bethesda this fuckers broke fallout 4 that you cant play it on xbox online and closed all tickets without any help bethesda you fuckin retards you fuckins piece of shit you horse fuckers shit eaters sons of whores liers and thieves fuck you eat shit and die i hope you will all die in a bombing fuckin morons ive spend money on your shit game and now cant play because you are a bunch of loosers stick rage 2 up your asses i will never touch again any of your worthless games i can only piss on your graves like you piss on your customers you fuckin aholes i have mad faith in avalanche studios especially after just cause 3 im not sure if i should buy this or the original better not fuck this up this looks like if you just ate cocaine and fruit loops for breakfast the gunplay looks like destiny needs first person driving option i swear to god if this isnt coop it can die in a hole like all the other non coop games that deserve coop im looking forward to this game heavily too long has there been a lack of games with an insane vibe outside of borderlands and personally from someone who likes the idea of borderlands but not necessarily the game overallincluding its grindiness its safe to say im really looking forward to this rage wasnt bad its combat was tight and the guns felt extremely enjoyable but i do understand all the comments on rage that insisted the game made it seem as if it had more content than it really did like a false promise of openworld nonetheless looks good bethesda is incapable of decent character or gameplay design none of this looks remotely unique or interesting you want to be borderlands or destiny both games for people with no lives try make a good game first also fallout 3 and 4 are a fucking joke basically fallout 5 alpha without a story and without vaults imagine how cool would it be to find the operational base of all the ark survivals with the main protagonist from the first game as a commander and a quest giver a w e s o m e been waiting for many years cant wait its not coming out on switch day 1 buy amazing trailer and i actually liked part 1 on xbox 360 this game is releasing at the right time cant wait i keep reading everywhere nobody asked for this but seriously looks intense i got really pumped to played rage 1 eh pretty mediocre shooter not that interested in it rage 2 holy shit this looks cool as shit bethesda you know thats not what we all want looks absolutely fun to play and an even bigger world wow just i wanna play it is it like fallout this kinda looks like the f4 and skyrim engine also it better not be over hyped holy wingsticks the fucking they did it where the heck are the interesting story characters and settlements like rage 1 wish it was 60fps on consoles this actually looks like a really gorgeous game i might pick this one up when its on sale id software at it again i see got that john romero blood flowin shit so we get a finished game this time bethesda should hide that other trailer i think people are bouncing off of it and not giving this one a chance please be good please be good please be godo 059 wingsticks confirmed i mean i still remember all the easter eggs in dead city and rage i thought it would never come gotta say the hype was real where is fallout 5 please still have the ak from the first one looking good now if only theyd shown actual gameplay and not a prerendered cgi video titled as such you still havent learned how to market a game correctly even after you almost bungled doom 2016 gameplay first then pointless live action fluff however it looks like you ripped off a little of serious sam if these trailers are right and youll have big open areas with lots of people shooting at you id advise some more direct game play footage to show rage 2 has an identity that isnt just a mishmash of other games let alone cohesive game play i guess bethesda is trying to outborderlands borderlands hey bethesda i really want to buy rage but its not available on psn could you guys please sort out whatver issue youre having with sony why does it feel like im alone in being exited everyone else is so negative i mean come on its not like they did anything wrong they just made a game and lets be honest it looks cool fun and exiting you guys have gotten hyped over far less dont deny it we all have im sorry it isnt elder scrolls or fallout but come on at least its something and from what they have shown so far im super hyped would be nice if you had a choice of what character to playor even change gender like mass effect but dont think so oh well at least its not another fallout game i love you bethesda take my money now garbage promo for a 2 year potential release my opinion 910 rage 2 creation club where i am looks like over the top nonsense like saints row it looks corny imo loved the 1st rage so well see what happens no texture popin right cant wait i love the colors going on cant wait to experience this in 4koled finally something to look forward to seeing id and avalanche is a big deal for me id is really good at making the core gameplay fun pacing fps and seamless on ground movement avalanche just puts the extra awesome into everything and have amazing environmental programmers although avalanche alone can make sometimes bland stories or open worlds this partnership should be great looks awesome bethesda has been releasing awesome games lately and i am excited for this even though i never played the first one i think i am surprisingly happy to not see tes xx i loved the first even though most didnt so excited thet their finally doing a second looks like a shitty sequel to a shitty game sad how publishers are unwilling to take a risk with developing a new ip clearly this just looks like another ubisoftflavoured openworld shitfest with a vaguelyborderlands coat of paint also this whole trailer is clearly prerendered and the actual gameplay is likely to be quite dull who could forget all the carracing shit from rage 1 id software should go back to their roots make something akin to dusk devil daggers or amid evil oh my lord this has avalanche and id working on it with bethesda welp time to upgrade my pc again make fallout 5 i would have loved to see how this game looked with id tech 6 engine still looks good though cant wait to get it buying it dont care about complainers whiners and crying babys i loved the first great premise that had no denying will love this too plus i like the borderland series as well xd rage 1 was really short im glad theyre making another i played the first rage im not sure why but there was something about it that made love it the game looks cool dont get me wrong but what about fallout 5 going to be keeping my eye on this one cant wait for this i remember playing rage all the time on ps3 and me and my brother playing coop missions so awesome hope its as good as fallout 4 fuck yeah i didnt expect this to happen looks a litle too borderlandy but im totally buying this almost makes me want to install the first game and give that a whirl again think ill wait for this one though lol post apocalyptic punk 3 loved the first rage this was a surprise i loved the first one open world games for some reason give headaches i was not excited about this until i heard the guys who made mad max were working with bethesda on this if fallout borderlands and mad max had a child wolfenstein doom quake and now rage whats next a new commander keen not gonna be as good as borderlands 3 but fuck ya still hyped for it lol i love you rage was my favorite game please add levels and perks 1 didnt really have that and it would change the gaming aspect a lot this looks sweet this would be my kind of game if it were 3rd person oh well i wish they would just release elder scrolls 6 this looks so fun finally a trailer that doesnt spoile the plot or story at all this looks like a solid game and since its not developed by bethesda it has a shot at not beeing a buggy mess also andrew wk is always a solid choice for all action based trailers but i detest the tone of the trailer and there is also the not so small problem that rage 1 was an unfinished disaster without and ending so far there are 10 guns in this game we know of 4 of them can deffinitely be used watch this have nothing connecting back to the first rage this isnt a gameplay trailer their gayass pink fucking hair is incentive enough for me to brutally murder them fallout meets mad max meets doom and i looove it ill admit i was hoping for tes vi but i cant say im disappointed this game looks fun as hell please dont fuck this up pls pls pls the boner this gave me is making it hard to type avalanche killed it with mad max and this looks a step above that i hope it has an ending unlike the first one will rage 2 be 4 player coop so sunset overdrive mixed with mad max i have a mad max i have borderlands ughghgh rage 2 apocalyptic doom yes so u guys gunna make another elder scrolls or nah showed this trailer to my husband his words were goodbye wife perhaps ill see you again someday is this suicide squad i want lan coop ive never played a rage game before but this ones looks really cool i dont know why people are saying its not good when it havent even released preordered and ready to rumble im glad rage is getting a sequel the first was an underappreciated but definitely flawed gem this looks nuts cant wait to throw those awesome wingsticks again i guess some people in this comment section are easy to impress looks meh probably anyother tech demo like the 1st rage fallout skyrim doom mad max all put in one noisy and annoying add in twitch fucking hate it what a beautifully crazy mess looking forward to see more details about this i want ir formal nintendo switch is it good be honest is it id software fpsshooting parts avalanche carracing parts insta game of the year anyone else really tired of this whiny new generation of gamers that deem everything shitty or generic when its literally the opposite by design this trailer was made to be overthetop you make yourself look like a fucking dumbass when you call it boring or whatever not like you have some sophisticated beautiful mind its embarrassing and people are laughing at you so please stop trailer was pretty good mad max and bulletstorm vibes all day overthetop shooters are the shit fuck this i demand bland movement so maybe those walmart leaks were right i must buy this crazy game got bored with the first one pretty fast but this looks way more interesting think i might be looking into this one so this is what todd was talking about fallout on crack i literally gave up on the idea of them making a sequel to rage the first rage has tons of potential but fell flat in story game play and the characters it is good to see that they are giving it a sequel and hopefully will improve the various issues the first one had it looks freaking fantastic though and completely insane xd the knife game better return character customization or dont care to play as a female the irony is that it is the present governments of the world that actually do the mass killing the story described here is socialist fear porn the opposite is true when people directly receive the consequences of their actions they are much more peaceful and loving towards each other because they want the same in kind the first one was boring waste of money i have to see reviews first holy fuck for the love of all of us please be a coop game whats name of that song thx good trailer hopefully the game is actually plays better then the first looks really fun pls dont use the papermach engine shit you used on rage 1 please let it be more like id tech 666 aka doom or wolfenstein engine for the love of god 3 i patiently waited for this game and never never gave up hope blew my fucking mind im buying this game just because you used an andrew wk song i know you probably wont bring it to switch but if you can please do that rage2 looks interesting going to see what reviewers think before i buy and learn what the gameplay loops are about but seems interesting mix of fallout and mad max i hope they keep some structure of the first game i really enjoyed it no matter what any shitty ass critic rated it to be honest i liked a little bit of rage but this looks like they fully embraced the insanity of the games setting loved the original rage but this seems a bit less serious and more cartoony still excited asf for ittttt my question is are there companions lol 5 fingers to the face where have i seen that before oh right destinys warlocks am i the only one seeing destiny movement animations the melee jumping shooting and special moves look like they were stripped right from destiny that former destiny employee from fallout 4 must of got one hell of a promotion doom gameplay fallout setting borderlands look trailer didnt impress me tbh but im definitely getting the game to support bethesda at least this shows that bethesda is not trying to rush out the elder scrolls 6 doom 2016 looked really amazing and played well too this is the reason i will get this game i dont get why every one hates on bethesda for minor shit you guys really must be fun at parties wtf this is gonna be the next big shooter after doom i can already tell this looks absolutely insane in all the best ways why arent they using the tech 6 engineseems strange dare i say it but this looks better than bo4 holy fuck a game jve been looking for the first one was so underrated it had super gunfights a really cool ambiance and yes the vehicle parts were kind of meh but overall it was a fun game the biggest downside was that it was way too short mostly in the second world as soon as you arrive there you barely start to get used to it that bang game over already as if they missed money to finish the game you used the word insanity wrong please just dont make a borderlands clone out of it rage was just fine without tons of jokes and stuff so hope thisll be good too borderlands confirmed please be more open world then the first and be more crowded with different sorts of enemies the first alls u could do really was kill bandits in ur car i hope u can explore on foot more the gameplay fits well with the superjail intro wasnt interested to begin with now im really not interested the only thing that gives me pause is the double jumping like a re skin cod this looks fucking awesome i loved the first game excited to play this one at 100fps on a 4k monitor my fucking ears i hope they remaster rage 1 for ps4 and xbox 1 oh wow as an unreal tournament player i can say this looks impressive i didnt play the first rage nor do i know what it is i see this has some arena style techniques which is automatically a plus on top of that is a beautiful environment with great textures and lighting i remember 2011 was underrated wtf this looks awesome im excited hopefully with the time gap between this and the first bethesda will know how to make this good i really hope there are plenty of indoors areas snipers and maybe some stealth holy shit thjs game is beautiful 0 cant freaking wait d i am very interested the first rage game was my favorite game of all time and im interested to see what this one is going to bring i love the fallout 4 dlc i was looking forward to borderlands 3 but since randy pitchford has his head up his ass im looking forward to rage 2 i love postapocalyptic shit and i love bethesda rage was an okay game i guess but nothing compared to fallout this trailer kinda gave me a mixed vibe of alot of games mad max borderlands destiny etc love the punk aesthetic aswell i do wonder how the gameplay will fair or how wellin depth the character creation is this looks fucking awesome fast paced gory action also the graphics seem really good too looks like fury roads oversaturated color paletteim in if its all right with you ill drive that tanker ohhhh im getting a big rageingsmile from this it about ing time fuck yes rage was my favorite game so glad the sequel finally got made this looks more like what the original rage shouldve been to begin with i hate it when game companies do this shit they put out a trailer for a game that looks like 100 done but then have it preorder ready and it comes out a literal year from now had to come back to watch this after that garbage bo4 reveal this trailer had more action than destiny 1 2 put together a massive disappointment for me the entire attitude and feel has changed maybe rather than marketing it as rage 2 they should name it something new cuz this is not what i expected at all edit still looks like fun tho give me fucking elder scroll 6 so much want i loved the first one okay when i first heard about the leaks i thought really a sequel no one wanted after seeing this gameplay im actually kinda excited not as excited as metro exodus but at least as excited as far cry 5 fallout from the point of view of the raiders lol for the people saying it doesnt look as serious as the first look at the first part of the trailer and the first one had mutant bash tv explosive rc cars jokes sprayed on the walls gangs with the uk flag on their faces so cool i cant wait i liked the first one well enough will definitely support this because we need more of those in between games so rage 2 seems to hold no similarities to its original its now about superpowers large scale conflicts and being openworld no longer a story driven fps with minor rpg elements with a hub bassis not anly that but it feels like they completely scraped that western ascetic and were the hell is the athority this no rules talk sounds like the authority is not even gana be a thing and they were the bug bad we never even finished duking it out with gameasaservice boycott this shit or you will never be able to buy and own a game again fuck bethesda reminds me a bit of max max love the style this looks wayyyyyy better than the first game look great maybe ill go with this while wating for bl3 hopefully the combat is done right game looks awesome man all these bethesda games look the same doom wolfenstien now rage 2 exactly the same with a slight skin job run gun and jump please give rage 2 an fov slider on pc and consoles this time around party til you puke cringe song choice that doesnt sync very well with the first 40 second buildup megadeth symphony of destruction or testament practice what you preach as long as the ai isnt dumb af i never realized we needed a new rage watching this awesome piece got me on board you bet millennials all around are wondering what rage is all about and if it has a battle royale mode you ruined rage fuck you this better be not that driving needlessly long hey fix the first one on pc bethesda then ill try the second one hope we can be more free than the first game and btw the first one wasnt that good run this is what fallout 4 could have been i wonder if its a continuation of the first rage or a lite reboot i always remembered rage as grittier and darker borderlands i want to see how borderlands 3 competes with this wow borderlands 3 looks amazing i loved rage but it definitely blended into the other generic brown postapoc games glad to see theyre embracing the madness this time around open world shooter with no paid early access no loot boxes no micro transactions and a dark postapocalypse theme hype im so in so basicly this is what fallout nuka world should have been wow all the top comments from yesterday that had even the tiniest hint of criticism have been removed sarah hagar is thicc tho oh shit avalanche is delevoping it fallout 4 doom rage 2 fine video always keep creating highquality content and you can get bigger very quickly subscribe to our channel and so we could subscribe to your channel does anyone know if this has coop if it has at least 4 player coop for me this is an instant buy if rage2 doesnt have an fov slider when it comes out imma be soo pissed i have to be honest i cringed hard at the announcement trailer so much so that it put me off this game but after watching this trailer i have to say im hyped holy shit this looks like a bastard child of doom borderlands fallout and mad max its officially on my list of games to get i cant wait for this i know the multiplayer is gonna be amazing ive al walked the mad max type vibe this game gives me hope it doesnt have a shit ending like the 1st i really want to be exited for this truly honestly so but my head screams look its a new borderlands from bethesda when i watch this its been to long old friend as long as you can still strafe jump arround with pop rockets this is going to be fun its looking good i never hated the first one i just didnt like the lack of an end game looks very different from the first one hopefully itll be a bit more compelling than the last and not quite as quirky as the trailer paints it just dont fuck up the ending like you did last time bethesda i have faith need it more and his penis grew 3 times that day i hope its better than rage one of course it will rage 1 was shit its like if the people who made suicide squad doing a mad max game ok some hope restored after that trailer yesterday id tech 6 is improved by leaps and boundsas doom and wolfenstein 2 were somewhat linearlets see how this game engine fares on open world fallout 5 i liked the first rage but it was a bit light on content hopefully bethesda will create a large robust open world ive never played rage 1 can someone do an summary what happend in rage 1 this game looks over the topstupid as shit and ridiculous in all the best ways this gameidk at first glance it really just looks like fallout but with only raiders also will this be fps only dam this is dope thought they wpuld finish on the first ons theyve also got another year to work on it if were not getting a borderlands 3 this year then this game will do andrew wk is my fucking dude i always thought rage was a promising ip that didnt quite realize its potential definitely interested in this game wow i was just joking when i said to myself rage 2 is definitely coming out this year loooks awesome anyone know the price why bethesda not using their resources focus on doom sequel instead i was hoping for more serious stalker like tonedamn another disappointment post apo fps for me better be longer than the 1st game holy shit this looks fun unlike the first one will wait for game hope its gud can we stop comparing this game with other games and judging it before even playing it last time this happened there was nothing left but a big ugly shitstorm of completely uneeded hatred and delusion atleast thats what happened to battleborn so stop it and watch with an open mind until it comes out so bulletstorm 2 this honestly doesnt look like anything special going to be super repetitive and looks like many games that weve already playedseen i actually liked the first one wow looks amazing i enjoyed the first one so i cant wait to get my hands on this kinda looks like fallout meets mad max man the new mad max game looks great tes6 are we sure this is a sequel to rage the game from bethesda released in 2011 this looks absolutely amazing would never have guessed rage 2 would look this good eeeeeeeeeerrrrrrr why are we doing this interesting that this one is distinctly more punky than 1 have i ever told you the definition of insanity all aboard the hype train woot woot what kind of borderlands is this haha just joking it looks insane is just me or this trailer would go so amazingly with this song instead saves sockets if you put two tads one with the trailer and one with the music put the volume on the trailer half for the sound effects and the music high fucking sick pls someone make that it would be fucking dope ooohhh shit i been waiting on this trash do not disappoint us please have this be the epic rewarding as hell fun as hell open world game we have been craving for sooooo long well im most definitely interested but since bethesda claimed it was hell on earth time im pretty pissed off that theres no doom 2 yet because lets be honest rage will never be as good as doom id avalanche you have my attention the first game was a blast its like borderlands please thats the same crap that was said about the first rage is it me or is it fell like destiny doomfallout 4madmax looks pretty fucking sick i hope there will be at least some vehicle customization we all knew that the original rage was made to fund this one thank you to all the teams that made it happen this is how shooter looks like when its not made by bethesda v in case you guys are new to the rage series and didnt play the first one its backwards compatible at least on xbox and is in the xbox store for like 20 bucks highly recommend and think it was severely under rated does anyone have an idea how the first one was is it worth a playthrough i see a lot of fallout in this hopefully thats true starts violently masturbating im interested and hope its good such a great twist of expectations hype hopefully coop and has good customization madmax is this you does this game have super powers it looked like he just blew up that poor boy by just waving his hand at 057 not into fps but i am interested in background lore player choice factions things you can do besides fighting npcs a rich story mods this is from a gamer who likes bethesda openworld rpgs nice tes vi will never be made thanks todd howard and we know theyre not making the game which vault does this start in i thought this day would never come the first rage might be the most underrated video game of all time its still better than 2016 doom where is blake griffin nobody wanted this can you imagine if this has a battle royale mode i hope theres no downgrade what a day what a lovely day i loved rage hope this one is just as good did they even play the first game hey bethesda no one wants mad max 2 but we did all this work bethesda ok but we have to call it rage 2 nice to see a postapocalyptic game that doesnt take place exclusively in a desert wasteland i played the shit out of the first rage and loved every second of it give it up for todd howard for a awesome come back from the first rage yes please and nice to see avalance studios back to why am i getting a devil may cry feel while watching this trailer anyway still hyped for this game i want it now the new borderlands 3 looks great fuck yeah cant wait fallout the first rage sucked noodles got the limited edition for 3 and i still felt ripped off a woman as the face of the game what a burping surprise does anyone know if this is going to have multiplayer co op and be kind of a mmo will there be any multiplayer aspect my nuts are hard doesnt matter if it doesnt support vr i cannot go back to pancake gaming anymore even when the game is great it just sucks because its not vr looks like another generic open world shooter 410 gameplay the graphics look like ps3 era graphics 110 graphics anyways rockstar is the king of open world games and bethesda should trying to copy them they are trying so hard to be rockstar they even released elder scrolls online to compete with gta online elder scrolls and fallout will never compete with gta and red dead rockstar is just so much bigger and better leave open world games to them holy sht its like if mad max fallout and little borderlands smashed together i want it is this just another fallout game or is there multiplayer to this music is from andrew wk party till you puke avalanche studios must be behind the vehicular ombat looks like mad maxs gameplay so someone else besides me actually bought that andrew wk album who knew i feel a tingling in my loins i still remember the first rage all the e3 love and none of the payoff better quash that hype and start putting out some substance bethesda because theres way too many games i could otherwise be playing is it just me or does this look totally bad ass never played the first but i may give this one a shot looks like borderlands had a baby with fallout so got rid of the feel of the original rage in favor of a sjw anarchist version of mad max ill pass ya done good with doom just not thisthing looks like a generic garbage mix of rage borderlands destiny and mad max the mad max team was even working on this and mad max sucked hard expectations 0 when is it going to realise i wanted something new not borderlands 3 why is there a pretrailer trailer just play one trailer and stop insulting my attention span anyone else kinda underwhelmed by that gameplay the colors looks bleh the graphics seem kinda dated the animation is wonky and kinda stuff hopefully im wrong i know im being unrealistic but this sparked my hope for a quake wars 2 yes thanks for making a sequel andrew wk playing made twice as cool so uh wheres the gameplay looks like the love child of doom and mad max psa this game isnt made by bethesda just published by them doesnt mean it will be any worse just making sure you know switch version come on im in i guess i need to go back and finish the first one now no fucking thanks the first rage was mediocre though excited for a sequel finally coming outsad that it looks it will play just like doom just give me more of the original im ok w this minus the cater to 16 yo feel also has as sucide squad influence in the characters first rage was 60 fps on both ps3 and xbox360 hopefully 2nd one will be the same whats with bethesda and their narrow fov whos laughing now todd howard rated rp ive been seeing this as an ad on every video and every time i think its borderlands 3 my penis has never been this erect before please send help im scared hopefully customizable armors and items because in a world that has no rules creativity is everything then jokes are going to hit this trailer this looks like mad max on acid everything you see in the trailer is whats in the gamethats it nothing else just you killing stuff without plot i miss when borderlands use to have that cartoonish look can we get a rage remaster with preorder or something id love to revisit before hopping into 2 i actually loved the first one thought it was what fallout should have been i am so happy they made a second pumped as a mufucka looks awesome just from the trailer and then you think that its open world mayhem by avalanche with gunplay by id oh sorry i have to go to the bathroom long live bethesda and its singleplayergames rage 2 looks awesome and its like a mix of borderlands fallout madmax and doom what is the definitions of insanity rage 2 motion blur and failing to even hit 30 fps way to advertise should have been third person we need more third person online games if doom and borderlands had a baby im buying mad max on lysergic acid diethylamide with a little bit of far cry still in the fence my wallet is saying no but my inner wasteland psycho says yes please a lot of fallout 4 and doom vibes haha love it please dear god be single player focused trailer looks solid i hope the game feels good to play and is well optimized this is kinda disappointing i liked rage but it was more serious than this this looks way too over the top this looks awesome omfg yes this is fucking awsome hope people will enjoy this but as is becoming increasingly the case over the last few years this too is a pass cant wait for the battle royale mode this needs vr support destiny infinite fallout looks great i feel like the first rage game was highly underrated so its awesome to see bethesda making another one sexually aroused stop worrying people this is coming 2019 and elder scrolls 6 will come out fall 2018 book it this game is a disgrace for the genre a zero depth mainstream shit game tailored for mainstream audience who loves playing fortnine league of legends and other carcinogenic games and whose attention span is that of a three year old this game embodies a lot of whats wrong with todays gaming culture as usual for games like this one it will spike in popularity on youtube with fun gameplay moments videos containing attempts to be edgy and memeful as well as containing a lot of obnoxiously autistic screaming from all these popular and wanna be popular youtubers oh how glad am i to be a gamer of the past generation i wouldve liked this a lot better under a different name and they really need to decide on a setting the neon escape from new yorkesque setting looks so mismatched with the apocalyptic desert and that looks even more mismatched with the lush green forests i wouldve preferred if the bulk of the game just consisted of the city bits we saw fallout5 im really looking forward to this considering how the original looked so well original that and it was ids first true original series besides doom and quake rage was underrated also andrew wk am i right avalanche is probably the best studio possible for this im stoked looks way different than the first one but still looks amazing doom with open world on lsd is this game open world like fallout cmon son i wanna play this so badly basically borderlands without the cartoon graphics hey bethesda are you taking notes was hoping they would focus less on the driving since that was the worst part of the original i want a realistic real life game where you can literally sit on a grass field and pass around a joint to your buddys then you can go shoot some guns and do what every you want im tired of game devs trying to push the limits with video games because theyre doing it in all the wrong places i bet you if they made and ultra realistic free roaming game similar to gta but better i bet everyone would play it game devs are fuckin up i hope rdr2 meets my expectations fallout borderlands mad max doom rage 2 this is going to be amazing all i have to say is its about damn time never trust gameplay scenes when there is no hud hmmm i hope it has a cool postapocalyptic story like the original did that was the best part for me it was more mad max this looks more like doom looking forward to seeing more trailers and gameplay sweet baby in a manger jesus eh i dont know i was expecting something more like mad max that was a good game i dont like all this crazy stuff lets see this is unnecessary rage 1 should of ended the way it was i feel like the polychromatic light show just takes away the apocalyptic aspect of the first one ok my disappointment that it wasnt fallout new orleans or a new proper elder scrolls is officially over this looks like doom fallout sunset overdrive call me officially hyped edit maybe not so much like sunset overdrive but i really got one of the same vibes i got from playing it i think its the music and over the top action loved the first rage always felt it was underrated missed by allot of people ok so i was buying it regardless but this trailer didnt answer one super important question will there be wingsticks yes yes yes woo hoo i loved the first rage and i was hoping for a sequel i lost hope over time but now i can rejoice cant wait looks cool fov is awful and made me wanna vomit but other than that seems good im so hard right now no thanks plot twist this is actually a creation club mod for skyrim looks a lot like fo4 with better graphics and vehicles looks epic reminds me of borderlands avalanche studios made just cause and the 2015 mad max game which was fucking awesome excited that theyre working on this its like if doom and mad max had a baby with borderlands as the surrogate borderlands without cell shading i can dig it looks better than the first can i pay you for it now cant wait cant wait rage 1 was disappointingwhy is there a sequel who asked for thiholy shit why does it look so good if the gunplay is as tight as it is in the first rage im hyped not a fan mute this fucking annoying music lets hope this time it will have a better and more complex ending than last time i hate when they put driving in shooters pass first game was great this looks amazing lets hope its just as long whats the song yessss when rage 1 came out me and my best friend played the hell out of it we love rage i cannot wait for 2 avalanche the people behind just cause they know about blowing shit up ill trust it just because avalanche you had my full attention until i saw wide open world appear on screen how game breaking glitches do you guys think there will be at launch awe fuck yes im buying 2 copies postapocalyptic vaas 033 thank you it my birthday and this is my dream first rage was decent i guess but i didnt expect them to make a sequel i hope they can get it better this time around ive been waiting soooo long im so excited looks very cinematic for me beyond 30 fps xd fuck yeah although i hope its more stable and optimized than the first game the first one came out in 2011 i really wasnt expecting this but im cool with pre order immediately plebhesda might be onto something but im betting the game will be filled with shit ton of bugs at launch thats it im gonna have to fire up the first rage and play it all the way through now game looks so amazing i can not wait hope pc performance is good soo when will fallout new orleans release ea singleplayer games are no longer popular bethesda hold my beer d wow this looks so ridiculously boring this game is for school shooters give us elder scrolls or fallout looks retarded and aimed at wannabe edgy kiddos pass dude im a huge fan of the first game and man ive been waiting for a sequel since de day that a finished the first onebut this looks like the son of an orgy between mad max borderlands doom quake even fallout and it looks aweasome looks like destiny with a mad max skin ill pass to those who buy this have fun looks boring and generic the motion blur at 126 is making me physically sick who thought of ever implementing that critics of rage 1 the colors are too bland bethesda softworks just a sec time passes critics of rage 2 there are too many colors its like fallout and doom had a baby and that baby got pissed off and fucking ate mad max i loved this game on 360 bout time they made another you know its a bethesda game when even the gameplay trailer has framerate drops why is the fov so slim looks pretty good actually i know its just a trailer but still rage 2 is what i imagined it supposed to be the borderlands meets mad max vibe minus the cel shaded art oh yeah thats what im talking about finaly a sequal i realy enjoyed the first one omg omg omg omg omg omg omg wow shtb this looks fun as hell avalanche has only made stellar truly massive games since the dawn of time read just cause 2 ids involvement basically guarantees great shooting mechanics and boy oh fk boy those graphics from the special effects so much sexy dof and particles to the insane textures are far and away the best thing ive ever seen looks like something that would only be possible on whatever the next generation of consoles are welp this is my most wanted game this year now thanks beth please let the actual game have as much dof as was in the trailer at least on pc and the enhanced consoles im begging ya cheers mademyday we live in an age where they edit the work fucking yet show peoples heads exploding anywhoo cant wait to play it the first one was too short this looks like a better version of avalanches mad max game whats the song playing in the background being a og rage player i cant wait for this game so its bulletstorm with cars you can ground punch consider this game bought where is skyrim 2 graphics look nice but this looks like a halfbaked borderlands ripoff blood but no gore explosions but no destruction current gen games have been taking too many steps backwards woah the new borderlands looks great keep it up activision looks fun rage had a lot of potential but hopefully this game is better polished and fleshed out looks like a mix of doom and old fallout hopefully too this becomes bethesdas new postapoc shooter and fallout can go back to being an rpg i wanna play this now this looks like the mad max game its also from the same devs this game has to be amazing with coop mode seems like its just an amped up fallout so bethesda open world architecture combined with id first person shooter game play match made in gaming heaven why does this look worse than the first rage game visually this looks like mad maxdoom had a baby if this can deliver epic vehicle combat and shooting mechanics of both this is an instant buy i see so much potential bethesda beat gearbox to borderlands 3 wait they modded borderlands into doom i really like the 35 horseblinders field of vision in this game this didnt give me aids lets hope this isnt another 5 hour long open world game with an extremely horribly bad pc port just can not fucking wait i regret selling my special edition rage copy for ps3 but now ill have 2 to make up for it and my ps3 broke anyway lmao ready to die andrew wk sound in trailer yeah wish it used id tech engine but oh well gonna have to wait after release before buying because as gamers seem to never learn trailers never and never will represent the real game does everyone play games for the story or what games are for the gameplay so many people complain about the original story but honestly if i want a good story i watch a movie i play games for the gameplay and a good story is welcome too but i dont get caught up in it unless its amazing i have to get through the next bit just for the story like bioshock it the metal gear games always had great stories but what keeps me going is if the gameplay is so tight i can just keep playing it over and over like halo combat evolved or super mario 64 forza horizon og splinter cell banjo kazooie half life 2 and so on and so on what im getting at is play games cause u can watch a movie cause u cant play them ah this looks like actual gameplay footage and not prerendered like every trailer for aaa games in the past few years good job yall jesus thats gonna be one huge single texture is that fallout 5 andrew wk party till you puke if anyone wants to know the song orgasm everytime the rock track kicks in i loved rage 1 it was an old school shooter at the time when everyone was trying to be cod well until the last mission that had annoying car combat section and that ending yayyy cant wait its been soo long since the first one came out pls tell me its powered id tech 6 that engine was so smooth in doom will it be like fallout 4 o where da hell is alucard where the fuck is fallout looks pretty great i know this isnt an id game but it looks a lot like doom in the best way possible i dont intend on preordering since it has never yielded good results but this looks very promising please let this have mod support is it co op though single player only this day in age is pretty poor unless its something like the witcher 3 but open world games are made for co op like ghost recon farcry5 and the like the main reason why i bought a ps4 holy fuck this looks like a combination of doom and kinda falloutish fucking great i need to slam a dew like now shout out to the og rage 1 fans thats how you release a sequelnot once every fucking yearbe like bethseda i hope bethesda dont fuck this up like they did with fallout 4 now thats a video game trailer ill give it a shot why not this looks amazing what is that fucking fov and motion blur and 30fps i dunno it looks a bit too scifi for me still waiting on my dream game an open world first person last of usfallout hybrid looks like mad max first person shooter better fill this wide open world of yours this time around first game looked and played beautiful but we had little to do on it not to mention the abrupt ending all the dislikes cause people wanted elder scrolls vi or fallout 5 when in reality this isnt even a bethesda game studios game lol im glad they are making a sequel i loved the first game i remember playing it when it first came out and getting stuck in dead city yo can we get like a 60fps trailer looks juvenile as shit more arent we so wacky and random try hard nonsense i bet you have to play as one of those pinkhaired tumblr cunts haters go hate but this looks like what borderlands could have become if they used the first graphics that was demoed mixed with there is existing color pallet i got a doomfarcry feel coming from this new installment doom combat with a mad max open world yes please if doom borderlands mad max and fallout all had a baby this would be their baby whats with the the 80s vibe looks fun sick and dynamic thanks ps grabbing popcorn to watch piggered bethesda fanboys who demand tes vi and dislike this trailer just because its not tes vi hey so are you able to join a clan or what ever like fallout4 rage was really good but this looks amazing o who asked for this the last time i checked this wasnt a very beloved or even very liked game back in 2010 they are rage brutal without mercy but you you will be rage 2 its been a while sins i play the original rage it was cool but this looks cool please make a it couch coop friendly open world doom this looks awesome im getting a borderlands bulletstorm vibe from this game that alone makes me wanna buy it it also looks nothing like the original mad max doom expected but with a mix of rainbow and happy apocalypse apparently now lol the colors and tone vaguely reminded me of the tone of sunset overdrive not comparing gameplay just saying all the happy colors reminded me of a similar style the first games art style had nothing wrong with it whats the meaning of this to ride the coattails of borderlands well then holy fuckknuckles finally a bethesda open world game with vehicles id avalanche im hard af lighting and color grading looks realistic i hope that doesnt change they better show those guys robbing some old loral warehouse bc i dont know how else would they get all these fucking hair colors in postapo world you have my attention fallout 5 looks great awesome that they added vehicles back in finally yes i know this isnt fallout nor team howard related i played the original rage it was okay the visuals kinda look nextgen to sort of speak i dont know if its the improved lighting shadowing textures or all of the above but it looks really good its looks like if mass effect andromeda and call of duty had a retarded baby avalanche avalanche ava avalanche holy shit no wonder im getting mad maxjust cause vibes this look like fallout 5 interesting i could only think of mad max and doom combine and turn it into something beyond badass af this is how you make a game its fallout meets doom meets mad max meets asphalt 8 i also think this is how fallout should have been as a huge fan of the first rage im honestly kinda disappointed in this one the graphics look retarded im so sick of this cartoony forniteoverwatch bullshit its a post apocalyptic game not fucking disney channel second it looks like theres no depth to this whatsoever its just a bunch of nameless enemies that you can mindlessly shoot and blow up it looks fucking retarded right off the get go rage as dated as it may be was creepy immersive intensebut in a more holy shit i need to get to fucking cover or gtfo of here instead of mindless piss poor combat and most importantly interesting there was something going on but it felt natural not forced unless their is a lot more depth andor darkness to this i can guarantee it wont last more than a month the first one took itself to seriously and lacked anything to set itself apart besides solid gunplay this looks fast and fun day 1 buy shut up and take my money borderlands 4 confirmed this is how to redo an ip rage 1 wasnt bad at all looking forward for this game maybe a game worth of playing so many games are completely crap nothing can be as bad as the ending to the first game so at least theres that pls dont read comments you might get brain cancer i didnt knew i wanted this now i do give it to me please preorder for me without korean subtitles bethesda does not sell much in korea i hope there are more guns that resemble ones from the first games and i hope there is more close quarters indoor combat like in the first game first game was fun if a little underwhelming but if this one allows me to blast through missions with wing sticks and explosive shotgun shells like a badass wasteland harbinger of death again im totally keen hell yeah im interested i wonder if well be able to customise our character surely a game with this much wacky freedom and spectcular scrap bling has customisation options who needs rage 2 if stalker 2 comes out so shoot kill repeat a slightly more realistic art style borderlands ok i thought it was with the dinosaurs forgive me omg the first rage had incredible potential and one of the best shooting mechanics of all time so i am very glad this game gets a second chance open world rage was such an odd and unique game it felt like borderlands except more mad max i didnt care about the plot and the gameplay was boring but im hopeful for this game seeing as doom 4 was kick ass im not expecting another doom but im expecting something fun at the dry least i dont how but they made me hyped for a game that i wanted nothing to do with good on you bethesda that game rage 2 is going to become a disappointment when it releases i dont care about tes or fallout this actually looks promising its practically gonna be an open world doom im all for that mad max oded on steroids and hard rock why companies still make under 60fps trailers is mind boggling its the current year 60fps or gtfo one thing that raises a red flag for me though is that avalanche isnt a fps dev and this is a huge first for them the field of view in this trailer is absurdly low even just watching passively i really really hope that it was just for this trailer and even then why it actively obscures the action to the point where its worse off never have i seen a game so deserving of the andrew wk music for its trailers bring on the rage it looks like a colorful hipster abomination with probably sjw content and retardation culture lol ill wait for ion maiden not gonna lie very disappointed we were expecting another es or fallout not another mad max game in addition to things like mad max and borderlands im getting some serious sam vibes from this too avalance id and bathesda partytilyoupuke name of the song from the middle is andrew wk party till you puke need 4 coop in this game waiting for quake 5 trying way too hard with the wacky lol xd shit im sure the gameplay is great though but that reveal trailer was fucking horrible i will buy this if there is alot of cars that you can drive plus a good character customization but rage was so disappointing woah i was not expecting these comments to be this positive anyways this game looks fucking rad id and avalanche sounds like the best combination ever needs more motion blur and other effects because i can still make out whats happening this crap no one asked for looks feels and smells like doom looking forward to it is this singleplayer multiplayer coop the site is kinda useless for a game you are trying to sell i feel like im one of the only people who has been waiting for this sequel i loved the first one but it ended in what felt like the exact middle point of the game i was sad this is just a pure open world fps like just cause do what you want when you want however you want if done right this will be endless fun like doom looks super fun but it seems they have used a lot of resources from fallout 4 this honestly looks like the game i have been looking foran insane open world game with elements of mad max fallout doom and the original rage i feel this is what the first game was meant to be like and im one of the people who really enjoyed the first one im ready to rage will it have mod support interested in knowing more about this game watch eso httpsyoutubeuplaqmd8by fps open world race rage 2 hype creepin up on me rage was one of the most underrated games of last gen although a bit short the art style and character design is unrivaled that said i think this neon design is corny as hell looking like 2008 green day hot topic punk while the original had a grittier mad max authentically distressed look i hope its good i hope it has story i think open worlds are a boring gimmick that need to go the way of the quick time event i really like mad max game and i really like doom game just amazing cant wait and i already know this isnt disappointing because look who develops this game is this a new form of serious sam d this looks like the less shitty version of destiny 2 i cant wait for this game to come out this reminds me of sunset overdrive if anyone even remembers that game lol 044 is that rick from rick and morty well i guess battle royale mode is confirmed this is the most retarded shit ive ever seen yesfinally yes this is what ive been waiting for the first rage game was fun and now i am looking forward for the second one to continue the main story nice work d new fallout game looks great i think they spelled doom 2 wrong but honestly it does look better than how the first rage turned out it seemed they didnt really know which direction they wanted to go with the first one i had a feeling it would be a bethesda borderlands not a bad combo in my opinion thats it for borderlands 3 i guess they waited far too long for it rage 2 looks more like bl3 to me too late gearbox sure this isnt borderlands 3 please dont be garbage like the first one this is like snorting speed and playing bulletstorm sunset overdrive and fallout 4 all at the same time while having a drug induced fever dream i really hope its gonna do well multiplayer rage 2 id software should have developed doom ii reboot look at the colors omg actually pretty dope looking lets see your pressure ps4 pro handle this game xbox one x all day mad max with color rage was a huge mess of bugs and crashes hoping this one is actually playable bet its going to be a destiny clone well this will be my single player game battlefield being revealed also will be my multiplayer i think cod i will wait ohh and atomic heart i have interested in my soviet union friends i didnt think this game would ever receive a sequel good job bethesda you actually caught me off guard for once this game shouldnt call itself a sequel of rage i get it pubg fortnite borderlands are taken but try harder for the title i have my doubts but this looks good very im guessing avalanche is doing most of the heavy lifting on this game while id is working on the doom sequel either way i cant wait rage was an underappreciated gem i loved the first one this looks really fun too like a mix of mad max and the best parts of bulletstorm fallout 4 20 version 666 aw man first one had some cool atmosphere it was almost eerie and spooky definitely still getting it i just hope they dial down the whacky stuff i wouldnt want a repeat of sunset overdrives too cool for school man attitude the first page was kinda bad but this one looks promising mad maxs developers are the team developing the game it just works why couldnt they wait until e3 still shouldve waited to show all of this despite the leak looks promising buy maybe they should try to keep the visual style of the original this one looks to borderlands for my taste youre a fucking brainlet if you think bethesda made this game game was shit back then hell fucking yes if the gameplay is actually what the trailer shows then im in god that fucking fov put melee weapons in or u hav no ballz avalanche studios pretty much just cause vs mad max wait they made mad max as well ok so just cause vs mad max vs doom i sense a doom and fallout 4 mixture here maybe more so fallout if its called rage 2 and it has rc car bombs sentry bots and monster trucks im in also only to entertain you other game namers this looks like it has some bio shock and halo 3 in it that looks fantastic cant wait d the first one was full of bugs and felt unfinished here people are already ready to preorder just cause of some fake gameplay good for you fallout with waayyy better graphics and shooting mechanics i dont like how they trying so hard to make this game like fun dont get me wrong it likes fun but i dont like the fact that they gave the character powers ive been waiting 5 years for this andrew wk the game if this is co op im 10000 sold its so different the first rage was dark and this is like doom had sex with fallout love it bethesda pleaseplease dont make this like the last rage were begging you please please dont screw this up i want it now reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee andrew wk really made this trailer i played the first onesure it wasnt that goodbut hot damn guys give it a fucking chance people come on this looks like its gonna be fucking awesome id software and avalanche studios shut the fuck up and take my money i enjoyed rage when it came out for the last gen consoles it was a fast pace shooter with tons of different enemies to fight pretty good story although sometimes forgot about the objective alot the ending of rage left me with a whole bunch of questions and it kinda sucked that it ended like that im happy to see rage 2 is gonna have everything that rage one needed to get back on my must play list open world is where they got me i wanted that this is fallouts and dooms love child here open world doom 2016 yeah i can get down with that you got me at big fing guns now we wait so nobody is gonna point out that this is the borderlands 3 weve been waiting for im more of a falloutskyrim guy but rage 1 was pretty good ill be eager to try the next one looks amazing and i wish there was not such a long wait for the release fuuuck this dude even if the game turns out to be decent which im sure it wont be due to the failure of the first rage this trailer is complete trash and utter laziness they gave me no story or set up any premise of the game and instead showed me a minute and a half of a doom looking rip off of random gameplay you could literally put the title to any game in the end of this and it would be applicable because of how vague and shitty this trailer is this should have never been revived 2 player coop downward thrust eat your heart out its like boarderlands and doom had sex and abandon it to mad max and raised the bastard this trailer hypes me up everytime love the color in this dystopian environment what is this song too i need it this reminds me a lot about bulletstorm thats a good sign i remember the cool blade frisbees that fucked anyone that got hit with them listen im interested but who was asking for this after the first one i mean no disrespect but seriously who i hope they add a cockpit cam this time rage was awesome now bethesda you fucked up with wolf ii rage was almost pure fun with superb ai for its time and you described this as insane which triggered poor old patrick klepek well this shit better be as insane as you describe and i want no bullshit that comes close to what machine games did looks good hopefully the code and game are optimized and on par with the recent doom game give first game free or demo of rage 2 hmmmm already doesnt really suit me but i hope im wrong graphics look shit and gameplay also looks shit this game kinda reminds me of bulletstorm that game was underrated is there coop damn i remember playing the first game back in like 2012 and i loved it cant wait to see what this new one is like 3 will there be a fallout 5 hell yeah yells in an australian accent its time for some mayhem giggles crazily no switch version damn you put skyrim wolfenstien and doom but i am crying right now i hope it has some kickass multiplayer cause it sure looks like it has potentialloved the first game by the way i think i had my first orgasm just now hell yes looks like a hell of a good time first was awesome insanity rulessssssss fuck yeah much excited the first one was so much fun and underrated i can see they brought back those boomerang things or wingsticks lmao this shouldnt even exist im so buying it i like the whole its not serious stop giving a shit vibe this has fallout and doom had a baby cant wait give it to panic button and port it to switch keep that tone and you will have me hooked that being said i want to see legit gameplay vids before i even look at this purchase wise okay i might be a little moist right now bruh i liked the first one even thoe it was no slapper but this one its gonna be a banger bruh on god 001 is this some kind of psionic power or high tech weapon will there be a nintendo switch version this looks interesting but i hope this isnt their center piece at e3 after watching trailer never heard of borderlands 3 but all i know is im getting this game well the first one was a day one buy and this looks no different thanks bethesda you made a grown mans dreams come true off the charts cant wait to get another solid shooter looks like another boring game without any storyline holy shit awesome im surprised theyre making a sequel since the first game got middling reviews looking forward to this one ahhh ive been waiting along time for rage 2 rage was my life as a kid looks like that leaked walmart upcoming games list wasnt fake borderlands without cell shading doom okay i was worried that rage 2 would be more of the same as the original but the fact that avalanche studios is working on it gives me hope after all they know how to do kinetic crazy gunplay and explosions just cause series especially 3 plus given that they did mad max a few years ago shows there will be a vast improvement in the car combat portion of the game something we can all agree was lackluster in rage what if doom and rage are connected god damn im starved for some car combat more like doom x mad max x fallout x borderlands looking great i didnt like the glam punk they advertised with but it seems the general theme of the oringinal rage is still there just needs a lot more depth another shallow open world will do it in for open world games so please be deep and full of personality keep all those mini games add more give us good characters lots of ways to interact make shit we do have an impact please just fix all the things they did wrong with the first it seriously has potential wow the new borderlands is looking great the first one is one of the best games ive ever played i cant wait for this one curious how the story will pick up its trying to hard to be like borderlands rage was a great game in 2012 one of my most played now it seems like a fuck fest of colors and shooting it was a scary game now it seems to be straying away from that dont get me wrong im still gonna play it but this is my initial thought but who knows maybe they will still toss in the horror aspect of the muties and shit i loved the first rage despite its inconsistencies i never thought id get to play the intended sequel to what was a promising new franchise due to the lukewarm response to the original thank you bethesda for continuing to publish great shooters from passionate devs in the words of the wasted clan fuck yeah about god damn time this is a game that must be play in pc i really hope it has 219 support trick me once shame on you trick me twice well i wont let you this to me looks like a mix of doom and sunset overdrive dope did anyone ask for this any one think bethesda net is gonna be in it are u going to play as a bunch of women against male soldiers not sure but sounds like a bit sjw im starting to wonder if the starfield trademark bethesda has is for dlc for this game asteroids space rpg hmmm ive watched this about 10 times i love how it looks cant wait this art style looks like a clusterfk of ideas i guess its supposed to be grunge like tank girl meets tank girl but it just doesnt work for me the dissonance between the browns and oranges with the neon colors just looks intentionally gaudy in addition the heavy use of post processing makes for an image that will either look completely different when the game comes out or make for a playing experience that requires a barf bag sorry to be a wet blanket if you think this looks like for thing enjoy it first game was okay fun gunplay with some weird tackedon vehicle sections that didnt feel quite right and an interesting world with an underwhelming story it lacked much of an identity of its own and was pretty generic in many ways because it was literally made from the leftovers of what was once supposed to be doom 4 with that said no one asked for this im shocked this is even happening but looking at what theyve done this actually looks really good ironically its like weve gone full circle but in the best way imaginable we got doom 2016s engine buttery smooth frame rate and general feel mixed with the personality of borderlands as opposed to a slightly more serious fallout kind of direction from the previous game and then finely tuned with the apparent utility and fun that bulletstorm wishes it could have had this random jumble of shit coming together actually looks like it works maybe bethesda can pull through with a surprise sequel that blows the o this game is going to be amazing and i cannot wait to play it all i ask is that the ending doesnt suck you can play coop2 player story mode beating the game doesnt mean the game is overmore shit to do after the story is over and the death race car is still in it from rage 1 do that and its a 1010 just like the first one would have been if it had all this stuff pretty similar to fallour doesnt convince me looks pretty good played the original and i thought it was decent but i honestly was hoping bethesdas big reveal would be a doom sequel doom was fuckin siiiiiick i was hoping for elder scrolls 6 looks fun to me my biggest complaint in the first game was the lack of or terribly implemented multiplayercoop but it looks like they fixed that now looks good as long as theres no denuvo third party launchers loot boxes or microtransactions i might buy it is it multiplayer tho let the rage begin so its fallout x doom with vehicles cant be worse than fallout 4 take my fucken money i liked the first one i really hope they didnt fvck up this one i hope it has a new game option this looks quite encouraging the tone seems very different from the first game despite a very similar artistic direction in a world were textures didnt load properly now if we could just combine this gameplay with fallouts rp aspects and modability so doom and far cry had a babie then was raised by mad max me ok this game seems fun me when sees bethesda logo nope and somehow there going to fucking this up with thousands of micro transactions fuck yes i was holding my breath for another rage medicore kidding i wants it nobody careeeesssss soooo a borderlands clone with doom style runngun im down less than zero expectations for this game first one was underwhelming and bethesda has slowly been grabbing my shortlist attention hot damn this looks like a winner in my book looks stupid is it for 10yo kids damm was not expecting this youve got my attention bethesda anybody know the name of the song oh i missed sunset overdrive good to see it back only the pussies dont like this video this looks fucking terrible it feels like im the only one who liked rage reminds me of my punk life now all we need is you guys to bring back hexen heck i dont even know if you own the ip so its borderlands without the cell shading why did they waste money on the live action trailer this was amazing when the trailer started i was waiting to see only one thing i dont know technical word but it like when the bomb or heavy weapon hit the things and stuff around it should be able to be destroyed for this trailer they try to cover this weak point by skipping the flow of the scene before those blasts reach the things wowthe orgasm i just had had an orgasm i cant wait its so good wow borderlands really changed their graphics style why is everything so colorful well its good to know that it runs on a potatoe at 30 fps according to the trailer cant wait also cant wait for the next fallout to look this good looks cool but also looks nothing like the original rage which i actually liked quite a bit hmmm this is a fucking masterpiece holy shitttt in a world governed by liberal ideologs this is much better the teaser was absolute trash drop the lesbian punk shit youre going for it is clear that youre trying too hard with the style tes 6 after this cool game red 2 evento nintendo switch this looks like what rage 1 wanted to be hopefully the games a shit ton of fun mad max mixed with border lands i can dig it if mad max fcked the vault dweller doom had a baby with fallout i cant wait my god another gem to add to the collection im just happy its not bethesda studios them self i believe tom is working hard on the next big aaa title im hoping its tes 6 but i know its not it lmao im sure there gonna show something at e3 for the actual big title release and im excited dont get me wrong though this game looks like it will be a lot of fun just waiting for bethesda studios to show something finally the ending is near after 7 years this looks clean as fuck why did you put out that cringy live action thing yesterday when you had this in the wings just start with the awesome gameplay next time smh and i just wanted oblivion remastered i hope this is multiplayer too many mobs is kinda boring hope this has 4 players story co op like borderline doesnt have to be split screen just co op from start to finish will be solid looks like far cry can take some notes how to make an openworld fps falloutoverwatchdoom not impressed but then again i didnt care for rage 1 either this looks good man i hope it doesnt suck yes please song minor threat rancid who really another nonsens arcade shooter like doom 2016 looks like another failure as the 1st one wastheres nothing new to this trailerlooks like just another rescripted game same engine 5 value or less is this destiny 3 there is actually more content in this trailer than in the entire first game looks good though rage was a solid game avalanche studios created one of my favorite games period mad max id tech 6 is one of the best engines currently out what a day what a lovely day damn i still gotta play the first game no way ive been wating for this andrew wk makes me want to play this game could you make it so you can go explore after beating the game i beat the first one but was very disappointed when i loaded in and was stuck at the point of no return looks way different from the first one and thats a good thing a colorful shooter is always refreshing after stomaching barrels of grit and realism this is like mad max meets fallout meets bulletstorm looks like itll be a crazy fun time man weve needed rage 2 for so many years thanks bethesda i just hope the story is connected to the first gamebut even if its not i think this gamell be great its beautiful i was waiting for doom 2 from id software but this looks just as cool the only thing that would make it better is if the car running through the crowd was a mustang reskinned doom would still play it 3 hope the ending is better than the first never been so burned by an anticlimatic game shame because the gameplay was fun glad it has a sequel though im not a fun of mindless game action i expect something more of videogames i have the films and tv media for the braindead situations still liked doommaybe im gonna give it a try still waiting for a new game from bethesda game studio bethesda marketing department could we get a little less frame per second at 24 fps i can almost see whats going on in the video and get excited for this new release please lower it to something like 20 fps at this point i will be able to entirely skip the announcement and wait for a lets play review a couple of months later for crying out loud bethesda this video got a boatload of video cuts all over the place and fast movements of the camera and it has to go through youtubes reencoding the result is an absolute blurry mess in 24 fps the ms paint montages on twitter fun banter unexpected marketing sending out a gameplay trailer that looks like a bad 360p reupload with all the pixelated blur even in 1080p that looks like shit its doing a great disservice to all the people who worked on getting that gameplay demo montage done on time all these hours of hard work to have it uploaded below 30 fps whoever did that fix it asap what was already seen by 30 congratulations to bethesda and their advertising team i dont think ive ever gone so fast from pshaw yeah right to tell me more the fucking motion blur teaser trailer ready to die gameplay trailer were not gonna die party till you puke i love how this is basically a punk rock wolfenstein tony hawks american wasteland i am conductor of the poop train i was wondering why a sequel never came out but better late then never what a wonderful day what bloody wonderful day fuck you for making me want this game i didnt want this game i wanted something new ausdhfdsoiughgdoidsfugihdfoigyseufjiosdhgufidogd forget rage i want a bethesda rpg i can spend hundreds of hours playing hope it wont like the first one only got a open world with just some car avalanche and id teaming up am i dreaming 00 about damn time bethesda d to all the kiddies saying it looks like borderlands go play doom mad max or just cause looks nothing like borderlands aside from being post apocalyptic open yer eyes ya little spuds is there still coop looks like an awesome game but im worried about the continuation of the story from the previous rage looks like that they retcon the story from the previous game like what happened to all of the arks you activated at the end of the first game i guess they could play it like this takes place before the first game and before authority came to power either way game looks like its going to be a crazy explosion filled experience im still very undecided on whether or not i like this im really hoping they stay true to the original open world sandboxes are usually not very fun and often rather empty and flat with not a whole lot to actually do edit i also dont like that all bethesdas fps games are starting to look the same i hope this isnt the movement speedflow of doom i really like that rage slowed things down borderlands got a graphic update i see come on use this id tech engine on tes6 the effects this gaming engine can deliver are just beyond insane that beautiful global illumination in this trailer just wow and those correct distanced fogs and vlighting not to mention that glorious bloom effect wow great work bethesda party til you puke andrew wk just in case you were wondering about the music hyped alright im game bethesda certainly knows how to do trailers awful music please dont put that in the game yeah whatever this cliche bombastic big fucking guns tryhard pink borderlands punk rock resurrection of a game nobody liked might excite the thirteen year olds but i have to tell you it leaves a huge proportion of gamers totally cold where is starfield this trailer make me playing the first rage is so good gameplay more fast now is not like rage 1 hell yeah for all you guys who hate this game i understand where you coming from however look at the bright side now the leak is confirmed and we know borderlands 3 and some other cool stuff is coming out underwhelming period better than expected though not a buy from me despite owning every bethesda game this generation for multiple platforms looks like were getting rage 2 after all just hope its follows up the ending on rage that was the most big disappointment misunderstood for me but holy fucking shit so much boom boom doom with madmax had a insane child okmaybe rage might get its second chance reminds me of bulletstorm that was such an underrated game now add 105 fov with the fast paced action i dont get why people are complaining about the colour the only colourful things are really some cars gangs and grafiti the majority of these dislikes are from idiots who still think its made by bgs ok the trailer looked ok but was kind of miss leading but now holy crap this looks like it will be great fallout mad max and farcry had one hell of an orgy not an elder scrolls game but im excited not much love for us fantasy freaks these past years its all fps but thats ok i understand its not you its me nah too much of a flashy shiny arcady and forced juvenile style for me bethesda trying to grab the younger customers which im not gonna pass this one funny how everyone was talking shit yesterday like nobody asked for this and why would they bring this back now mf singing praises lol gtfoh this shit looks lit af next game tes6 i hope i do not need 200gb of free space on the disk my first reaction was how mad max this game looked then i saw whos the developer avalanche studios and i wasnt surprised at all first game was good this looks amazing oh dam this looks soo fun its like fallout doom and mad max fused a better fallout that we deserve perhaps its like bethesda said fuck it and through a whole bunch of games in a blender to make this masterpiece this thing is radiating sunset overdrive vibes gameplay looks great but yesterdays live action teaser put me off character customization tho id and avalanche no freaking way now this is what rage was supposed to be wheres nicholas raines fuck yes im definitely getting this could have saved this for e3 facepalm bethesdas farcry hell yeah this looks insane bethesdas final solution to the borderlands question same engine as doom quake i am unspeakably hard okay this looks fucking good a new fallout game cool loved the fact that avalanche studios are also working on this thought mad max game was great they totally nailed it if they can transfer most of the aspects from mad max into this it would really be an awesome game didnt even know about rage but this looks really fucking cool im gonna need to pick this game up doom combat in an open world sandbox with vehicles i am in this is how you salvage an ip i like the idea but this is one obnoxious trailer i hope the open world has a lot in it and isnt just empty space to drive in i will say this i bought the first game liked for what it was john goodman was good voice casting and i fucking missed that boomerang eh turns off motion blur yeh looks like mad max doom destiny just cause well the people who made all those except destiny did make this so makes sense god you all missed out on rage 1 it was an absolute gem pls dont fuck this up fallout 4 this time we didnt scramble the last day glad to know that mutantbash tv is still a thing the character only uses 4 guns in this trailer i hope and im sure theyll be a lot more the rage haters from yesterday nowhere to be found good so if fallout mad max doom and borderlands came togethersnorted a lot of crack and smoked lots of methhad a massive orgythis is what it would look like ps the game looks good by the way soooo anybody feel different from yesterdayhmmmm no thank you cool no one asked for this so boring i feel like i have played this before and that music was cancer when he double jumped i got hard pro tip finish the game before your release date this time really hoping its open world shooter looter i love games where you grind for goal features im hoping it will include is your basic material grind to upgrade loot or vehicles and your basic rpg elements campaign sidequests etc and just whole new overhaul to the gameplay mechanics not a reskin of the first one dont fuck this up guys because if this what you have hyping at e3 only im going be very disappointed your last conference was horseshit finally a game art that compliments a bad ass looking game finally looks super good tbh why is there even dislikes to this video looks cool i can smell a fucking battle royale coming edit i need that beta tho so basically a crappy borderlands so this is what its like if fallout 4 was actually using id engine and vulkan api ok bethesda this has driveable cars can you at least add that to the next fallout if this had an rpg system like falloutskyrim i would say just make fallout art assets for this add the special system and bring back the f3 style of perks and add a settlement system and that would be the perfect fallout 5 ok gota say i wasnt feeling at all excited for this game during the teases but honestly it looks pretty good people are always going to complain about stupid things people saying this looks like another fallout obviously havent played fallout as virtually all the gameplay showed is not possible in fallout people who say its another borderlands probably havent played that game either well have to wait until the game is released to truly properly judge it but so far for a game no one was really expecting this is a very pleasant surprise now about that rocket ship tease now please use this engine on the next bethesda rpg last rage was class wait wait wait so its the fast paced combat style of doom the setting of fallout the driving mechanics of mad max the destruction scale of say red faction and the absolute insanity of borderlands i mean jeez i liked the first game but my nutsack can only produce so much looks fun but jesus man that fov could we please have some nuance halfway between the hopeless depressed intro guy and hurrdurr murderfest idiocycelebration second half gameplay looks potentially fun but i dont see this lasting if it all revolves around kill cuz is fun with stupid mohawks and shitty teenage rock blasting at every corner looks like rage stopped taking itself seriously this actually looks fun well oh fucking k then its like splatoon but for the edgy kids no one here played the first one what a shame the gaming community is shut up and take my money looks like it could be great and i really hope it is i hope its closer to the first rage than it shows here tho that fucker downward thrust said that the rage franchise shouldnt exist and that no one remembers rage well he can go fuck himself cause when hes gonna play the game hes probably gonna delete that video i meanif you combine mad max and rage and doomsday the movie idk if anyone remembers it you get rage 2 i just cant wait why does the fov look so small so its another doom with a little bit of just cause and set in mad max aight i was a supporter of rage 1 and liked it for what it was but this looks like what the first should of been with an actual open world and random events going on chromatic aberration toggle that works pls ill be honest i thought id have zero interest in this when people started talking about it but so far this is looking really promising all i ask please let us skip the cutscenes this time i loved rage was really excited when i saw this customization the one thing about rage that drove me nuts was having to race race race race race race for the parts i needed heres to hoping this game has less of that i hope its longer than rage xd much bigger improvement from the original cant wait borderlands 3 and other leaks here we come sad they changed the art style for borderlands 3 does it have multiplayer though omg i love this game how is this a gameplay trailer all i see is cinematic sequences omg that was freakin awesome i never played the first one but im definitely getting rage 2 if theres multiplayer in this im buying it omg omg cannot wait for this game the real question is is it an rpg looks like doom minus the demons but with a bunch of crazy shit i watched this trailer like 10 times now and its not getting old yet better trailer than the last one which was full of cringe and was shit some of this gameplay looks like the devs just placeing some enemies in an open area and going nuts on them chills can i give you my money yet finally borderlands thr what the fuck is rage oh now people are interested just yesterday everyone was shitting on the teaser i dont like it it looks like a borderlands clone the first had such a somber tone this just doesnt feel right lets hope this is will be a return to form for avalanche after jc3 i have my concerns tho all i want is es6 trash reminds me of serious sam buy me bonestorm or go to hell so mad max with bethesdas backing and the first person combat by id softwarethis is like a dream come true holy shit is this borderlands 3 fallout rage 2 edition why tho this looks awesome a open world thats fantastic i played the last game and i mean it was good but rage 2 i cant waitto play as the guy we played last time this marketing is disgusting i hope it keeps the atmosphere of the original and improves otherwise mainly in the story now someone take this video reedit it insert mad max trailer music with tom hardys voice thousands of views rage was an awesome game spread some fallout 4 cups doom 7 tablespoons of bulletstorm 2 pints of mad max sprinkle on some borderlands dash on a little tank girl and add a hint of twisted metal now time to taste it first one was okay just okay this however looks amazinggggg i really like rage one and from what i see in this i think its a good new take the new psychic powers could be fun and its taking more of a page from doom as far as gunplay goes and i love andrew wk so the music choice is cool and im glad that while its high energy and fun its not trying to be funny like borderlands theres the big fucking gun joke but that was in the original too who doesnt love the bfg overall im excited locked to 60 fps bad physics tied to fps bad no fov options bad soooo are we finally going to be able to pick someones weapon from their corpse or is it too difficult borderlands doom and fallout took a lot of cocaine and the gangbanged mad max in all seriousness you can compare this well trailer to a lot of games but just by that you can say that it has its own style also remember no preorders prepare for more hidden easter eggs remember when we were able to go into that one quake level choo choo the hype train has left the station bethesda strikes again lets hope they make a great pc port for it if so then sign me up pretty much an open world doom i am sold this looks so fucking cool like the first rage was decent but this looks like doom 4 levels of awesome im not a huge fps fan but damn if this doesnt look like fun 100000 better than announcement trailer u cant explain this game simply but if i had to it looks really bad ass its 2018 could we have a 4k trailer please looks like fallout doom and wolfenstein had a baby dont fuck this up or put any bullshit into this that could ruin it like loot boxes or bs season passes for multilayer like doom and then get rid of them later looks very promising will keep an eye on it not a pre order because i dont trust you as a publisher from your past actions hopefully its one of your good games rage 2 creation club when it looks pretty good so there is something good it looks fun just we have to hope that it takes all the things we loved about the first rage and fix its problems and adds new content to the mix make this how rage was supposed to be and dont stray to far from the original concept like the crazy amount of color is a little much in my opinion but i tend to like gritty games so thats just me it looks like if doom far cry 3 and destiny had cocaine made a game so mad max borderlands and fallout and its made by id software you got my 60 is it gonna have paid for mods the weapons strangely reminds me of black ops 3 is it just me this is where game developers are seriously out of tune with todays gamera song from 2001 no nintendo switch version dude where are the megatextures seems like a hipster and the maker of splatoon aka nintendo came together and made this horrid trailer bethesda this is by far your worst thing ever i just hope that the game actually carries forward from what happened after the nasty ending from the first game which was an amazing game also it would be nice to have a creation kit for it not demanding it of course but it would be really cool are you bringing back the wing stick loved that weapon interesting going to keep a eye out would recommend the same another game for the adhd autism crowd nty this actually looks fun now wait for the downgrade looks like doom borderlands and fallout has a baby i am definitely getting this a game no one asked for but well buy anyway the music should have been andrew wk party hard lol the first one was awesome 2 is going to be orgasmic whats this fallout on steroids wait id software using id 5 to run an openworld fuck yeah i am so happy for the color variety worst thing about the first rage is the boring brown world but this oh boy it feels like mad max borderland had a kid but they threw him away and he was found and raised by doom fallout and then grew up to have bulletstorm as his best friend thank you walmart i hate you eh ill hold off my wanking for borderlands 3 at bethesda so we are going to make a game about a post apocalyptic anarchydriven world with aliens hold my cocaine so is this fallout but just the raiders i think in india they call this holi festival when doom and mad max have a baby this looks kinda awesome huh well that looked fucking insane i want this it might be interesting if it had a sort of multiplayer red dead 2 seems pretty good mad max was so underrated nice to see them get a second chance with rage 2 dear bethesda i loved the first rage game or had problems sure but it is definitely within my top 10 games i know you wont read this but i want to personally thank you for making my dreams come true with a sequel and i garubtee i will love it all the same your favorite rager gmankhronoz the ugliest trailer i have ever seen perfect product for shiteaters but where is elder scrolls 6 tho for some reason watching this makes me thirsty for a energy drink a couple years ago i remember asking if bethesda might use idtech for elder scrolls down the line and some person said that idtech 6 would be a disaster for open world gaming clearly not this game is officially fallout halo of the bioshocking borderlands of destiny 2 lol a fallout mod for borderlands awesome makes me wanna play the first one i just dont understand why you would attatch thid to rage 1 like as far as i can tell no one who bought rage 1 liked it beyond it being a fancy tech demo please dont say this is what is going to be release dont get me wrong it really catches my eye but i will probably hate it i was hoping for another elder scrolls game and i know you dont just want to make elder scrolls and fallout games i understand that this talk about starfield of wich i was hoping to see and i got this i had a feeling it was something else you were working on but so far it looks like road rage and no offence to any workers on that but it was terrible i liked the new doom a lot i hope they dont fuck this one up we all know this game wont look like this why didnt they just show us some gameplay at regular speed got something to hide im not jaded enough to say that wasnt epic is it open world rage was kinda meh i loved it dont get me wrong the end of the world will always be interesting however it felt like brown shooter how do they fix that look like the answer was go balls to the walls and crank shit up to 13 i am okay with the direction they took here tbh rage felt like it needed moremore looks like rage 2 added some of that as long as it is better than rage id buy it looks like the most add shit ever if this has the same restrictions on coop as rage 1 im probably gonna have to pass on it plenty of wacky shooters out there already i dont need another single player one omg finally rage 2 game of the year already stop marketing as a colourful borderlandsesque game its obviously not i thought thats what it would be from the promo material and now i know its not im glad i feel this is the wrong direction for rage im in i didnt play the first one but im interested looks good on the trailer i really hope the neon blue and pink and green colors really overwhelm the wastlands greyish yellow looking at the comments reminds me of when rage 1 was being teased and shown off everyone was so impressed then everybody shat all over it hopefully this game isnt just retrieve item drive kill some enemies get item deal with more enemies on the way back drive and get shitty points like the first why so many feminist characters holy crap its like doomfallout borderlands mad max sunset overdrive skyrim halo pubg fortnite monster hunter world call of duty titan fall warframe and battlefield all went out for dinner one night and after dinner gave each other very firm handshakes and then all of them went home and fell asleep hella hyped loved the first and this looks even more badass it will run id engine and vulkan this is going to be a smooth ride boys who here played the first rage back in the old days of 2012 i love the first game so im definitely going to buy rage 2 looks cool hate the guy on the cover thoughvery punchable that mech this make my peepee hard my guess is that its coming out this year around november im guessing i never played the originalrage so this is going to be fun i just hope this doesnt make me mad sooo hype how does no one remember this game there is definitely no other two developer studios out there more perfectly suited for a game like this rip borderlands 3 thats some seriously unlucky timing for gearbox lol did the first one have any kind of coop this would be amazing with 24 people it seems honestly feels really weird seeing a sequel to a idsoftware created ip not running on a idtech engine s may contain content inappropriate for children fallout mad max doom and borderlands count me in i hope they remember to make an ending this time still hesitant but if its a party after the end of the world kind of angle i could get into it rage 2yeah thank you for not letting this die i liked rage and wasnt expecting to love it it played well felt great looked awesome and kept me playing til platinum looking forward to this well bethesda said they hada few new projects in todays episode of sequels nobody wanted honestly looks like they are trying to hard not sure this is really going to be all that great if this is 4players rip destiny this looks awesome doom style gunplay and mad max style driving thanks todd howard idiots who cant understand they didnt make the game if theyve already showed us a game play trailer before e3 they obviously have many more games to show offim excited can this even run on my xbox one since its been six years since borderlands 2 im tired of waiting for 3 this will have to do looks better than anything gearbox could do anyways borderlands 3 confirmed why do people think this is a silly game when the dark tone is still there it just wanted to grab your attention with the music and combat big fucking guns intense actionand a open world yea standard stuff gimme something unique something that makes this is not look like if mad max had a futuristic setting and more variants of guns i dont want 8 fucking guns to collect throughout the map why does madmax have pretty colours so its wacky world doom cant do worse than the first game i suppose i didnt play the first game but if this is as actually as fun as the trailer make it seem then ill be sure to play it keep up the great work bethesda yall pumped a ton of good shi t last year and i hope this one will be just as good my wildest fantasy has come true not trying to be a negative bitch but i feel like its gonna flop or people just wont really care looks like its supposed to be goofy and over the top i dunno that seems different from the tone of the first one games with this tone dont usually do it for me story wise because i cant take anything serious which leads to not caring about the characters and therefore the game fingers crossed with a dose of skeptical optimism well shit what just happened absolutely stunninglooks amazing the vibe it gives is great defiantly my most anticipated game of this year next to borderlands 3 my wish for this game is lots of guns and wind stick action maybe some steath takedown would be legit rambling lol holy shit yes so excited cant wait this looks awesome i normally cant stand postapacolypse shit but i like the first one i cant wait for this one i like how everybody was like nobody wanted this and now its where do i sign up ok an actual fucking trailer this better have the player and car customization of avalanche mad max and the classic feel of rage 1 or is gonna be such a blow to the gaming industry that it will make rage 2 burn in the ashes of forgotten this seems like a tad of a departure from rage 1 a game that felt very unfinished as its story never reached a climax and ended before you even meet the antagonist what is this this is like a crappy reboot does it have multiplayer will it be some online only destiny crap what is with all the enemies standing out in the open like that wow i absolutely hated everything about the first game except for the combat the openworld had absolutely nothing to do and the ending was so abrupt and meaningless all that was made even worse by the fact that the game was split into 2 discs like what didnt think a sequel would ever pique my interest but if this game addresses the gross problems the first one had im in actually looks kida dope i thought the original rage gameplay was great but now doom like gameplay in a post apocalyptic open world with vehicles im excited to say the least no coop so ill pass with coop it could have been the new borderlands powered by id tech 6 or 7 rage was so boring this looks fun as fuck stop turning single player games into fucking open world games i loved the original because of the pacing so different from the first rage but i like it meh its not doom this game is going to be awesome longtime rage fan ok thats great and all but wheres doom 2 looks a lot like fallout but with more deserts does anyone actually remember the jip that was rage idk i want my story finish but i forgot this was even suppose to keep going when is it coming out better be this year or that is awful planning needs to be released asap with all the hype it has rn if its coming in 2019 idk if it will succeed meh lost its firefly appeal it had looks rad definitely gonna be picking this up another great game that is not on the switch i really hope its good open world no thanks when rage first came out i shelled out my i dont know 6o bucks for the promise of a dystopian doom with a generous sprinkling of mad max i will not make the same mistake twice loved the first rage this one looks great please please maintain love for the solo player who wants an engaging campaign campaignlike experience another from rages to riches tale huh well dont keep me waiting do tell stayed true to rage 1 but shoved mad max and doom into it these choices please me sequel looks worth the wait im so pumped for this game looks better then before imo also they showed alot of new things hypee this is a game i can wait for some reviews before buying it doesnt really look like something i have to have on day one this is dumb i hope mick gordon does the soundtrack hope the dead city and mutant bash tv makes a return thanks walmart stupid question where is the switch version all this is missing is dropkick murphys were never going to die i absolutely loved the first one except for that abrupt ending now this new one being truly open world it might now even have an ending lol i loved the mad max game that avalanche did too i am so hyped for this doom meets mad max sign me up okay this does look cool alot of hate the game looks good and as a fan of rage and bethesda i look forward to it if you dont like it dont buy it and make a better game this looks so bad is this multiplayer this one looks a hell of a lot more fun than the first one but will it have mods brilliant the first rage is one of my favourite games ive ever played always been hoping for another but never expected it so hyped looking forward to it thank you who asked for this game rage 1 bombed hard why in gods name is there a second one ive been waiting for 15 years for unreal 3 when can we get a proper shooter again the fuck is that box art when when when when i wanna preorder you guys forgot the switch version its like tetris kirbys dream course and kinect sports all in one fallout meets mad max looks like call of duty to me fallout advanced warfare mad max when is it out and can bethesda take my money now please looks nice doom in mad maxs world im guessing you guys are already ditching the nintendo switch now despite you guys saying youd support it for years to come oh well ill still get the game for pc anyway i dont gonna buy until i see some real gameplay looks like ill need a new gpu for this game looks like an absolute amazing clusterfuck id software you guys are my favorite both new and old but this open world wipes away all your magic im disappointed the nuka world dlc just became a full game rage ing boner esrb may contain content inappropriate for children you dont fcking say can i play as max in this sold regardless almost having doom flashbacks switch the first 40secs was goodliking the new environments and enemies i gotta say you are experts in making nonsensical trailers im not any wiser as to what this game is about other than some crazy loud terrible music big flashy text and short bits of gameplay please try harder or call it something else because a gameplay trailer this is not fallout really digging how this is looking i never played the original but i love how this is going for a crazy not too serious blow shit up vibe reminds me a bit of borderlands gunplay looks fast and tight like doom which is great and honestly im super down to see how it turns out it says rage 2but this isnt rage stop comparing this to bordelands this is clearly a mix of mad max and doom this gave me a fucking headache no preorders please guys and gals dont feed this practice it just works day 2 buy for me pending reviews because im not stupid i need it wow this actually looks like something i would want to play nope this is inengine footage not gameplay footage is it a little doomish looks pretty nice consider me god i hate that phrase for me this came out of nowhere and it is beautiful i had a good time with rage in xbox360 it was my first game indeed will have a switch port even though its pre rendered this is basically what we will get someone took nuka cola dlc very seriously in bethesda i think this games biggest contended will be borderlands 3 by gameplay and the theme it seems to be a dark game thats covered up by w h ac k y stuff jsut like borderlands what is that frame rate tho wow the framerate is atrocious and this is a freaking trailer i liked rage 1excited for this when the nintendo switch port its like watch dogs and saints row took jabs at farting on each others faces and puked and crapped this crap out the advertisement is fucking obnoxious but the game looks great no gimpworks and avanlache studios if im not mistaken so 21 because bethesda high hopes anyone know if theyre using the same engine as in doom cause it look sound and feels a lot like doom not a bad thing tho omg i cant wait to run to marked points on a minimap and complete the same kind of mission over and over again in another open world game this looks way more fun than the original rage not going to preorder until i have more gameplay footage i love the first one the 2nd looks better i love the post apocalyptic setting just an fyi they made rage 1 to test their rage engine specifically so maybe they are testing it again possibly for another elderfalloutetc gimme co op not multiplayer specifically co operative in one session and some decent customization and im fuckin sold oh and the arbitrary easter eggs also this steaming heap of cow dung isnt worth preordering ill get it when its on sale three months after release and for nintendo switch looks like a game based on raiders of nukawolrld a dlc of fallout 4 hopefully itll be playable on pc this time around this actually looks like alot of fun bethesda is making the games they like not just fallout or elder scrolls coming up more open world rpg action games fuck super hyped nooo theyre destoyng the postive feeling that the first left me rage 2 is coming and the fov is 40 degrees rage 1 was amazing hope this one is just as good is there multiplayer if so is it coop or just more than two people im going to get so much hate but this looks bettet then the fallout games great news too bad walmart ruined the e3 surprise it looks like a post apocalyptic far cry and it better be i thought this was a gameplay trailer me the first one was trash bethesda were sorry also me dont be sorry be better this looks exactly like bulletstorm the original was great so looking forward to this hopefully will have some split screen game play as well looks blandgeneric and really uninspired ill be seeing in in a bargin bin with its predecessor real soon song name please i dont like the marketing style and aesthetic they are pushing for this i have a good feeling about this game man i was about to spend my 100 bucks on some games but when i saw this dude day one and deluxe edition or gold edition baby how about doom 2 no ok it looks like rage 2 is taking a lot of inspiration from doom whats the point of this game this fov is pure cancer what is it 65 please stop with this looks cool i hope theirs an interceptor hidden around somwhere as a secret i loved the first game but never thought id get to see a sequel this was a pleasant surprise for sure and i cant wait to get my hads on it thanks for giving it another go ho lee s i wish i could figure out why im bored by this this cover art is fucking awful the game itself looks really fun though how many billions i can see some battlefield visuals in here awesome so now youve got another post apocalyptic open world shooter franchise you can met fallout be an rpg again could be the best thing to come out of this annoying music this actually looks good and i hated rage nice trailer and i like it but is in 30 fps and that i dont like the comment section is literally copy and paste from 2011s rage trailer everyone is just comparing it to fallout borderlands and mad max all over again nintendo switch i really hope this is an rpg im still gonna buy it if its not but i hope it is if borderlands and doom had a baby this would be it switch version when will the game be in 60 fps this isnt fallout and its not starfield and its not bethesda game studios the kids will love this game but we adults want the real thing cmon bgs you know what that is youve had more than 3 years now to develop it do we have to get down on our knees and beg for it stop being so fuckin secretive open the bag already and let it out this year if you do we will make you rich beyond your wildest dreams this game looks awesome this sucks so bad this shouldnt exist die i hope it has good characters i cant help but think borderlands need good characters to make it good is it just me or have they times down the cel shading that was my favorite part of the first game the art direction was fucking incredible this is disappointing as hell never played the first one but holy fucking shit this looks great but why this trailer makes it look like the nuka world raiders got their own game so the tone of sunset overdrive the driving of mad max the post apocalyptic setting of fallout and the gameplay of doomwolfenstein this pleases me heavily why age restricted insane action big fucking guns insanely small fov i really like this idea of using 2 companies different strengths to make a game looks fun as hell not to judge it to early but the map looks somewhat empty aside from the outposts shown awesome i loved rage somebody see nice graphics and gameplay i see fps drop wish i was wrong the original rage was the most dissapointing unfinished piece of shit i ever wasted time on this would have to be completely different in every way to be worth playing very goodbut i hope this time we will not have the same texture problem like the first rageand this time lets hope a good story with a good endingand this time no mega textures put an xp level up progression system and you got my sale otherwise im not getting this one either im just excited by a bethesda engine that has vehicles i wonder if they created a new engine why couldnt fallout 4 have good graphics like this omfg who cares give us elder scrolls already yesterday nobody wanted this yesterday nobody asked for this today nothing has changed im just wondering if single player only or coop will definitely fill my fallout craving for now cant wait whats up with the dislikes the game send promising people love to bandwagon on others opinions looks cool hopefully they get it right now that its a different studio holy fuck this looks boring looks entertaining to me if the combat is anywhere near as fun as doom then this will be purchased bethesda with id never disappoints me shut up and take my money looks amazing cant wait to get it the only thing is that it was a little to colorful the first rage was great really liked it very much i need one of them collectibles like with doom and the revenant statue you guys are metal as fuuuk now thats what i call a trailer hell yeah bethesda does it again looks indane love the mad max style hey maybe this one will run on pc i loved rage and i had a sneaky suspicion that this is what was coming next i wonder if we will be the same vault survivor or someone else i just hope it has an amazing story unexpected most unexpected i just wish they put in postapocalyptic creatures in the game instead i feel well get a few cool mutant bosses everything else will just be copy and pasted humanoid bullet fodder eh i want somthing new not more sequels please will there be support api vulkan i hope the enemies arent to the same level of bullet sponge they were before i also want my crimson raider armor and my monarch car from the first one yes i am so glad you are making rage 2 the first one was amazing jesus that fov and motion blur looks horrible is this far cry blood dragon 2 ppl who think this game is shitty there are so stupid well this certainly looks like a game cautiously optimistic please dont be a mindless game ala just cause looks badass just like the first one but better teaser trailer nay gameplay trailer yay was this running on a wii u that was a slideshow complete rip off of mad max the game but with guns yes i know the guy from mad max is working with bethesda but cmon bro copy paste much this game is being made by just cause developers and id software both of their last games were a bit mediocre and whats up with the gay box art just cause and fallout just got a baby and the baby is awesome heres to hoping it has more than 4 hours of gameplay this time hopefully this runs better then just cause 3 and the first rage did when it was first released still glad its coming out rage was an awesome game just not even close to a day one purchase for me this is way better than the live action trailer please give this game deluxe edition include season pass for 7999 or 8999 bucks yeah wheres all the dislikes now cunts now this looks cool doom x mad max x fallout x blade runner lighting idk about everyone else but im looking forward to the big fucking guns welcome to the borderlands fallout edition has a scope doesnt aim looks good for now my opinion i think on announce trailer there was too much rage thank you id avalanche and of course bethesda for bankrolling this game now you guys should x enhance the first one seeing it is already bc for xbox one i saw on a board yesterday that there are even issues with the bc port but can i build a settlement if not then i dont want it alright take my 60 oh my god bethesda i was hoping for a other rage for so long i love bethesda your the best for open world games and also i love very much fallout 4 i played so many hours and start again many times because it was too good i think i played approxymatly 300 hours maybe more than that this shouldve been the announcement trailer the actual announcement trailer was shit hey its fallout 4 with cars please dont fuck this up double jump no thanks it just got me out of hype people were hyped for the first one too and it was a terribly short story no where near worth it not good enough make real insanity then i buy it ok this looks fantastic motion blur the game this looks terrible the new fallout enb is looking good omg this look like fallout with god of war graphics this looks really awesome the unapologetic whacky style is refreshing ok this i want those live trailers do not help spend that money on development so basicly this is a fortnitelike fallout dont get me wrong tho looks amazing battle royal mode confirmed in this wide open spaceoh shitdid they finally make it open world loved the first game cant wait for this tbh the first rage blue balled me at the end so i still need more tell me when borderlands fucked destiny and splatoon and this is their baby garagepure trash garbage gtfo with this bullshit game really hope this isnt the big reveal for e3 from bethesda first game was pure trash so no hope for this garbage now listen close and listen hard because im only going to say this once fuck multiplayer im sick and tired of arena shooters im sick and tired of games with no story substance and atmosphere i want my own game world where my choices matter i dont want to share my experience with countless other players who ruin my immersion i dont like how it seems to be venturing away from its darker themehumor like fallout 4 did looks like every other game this generation fallout 5 looks amazing i wasnt a big fan of fallout 4 but this sequel looks to be a much better installment in the franchise oh wait jesus fng christ what did i just watch explosions explosions everywhere not sure whats the point but lets wait and see is there a choice to rebuild the world its like doom and fallout 4 had a baby if walmart didnt leak it we would have seen this at e3 cant wait switch no ok put me on the not impressed pile i wanted a continuation of the gritty and somewhat grounded apocalyptic rage a game i was one of the few to actually enjoy for what it was i didnt want rage ip with oh look we have colours for colours sake and we have the floaty jumping alien weaponry and enemy attack mindset of our successful new doom game because thats guaranteed to sell right pasted into it i thought this would be at e3 wonder what they will have at e3 insert to much to young to fast in the trailer this game is going to be dope just you wait stop with the pink hair im so into this you meme it then make it real ha is that the beautiful sound of andrew wk i hear i swear to god he better make a cameo in the game at frist i was skeptic when rage 2 was announced but this looks reasonable wow the new rage looks like borderlands mixed with sunset overdrive the music sounds like it would be in sunset overdrive i am so gonna buy this it sucks that this got leaked however im excited for the game either way and im hooked glad to see avalanche on this mad max had great vehicle combat this looks awesome nah yall were disliking get off the hype train i want this game omg bordernight fortnight and borderlands yay for non original bullshit looks insanely good after several years from the first game an upgrade was needed didnt see a rage 2 coming i almost forgot about this franchise but im happy about it coming back and feel very hyped now this is pretty much just serious sam 2018 borderlands 3 without cell shading hopefully you dont play as the neon haired feminists this trailer is way better than the previous one open world doomthis is gonna be epic damn i really like it fucking rage you are going to double down on this turd may it tank even harder than the last one this looks much better than rage 1 like you cant even compare the two at this point and weve only seen one gameplay trailer i hope it fails you hire absolute retards to gamedesign and market your games i wish i could give bathesda some cool ideas i have p where is the little cars cool i have no idea what the first game was about but this looks fun new boom sure fucking hope this isnt a console port or i swear2god this looks fucking sick waiting for a coop wow fallout 4s new mod looks cool looks like it could be a lot of fun what about doom 2 i need this in my life now super hype shut up and take my money i am inclined to getting this instead of borderlands 3 now avalanche and id togetherfuck yeah the only way id ever get this game is if theres a big slaw going on or if im heavily intoxicated and i dont remember how doom was equally as disappointing with having some of the best gunplay ive seen in a long time matched up with probably the most repetitive drawn out boring sequences that have ever been in a game the only reason i have any hope for this game is because of monolith please test the pc port this time thank you signed the master race not gonna lie that looked sick as fuck what the fuck is wrong with the framerate aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa looks ok but the box art is so bad im gonna have to pass i dont want to have to look at some ugly lesbian bitch everytime i want to play this also hmm whos the dyed hair femtard sjw on the trailer cover shoukdnt the dude narrating be on it and he talks like a complete beta pussy get voice actors that sound like a man im digging it i just hope the story is compelling i didnt know i wanted this man this looks good ok rage 2 looks pretty awesome now im hyped they seem to be taking the best aspects of the original rage and amping them up it will be awesome ok this looks really fun just fucking fuck shit up im in much better next time dont show a live action trailer like that ever again i love bethesda been waiting since 2011 looks good everyone wow prey 2 looks amazing and its an original idea can we have that bethesda no everyone rage 1 was bad lets not do that again bethesda rage 2 good idea ffs bethesda give up on this borderlandsdoom wannabe this game will be bethesdas agents of mayhem i love andrew wk but this is too fast to really see anything fallout nuka world and mad max pillowblaster goes aaa p adam jensen i didnt ask for this insanity random cyberpunk what a lovely day some annoying robot wubwub doom guy they stole my gun piboy war war never changes if fallout and doom had a child we want new skyrim fucking idiots not this shit im hyped is this mad max 2 after the gay trailer we have a yawn trailer borderlands and doom just had some straight intercourse and this popped out gimme actual footage of the gameplay plz with the hud map etc holy shit this looks better than the 1st rage the first one felt unfinished and i wanted more from it looks like im finally going to be getting that that color scheme is badass it looks like the best part of suicide squadthe aestheticmixed with the action of doom set in the childworld borderlands fallout 4 would make if they hooked up thank y o u bethesda ken jeongs gay would be perfect at the end of this video borderlands 3 is that you oversaturated colour with horse shit shaders and texture the graphics sucks considering its coming in 2019 and recent games like god of war 2018 absolutely obliterates this rage 2s graphics not to mention the idiotic gameplay that will get boring after 23 hours flop already why so shit yes yes i loved the first game and rage 2 looks fucking lit disliked cause its not the edler scrolls looks pretty good and you got wk on this bitch i meet him like 6 years ago good times rocking music we will see how it goes as you show more no date btw this is the most beautiful thing i had ever seen whats the point of this gameto blow shit up very shallow perfect musical choice to accompany mayhem consider me hyped oh my fucking god yes hopefully this will link to the original story wise the teaser turned me off but this did the complete opposite looking good so far why are pre orders only uk and usa this makes me wanna party great another open world action game just what we needed played the living hell out of the first on campaign was a bit short but that didnt stop me from completing it like 5 times xd love the work yyou guys do please keep it up thank you for a sequal i think it looks great looking forward to seeing more about this game kudos bethesda welcome to the borderlands what happend with nintendo switch yes were getting doom 4 style shooting mechanics with the mad max style open world the best of both worlds now im really excited for this game i like this new skyrim expansion ive been looking for something to fill the void that sunset overdrive left chaotic af i like it so no starfield ehh i dont know oh heck yea looks lit everybody was saying they didnt want a rage 2 in the cinematic trailer but now everyone sees the gameplay and potential rage 2 has and now they are fine with it lol this game looks really awesome it looks like the first one but with a whole lot more action with a whole lot more insanity and a bigger open world good job bethesda i cant wait not the fallout we wanted but the fallout we deserve k this is on my radar now rage had the best bullet impact reactions of the genre i hope they retain this in rage 2 were people asking for a sequel to this wide open world okay im interested better not be another it just works tho avalanche studios ey thatsmatch made in heaven i expected nothing less from the makers of mad max with creative freedom ive been waiting to see their next project lets hope the marketing doesnt ruin the game first one was fun this one looks cool to thats gonna be a big ol yes from ya boi rage 1 looks bettter but ill still buy it dont worry bethesda just dont rip off id software please 111 why did they blur the word fishing out that makes no sense soooo skyrimfalloutdoomwolfensteinme raging over not having the elder scrolls 3 morrowind remastered buckeld with the elder scrolls 6 doom had a sex with fallout like fallout with cars ign the only studio who cares about single player but is it lore friendly i liked the 1st and the 2nd looks funny hope its not focusing on multiplayer never played the first one but i may just have to try this one doom 2016s shooting mad maxs driving borderlands personality best openworld fps of all time will the ai and npc animation quality be as good as the first game its a generic post apocalyptic game big fng guns aka bfg gun in doom i see what you did there takes a special kind of talent to make a concept like this look so boring and bland just an another shooter fucking woah wow blown away who asked for this loving the andrew wk i still dont get the pink and yellow theming this actually looks really good had no interest before but this looks like it could be a really good title more of this and less cgilive action trailers publishers your devs work is the most interesting thing i wanted fallout new vegas 2 i guess this will do for now rage 2 holy moly this trailer went all in awesome i only played the first rage thanks to jesse pinkman saw him play it and was like that looks like a cool game and it was where is switch beggars borderlands with hd graphics pretty much if the story line is 510 rip this game this game looks amazing looks like mad max on acid to me p thank you for making a straight up sequel in what looks like a single player experience and for not chasing trends i am so excited too bad this couldnt be saved for e3 this looks so fucking sick looks uninspired generic and mediocre this feels like mad max mixed with fallout doom and borderlands i like it yep this what we need till doom 2 the real question is there coop to enjoy this mayhem with a friend meh the first one was a muddy textured borefest i cant see this one being any different can you join factions in this game what about companions i knew they were gonna make the game look better pest of 2018 good but why fov 50 lol doom and mad max had a crack baby it was then raised by a pack of wolfenstein reminds me of bulletstorm and that games was great so got high hopes for this too pc requirements minimum latest 8 core i7 32 gb ram gtx 1070 for 720p low gtx 1080 ti for 1080p30 medium forget high ultra and 60 fps amd cpus gpus not officially supported and never tested recommended buy a console you filthy pirates you think we are going to spend money optimizing the game for your rigs so you can download it from a torrent site and laugh in our face remember the first game this is going to be so much worse you are lucky if you make it to the title screen without crashing now be good boys and girls and buy a playstation everyone with common sense already has and give us your money it looks like doom mixed with fallout and mixed with wolfenstein but had its own mad max spin on it fucking epic you can have my name and signature because im officially signed up for this rage was good just short and brown this could be good tooright where the fuck is mrmattyplays lmfao although the first one was a game i actually found very enjoyable the ending sucked ass now we finally have something to make amends im very happy this is a thing the first one was underrated i want this on psvr even if it doesnt look as good the sequel i never thought i wanted nice gimme i want this battle royale turn shitty motion blur off in videos it was awful fallout 4 looks great the fact that avalanche studios is involved has killed what little interest i had in this game mad max and just cause 3 were astronomically bad and i wouldnt trust avalanche studios with a cup of coffee now this is a trailer i see mutant bash tv is back im in this is really just borderlands before it became cell shaded i really liked this game when it was called boarderlands 2 as if there was any doubt mad max 2015 doom 2016 take my fuckin money open world you mean microtransactions honestly starfield trailer i prefer to play shooters on pc but idk if my pc will run it so i possibly will buy it both on my pc and ps4 cuz im hyped af d so resurrected a dead game and now youre trying to compete against destiny need something better big fucking guns nice reference to doom damn my childhood game is coming back pls support native ultrawide and unlocked fps when oh my gosh its love at first sight please nobody tells fallout that i will cheat on her i hope this games isnt an open word linear game this time rage 1 was great but it was too linear i was sold at 042 im buying it wide open world i remember rage 1 lets see this in action first hehe i f love id and bethesda basically borderlands and mad max alrightill bite i think this will make for a great replacement for borderlands randy pitchford and his politically driven writers ruined that series for me openworld bulletstorm hell yeah sad but avalanche never could make an interesting open world hope this is exception and this stupid movies trailer trend with few seconds of action in the beginning its disgusting it ruins whole trailer this looks fantastic not fallout 3 remastered but will do even though id love a bethesda game studios rpg this besthesda softworks intellectual property produced by id and avalanche looks great both studios most recent releasesdoom and mad max have been excellent and even though zenimax doesnt own avalanche studios its really great they were able to collaborate with an outside studio im tired of farcry titles and although borderlands 3 will be fun that multiplayer first gameplay feels different than a title like this singleplayer is my jam 3 i wouldnt even be disappointed if the only announcement from bgs was that they were a year away from releasing something id still like to know what theyre working on though if rage 2 were released in summer and a bgs rpg came out in fallwinter thatd be the tits i almost always wait for a sale or buy games second hand but for titles of this quality ill pay full price upon release i never played past getting to the first big town in the first rage does anyone know if it was worth playing through all the way i always liked the setting art style and graphics of the game but something just never grabbed me with it i think i played more of the mobile game than the full one woh anyone else getting true lives of the fabulous killjoys vibes you know the comic based off of mcrs last album the moment i saw avalanche studios name working with id and bethesda in the trailer i was already sold lets blow some fucking shit up this was alot better than the teaser thank god i came here for andrew wk bethesda please just take my money is this destiny 3 thought this was rockstar announcing an update to their game engine ok this is looking like a pretty good game from this trailer so bethesda evolved its no longer one game with diffrent skins its 2 and i love it big open world finally something like thisi mean why they dont make this type of game more avalanche studios they made just cause right that could be a good sign for a chaotic open world game its like mad max borderlands destiny and fallout all had a big foursome and this is what spawned thats doom with max max skin ok you got my attention avalanche studios abandoned just cause 3 and never fix the lag problem sou seeing them here is concerning this game looks annoying ah so this is what id studios has been up to still eager to hear what bethesda game studios will announce looks trash imo wont be bothering no one asked for this lmao i have the feeling there will be a big graphics downgrade holy fucking shit this should have been the announcement trailer hmmm ill wait for the aliens coop mod omg it looks so amazing cant wait for more at e3 this year cool the first rage was great if tragically short and with a disappointing ending i have high hopesdreams for this one and hope its gonna be amazing lol now this is a trailer d better then the live action teaser now this is what the fuck im talking about this is rage right here you need to take that other trailer down hmmm looks like ill be spending a few thousand hours on this another shitty game from bethesda fallout 4 and skyrim were games for beta males and cucks just like rage 2 is so how many micro transactions creation club purchases i saw the original rage gameplay from 2011 before i came here this looks beautiful now this is a trailer train hype here i go im not really a fan of just cause but lets see what avalanche will bring to us its lit af well have to say this game looks like its going to be a lot of fun i just hope it has a decent story i remember playing the first rage on the xbox 360 and the game felt very lacking it felt like the old consoles were holding it back but with the new generation of consoles its skys the limit of what bethesda can probably do now so i believe that this new game is going to be great just give it a chance so much yes my only worry is they are not going to carry over dynamic injury from the first game it seems like minor thing but it was a amazing thing imo most games have 1 or just a few animations for when a npc is shot rage had several dozen and depending on how they were killed shot melee or boomeranged a special animation would play for that effect on the part of the body it hit at the time this was groundbreaking and rage did not get enough credit for it if they do include this and do as good a job with the story as the last all they need to do to make a smash hit is not make the ending a nonending like the first one p avalanche hell yeah at least we can expect pretty well made explosions fuck this looks fun i trust id software this has a good chance at becoming my favorite game ever now i see why its called rage i want that game in my in my possession right now really liked the first rage game hope this one is even better and the story has an actual ending this time ok now thats something i loved the first gamethis is gonna be even better hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah 2018 not posting your game trailers in 4k and 60fps for better impression am i the only one who doesnt like this song its also really fucking loud in this trailer christ looks pretty but eh this looks exactly how a sequel should fucking excited now a lot more now ive seen it in action alright this looks fun as hell looks fun but hopefully they remember they kinda established a story with the first one already and also there definitely using the doom engine soooo doom without demons gotcha day onelooking forward to this more than last of us 2 or anything else at e3 so i barely remember the first game at all did it have any form of multiplayer cause this looks like the kind of game to play with friends its like someone threw borderlands mad max and doom in a blender and seasoned with some destinyesque scifi hopefully the resulting pulp can be filtered of the issues and were left with a sweet syrup of a game it looks like this was made in unreal engine 4 if so bethesda should seriously consider making that their main engine because graphics look amazing in ue4 tone is inconsistent af really looks like another game with a wildly varying tone that exists just to please everyone despite how poorly written it comes off just give us a sequel of doom 2016 im still not feeling these music and aethstetic choices oh thats cool hey look borderlands 3 holy shit i thought i was excited before this is even better finally i have been waiting for rage 2 since i beat the first one sooo i guess were just gonna ignore the plot of the first game where we essentially save the world and get it ready for rebuilding ahh well at least it might be a little different from ubisoft open world game 627 thank you bethesda and avalanche for this big fcking guns its doom reference the physics involved in hitting a grenade with the baseball bat was weird i am 80 sure the marketing department chose andrew wk songs because of hellsing abridged gameplay graphics looks good but the trailer itself is like indie game bound by flame technomanceretc definite buy hint hint still would love switch fallout 4 can we expect character creation damn that gameplay trailer made change mi opinion lol this shit looks lit wellthat looks better then the firstim in what is this cannot believe that story is traded for a cod style shoot kill die repeat no rage2 for me is this the id tech 6 engine will it be as disappointing as fallout 4 or wolfenshtien well see bethesdathis is what we want black background starfield printed yellow vader breathing still no release date id is at least codeveloping andrew wk is a hardcore influence tonal change from grounded and gritty to chaos and carnage same apparent game play as rage 1 preordered im super down i picked up rage 1 a couple of months ago and played about 4 hours before getting distracted really enjoyed it but i kept wanting it to really open up basically i wanted falloutmad maxdoom and it was close this looks to be the game i wanted i hope its not one of those games that is a year away from release time to hook the ps3 back up and finish some rage edit doh 2019 release date my only question is will this have anything to do with the first rage i mean did we just go through all of that for nothing did the people from those bunkers just die the second they got out this game is lit 3 i love doom the serious intro dialogue sounds like something from pacific rim 1 and death stranding combined thats a lotta motion blur this looks like some weird ass child birthed from an alleyway orgy involving doom fallout and a lot of cocaine where do i sign up i am ready its like doom mad max and wolfenstein had a gangbang and made this heavenly game that is waiting to be cared for by our consoles mutant bash tv season 2 is looking good so far wasnt excited at all but holy shit guess i better finish the first one then wow this looks like a reskin of doom its a shame too since the first rage was amazing are you fuckin kidding me this looks metal as hell please allow co op please allow co op holy shit now this is exactly what i wanted from a rage sequel pure fucking insanity im totally ready to embrace the crazy damn that trailer was pretty cool until you start that lame and try hard hey are we cool yet are we coll look we have rock music not a fan of the style to be honest kinda done with this wacky colorful style at this point no one asked for this give us a new elder scrolls or a sequel to new vegas 044 rick where do you bring us is a bethesda game morty oh boi im pleasantly surprised my biggest problem with rage was it wasnt open really open world like i thought it would be looks like thats being addressed unexpected hype train is fine by me give me my copy this game and go to hell d this is literally the most hectic trailer ive seen for a game ever first game was fucking crap badly written poorly paced and extremely brown this game doesnt look like a bethesda game anything affliated with bethesda and id soft is worth a shot in my book and avalanche is also seasoned so im in i love you wallmart i never knew i wanted rage 2 looks like a fun time still dunno if ill buy it though yessssss i remember beating the first game when i was in like 5th grade such a fun game im hoping therell be a 3rd person mode hope they include coop campaing yet another open world game with bleh design sense disappointing might pirate it but definitely not gonna buy this is a pleasant surprise yep i dont give a shit so someone finally got mad max right the new splatoon game looks lit this game looks amazing bethesda are only publishers for this game they have the main bethesdagamestudios reveal for the starfield or tesvi game at be3 2018 doom fallout and mad max had one heck of a threesome last night hoping the storyline is on par with the gameplaymechanics really dont want another fallout 4 beautiful but hollow looking forward to the inevitable switch version it makes perfect sense that id would be on the side of the shooting mechanic judging by the epicness that was doom this looks really fun tbh i never played rage but im glad that theyre bringing it back to try to improve on the first even though no one asked for it wow i really like this bordeland 3 trailer getting those bulletstorm mad max and a bit of those colorfull infamous second son moments this was the last game i expected to get a sequel but this looks very bold and promising so basically trying to be borderlands ill just wait for borderlands 3 not sure if i like the shift in tone seems like the easy way to me rage wasnt received so well lets make it over the top and funny thatll work we dont need another borderlands but still ill wait until theres more information i feel like this is what the original rage was supposed to be hope to god its an actual open world instead of linear gameplay from the original looks dope avalanche is a great studio so this has a lot of potential ive been waitin years for this ahhhhhhhhh this looks rad as heck and anyone who says otherwise is objectively wrong sorry very cool thank you for making this game been waiting a long time for rage 2 definitely stoked rage 1 was so fun but the ending and forced linear campaign was so depressing i wanted to return to certain areas i never finished looks great rage 1 was the first game i bought that and resistance when i got back into video games in 2015after not having played anything since resident evil nemesiswhen it was new this looks great and not too far off from the first the fast paced fps was definitelyin rage 1 think of the subway level killing what seemed like 100s of mutants and even the carnival killing game seems to be back 043 rage 1 had a goodmix of both a serious and silly tone and i hope rage 2 keeps that mixture liked the first game to an extent i hope the story is longer than the last one and please still have the split screen stuff i had so much fun playing that with me mates this looks fucking awsome hell yeahready to die from awk should be on soundtrack as well looks promising after that excellent doom reboot i will definitely look forward for this one as for avalance studios well kinda worried especially after mad max and just cause 3 mad doom or doom max i need it this looks dope and generic at the same time fallout new vegas remaster at 044 that statue looks kinda like rick from rick and morty is like borderlands series but with other kind of graphics this trailer is full america fuck yeah look pretty good and reminds me of the doom reboot but the whole vast open world thing did put me off hopefully we get a structured campaign instead of the ubisoft go collect this thing over here approach why the fuck is it so pink just zoom the first person camera just a little bit other than that am gonna be there at launch so happy the mad max guys are getting a good ip to get stuck into please give us a mad max 2 maybe by 2021 they should have shown this trailer right off the bat those teasers were seriously questionable but this looks more promising a bit more doom a bit less sunset overdrive huh i have to say this looks a lot better than i was expecting so when do we get to see the trailers for the games we want hope this was accidentally leaked so they wouldnt need to stink up the stage too much so basically open world doom i see game with dooms hand to hand combat and weapon combat the mad max games vehicle combat and honestly when the most hilarious soundtracks ive ever heard i think we have game of the year here so pumped for this loved the first one its funny last week when it was leaked all the people shitting on it now everyone is cupping the balls cant wait for creation club to be added very nice video great music and editing as for gameplay i just doubt it 3 as we all know its bethesda theyre gonna fck things up somehow in the end this looks fun fuck live action and cgi trailers give us trailers like this if this doesnt have coop you are god damn retarded bethesda looks cool hope you wont fuck it up like fallout 4 like what i see i really do but wide open world makes me afraid of the content because mad max was a fucking shit game yeah thank you bethesda to give rage a follow up i am stoked its fucking good id and avalanche ok so like the first one this wont have a story at least not a worthwhile one i am slightly miffed at the change of aesthetic but i do love punk aesthetic so maybe it will all even out in the end tone and art style wise is this destiny 3 ok bethesda the flamboyant colors had me worried at first god dont scare us like that i thought this would be some gay mad max splatoon thing thank god or todd ok known chaos added certain color splashiness looks good from trailer so far this is a hybrid of fallout doom and mad max and its cool i really liked the first 1so im hyped i hope they dont make it too silly this all looks greatuntil they said open world that means making the game longer maybe adding more grinding gameplay adding additional weapons adding dare i say loot crates boxes lets hope they dont go down the road of other shitty developers who made games like cough coughstarwars lets hope it doesnt just on multiplayer but focuses on single player experience too ok im actually interested now this looks way more like borderlands than they probably want it to this looks awesome cant wait to see more this looks freaking great i cant wait for it wow why didnt you guys open with that trailer the live action one was kinda silly like saints row question bethesda who do i need to throw my money at for this game already im interested to see the degree of involvement that avalanche can have on the production of this game if id can bring something along the lines of dooms pace and sheer craziness and avalanche can bring their just causelike open ended world development and style well lets just say some money will be set aside anyone who preorders the game could win the first rage fallout 4 was dissapointing maybe thisll fill its void so mad max with colour bethesda have anounced swtich titles vr titles updates dlcs and even games before thier e3 and its still meant to be their biggest conference im so hyped no glory kills10 still not particularly hyped ill definitely try it out when it comes out i knew that the live action trailer people were complaining about wasnt gonna be what the game was like doom wasteland edition nice mad max fucked borderlands and their baby took some lsd and fucked far cry basically well it certainly looks different from the last game looks awesome tho i am deffintly interested first rage was underrated it took 7 years for a sequel thanks for making it happen its just borderlands without the cell shading mad moxxi and mad maxs love child the og rage was cool dark and gritty this is colorful light and gay id rather have no sequel than a shitty one well thats more like it please be good y e e t cant wait for this game i so enjoyed the first one seven years in the making also anyone who disagrees remember this is my o p i n i o n wingsticksareback holy shit the gameplay looks good and can stand on its own without that awful corny marketing my guess is the men have to do the graphics and gameplay and then you hired those typical marketing social media designer women to do the marketing because they are so completely disconnected its unreal drop that awful marketing campaign and fire whoever came up with it bootleg fallout so id is developing it i heard some were they werent reminds me of the mad max game so this is a mix of fallout mad max borderlands and doom this will be awesome ooooh the new borderlands game looks like a lot of fun i didnt wanted this looks like michael bay shit fallout 5 i cant freaking believe how amazing this looks i cant believe it its like my dream game i hope there is some coop this seems fun with friends this looks really heavily influenced by doom 2016 which is a positive surprise imo madbulletlands shut up and take my money i never asked for this how to pre order in steam i just dont know ill wait for reviews before i buy cause the first one didnt impress me avalanche studios fuck yeah woooo who else is excited for this game to be nothing like this trailer cant wait please dont fuck this up can you reupload this at 30fps instead of 24 its choppy as hell wide open world please no so15 fps the melee and gun models reminds me of the destiny games would love this on psvr even with a visual downgrade ill take the immersion if ids involved with this theres hope borderlands with normal graphics this oughta be good avalanche and id together holy crap this is gonna be so good and the andrew wk music fits so damn well i fucking love id software they make the best games looking good but i will now be that guy that starts pointing out things that i saw in the trailer that worried me extreme usage of motion blur which would indicate that this a 30 fps title because the panning of the camera with the blur didnt look smooth at all narrow fov or like i would call it tunnel vision simulator hopefully they will allow us to bump that up without having to fiddle with config files hell this should be an option on consoles too im a bit torn i liked the first game a hell of a lot avalanche is a great studio and the gameplay does look fun but the tone is insanely offputting no ones looks big picture if they are dropping trailers left right and center then they must have something big for e3 looks so good cannot wait classic bethesdadragging id software down the dirt road again it was better when they we cool still need to see more i hope you can customize the cars add different weapons armor plates different engines fuel system etc seeing this gameplay actually makes me exited for this game this looks great graphics looks insane almost doom like gameplay too looks like it just in rage universe that was some shit music that is nice 20 fps tho mad max epilepsy road hmmm looks dece but what trailer doesnt id wait a week till reviews and feedback is out not allot of gameplay for the gameplay trailer im just saying hopefully it will be as gory as doom a mix between destiny fallout borderlands doom and mad max take my money take it all i was worried but now the hype is real les hope its true xd this style sucks open world too doom was my goty in 2016 seeing that they id are helping with this gets me excited missed the first one but would assume this is a jumping on point since its been however many years big fing guns bfg i love it this is why i love bethesda and why is my dream to work for them now give us stable performance on pc and 60fps on ps4 pro now we are talking bethesda well fuck my wallet give me two im not saying it looks bad as a fan of rage still the best looking game on ps3 especially with a ssd i was quite curious about rage 2 that trailer killed any excitement i had for it this sequel looks completely unrelated to the rage universe which had a real narrative potential what we get instead is a silly cross between bulletstorm and mad max rage was substantially closer to fallout than borderlands but apparently id soft decided to abandon any pretence of uplifting the franchise much better than the reveal trailer uh for an fps game you really should have rendered this at 60 fps for youtube bethesda avalanche and id its like a bug trifecta humor aside i fully give credit to each of these studios for creating big ambitious games of course there will be bugs this looks fun i always thought rage was made by some shit company and it was trying to rip off of halo and borderlands at the same time inhale i was completetly wrong this game looks good and is made by a very respectful game company now that is more like it borderlands mad max style with the doom like gunplay hope its better than the first scripted vignette one i will buy it on 10 sale this actually looks great holy shit falloutmad maxjust cause sign me up haha i knew this game will be cool id software for fps and avalanche studio for open world both of this developers will make this game looks great the framerate hurts my eyes coming clutch beth excited for e3 i hope its story driven roses are red violets are blue no mad max sequelrage 2 will do holy shit aint knack but im takin it mad max borderlands this game ill be honest i was pissed yesterday cause of this being the only thing but holy shit this actually looks a hell of a lot better then i thought it would because the first one was sooo good doom serious sam bulletstorm mad max fallout far cry rage 2 just when i thought rage and series itself died with my ps3 time to get the sequel for my ps4 pro i love this game more than borderlands and fallout series yes i know both game series are awesome but i enjoyed the mad max feeling of rage better fallout 5 is that you so 1 this game is a reboot instead of a direct sequel to the original game or it takes place as the same time as the original game but follows a different character 2 this is probably on the doom 2016 engine which is awesome the old games artstyle is too warm and it hurts my eyes from time to time 3 the character abilities make the game fluid not gonna lie it actually looks pretty good im glad avalanche are developing this time ive always been a fan of their work why is this encoded in 20 fps looks like upcoming year could bring something at least worth to try games and not copy paste shit all devs do for long time after soooooo many years 3 holy fucking moly is this the game we all want d looks awfully similar to mad max and doom tbh so this game is a collaboration between id and avalancewow day 1 purchase for me i hope that there will be a collctors edition i looks kinda cool but not for me so essentially doom but on earth looks like the far cry 5 killer of 2018 doom guy looks like hes in the wrong game this might be fallout 4 all over again im good on this looks like a ton of fun might have to pick it up after starfield already looks better than the garbage that was the original game did i ever tell you the definition of insanity the one thing i not digging about this game is the shitty music ok id software doom stlyed fps plus avalanche vehicle combatopen world count me in so much rage great job bethesda the new fallout looks good i love raider backstory you had my curiosity now you have my attention this looksreally good well discount fallout doesnt look too shabby i can get behind this even if i thought borderlands 3 here and there this looks promising this looks really fucking fun well this is exactly what i wanted from what the trailer showed the game could have been two things either some happy peppy comedy shooter like sunset overdrive or a sequel to rage with more colour and personality and thank god we got the latter this looks really good but wtf is with the mutants they look like theyre made of playdough i had my doubts with yesterdays trailer but man this looks amazing now this is pod i mean post apocaliptic racing please let there be a multyplayer avalanche studios the guys who made just cause this has to be a great game soooooo no coop ill skip this one this is gonna be fun xd nice but i was hoping for elder scrolls 6 where are all the haters this is perfect it is taking what made the mad max game fun and ids amazing fps design and mashing them together in the perfect world i just hope the writing is on point mad maxfalloutdoomfuturistic shitbad fucking ass dont let this video distract you by the fact that the ending of the first game was fucking awful surrender the fallout ip to obsidian todd coward avalanche studios 3 love these guys cant wait looks good but when is fallout 5 due i really hope that this isnt the big game bethesda is trying to push this year this game just looks too crazy for me idk looks absolutely beautiful and cannot wait just look too cod iw ish with its combat and tactics system this looks great but after subjecting me to that announcement trailer this is a no buy from me on principle that looks way better than the first game really it looks fing insane well im interested now this should shut the ignorant haters d yes please wait fk please this is the postapocalypse gimme a copy now or ill skin you alive at 102 when we drive the camera angle move to third person o44 rick is that you if only this could be somehow ported to the switch well this looks fun so basically its everything i dreamed fallout 4 would be interesting move from bethesda softworks though if this blows the fallout franchise out of the water where do they go with fallout they didnt want to make a game of thrones game because they didnt want 2 competing franchises but now theyre risking their own fallout franchise by making a second post apocalyptic series that might beat fallout like it owes it money the trailer looks great though im excited to see more i hope theres a third person view holy crap fov slider please be in the game this game is literally perfect for the switch yea were is fallout or elders scroll at rage sucks get ready to die 113 i see what ya did there also looks like mad max crossed with boderlands i mean its looks ok but i would never ever buy it myself but if my friends buy it on ps4 then i would game share once again thank you in my hope for another rage i never thought id be this impressed by what they came back with all the lessons from doom and they even got avalanche to come help i adored their mad max game this is just above and beyond my expectations im so excited and so glad rage is getting its due borderlands 3 ohhh yeahhh no 60fps on ps4 no party i want this game just for the open world driving tbh wtf avalanche where da fuck my mad max 2 was expecting it to be open world exited for this one how many microtransactionsdlc will there be too ruin this game this song sounds so much like an other rock hype song its on the tip of my tongue does anyone know what i am talking about hopefully the driving part of the game is better if only avalanche wasnt doing this one their games are nothing but a boring ubisoftlike grind oh its fallout 352 neat from the guys that brought you mad max fallout and doom comes fallout mad max and doom the perfect lovechild of doom and mad max going to start saving the pennies now because i know this has to be right around the corner if the beautiful beth has announced it im motivated to live thanks bethesda well i guess this is gonna be the new doom game for me still cant wait for doom 2 aaaah after the last trailer seeing this is great a new adventure awaits us mad max doom fallout rage 2 looks ok but id is wasting their time make doom 2 bethesda please include a bluray dvd with the bulk of the game files ive skipped more games because theyre exceeding my data per month also put some info online on how much is missing from the discs to inform us the low data ratelow data allotment who are bethesda loyals doom on launch day took over 2 weeks and two months of data to download i wont touch any wolfenstein games knowing that so what if i dont like social justice color scheme is pretty stupid mass popularity of fortniteoverwatch and other colorful shit bothering them beyond reason also looks very rough technically like they have nothing to show yet but want to show anyway looking forward to it i love postapoc doom and mad max had some violent intercourse in fallouts apartment i see yesterday me rage 2 meh me after trailer hell yeah thank you bethesda game looks great but please bring back the old rage logo love avalanche studios they know how to make open world games and give you the tools to have stoopid fun looks awesome and epic just one comment though please no jetpacks wide open world jetpacks too soon too soon ive bad memories of that one that looks insane yes yes and yes big fucking guns big fucking explosions sounds like my type of game yeah not getting burned again ill be waiting for the reviews of this like all other aaa games before ill consider dropping 3540 on it no doubt the price will plummet too within 6 months too cough fallout 4 cough i saw 100 comments about this game is gonna suck i have to say this looks like a fun open world game and of course something to try to get 100 on pack your wingsticks its time tear some shit up pleasantly surprised by the look of this fallout and mad max oh man the hip 042 is that rick i need a fallout 4 style short walkthrough because this is just a bunch of flashy nothing it looks boring and too grey peoples opinions about this game changed real quick why the framerate looks bad long life bethesda this should absolutely be a worth a buy when this beast comes out id and avalanche boy oh boy this is gonna be amazing this made more justice than the trailer i can feel the doom vibe im pre ordering this game i was expecting more authority i very much enjoyed the first game all though im not all to sure i like the yolo vibe im getting from this the gameplay looks good but the tone is far from what i expected from a rage 2 but it has been many years since i played rage might be worth cracking it open again avalanche studios is the perfect developer for this game it just looks like a game they would make i cant wait for this game all we need is a release date looks like a doom reskin and the first rage ran like shit on highend pcs so im out mad max 2 would of been much better oh well even though people hated the first im sure their tunes have changed and are now daeing over it like all bugthesda fansbois do shame too because avalanche are an awesome studio this is doom meets mad max and im hyped doom fallout rage 2 okey im sold take my soul bethesda green blue but no red no switch version oh well holy shit this actually looks good its nuka world getting a very destiny vibe off the traversal system and force powers i guess thats the final frontier for bethesda game works they have every other genre covered is this the big game they were working on will this be a live service game if it is then ive lost hope still not sure what to make of this trailer its a lot better than the liveaction trailer though madmaxbattlefield survival i thought they stopped making boarderla damn thats some good lighting bethesda id i fucking love you lets all hype over a game that looks a generic as it can get this looks fucking awesome my body is ready i doubt this is one of the new ips todd howard said his team have been working on and pete hines recently said that this years bethesda e3 showcase is gonna be quite long so that means lots and lots and lots of bethesda open world gaming this year and next fuck yeah ive been begging for this for years and it looks far better than i could ever have hoped oh what a game what a lovely game i made a mistake judging this game im so in i was hoping for tes 6 this not as postapocalyptic as the first one the original rage looked awful close up they used really low resolution textures then dynamically added static to the texture images that way they could increase the memory usage without actually improving the quality of the visuals wtf what the hell happened wheres the people whos hatin on this game yesterday the people who judged on the live action trailer without seeing the gameplay the people whos hatin because of the pink sjw shyt and the people who said that they never asked for this game where are you now huh well wherever you are i just want to say somthin suck it why is the frame rate so low de fuck is this destiny look likes fallout doom and wolfenstien had a threesome rage is in the same universe with fallout yes im buying this meth heaven rage 2 tony hawks borderlands fury road this is literally my dream i once had a dream like this it was scary in game form its great it looks great gameplay trailer please dont put regenerative health please health items friendly reminder that if this game doesnt get a metascore of 85 or higher bethesda publishing will axe this developer like they did with obsidian and their fallout game this looks like you took from fallout and borderlands in order to fix the crap game you sold us years ago he said wide open world it better be you cheated us last time hmmm doom with open world nice 30 fps video and fov in the game is like 50 painful to watch i hope my pc will run this ryzen 5 matched with a gtx 1060 6gb dual fallout 5 looks pretty cool so far this is the very best surprise of 2018 youre not perfect bethesda but this is one of those things where i am convinced youre a great publisher that may actually learn from your own missteps and can somehow mix making profit and also delivering great creative works sure this is a sequel but it doesnt look like just another sequel of course well have to wait and see but you made a very good first impression with this just make sure the game is finished unlike rage 1 that stopped about half way through the story please battle royal in this gamethis trailer was awesome but did you guys improve the story oh please let this have more guns than just those shown its not fun to cause mayhem when your range of tools is limited no 60fps for id thats your trademark the gameplay seems fun but the game itself as no depth a bunch of psychos and ugly monsters to kill and thats it no storyline no characters no custom whatnot just shoot come on even doom has all of these but sadly i guess revealing this about a month prior to borderlands 3 and e3 means you kinda know how it will turn out still have trust in id though so maybe it will be good dont forget a final boss fight this time it certainly looks very different from the first onedarkness is not longer popularnow its all about colorful the fps drops are making me raggeeeeeeeee wowgroovy looks like borderlands without the cell shading i mean that in the best way possible sees doom and mad max mixed together a more ambitious crossover than infinity war i need it now i see you guys are really big into andrew wk i get a real mad max and borderlands feel to this is there online coop please be online coop this is a world i want to be in my favorite postapocalyptic game of all time is getting a sequel i cant believe my eyes hmmm almost looks as if they have done away with the lore of the first one entirely eh doom and mad max on lsd looks bloody awesome cant wait to see how this game will look on the xboxonex ill wait for reviews the first one on pc was so awful cant wait braindead shit for 13 year olds looks great but if its 30fps on console then no interest hope its 60fps like last gen this game is the child of borderlands and doom this looks like something i would never play who was asking for this i hope the actual gameplay is more stimulating than the first one this game is pretty awesome looking id play it but i like all bethesda game though lol this looks as amazingly insane as it does surprisingly colorful a universe where an astroid has the infinity gauntlet so much better than yesterdays trailer this one is actually a open world thank you looks a bit meh to be honest rage 1 was good but theres something missing from this that has me interested trailers cut together fast dont interest me i dont want just mindless shooting in a game i want a good story with rpg elements and maybe leveling up and rebuilding a settlement going from camp to camp killing the same enemies gets really repetitive dear disney if youre watching thisits high time now that you revoked eas star wars licence and hand it to over bethesda instead wait hold up yesterday most people were like who asked for this and the first rage was unwanted blah blah blah now its this looks fantastic etc bunch of hypocrites this looks good the gunplay looks like doom so good im excited it seems we might get what mad max should have been did you guys just license the whole andrew wk catalog its much better suited here than the announcement trailer now if you manage to squeeze it ingame im definitely buying it i was interested up until i read the words wide open world d if they made id tech engine look this greatdamnwe in for a sexy ass game so ready for this game what a shit stain rage 1 was awesome this one looks bit too much borderlands when it comes to mindless forced humor imo another open world style game oh hell yeahhell yeah now i see why fallout 4 was such a poor game this looks sick open world ill wait for borderlands 3 why id software doesnt develop this it is their game afterall hell yeah well congratulations for all 10 people who got rage 1 glad you got a sequel i hope its fun i dont understand why there are this many dislikes totally not rendend tailer lol cutscene not gameplay lol maybe few secs of gameplay only guys should i play the first rage borderlands without the cell shading so original 126 is this rage or serious sam why the hate haters gonna hate what an attack on the senses i am so ready thank you bethesda i loved the first game despite its flows and this looks a step into the right direction adding avalanche brilliant adding some just cause flavor i like it looking forward to it add multiplayer splitscreen like the first one and perfect im just hoping my pc can run thismy 1050 ti hasent failed me yet but it might need a 1070 ok i was skeptical but this looks fucking amazing also mutant bash tv is back this is what happened last time trailer looked awesome as hell but the real game ended up being short underwhelming and it had one of the most unsatisfying and terrible endings in gaming history lets hope this game is better and worth every penny love it something tells me ill be having frame rate issues with my current set up third person option please i wonder if you play as the same character from the 1st game looks cool hope they built an engine that can run mods alright im a lot more relieved now than when i watched the announcement trailer im playing through the first one for the first time right now and im really liking it so to see the colorful and wacky trailer really concerned me while its definitely not at gloomy as the first one its nowhere near as bad as i was expecting it to be fallout madmax doom farcry rage 2 there is an uncertain feel of sunset overdrive in rage 2 fallout 4 doom far cry 5 rage 2 holy shit i was thinking yesterday it might be better than rage 1 but its not going to be one of those games that stick out from the compitition but now im like holy shit this looks awesome big explosions and the mad max aspect of the first game intensified im not sure but i hope this game will also be released on the switch release date please i cant wait for this for a second i thought i didnt have pants on idk i already have feeling that there is nothing to do in this game not gonna lie this shit got me hyped avalanche studios welcome to 2 fps on console xd i hope theres no stupid leveled enemies because i hate then you cant kill halfnaked raider with only crowbar in hands just because he has higher level than you or he just bullet sponge that you have to shoot him about an hour say that i will play that game in 2018 please nice graphics mad carmagedoom lands lets hope it has better optimization that jc3 well already it looks 10x better than the first one so megatextures included this is actually ther very first videogame im hyped on for many years its about time thank you very much bethesda and and avalanche studios exactly as expected its a re skinned doom im fine with it being an action game first but i hope they also prioritize story side quests customization and rpg elements too damn i cant wait uhmm i wil play it but it looks a lot like borderlands did it whit fallout and had a mutant baby the vehicles xd what kind of elder scrolls online dlc is this looks amazing and much better than the first one but reminds me of bulletstorm i was sad mad max 2 wouldnt come out the cover of the game is awesome looks like bethesda knows what they are doing with their fps style games sort of bethesda arcade niche fps better not freezes when im playing it put it on switch rage setting combat from doom rage 2 looks like borderlandsmad max with more colour and a grain of rage kinda shame really liked the conservative loneliness of rage well see as usualhype the fuck out of itand then shit review it creators of the mad max game are making mad max in firstperson well youll better not fuck it up and switch u well this game is going my list of games i have a ton anticipation for which includes kingdom hearts 3 spiderman ps4 and beyond good and evil 2 dam this action looks intense they never disappoint nanana by mcr fit this trailer cant wait to play it but my gaming shop says 2019 whaaaaaat cant wait sooooooooo long holy shit a collaboration between avalanche studios and id software this just went from probably pretty mediocre to probably my new go to game for an adrenaline shot andrew wk party till you puke 3 3 3 many respect to the one who chose the trailer music looks great and interesting even though i dont like the song this works on me ok its not a new game of bethesda game studios but i guess thisll do it looks empty this is not post apocalypse this is garbage for teens looks good but sorry thats not rage maybe its weak argument but i just do not like it take my ing money i dont think final version cant get this level of graphic like this trailer fucking hype and switch i wonder if randy pitchford is sweating right now call of ragefinite warfare its amazing to see what kind of games are published if multiple companies are working on it bethesda for the amazing enviroment world creation and locations id for the amazing guns combat abilities and animations and avalanche for the racing and just the rage sequal in general hype the moment i saw the first few seconds it just felt like avalanche studios doom on meth love it looks promising better than that cringy reveal trailerim just hoping a doom sequel gets announced for next yearwill be bummed out i all of f id softwares time went to rage will this game have microtransactions or will it be one straight up badass game this game doesnt have chromatic aberration this game is a chromatic aberration give megive me thisright now switch fuck if they pull this off bethesda and the switch rage 2 in the switch looks like a ton of fun this is what happens when you give lil fallout steroids looks cool awesome if this ist compatible with vr from the getgo the framerate seems pretty low anyone else think this would have been a better trailer with andrew w k party hard as the music ladys and gentlemen rage 2 or how i call it the better doom so pretty much if fallout 4 was good please have coop the music and colors are so hype where is the gameplay tho never played the first one but this looks good like a mad max and doom mix far cry 3 already came out i dont see the preorder button doom meeting mad max insanity level is high hs this is more colorful than the first one yesterday everyone was hating on this how the internets opinion can literary change over night who actually asked for this doom im fallout style reminds me of bulletstorm stillcame outta left field but i can say now im pleasently suprised please please please id and bethesda allow us a beta or demo we need another season of breaking bad just so jesse pinkman can play the sequel to rage ok its actually looks cool dude futuristic apocalyptic and fantasy aesthetics all in one game lmao how could this ever back fire this just looks like pure fun and you cant say fairer than that this is just a trailer no real gameplay meh hey that means splinter cell is also real yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees change the box cover i beg you cant wait for more wingstick action the wingstick from the first game is one of the best weapons in my recent memory i love the music the shot at 125 looks the best to me too many enemies to count on screen reminds me of doom i love it how everyone were talking shit when they first released the teaser trailer and now yall changed your minds gameplay trailer in 30 fps this looks really good everythings coming up explodey anyone know if this is coming out in 2018 combat looks basic af looks like mad max on crack will it have multiplayer coop holy awesomeness great way to bring back rage day one congrats avalanche and everyone involved the fov looks terrible combat reminds me a little of crysis is it vulkan then it would be damn powerful for amd rage 2 the non binary story looks lit way to go bethesda so its just shooting mutants and racing with buggies no actuall story bethesda i was definitely skeptical but im in now looks like a blast and the music is perfect for this insanity ride just looks like a wasteland reboot of doom 2016 nothing impressive no one asked for this and with no one i mean even the most harcore rage 1 players did not expect a sequel since it was so bad and this is not even a sequel or not even rage at all this is a money grab game to lure idiots who still play games like call of duty its like rage had a baby with doom destiny wolfenstein im excited okey i need this haha bfg d this is an open world game not an rpg after watching trailer wallet flies out of pocket me wa wal wal wallet stop stop stooooo and there it goes to bethesda hq nice a game i wont buy d it was a great wellmade trailer the car combat seems more visceral than ever and the onfoot gunfights seem just as satisfying and hectic as before i especially liked that the avalanche studios logo popped up during the carcombat sequence and the id software logo during the gunfight scene my problems with this trailer are purely technical i think its not the best way to try to sell a relatively fastpaced or any first person shooter with a 30 fps youtube video especially because it seems badly encoded a lot of scenes felt like were running below 24 fps and it results in a bad viewing experience also next time please use a wider fov doom metal quake industrial metal wolfenstein late 60s early 70s classic rock rage punk rock any game that uses andrew wk for music has my approval fallout michael bay addition ok im hyped there i said it the real question is will the mini games be making a return or possibly new ones this actually looks really good strafing jumping lots of enemies on screen seems to borrow from dooms gameplay formula which makes it incredibly promising id be very more excited if the game have more dystopian feels you know this looks like have too much actions borderlands fallout count me in rage 2 infinity war got the case of watch dogssaints row syndrome where the first one was trying to be dark serious with a balance of fun then the sequel going balls to the wall fun the game no one asked for much much better than whatever the hell that thing was yesterday this however has me hyyypppeeeeeedddddd the gunplay of doomwolfenstein 2 with the open world awesomeness of mad max its fallout 4s methriddled insane son and i love it lets be honest the announce trailer yesterday was a little weird but this this is beautiful this looks insane i cant wait this looks really good forget the haters might be a day one for me bethesda always dropping heat open world aaaand thatll be it for my hype train awesome trailer this sounds great a bethesda open world with combat action made by idsoftware and explosions made by avalanche could this be any better what is the developer looks more promising than what i anticipated based on the announce trailer no ill just keep hoping its not a generic open world collectathon this this is rage 2 i fucking love it avalanche creators of just cause mad max id software creator of doom quake ok take my money bethesda okay ive never played rage before so its doom a bad fallout god dang that actually looks pretty dang fun it even looking to be a full on improvement over the first game as well i will buy it when will be released on nintendo switch i have a weird destiny vibe from it and i dont like that now see this trailer is so much better ill just forget i saw that one you showed us yesterday ok omg i want this so bad holy fucking shit this game looks fucking incredible i am so happy for this i loved doom but this feels so fresh and i love it glad to see they did this game justice holy crap this is going to be my favorite game ever this is gonna be one of the best e3 ever this game looks amazing thanks bethesda the only sequels we need now skyrim 2 and brink 2 i got bulletstorm vibes mixed with mad max and new doom love it all i can say is there better be coop the last trailer was so cringy but after this i know i will buy the game like i said loved rage even though theres flaws but im glad bethesda are learning from their mistakes and trying to improve on their ips instead of throwing them to the dust wouldnt mind brink 2 keep the original core concept and style of brink but fix everything else other then that cant wait d pleasejust give us elder scrolls 6 day one please let there be coop i find it more then anoying that they keep using the anarchy symbol not really knowing what anarchy means it doesnt mean no rules it means no rulers i actually wasnt looking forward to this but now i am im sold next thing this isnt their official e3 surprise announcement cant wait for e3 this looks so sick crazy exited for this release way to go avalanche id i can already see df making a video about frames dropping below 20 i hope im wrong this game looks awesome what a day what a lovely day well im sold gonna definitely buy this game this looks like everything i was expecting from the first one and more its so annoying how underrated rage is like niggas be hating and making assumptions and havent even played the first game this why we cant have nice things bruh smh rage 2 looks amazing and i cant wait to get my hands on it this looks fucking awesome this is like if ubisoft made a mad max game and added the cool and totally sick tone from watch dogs 2 in it ill keep an eye one this one as i enjoyed the first one idk maybe itll turn out to be a crazy stupid fun game without all the cringe like watch dogs 2 had i have faith in bethesda its like fallout with cars the only game that i really waiting for players first rage so sick and boring bethesda hold my beer boi fallout 4 nuka world for anyone wondering the song is party til you puke thank you shazam link httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqri3fo50k8y looks fun but this is not rage why does the player have powers that stuff does not exist in rage i could definitely see id after seeing this gameplay and it looks interesting so far hopefully this has an interesting story as wellif not fun wow another shooter designed for a controller no thanks this is like the exact opposite vibe of the first game plus its avalanche and open world im somewhat interested god i hope we can get the crimson elite armor doom was so fucking good rage had so much potential but a poor application that trailer is dope im hooked give it to me i thought it would be good but this looks fucking amazing i am really surprised how good it looks but the original rage story and characters were really mediocre hopefully rage 2 redeems the franchise meh maybe because i waited for doom 2 but it looks a bit generic and bland brown desert and wacky raiders fallout 4 mad max not excited lets be honest this is soo much better than that cringe worthy announce trailer i hope we get to create our character mad max x bulletstorm nice remind me borderlands cant wait to have the game looks way better than i expected holy crap this looks like so much fun and people were doubting the teaser yesterday this looks awesome see now this this is a good first trailer the other trailer that came out yesterday had no gameplay and didnt need to exist nuka world meets borderlands which meets doom which meets mad max which meets fist of the north star never played the first one but this game looks really fun considering the developers this game is gonna be worth buying no matter what idk what that horrible blurry gameplay is all about but hopefully its just some trailer effects it looked almost interesting until that cheese ball music started looks amazing you graphics is on fleek now please be a 2018 drop i cant wait for this so hype mad max and borderlands i am scard but hopeful no switch edition is it mp only lmao remember yesterday when everyone kept hating on rage 2 yeah i remember cant wait thank fuck they have done this game right looks a 100 times better than number 1 i expect they wouldve said if it was coop cause thatd make it next level good in a comment on the leaked trailer i said if its half as insane as the this the announcement trailer itll be a dream well it isnt the announcement trailer is half as insane this looks fucking awesome mb is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack unexpected game hype isnt this just borderlands with better graphics now thisthis puts a smile on my face looks pretty cool that 40 fov and motion blur really adds to the cinematic effect if it will not pay back then i do not know what to do this looks epic definitely buying this one looks fun but my god that music is awful i know in the last game we woke everyone up so im just wondering if this continues where the last game left off or if this is unrelated to that story 24 fps the game why is my pee pee hard what the hell it is shit does it have multilayer tough is it bethesda borderlands holy crap this game just surprised me now im waiting this take my money and i think that many also is surprised after this looks like doom action on steroids in open world jesus d good going bethesda shills everywhere i need it its like falloutmad max incredibly hyped now after this trailer correct fallout 4 not exactly a sequel everyone was asking for but the first game wasnt too bad and ill always welcome a new shooter from id software and avalanche that sticks a middle finger up at the boring military fpses you get today in favour of punky arena fun in a mad max style okay im sold give me the game please my ugly dick its imploding well bye doom 2 reboot well maybe e3 2019 see you then atleast we get this looks so good im so happy right now and to think yesterday people were bashing this game but the moment the gameplay was revealed everyones thinking wow this looks really good of course it was going to be amazing its the people behind doom nice to see rage back but jesus another generic open world this is all you can do bethesda the original game was really good imho but i feel this is another ubisoftesque shit doom mad max fallout blended together pure lsd injected in and then shoved down your fucking face ive gotta hand it to you that looked incredibly savage i love it d if no character customization then no fuck no ill stick to the fallout series lol to those who think its smart to prejudge awesome dat trailer did he throw a predator blade looks nuts im sold now thats how you do a trailer nice righteous looks as if the mad max game and borderlands had some freaky lovechild looking forward to seeing the first games ideas fleshed out you have my attention i hope andrew wk voices the protagonist so its doom with sand i could dig it okay now im definitely in holy shit is all i gotta say just sold me on this game go bethesda waaaay better than the reveal trailer what song is playing over the trailer welp i stand corrected that awful teaser yesterday gave me worries but with avalanche behind the driving it seems and id taking control of the shooting i can say im truly excited for this new rage while i still dont like the music choice this trailer was much better i dont like it its a madmax clone this is bad id tech engine 6 id software developer thats all that matters this looks incredible was that andrew w k omg rage is back wait a minute avalanche studios oh no bethesda about to fuck avalanche like they did with arkane and id and how they tried with obsidian feels like a softreboot and by that i mean more fun and insane than the first game i stopped playing because it became boring nice job taking a whole extra day to drop this instead of yesterday like u said fuck this bullshit nobody asked for this we wanted a doom sequel impressive you got my attention cant wait avalanche studios is involved okay now im gonna have to play this game watching it again this time on mute doom and borderlands hash up this is fucking epic this honestly reminds me of what gearbox did to borderlands to make borderlands 2 took something that was good and made it amazing i really hope its as good as it looks looks a lot better than i expected and superficially looks a lot more interesting than both rage mad max aight im down hell yeah this looks dope af haters gotta admit its cool now i love it its a mesh between fallout and doom and it works hype cade elder scrols6 im gonna make my guy look the like the most mlg dank pink haired hipster this game is making me very angry i never played the first game do we get to create our own character and car this went from something i never wanted to finding out avalanche is involved to now being one of my most anticipated games all in like 24 hours gives out 2016 doom vibes i hope they repeat history will there be a female protagonist option looks like a ton of fun cant wait to see more doom devs and just cause devs on one project its going to be fucking carnage i will play the shit out of this with my new gtx 1060 aorus the fov makes me want to barf hope to see this running on vulkan too 4k 100fps baby looks too generic like a first person mode for mad max game lol its about damn time this looks plain edgy im not liking it rage oh fuck me there goes 60 holy shit this looks amazing i hate the music choice for the trailers otherwise im all for the hype train why is it not coming to sens fuck you bethendo i dont like it too much colorful may contain content inappropiate for children now that we know the creators avalanche and id then hopefully bethesda game studios will have starfield so the teaser told us to get ready to die and now its saying were not gonna die jesus guys make up your mind this is bizarre i hope it would be with borderlandslike coop borderlands but not gay mouth watering rage 2 might actually reach the potential this franchise has motion blur motion blur and more motion blur get it today what a lovely day all shiny and chrome but seriously mad max meets doom and fallout i think we have a winner time to party holy fuck this looks amazing please add coop support for campaign for at least for 2 players and make the game harder but not that bullshit of enemies does insane damage if this has good online multiplayer features and stuff then i am in this game looks awesome fuck those idiots saying why a second game in the series why whats better some shitty high school game like persona lmao cmon is that supposed to be it explosionscars and guns i bet the storys meh seen it all before why are people getting hyped theyve seen 150 of gameplay and there was nothing original about it idavalanche holy shit what start to shiver looks like most of the gripes people had from the first trailer have been quelled remember yesterday when everyone thought it was gonna be a shit game i remember seriously though i had doubts yesterday but now i am hyped as hell nobody even asked for rage 2 almost like an unofficial sequel to avalanches mad max where the seriousness of the first game i did not expect that finally some borderlands 3 gameplay you think the requirements would be like those of fallout 4 maybe pushed a little mad max doom 2016 fallout borderlands rage 2 u mean gameplay looks pretty slick may pass on it for borderlands 3 though time will tell waiting for this when i played the original game i was too young i remember when my school mate gave that game for the weekend memories what was once a moody atmospheric shooter with dusty little towns and an aura of mystery is now a loud obnoxious double jumping frag fest made for millennials man this looks like something ive never seen before1111 wow this looks like shit my only worry for this game is lack of content i am a person who likes a lot of bloody weapons in a game and if it doesnt have that i dont buy now this this looks fun since yesterday ive been jamming the first rage on pc and im loving the throwback all it looks like is a slightly improved rage 1 with more variety of environments and toolset not impressed so looks like mad max meets doom with id and avalanche studios this could be be great i like it but it reminds me to much if destiny also i want it on the switch destiny mad max if there is character creation this would be the perfect place to play with tank girl this looks like a rage ripoff well its hard to tell with the quick cuts but at least its a decent developer game looks so generic gone are the personality of the first entry the world design guns and gameplay plays out like a modern stale scifi shooter this was expected when medicore studio avalanche jumped on board im so damn disappointed that i waited 7 years for this did i just see a mixture of all current bethesda published game this is why i love bethesda they surprise you with games you didnt even know were being made thank you for not giving up on rage holy fcking shit havent played the first one but this looks really good bethesda our only savior in this life service filled swampland of a game industry holy shit yes i hope this wont be bethesdas destiny game looks pretty as fuck and good as hell missed the first one i like playing doom and mad max is my favorite movie why even call this rage 2 waaaaaaaaayyy better than yesterdays god awful trailer rage 2 actually looks amazing hopefully its still a idtech powered game yes yes a thousand times yes looks incredible nice to see an underappreciated ip get some love trailer this looks trash gameplaythe hype is real wow all they had to do was show this first instead of that awful live action trailer and then everyones first response wouldve have been a little more positive mb tv is back where are the haters at speak up cuz this shit looks sick as fuck bethesda delivers again they take everything that was lacking in the first rage and blew it the fuck up looks like shit i got pleasure from first rage game because of cool shooting mechanics nice art design and ai wheres something cool in this trailer all dynamics of this video consist in music theme i hope this shit doesnt affect doom 2 release date because it must be real rage this game looks amazing didnt play the first rage because i lived under a rock but i will play this if it comes to switch and maybe on my ps4 if it doesnt come for switch my only problem is id like to join one of the clans instead of taking them down but hey maybe making yourself an enemy against the world could be fun to p this looks reallllly good oh my god its wonderfull d fuck yes thx for not giving up on rage bethesda i loved the first game despite the hate you got my money on this one this stuff looks awesome please support korean language fallout meets mad max wutthefuck this is awesome told you this was good shit double jumping seriously where is aim down sight is it only hip fire like doom rage had aim down sights again obnoxious ass music the first half of the trailer was alright then it went to shit this barely resembles rage 1 the video game industry is dead this is the worst console generation in history i wanted a sequel to rage for years and this is the trash i get rage meets black ops 3 meets sunset overdrive not looking forward to this ill buy it on sale if at all yeah man this looks legit i need the song in that trailer the atmosphere is lost cant wait for e3 still dont know why they made this uhhh im not too sure we need actual gameplay like all games now well wait and seecant get hyped for anything anymore thank you bethesda for giving us pc players proper single player games ps dont put microtransactions in it please me and your mom at 106 mad max beyond morrowind but is it coop this looks like a lot of fun count me in same company who made doom looks neat just dont force us to side with the pinkhairs and ill be good also any path of exile player realize those exalt dropping sounds d me when it isnt starfield game title kappa omg yes i want it man i want it so badly avalanche studios and id software is developing it count me in ok i was scared but this whips sack official gameplay trailer alright but wheres the gameplay i have to say this looks way better than i expected ok this actaully looks cool consider me interested quick question will there be psychedelic drugs looks absolutely fantastic and absolutely not like the prior game for me its like fallout 4 and doom hade a baby but mad max is the milk man dang cool idk why but i smell bulletstorm influence in this too especially with the juggle ragdoll physics oh hell yes thats nice now where is fallout 5 or elder scrolls 6 im being honest when i say that im slowly becoming more hyped for this game ive played the first rage and thought it was fun but it had some flaws if theyve taken some notes from bulletstorm then were in for a good time nice another game no one will remember like for honor and just cause 3 looks awesome dudes looking forward to playing this beast i hope its gonna be coop 044 to be fair you need a high iq to enjoy rage games you have my attention huh im strangely getting a bulletstorm vibe from this with added car combat i think that it comes from the shooting of enemies as they fly through the sky ive been waiting for this since that shit cliff hanger we have to wait a whole year to play it im about to playthrough mad max again to get this hype under control doom mad max borderlands andrew wk im buying i cant wait for three years after release for this game to still not work on my comp the elder scrolls 6 e3 2018 would this be focusing on roleplay like fallout ner vegas feels like destiny but in mad max atmosphere you most certainly have my attention rage 2 the sequel noone asked for the new borderlands looks great nice but still looks like first idgame without idtech in the end always thought the ip will be handed to someone else than id and also in the end the game looks epic cant wait hyped and so on the mad max game ive been wanting when you try to save a shity franchise with adding doom gameplay and stealing from mad max yeah sound good i can already see the 410 and 35 ratings obvious question multiplayer coop i bet like 90 of this will be completely downgraded but will it have a wingsuit my ass itches feels good to scratch will it character customize though this looks fun but wheres the switch boxart too bad the trailer isnt 60fps looks pretty great actually might be a lot of fun some of it looks like real life like the woods o it looks like it would be perfect for coop not hyped this looks good especially i like at about 45 seconds in what looks like its from a reality show maybe its just a set piece or maybe its part of the game this is doom and fallout on drugs basically so im guessing none u played the first one lol because all these its like this and that are all games that came after rage 1 except doom its the same gunplaygameplay just with enhanced graphics come on bros so all the games u guys are naming are like this or pulled ideas from this thank you bethesda i was skeptical at first i kissed skepticism goodbye when i saw avalanche was involved looks like everyone is a fan of smash tv as long as it gas a better ending than the first one and please please no silly tag doll effects im so sick of seeing people go flying when shot well there it is a colorful symphony of death and destruction hopefully we get to enter the wasteland soon my wingstick is thirsty 30fps slowmo 1080p yt compression 4k 60fps trailer god please all i see in this is fun this looks like such a good fcking time i hope they really capitalise on that open world this time with a more robust driving and car combat system looks awesome hope it has a lot of content to do with depth and dont have battle royale mode is this going to be id tech 6 engine i mean the graphics looks like it to me which would be good news since i dig id tech 6 after i played wolfenstein and doom amazing engine with stunning graphics and even better optimization and where insanity rules things start to become pink that fits actually like it lets see how its gonna be once it will come out combines some of my favourite games mad max boarderlands and titanfall this is gonna be good well shit why didnt you lead with this much better than that post apocalyptic music video trailer thats for sure time to shut up the haters omfg i was hoping on a new doom game but this will work yes this will work just nicely really rock n roll style ok car customization please make sure the game does not launch with bugs and glitches cant wait for the mattyplays indepth analysis oh what a game what a lovely game yeah this looks freaking incredible not to mention id avalanche coming together this is simultaneously the sequel to rage and the spiritual successor to mad max give me the mad max game weve been waiting for now with an actual ending maybe mm surprisingly not interesting as i thought i would be maybe e3 shall change my mindm holy shit thats awesome now we need a doom hell on earth to close the package rage looks marvelous congratz looking forward to driving those cars fuuuuu i love you bethesda for sht like this you making for us the players near the end i can see blue pickups looks like they are using some gameplay elements from doom is it my imagination or is the guy crouching and leaning with his gun an animation from fallout 4 can you customise your vehicle and will you be having any god forsaken loot boxes this looks promising did i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is this looks fun if the gunplay mechanics feel as smooth as doomthis is going to awesome i hope that it comes to the nintendo switch hmmi can work with this cant wait for mattys analysis hopefully this will shut up the whiny fucks from the first trailer this is already an improvement over the first game on switch plz this looks fucking fun cant wait till 2019 looks like all the other garbage thats come out in the last 5 years wtf is with all the retarded horror fps games obsession just make the pc launch proper delay if you have to fix it upit was a complete mess at launch for rage 1 on pc it still is a mess pretty fucking awesome forget yesterdays trailer this is more like it what a day what a lovely day this looks crazy its like mad max meets fallout what the fuck is the game at e3 to you being able to tease all this games vefore e3 this looks sick cant wait to play it will there be skill trees though waiting so long for the sequel finally i see reasons to be hyped will preorder on my xbox one x asap this doesnt really look like anything special i love bethesda fuck yes get ready to rock this is too different to original rage nobody asked for this hype bois amazing it looks a ton of fun oh fuck this is cool uffff bethesda just why holy crap the graphics are amazing mad max borderlands fallout rage 2 and i must say it looks spicy bois im gonna be really mad if there is no coop in this uhh release date it better not be in september im inmissed rage 1 but ill totally check this out for sure love you id and bethesda great work guys knew the sequel was coming its doom and mad max mixed together this looks fun as fuck thank you bethesda thank you as someone who didnt really wantcare about rage 2 im pleasantly surprised it looks fucking great instead of dropping this shit you guys should be working on the new elder scrolls and or fallout preorder our game that has no release date are you fucking serious gaming is shit wow avalanche studios hit it out of the park with this sequel hype intensifies 30 fps video why nice and all but one problem wtf is going on with the frame rate so guys do you think the first one is worth buying actually its pretty damn good and another open world god damn bethesda xd doom and mad max a match made in heaven it would be cool to create your own charachter and chose your own factiontribe just like in fallout 4 i hope this will be more fallout and i can tune up my weapons this gameplay was amazing this looks fucking insanely good im in love with this now let us pre order on steam wheres starfield we better get a bethesda game studios title this year hopefully the game actually has an ending this time telling you right now bethesda if you dont add a fucking fov slider to this which you have never done to any game ever you will not sell any pc copies that is honestly one hell of a reboot looks fuckin awesome bring it on avalanche the only question left is when holy shit this looks really good yeah this still looks too generic holy shit this game looks amazing im so glad they went with open world they kept the great vehicle play from the first one this looks like itll be a fantastic game not too far off from the aesthetic of the first one either i fnck need play this game loved first rage but not sure how to feel about this looks pretty cool it looks a little like destiny without the spaceships was dat rick from rick and morty avalanche do us a favor and make mad max 2 and renegade ops 2 ok this is bad ass man this looks fantastic and avalanche studios toomy god this is going to be one epic game get bulletstorm borderlands out of my life please this game screams fallout doom and borderlands and i fucking love it cant wait to see more of this game ok that looks fucking good im in on hype train finally a proper trailer i like this more that the live action cringe trailer from yesterday most of this was scripted but the developers have plenty of experience in making a fast pace shooter i just hope the world is as beautiful as shown and has plenty of content and doesnt just rely on gunplay im gona play the shit outa this game doom 5 apocalypse fallout madmax doom borderlands rage 2 im intrigued definition of trash what is that fov i hope we can change it on pc yet another brainless shooter no thank you doot but better with cars im a simple man i hear andrew wk i get curious looks awesome cant wait not gonna lie this look pretty guud bois what engine is this on 114 pharah is that you holy shiz i just replayed this last week i guess i should play more games i want sequels of xd yes me want now temper your expectations children need i remind you what hype can do to a game no mans sky avalanche studios who made just cause 3 are helping with this game just cause 3 was a total pile of laggy shit lets hope this aint the same fury road i loved playing the old rage game it was too funny but this looks awesome as long as i can widen the fov on pc ill play this game because the fov and graphics didnt look so great in this trailer this looks sick im actually reppaying the original at the time of watching this and i got saythis look absolutely nut shit and i want it all anyway this looks pretty cool well was not expecting this haha looks great wow looks amazing that actually looks hard but the real question is will i be in it to mark settlements on your map no switch version thats sad looks great keep up the kickass work id and avalanche is this doom not what i expected but looks interesting i take back what i said about this game being like if mad max had an affair with suicide squad and this is the offspringthis looks like someone just said lets make another doom game but with less shades of red and throw in a post apocalyptic of the lord of the rings w future stuff yaaay another open world game with a empty world and scripted fights yaaaay looks fun for the most part and collaboration between avalanche and id seems interesting cant wait to see more and i really do hope there will be a fov slider avalanche you have my attention another great company ruined by retarded feminists is this borderlands 3 or suicide squad who put borderlands in my fallout damn im hyped for this game even tho it looks like it plays sorta like destiny and mad max had a love child were people asking for a sequeal to rage this looks fucking awesome this is what mad max game should be well done my prediction basically far cry but with apocalypse and mowhawks 2185 thats one year before the reapers come noice again loved the 1st rage so csnt wait for this baby to drop fuk yeah hope they drop a revamped copy of the 1st one for the new gen consoles i need it that looks fcking awesome looks like what i wanted from borderlands if this game does not have coop i riot and dont buy it cringiest trailer ever man this year is not looking good with all these games coming out like rdr2death strandingspidermancyberpunklast of us part 2and now this fuck ya its great im gonna buy it what a load of chaos this is the real mad max game we have been waiting for im getting a weird destiny vibe insanity rules its like skyrim with guns ive waited a long time for this aaaaaah yes thank you 3 when can i pre order io sar il primo a comprarlo fantastico the beast game this is super hypeeee i had my doubts after the first trailer meh id pick it up for 25 30 quid not 50 though this game is gonna be ass lol looking real good this game looks fucking crazy id expected nothing less from you bethesda why does this game exist in the same world as borderlands love those mohawks 3 i dont get all the hate people bitch about devs doing the same old thing then they come up with something unique and suddenly thats a problem too cant wait to play rage 2 oh and yeah original rage is underrated my opinion confirmed rage 2 has bfgs doom and rage are in the same universe i hope its well optimized yess a mix of doom and borderlands material if make your own cac then yes if preset cac then no editthought of few more things to say 1 it does look some what fun from this remind me abit of titan fall with the whole 1fp and jumping and punching 2 making you own cac ala fallout dragon age dragonballxv xv2 ect ect looks grim as this looks fp only but then again it could have 1and3 fp like elder scrolls and fallout time will tell 3 as i have never played rage 1 was there any cac besides from like weaponcarlevel up was hoping to play as the ark survivor but nevertheless im hyped omg im completely exited this is insane i even broke a sweat yes please no one asked for this but now we all fucking want it cause that shit looks awesome do we play as the same guy in the first rage or is this a new protagonist borderlands is that you real like it so far live action didnt do much for me but holy shit this looks great cant wait fallout mad max doom range 2 why all the hate for this game jesus christ ease off of the goddamn motion blur in the game it is hurting my eyes i love how avalanche didnt gave a shit about rage and made mad max 2 but with crazy shit weapons looks fun reminds me of sunset overdrive if it had a kid with borderlands might as well be optimistic about it like if sexy wow it looks interesting oh fuck the hell yes party till you puke nice 15 fps trailer this actually looks amazing but will it have denuvo now this is what im talking about better bust out the first rage game and relive that memory i take back what i said about not wanting this i want this and i want it now lol awesome trailer was hoping for a new vegas remaster but oh well ok after 10 seconds i was already like yeah im buying this im raging because of the framedrops is there co op not enough dubstep and explosions10 good luck next year never clicked so fast someone really liked playing as a warlock in destiny mad max bethesda edition that sucks i wanted a 10 minute gameplay reveal like they did with doom wow reminds me of a realistic borderlands um holy shit oo this black ops 4 battlefield 5 and red dead 2 neat billions gone in the blink of an eyethanos oblivion remastered please pls repair shooting system perfect im the 10th viewer i hope this doesnt turn out to be like wolf2 first bout fucking time bethesda smh i can feel frame drops in this trailer xd finally ive been waiting all day first love you bethesda mad max on lsd feeeeeek yeah lets go what kind of borderlands is this omg doom borderlands mad max and from bethesda a dream come true i loved the first one this will be a instant buy dont seem any gameplay at all thats scripted af being very sceptic hope they dont mess it up like the first one didnt expect the day to come where i was more excited for a rage title than a fallout title eh looks too logical and coherent devs need to take more drugs makes biowares anthem stuff look lame avalanche is really rocking it these days i lived near the company who made rage 1 pretty cool to me it looks more like a bulletstorm sequel than a rage game oo hope bethesda havent messed with this too much as fallout 76 is an always online multiplayer game which is a huge disappointment so hoping this is the same as the last rage game and it gives you the option to play online or offline no internet connection required 303 particle effects the gun love those graphics cant wait to get it on my pc the wait was fucking worth it the rage we needed i was so hard for this and now im hard again maiq wishes you to find artifact this looks like the green haired mutated stepchild of doom wolfenstein and mad max cant wait to play it goty of 2019 looks cool fallout 4 on acid yes finally is it free tho age restricted man i wished for fallout 5 rhhhh rhhhh im getting really angry to buy this game a son of dishonored and mad max looks like borderlands 2 remastered 20not that im complaining doom destiny this game borderlands 3 has been pushed back so rage will keep me busy till then the shotgun looks like the one from doom not a tps not interested this looks very crisp fortnite crossplatform though we need this on switch yes please most of the gamers will play this on ps4 what extra content we get for you bethesda d you guys are easy to sell this game is trash yassssss i was waiting for this game for years if you could replace the song for this trailerwhat song would that be mad max in bulletstorm were those blood thirsty things zombies expect a downgrade hype from 0 to 000 yawn when it come out please no rules is the new rule this looks awesome im so ready for this another open world game that will be listed in 2018 underdog games so wheres my blood bag ist it 60fps haha mad max meets fallout meets cod definitely gonna pass on this generic gameplay trailer only 10sec of gameplay if borderlands 3 fails to appear im getting this just asking ive been playing alot more singleplayer games please make ps3 games also yeah thats cool but all i really want is for fallout 3 nv to be remastered for the ps4 looks so chaotic and fun maps or open world funny how they also developed mad max an openworld shooter i thought devs stopped making multiplayer fps games were saved ugh open world screams repetitive unless they straight rip off borderlands looks like borderlands and destinys abomination what a waste of time call of duty trash warfare brown for days free to play new fornite give it to me really hope this lives up to the hype being generated going to be off its face if it does another open world snooze fest nope far cry crackdown rage 2 that has to be joseph seed talking greg bryk mad max has nothing on this i guess walmart was right andrew w k seems appropriate walmart was right this is borderlands doom had a child the fov hurts my soul mad max giants a little fortnite rage 2 i think i had a seizure half way through the video i see theyre going with the bulletstorm type of advertisement reminds me of badlans im looking forward to this please coop consider this bought bethesda never disappoints still waiting on elder scrolls finally they have a cooler pallet the wingblade is back so much fun i had a feeling it was bathesda created it borderlands fallout cant wait i like twinks with bubble buttswas there a reason for me to put this here no no there was not looks chaotic in a dumb fun way need pure gameplay still waiting for kingdom hearts 3 graphics look dogshit consoles have to ruin everything ffs ok cool but is there coop tho sponsored by walmart canada i was hoping for a new fallout game but this looks way better this was a huge surprise and it looks like fallout and doom combined so basically the most epic game to ever be created so far or at least i hope avalanche studios dont they make the just cause gameshow did they end up helping with rage 2 eh id rather just have another mad max game and doom welcome to the new mad max is there coop if there is then im sold another open world game yay looks generic af will keep with borderlands thanks though for trying excellent trailer i hope the world is talking about this right now ok this look like a ton of fun i see downgrade inside the mountain i see downgrade burning the trees i see downgradeeeee checks bank account 690 i have enough fallout mad max and destiny in one game the only thing that would ruin this kind of game would be too serious vibe or a singular enemy faction which i cant stand enymore and can ruin the atmosphere even if the gameplay is great the atmosphere is what glues the game to your mind even after a long time im jumping on the hype train well i went from not at all interested to actually pretty excited to see more looks insane yesterday i didnt even know about the existence of this sequelnow its a fing day one buy it looks cool but it doesnt look like rage in the sense of world and society it looks like borderlands or mad max waaay much better than farcry 5 sorry to say but i dont know why its like doom fvck yeah i hope to see a rick and morty easter egg in this game all these kids who say borderlands and the original rage came out before mad max seriously how do you not know mad max came out in 1979 smfh so basically its just doom plus mad max well this is like 12 years too late but exciting ah i guess ill have a use for that gtx 1080 i bought for 465 this and metro exodus online is about to be crazy like dark souls with guns well ok then color me curious too much motion blur for one trailer insane thank you bethesda a new settlement needs your help i will mark it on your map so doom meets fallout and mad max my soul has been preparing for this moment trying to appeal a little too hard to the borderlands crowd nice high end pc footage gameplay looked fun but everything else was dumb yall mind if i praise insanity ive never played rave but it looks a lot like a more action paced fallout how similar is it to fallout this is awesome i could never dive in borderlands for some reason so i hope this will scratch this itch of mine and seeing this is id software there is a high probability for that 7 long years and thus bethesda has bless us once again is this multiplayer or just solo this is like the best evolution a franchise could have epicness this game needs glory kills like doom love it is there coop anyone who has played rage 1 knows rage 2 is going to be fun going to have s this going to be an rpg game is it going to full online coop im really impressed and hyped now if borderlands and bulletstorm had a love child this would be it a little borderlands a little doom a little call of duty and a little bit of a few other games nice one avalanche will give us the graphics bethesda will give us the bugs this have multiplayer idtech unreal mad fallouterlands finally rage was my favorite game when it was released and a second game just makes my pp wet insert i didnt ask for this deus ex meme much better than that live action atrocity of a trailer they put out the other day but actually this is super mario rage vol wish this happened in real life pls stop comparing to skyrim looks like doom mad max edition hopefully it has alot of execution moves needs a synthwave soundtrack let the hype begin seriously i was skeptical when i watched the announcement trailer now this its now on my radar really looks dope dont know if i should buy this or wait for playstation 5 with all the dlcs bethesda already tried to fool me with skyrim my money is waiting for you was already leaked rip single player only im looking forward to this guess this will have to satisfy my itch for a mad max sequel is this multiplayer somebody plz tell me basically this is falloutdoommad max thank you kanye very cool im really glad theyre embracing the more neonpastel color palettes it looks a lot better switch release wow bethesda looking great with a rage comeback doom punk edition looks cool tbh looks like a lot of the assets have been reused from mad max all the people saying this means starfield is cancelled you realise theyre actually made by completely different people and actually have basically nothing to do with each other its destiny with effort and content needs more motion blur please have smooth frame rate its all i ask my body was waiting for this well that comes out this year for sure guess the e3 leak was true waiting for borderlands 3 though mad max and borderlands had a baby i have waited for this for so long now it is open world and all bets are off lets rock this apocalypse i can already smell the bugs and glitches on release its like borderlands but with less guns only bethesda can make a game look this cool this looks cool i was hoping for a better fallout with a brilliant substituteidea instead of vaults but looks like a borderlands substitute with less identityidk well see i guess so this is what they where working on instead of elder scrolls 6 hmmmmm whats next so this is a thing hmmm ill get it on clearance when its 80 off i hope its a little bit like bulletstorm and maybe runs on the new doom engine some scenes resemble a mad max game i didnt know i wanted this do bad i hope this runs well on my ps4 slim if not then ill get it for pc and at this point i think im ready to just get the ps4 pro just for future games mad max fallout overwatch rage 2 what a terrible brain dead music is there going to be co op mod in it but is it coop in avalanche we trust coming soon a sequel to a game no one asked for borderfall world of mad doom borderlands fallout mad max doom i need it ok now im super hyped will they release the game multiple times like they do with all there games game looks dope tho well this is a day one buy for sure finally bulletstorm 2 ugh no thanks looks disappointing lol where is the real trailer i cant wait perfect my hype level is 100000000 boots on the ground please this game feels like a madmax sunset overdrive doom farcry 4 wolfenstein hyper boderlandish sense badass unadulterated style of game i think ill look into this in the future new fallout avalanche is a great studio but will blake griffin return too so its borderlands doom and madmaxi dont need this bethesda is this new borderlands fake gameplay lol for the hipsters out there i tought this day would never come my face is wet with tears of joy this looks so fun the live action trailer was disgusting ah yes because we all needed a sequel to rage the most forgettable 610 game of all time i hope it has coop i can tell this game will make me rage this will be the game that nobody asked for and nobody knew they wanted and needed it looks incredible now this right here looks fing fun forget doom and wolfensteinrage 2 ftw so off topic but i had to tell someone on netflix michael c hall also known as dexter is in a new show called safe i recommend it its amazing but does it have john goodman tho this reminds of another game called brink same quality just louder music f2p or nah borderlands the fallout of doom would be nice to have some metal music playing when killing these people 100 bethesda game are it avileable for vr hope bethesda licensed andrew wk songs for all their trailers this e3 my ps4 is ready to melt down its processor bring it on doom had a baby with fallout eh borderlands but more seriouslooks amazing borderlands 3 is also expected to be released soon this should be fun bulletstorm 2wow i hope they bring back coop an openworld fps no way ive never seen that before coop focuses as well gotta love modern aaa gaming some of the creatures look like the ones from resistance it actually looks like a lot of fun i wasnt expecting that looks interesting ill buy it so far that canadian walmart leak is accurate why not wait for e3 can you make star wars clone wars and complete saga in ps4 ps plus paid games are paid free games are free this is not gameplay looks sick gameplay looks dope just the music tone cringe of these trailers really makes me not want to buy this game man i enjoyed rage 1 the story was trash but the gameplay was great confirmed ign will give it a score above 8 if it doesnt i will commit suicide this looks sick mad max meets doom definitely influenced by the latest doom game so fallout 4 with color this looks mildly interesting at e3 the real stuff right bethesda d why does this look so fun sees id logo ohhhhhhhhhhhhhthat makes sense destiny 3 if this gonna be pure chaos exploions shooting and other fun stuff this might be cool this game better not be disappointing because just cause 3 is a framerate issue nightmare i sure hope that andrew wk himself is voicing one madman in this game looks amazing next year is going to be awesome ur late ign beat u to it so this is the game fallout 4 wanted to be huh thanks walmart serious sam for millennials looks great hype from 0 to 100 that rage scream power sounds badass when is comming the ps5 oh boy the leaks are real rage 1 was total garbage i hope this is way better this looks dope it seems the bulletstorm 2 is not needed when are we getting a horde mode still not good enough for me to spend money for a 7hour campaign ill be done the same day i get it hard pass ebay 1599 just bought it at the right time i see pussy game this is i still wish you guy would fix the aim sensitivity its soooooooo freaking bad for xbox and probably ps4 too you wanted no pause popups damn right too late though i quit playing in june dear developers add a new ability telekinesis with this ability you can throw enemies and cars please add it how about repopulating the goon squad camps thats the most fun part of the game going in and wiping out the goons in new and interesting ways but once you kill em all they dont come back think thats kinda stupid leave the loot out but let the goons back in have they removed some features after launch im shure there was a third mbtv minigame in this where u fight waves of enemies halp p this game was freaking awful amazing gameplay but a disrespectfully short story i paid 60 for this game and replaying it with my same weapons doesnt make me feel better personally i still feel cheated we need many more missions that actually work idk where else to say its great but their is a glitch that is breaking the game and almost breaking my console i mean i still havent gotten my bfg next time you make a game dont make the addons so fucking convoluted and impossible to get i and many others had absolutely no idea you had to do some weird sign up thing to obtain the items we rightfully should have just been given since we paid for them even after the sign up the bfg and other items never triggered i sold this shit to game stop and will never buy a rage game again or any other bethesda game again the only game ill buy from you is doom but i refuse to preorder because itll be some bullshit where we pay for items and dont get them so fuck that do a blood mod or cheat pls 4 ps4 i love this game still player more than 30 hours rage 2 is the game to set the limits of gaming quality in 2019 yet fucking borderlands want to stay in 2005 with their cancer textures thx for this game add more things to the world and variety in the npcs bethesta softworks damage is to low when super knockback activated fix it please waaaaayyyyyyy better then youngbloodwaaaaayyyyyyydid i mention its better i love it but can you make it so we can build a base or something to do in the wasteland is pretty boring to drive around maybe even some customizable cars put execution mode and let me see my character in the camera mode this is a great update time to reinstall the game and give the new game mode a try i hope the next update adds more enemy types specially the larger ones more story driven side quests and better vehicles guys how can i activate cheats i wish bethesda would just come out and admit they sold a half baked title and stuffed it full of openworld fetch quests the entire road map is so obviously left over content that its insulting stop pumping out substandard crap and charging your customers to fix it you corporate goons obviously id did a great job of the combat but even that is just a reskinned doom engine honestly used to love this company wtf happened why does everything bethesda touch end up with grubby monetisation and uninspired game loops now you guys produced some of my favorite series and now it feels like its run by a sleazy board of greedy investors who havent touched video games for yearsor ever what the hell is going on guys over hyped this game was ordinary so does the game have achievements now through bethesda launcher will it fix the empty open world slow useless vehicles when you can fly or lack of enemy variety good trailer but screw ozzy man for supporting egg boy add new weapons and actual gun customizations that change the model do controllers have adjustable deadzones or were they at least adjusted for me they were huge and it didnt feel good to aim so i gave up on the game the guns and shooting were what i was looking forward to the most looks cool but how much of this is free and how much is locked behind shitty microtransactions basically i barely used the abilities except double dash double jump superspeed running and the shield shotgunrocket launcherplasmabfg basically solved every problem i died 2 times on the hardest difficulty diamond geezer voice pack all achievements it was fun 3040 hours i had all the weapon upgrade before even started the 2nd3rd skill tree xd after rage 1 i really wasnt looking at rage 2 to kill it still feeling a meh sorta vibe i still cannot play this cuz of some graphics card problem i think i just press new game or continue it is loading and then it crashes completely nobody wants this how is any of that worth a hq update video well okay some of the extras sounds interesting but who boasts about skippable shit and last time i checked ironman mode ng and ultra difficulty are absolutely nothing to cheer about is it a good update yes definitely but this just screams look at me look at me i mean yeah i enjoyed the game but ffs this just reeks of desperation please keep all that bloated bullcrap for you all i am interested in is real addons with story and real things to do i will surely pay for them but this free boring nonsense is just a waste of work time we need more enemies or at least make some kind of modifier of enemies count so everyone can adjust amount of them like from default amount to atleast x3 more thank you guys for not giving up on this game can we please get the shrouded swords so i just spent two days getting murked up and down the wasteland to beat it on ultra nightmare difficulty not even gonna lie tho that is the most intense thrilling shit ever totally recommend bethesda the rage never ends me bitch it hasnt even started great update looking forward to getting back into the game oh so they disabled the pop ups so the game is playable now iron man mode ouch that hurts 3000 doesnt exactly fix the problems with the game like how there is nothing to do no giving the ability to just replay the same thing isnt a good solution awesome but worst cover art ever please add infinite ammo new game plus yessssssssss i want your babies what aussie man review fuckin niiice i was all like wait a fucking minutei know this loose cunts voice nekminnit thank god no more popups every 5 seconds we need real cheats cmon god unlimited ammo slo mo kills these cheats is crap sorry plzzz put this in when will we get new weapons hell yeah i love rage 2 just finishing the game up with 50 hours on the timer going to start again on ultra nightmare cant wait to play the dlc too hopefully it adds more enemies make new game plus rage 2 for nintendo switch rage2fornintendoswitch nintendoswitch bethesdasoftworks bethesda nintendo i hope the new dlcs have way better stories and more linear sections cause thats what id do best but i doubt it yeah why wasnt this in the original release doom slayer with blacowitz voice the ultimate killer i hope they fix the mutant projectile sound glitch it drowns out all the other sounds and im really just trying to listen to the music have to admit this was a really good update got super bored of this game in like 2 hrsnothing new or unique about it now this is a trailer all i wanted was a linear dungeon with survival horde rooms not a tweek in dificulty numbers because i still gotta drive kilometers to get to the action nothing killed my enjoyment more than the lack of 4k support on console first world problems i know but ill wait for that update the evil within 3 please the game is not bad but its too simple and it get bored at then end of the game wow i forgot this game existed that ultranightmare mode xd i beat doom 2016 on ultranightmare i was disappointed in this game combat was fun for a good while but eventually got stale but the story open world and driving sucked and its a damn shame considering i loved the first one despite its flaws oh and what the fuck happened to the awesome npc animations and why were the wingsticks shite those aspects of the first game were great i still dont know what this game is this game is on sale for quakecon think i might pick it up for 40 bucks throw in the doomslayers armor from doom 2016 and youve got a deal i guess its a pick up for me then all of bethesda needs the rage team working on game extras because this is what they all need ok the logitech g is just too annoying you could try making the story interesting too great gameplay horrible story line how about an ozzy man voice pack as much as i love the main voice actor i cant wait to try bjs voice is it just me or was that ozzyman funny the devs said there will be no new game i really want to buy rage 2 id and bethesda as i love fps games but please please remove the fact that you have to create an account to play feels wrong hope this is taken care of untill then no buy player made mods would be bad ass dont forget theres also now a flashlight to see in all those dark corners this is how you do it looks great still havent picked the game up but when i do im glad to know a whole shmorgus board of content will be there i personally like rage 2 but this trailer was too cringy probably has more content than the main game menu lag fix when doesnt this game suck or something rage 2 is extreamly boring like ubisoft game ill be honest i have really enjoyed my time with rage 2 had alot of fun with the game and looming forward to playing the first but hopefully not last expansion coming in the fall thankyou id software this is the kind of update you should be doing bethesda now do something this good for fallout 76 cool ozzy man is that you waaaat bj voice pack need that let me know when the open world is less empty and actually has content and i might consider playing again the wolfenstein voice pack is dope and that smug cliff no one talk about that smug cliff stop working on other games start working on elder scrolls 6 didnt this game flop mad max on steroids what is even this game the video started and i disliked it i hope they are doing multiplayer mode yo cant wait im really excited for this game this is like a mashup of jak 3 jak combat racing mad max and fallout its like the out side of the city of cyberpunk 2077 rage 2 or bl3 does it have online is for ps4 wait its available on pc too 21fps telling you now song title ok nobody has say it yet even after a year this game is a fortnite player killing simulator and i love it fpks new genre defining game the enemy npcs models in this game resemble the average fashion of nowadays online gaming and music industry hey im older dont like rap guess i could always turn it off what is the tune its sick love it nice game brain melting iq dropping demoralizing game yay another one wanna a joke far cry new dawn this definately looks like it will do until cyberpunk 2077 better game engine than far cry so you are strong i feel as if ubisoft saw this idea of a colorful mad max game and tried to copy it for their new farcry game my wallet is not ready neither does my credit card who cares if you dont like the music on the trailer all its doing is representing the game and it does that well the song suits the trailer and thats all that matters not your opinion boycott bethesda mad max fallout in the future give me name music please i hope that the final will be better than rage 1 what is the music borderlands is boring and every enemy rushes you like idiots this will actually be fun name of the song i want this game now is it multiplayer im sick of open world games no steam no deal i agree with what some of you are saying about the mortal kombat trailer so pumped for rage 2 mortal kombat this is what great trailer music sounds like for an upcoming title anyone feeling me like youre trying to get a feeling that this is supposed to be a serious game but the music and the random comedic scenes made it funny i guess we ignore them selling cheat codes i love getting less features that could be implemented for little to zero cost because i didnt want to spend an extra 20100 to get things made before the game is even close to release does nobody realize how crazy it is to hold back content this game will flop without a doubt not that into this fortnite hiphop look i want to see free roam gameplay video before i buy please danny brown nice choice borderlands 3 is gonna have some serious competition borderlands the handsome collection this part of mi life its called happiness xd please 60fps looks epic i see true potential here no these is rage 2 and i play frist game rage is a fan game bt rage 2 is bigher is an open world i thinck these is d game of d year far cry new dawn is the mobileandroid version of this game i might buy this instead of far cry and fallout mad max with bulletstorm sounds like danny brown better work on release bugthesda honestly i used to play rage but i dont get the same vibe from this one that i did on rage 1 no doubt cannot give a final though unless i play i was unsure if i would get this game at release but hearing danny brown sealed the deal whoever made that trailer is a legend why he kill the punks well goodbye social interaction goodbye bedhesda amen i can only buy on steam i will buy far cry not on steam not buying it this is gonna be fun after fallout 76 no chance lol 128 a wilhelm scream lol this is farcry new dawn wow this is going to be great cant wait for rage 2 it looks sooo awesome now this looks like a fun game hope it delivers on ps4 what regions will rage 2 be avaible for preorder this trailer is awesome falloutland borderout not another skyrim the head at the end that you can put on your wall looks disgusting xd okay this is epic mad max mixed with borderlands mixed with fallout omfg this song is terrible i just want borderlands 3 this just makes me want it more i am so pumped for this game i hope theres gonna be online tdm etc how is it that people are still complaining about the mk11 music in trailers for other games this is my video game dream come true well anything that made rage seems to have been removed cool who care about cyberpunk 2077 its raaaage time this new borderlands 3 looks fantastic oh wait a sec 98of gamers wont even use cool killing combos or gadgets from the trailer but will go around and shoot everything like retards i dont believe in avalanche theyre too mediocre for developing id software game sequel people must only play 3 games if all they do is compare games to each other this isnt like borderlands any more than call of duty is like goldeneye on the n64 shut up and take my money give me game you speaking of trailer music whats this song called getting a mad max vibe better have town of gun barrel sorry farcry new dawn this looks so much more fun than your recycled gameplay and this is coming from a diehard farcry fan of the past when it comes to post apocalypse games in 2019 im going for metro exodus days gone and rage2 new dawn just looks like a reskinned fc5 and poorly reskinned at that hyped games of 2018 list 1 metro exodus 2 the outer worlds 3 cyberpunk 2077 4 rage 2 5 mount and blade 2 bannerlord i always upvote for the wilhelm scream well ill be waiting to see what it actually looks like when it gets released if it was a stand alone studio and if they self published id be getting it day one but with the publisher being bethesda it will be a big pass until i am absolutely sure that bethesda isnt just releasing it just for some extra money i want to make sure it is a completed game with very few bugs before i invest a single penny into this why almost every new game have mad max vibe looks intense i will probably pre order this one rage 2 outer worlds farcry new dawn and anthem take my money howd they hire mad moxxies tunderdome dj with the help of the guys who created doom bethesda might earn some of their fans back wating in steam 4k and 2080ti i heard that wilhelm scream yall slipped in there lol danny brown detroit vs everbody would have been great in 3rd person che cacata i dont understand why bethesda wont use this engine this engine is just beautiful it feels like this is missing something bigger guns maybe best trailer ever i want to award the guy with an oscar who cut this trailer is there a cockpit view danny brown as himself would honestly make an interesting character in this game dude is a nut in the best way possible thats how you make a trailer borderlands on steroids with better graphics danny brown was the perfect pick for this trailer not surprise why people call it a borderland 3 killer yayyy its gonna release on my birthday d danny brown fits this trailer i want death grips in the next trailer my wallet is ready awesome this in may far cry new dawn in february 2019 is looking real nice so far looks ok why everything have yo be open world now though no thanks sony ill play it in my xbox one x with best graphics sound performance and online borderlands destiny and mad max just had a baby i want to buy it now did i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is so rage 2 is basically the child of mad maz and borderlands bad choice in music borderlands whitout cellshading cant wait for this to release its a bit of a deep cut but danny brown was a perfect choice for a rage 2 trailer amazing this is what we need this and doom eternal this game looks amazing its like bulletstorm but more crazy will this be coop so how come the smaller developers can make games like this and bethesda come up with fallout 76 danny brown sounds way too at home in the apocalypse mad max borderlands fallout rage 2 cool music i cant wait i cant wait this game can be playable only at 4k 60 fps whoever made this trailer deserves a raise its really enjoyable looks interesting i just hope they dont ubisoftify it with the usual open world checklist this isnt rage its gamer heaven looks millions times better than fallout 76 hey it releases on my birthday nice sigh they never list the song i am afraid that this will let us down like f76 money shut and up take my love that danny this gonna be 910 just rage 2 what game engine is this yes this remember fallout 76 no preorders as long as todd howard isnt in charge in this one itll be promising next years far cry and newly announced outer worlds not sure i trust bethesda anymore too many colors the next game i am buying after far cry 6 its been eight years since the original and this couldnt have come at a better timing long overdue but highly anticipated would be neat with coop always loved bethesda shooters i hope this game has lootsystem this is what i wanted fallout 76 to be like songs aint it funny by danny brown me on acid trip this looks fun i will likely check this game out wooow is there multiplayer im not gonna liethis is awesome but please do not compare this game to borderlandsborderlands was made based on action and dark humorboth games are awesome just rage 1 was pretty short so is blake griffin in the game this time around this looks legit man got that mad max on acid vibe to it mortal kombat still better trailer music 21 game looks decent tho music is garbage like mk11 this genre is overcooked why are postapocalyptic games always in a desert setting its this a new realistic texture pack for borderlands 2 oh look another open world game willing to get this and far cry new dawn both better than fallout 76 looks pretty cool not gonna lie this is what bethesda should stick to publishing id games another shitie game with a lot of bugs of bethesda 0056 uh oh dont let sony see that heavy mestl rock would be better as the trailer song borderlands is that you music danny brown i cant wait to get it will there be a splitscreen im still waiting for borderlands 3 i think borderlands should have stuck with the cellshaded look i like the original rage hopefully this game wont ruin the franchise im excited to play this looks boring nothing new feels like bordelands mad max farcry danny brown sold me on a preorder i am gonna enjoy every fight and way to kill in this gamea lot can happen in the apocalypse this looks fing dope well at least it has npcs now lets hope they dont send out the limited edition kits in nylon bags and leak players personal info you got my curiosity now you have my attention this game will be fun giant map 2 hour story mode thats dope it comes out on my birthday what is with story reminds me of doom mortal kombat trailer has left the chat hyped for the game but the environment and vehicles looks pretty much like the ones in mad max im seeing so many great gamestrailers today hype lets just pretend that this is borderlands 3 alright guys alright this game makes me feel uneasy day one how many are the puranas fallout mixed with borderlands with a buttery high note of mad max what is life 147 was that fulgore rage was released in october 4 2011 rage 2 will come out in may 14 2019 90 of comments this is how you choose a song mortal kombat 9 reminds me of bonderlands 1 left fallout gotyyyyy man i love it the soundtrack in this trailer is perfect looks boring tbh ill pass when mkxis trailer music makes no sense and rage 2s makes every bit of sense i can see this game being a flop definitely getting it borderlands should sue rage was a miracle on ps3360 the only open world title that runs with cutting edge graphics at 60fps on those consoles i hope rage 2 mantain the same level of greatness shut up and take my money that was canada far cry new dawn or rage 2so confused wilhelm scream customization pause at 203 look in the bottom left and now look at fallout they got the danny brown in the background lol aint it funny by danny brown is the song rage 1 sucked they should take their time and make sure the game is working nicely they are probably gonna overhype this game and release an unfinished game saints row 5 looks nice it seems like bethesda is paying more attention to rage 2 then fallout 76 take main monyveri cooool borderlands and mad max wild offspring with doom as the sidepiece im intrigued can we get actual gameplay footage this new battlefield v dlc trailer looks sick anybody notice the progress booster as part of the goodie bag in the deluxe edition i smell microtransactions it should have a coop feature i hope borderlands fallout mad max rage 2 bethesda looks like borderlands 3 is coming out sooner than i though 128 wilhelm scream wasteland smart phd dropped out for a scavenging degree ive wet my pantsand yours name of the song pls mad max meets call of duty on roids and molly sign me up fake ps4 its rill ps3 far cry new dawn vs rage 2 coming soon borderlands would look cool with this artstyle this looks sweet nice little wilhelm scream in the trailer looks like a fun game and cant wait to play it next year the game becomes more beautiful if the third person perfect conditions to make its own battle royale this and the new far cry trailer looks so similar wow 2 trailers of great games in the same days great its 2k or bethesda borderlands mixed doom and madmax but rage is most older than madmax and borderland ok this looks really fun think im gonna refund just cause 4 for this game this looks amazing just cause was such a disappointment for me its like farcry 5 borderlands and mad max in 1 game open the guns too bad it is single player only borderlands had a baby fallout adopt it mad max raise it doom kill it trash this game is gonna do well so now i have to keep danny browns discography on repeat while playing this game not a bad idea serious competitor to borderland here i thing is batter open world games next red dead 2 this must be the work of an enemy stand user the doom of fallout please bethesda dont mess this one up still wait cyberpunk 2077 bethesda tho hopefully bethesda havent ruined this one too now im confused r2 or fcnd i still have rage for ps3 no gonna lie had lots of fun with it when i was a kiddo if you bought this on console you are officially the dumbest person alive looks exciting and more like mad max than the boring mad max game itself shout out danny brown i hope this has a really smooth frame rate hello new battle royale far cry better mortal kombat 11 trailer makers could learn a thing or two from this this reminds me of the suicide squad trailer awesomelooks way more betterthan new far cry this comes out the same month i graduate college so thisll be a nice gift for me i would like duke nukem thrown in the mix then im happy to get it with a decent rating if all goes well this trailer is a response to far cry 51 please remaster all old tomb raiders can you pls stop sony some of us have college i really feel like they tried copy borderlandsits looks whole different from rage 1 mad max was underrated now this is what you call a video game postapocalyptic far cry this must be fun im seeing borderland 2 and mad max here combined 125 willhelm scream reminds me of mad max this will run amazing on my xbox one x inb4 the collectors edition mutant head turns out to be a balloon with a face drawn on its like they took away everything i hated about borderlands and upgraded what was left this looks like a mix of games and i dont mind that most annoying song ive ever heard in a game trailer a bit of a rip off from destiny this game looks awesome each new trailer for rage 2 looks more interesting kinda getting hyped for it one of the few devs that can really hit it on performance okey now badass customisation multiplayer and i amaddicted its like mass effect and borderlands mashed togethers this looks lit af danny brown get that money rage 1 but literally on every single drug possible looks boring sorry rage 2 specially designed for abnormal sjw inbreds danny brown is a welcome addition im getting borderlands vibes from this it reminds me of a fisrt person mad max game made by bethesda is this far cry or just cause mindless crazy fun consequencefree borderlands with realistic graphic awesome the bulletstorm 2 weve been waiting for lol now heres a game that actually looks fun lets just hope it lives up to the trailer collectors edition will giving you a nylon monster head aint it funny danny brown doom mad max super hype dont worry guys its being made by id and avalanche not bethesda bethesda is just publishing the game ive seen so many people freaking out in the comments over nothing take my money nowww i hate you bethesda for making fallout 76 best trailer music i loved the music if border lands and the deadpool game combined plus madmax makes this game borderlands the rage edition this is mad max on shrooms this looks so much better than far cry new dawn imma go broke next year fosure theres like 10 games i want already dear bethesda if cyberpunk 2077 comes out in may all i can say isits been nice knowing you looks like a huge mod for doom 2016 they even recycled some animations and assets im happy this kind of post apocalyptic thing is popular now we have far cry new dawn to tide us over until this im ready for you bulletstorm 2 its bethesda im just glad they didnt use a 21 savage soundtrack as the trailer music am i the only one who is feeling an improvement in lightning hopefully there is not too much borderlands in it i liked the old rage game bruh they keep showing those same guns the assault rifle and shotgun anyone knows how to remove age content restricted i cant even watch all the playstation trailer yesss borderlands 3 came earlier than i expected my body is ready borderlands 3 has some competition id and avalanche are gonna make a better fallout than bethesda game studios its like the gunplay and violence of doom meets the wackiness and quirkiness of borderlands rage 1 is out mad max borderland not a bad combo tho i hope it has better graphics as jaust cause 4 same engine and so im gonna go through the whole thing with just a revolver and a double barreled shotgun this song totally fit the whole stupidness going unlike some one else trailer cough cough mortal combat 11 who ask for this this is almost a better remix of the original is this a level up rpg like elder scrolls fallout danny brown or 21 who did it better mortal kombat rap song is dope stop and it feet the mood stop hating already i swear people failed with fallout76 win for rage 2 bethesda made this dont forget fallout 76 danny brown and rage 2 just go so well together i usually dont comment on game trailers but this is zabardast why this music and mk11 the worst music ever i had to stop the amazing graphics of this trailer because the music was so bad lol danny brown fits perfect with this for some reason song is danny brown aint it funny doom borderlands and mad max rolled into 1 this look like dishonored with mad max that looks fuckn awesome birthday is may 22i know what ill be playing 127 was that the wilhem scream watches trailer huh this looks pretty cool sees bethesda at the end yeah guess im not buying this now whats with these horrible music danny brownnnnnn just a few years ago he was emailing his albums to fantano now hes booking soundtracks for massive budget games what a man danny brown atrocity fits this trailer flawlessly looks decent in my opinion it looks better than boderlands this is the most video game video game ive ever seen so its doom mixed with some mad max and my birthday is may 20th yaaaaaaaaaay rage 2 looks hella better than far cry 51 aka far cry 6 but wait this game should be playing on xbox one xs the most powerful system on earth another sony exclusive that xbots wished they had this looks really fun danny brown is so underrated im sick and tired of fps games take published by bethesda off of this game and i might consider buying it another battle royale danny brown belongs in a post apocalyptic world lol its bethesda so ill wait till the game comes outavoid the whole fo76 bs perfect music to fit the mood unlike mortal kombat i preordered this for 35 already rage 2 is gonna be a 2019 goty nominee for sure that song was awful instant mute cant wait to get this game in april it looks awesome and cool reminds me of bioshock borderlands doom this looks so wacky rage 2 still looks pretty awesome im not going to lie 129 wilhelm scream i hope their a actual plot otherwise it will get boring quick that song was terrible but trailer was cool hopefully john goodman will make a cameo love og rage this game looks like farcry 5 and mad max combined yes please enough with the garbage music serious borderlands vibes from this super hyped never heard of rage before but this looks fire hey mortal kombat this is how you do trailer music mad max mixed with doom and im loving it song is aint it funny by danny brown soooo its its an open world doom in a mad max setting sign me up its borderlands with reallisticc graphics not a bad thing tho it reminds me of borderlands but without the cartoony graphics im excited to this game looks crazy this looks like a genuinely fun game hopefully it isnt ruined by the usual open world busy work weird flex but okay id rather get another mad max game please that game was awesome maybeafter fallout 76 im definately waiting to read the reviews after release to make my decision great choice of music though as an og lover of rage i am so stoked for this they didnt back down after the original games limited success its going to be bonkers now this is how you do post apocalyptic fallout 76 danny brown you just got yourself a preorder id danny brown song was unexpected but welcome far cry v did anyone really ask for another rage game after fallout 76 no thankkk ps4 fortnite with subs wow this game looks boring this reminds me of bulletstrom but with some improved character dialog reminds me of a titanfall doom style game looks sick too bad you destroyed the name rage 1 is better plz tell required graphics card the new borderlands looks great reminds me of crysis the gun play and modding this gameplay vid looks so much better than the other one more recent from april 9 its smoother and graphics look way more organic and not as gamey first person driving or no buy ew hes using aim assist the dynamic colours in this game are the main reason im buying it guns are great but there needs to be more variety i want a rage 2 goty ps5 splitscreen version mad max doom far cry new dawn rage 2 it looks badass and fun and ill definitely get it but the parts of the world they have shown does look a little barren this is next gen ps4 shows the power it has now at the end of its life cycle hey when initial gameplay on rage 2 was released it did not impress me but with these new videos im considering it a bit more i just found out it was made by id and i am a big fan of doom and this seems like the closest thing to an open world doom game mixed with mad max which i also love its growing on me should i buy it or wait for reviews post launch i trust id but you never know with aaa game devs anymore tbh it looks like different parts of doom and dishonoured this game looks awesome love the physics i was shocked they announced this game the first was so bad texture pop in i keep forgetting this is real gameplay i l o v e w e a p o n s how about you this is how you do it an fps that you feel you can take on the world great features really eye pleasing and if it is more open tharst one they have my money in before downgrade im likely going to preorder because i loved the first one and loved the doom game i am sad though because it does not appear to have the gadgets and lootingcrafting that the first one did in the first rage the looting was super simply and easy and you could craft stuff like super wingsticks and gun turrets gun robots etc additionally each weapon maintained its usefulness throughout the game because of alternate ammunition the crossbow had electrocution and explosive bolts the pistol had bigger rounds or rounds that split into many rounds i would hope these elements are still in this game i am happy with a faster pace but i also hope that the enemies are difficult like in the first game and dodge more the enemies in the first one seemed to have pretty intelligent ia and so far the gameplay reveals just a fastpaced looter shooter where it is more about how many ways you can kill enemies similar to bulletstorm albeit a great game imo but not what i am looking for in why is it so blurry would like to see some animation when entering and exiting cars no steps sound or what looks like 4 me days gone then this both look great dis game looks like doom call of duty infinite warfare and fallout has a baby i see people saying the game looks to easy and that your character never takes damage remember this is a demo so they probably turned down the difficulty big time for the sake of showing of gameplay and abilities and you know not dying who played that footage steven seagal damn i cant believe that this game its open world i cant wait is this game online the way the enemies act reminds me of fallout 4 raiders split screen co op tho not my type of game but i gotta say this shits all over the new far cry metro exodus and anthem this reminds me of borderlands 2 lol reminds me of mad max the doom aesthetic thoooo theres gonna be a graphics down grade come release bet are the car noises from san andreas haha third person please it kinda has a crysis vibe to it love it maybe a borderlands 3 type gameplay combat looks nice but world looks just as bland as the first one therell be a lot of traversing throughout unremarkable land halo 3 warthog vibes plus that needler gun this looks way too easy idk but i get this feel as if this will be another empty open world games bunch of bright lights with no actual difficulty call of madmax rage ops yo why 233 sound like the intervention from mw2 lmao the enemies must be a bit more challenging and strong not only bosses idgaf about this game damn this is great looks like borderlands and doom had a child this looks incredible the setting of borderlands the gunplay of titanfall and the driving experience of mad max cant wait ign actually found someone who can play the new borderlands looks awesome man the ai here broke the record of stormtroopers in the star wars series i love how stylized the graphics are all the way down to the effects its like doom 2016 and bulletstorm had a baby im for it this is dopelike a first person mad max what platform was this captured on picks up one upgrade man that place was brimming with some amazing gear what suits approved this dialogue lol its basically the mad max game from few years ago almost to the t this game looks like cross between doomgameplay and borderlandsvisuals very excited for its release killzone shadow fall remastered the a i is facked more blood please why does it look so blurry sweet mother of mad max this game looks awesome id only play this if it didnt have a fixed protagonist why did this need some generic space marine lead character you can tell this was made by the just cause 2 team so many games trying to be the next crysis but nothing will ever give us that thrill again were too spoiled now definitely worth buying this is another staged gameplay expect decreased gfxfx choppy frame rates for the not powerful systems i hope you can turn off those effects i might be in the minority but yeah its way too often its like doom in a mega open world 10 times more crazy and fun yeah excessive depth of field that reminds me of famous watch dogs 1 e3 presentation effects that make the game look fabulous but when you think about it obstructs the gameplay it is a glaring warning sign of possible downgrade looks promising amazing gear and visuals but will it be fun when the enemies are just poor lemmings coming to their death and you have guns with no recoil this is like doom mad max and borderlands had a baby im gonna skip crack down 3 and far cry new dawn for this why dont the cars kick up dust so this is where the amazing just cause 4 graphics went rage is just just cause in first person high tech shits chaos and even explosion this should of been bulletstorm 2 bulletstorm was a great game and underrated the ark voiceover sounds suspiciously like failsafe from d2 makes me remember crysis series why is this feels more punk than cyberpunk why so quiet where is some awesome music enemies screaming when you shoot them etc looks better than far cry this actually looks fantastic tbh i like i like reminds me strongly of doom lots of control over your mobility i hope they optimize this game well shout out 2 all the original rage fans out theregreetings from me to those few others on this planet seems they dramatically sped up the gameplay from the previous gameplay trailer looks way more interesting than it did then when it had all the style of the immortan joe big rig replete with doof warrior but all the gameplay of a soccer moms minivan how repetitive will this be great explosion physics amazing sound aswel say what you want about bethesda but i think this game looks great its bethesda so its a no from me dawg 1 buy rage 2 2 ride elevator up and down all day for music 3 4 profit looks to pg13 for me i wont buy it minimum requirements gtx 4080ti 4way sli i9 10900k oc 12 ghz 512 gb ddr9 ram 50 terabyte free space its like doom but more advanced movement open world and instead of killing demons its humansi like it i swear these developers are demon possessed can someone tell this guy to chill its not ranked ps this game looks awesome if this was made by the same guys who made doom then i gotta say i have high hopes for this all that mans wanted was a boat to impress the ladieshe was minding his own business and you yeeted him out of existence the game must be on steam for extra big sales but if you hate with your made game and dont want an extra sales eh put it exclusively the gun play in this game looks phenomenal i kinda failed to see anything exceptional or fresh looks to me like a mod for new wolfenstein games or doom so its basially a mash of doom 2016 and bulletstorm too much red faction not enough mad max is this a battle royal game or campaing im gettin a borderland vibe from this is this fallout 5 looks too easy great another fps man this game looks gorgeous and fun i hope id can make this game hard tho who still trust bethesda after preordered fallout 76 how is this not doom in a desert rage was somewhat of cult game and im excited for the sequel the authority actually have some depth now on a side note could you imagine a fallout game in this engine id and bethesda have the same parent company so it makes no sense that besthesda still uses a framework from 1996 hahaha wtfffthat superspeed modeits like you downed some meth lol the assault rifle seems like a wet noodle lol looks like hes playing on stormtrooper modelove the gameplay damn rage 2 a game that no one asked for damn im ready enjoyed the first one hope there isnt a downgrade before release doom without demons and open world count me in the borderlandsmasterchiefofdoom well there is a cool mad max vibe but im not sure about the art that shotgun looks awful bulletstorm and borderlands done went and made a baby same voice actress as destiny wow surprised how crisp this game looks and when you buy it its downgraded funny how that works yeah i know he playing on easy lighting is absolutely amazing from the explosions and muzzle flashes to the indoor and outdoor lighting effects i enjoyed rage 1 but it left me wanting more from it it was only a mediocre game or meh game it wasnt worth the full price and so far rage 2 looks the same its going to have to be a wait for sale on this game for me totally in need of this game exactly like doom but in free roam looks like the original crysis if it took place in the desert yes we finally got bulletstorm 2 bay bayyyy doom batman arkham knight driving dishonored powers blue hair characters rage 2 hmm there is a lot of film grain dof makes it kind of look wierd i assume we can change in the settings though i just played the first game a few days ago it wasokay crysis 4 wow even the bridge is flying looks like the doom franchise had a rapechild with fallout madmax and farcry franchises preety badass mad max 2 died for this would prefer 3rd person tbh bethesda tho very arcade like way more hyped for metro exodus id love to see more raw gameplay rather than what looks semi scripted but this looks dope it seems way too easy doom got boring real quick lets see how long this lasts looks cool but doesnt give off the vibe the original rage had for me remember no steam no buy is this the new open world doom doom 2 the surface battles rage 2 sure is drifting away too far from its original now it looks like borderlands and doom combined i hope cyberpunk has similar shooting mechanics looks cool not a fan of the weird color pixelation during the melees and the slams though seems unnecessary this game has to be played at 60fps and above developers sure had fun with this one look its doom mad max edition far cry new dawn looks great hold on to your walletshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjvsonjiokwe this is an up dated version of bullet storm whats that blue stuff poppin out of dead enememie omg rage and bulletstorm sequel all at once looks super fun to play is this captured on a console 044 throws shield proceeds to jump above it can i hear sam reigel i really hope the harder difficulties have smarter ai great gameplay but i dont get those shotguns that shoots airsound nobody asked for this and feels unsatisfying af doom with plasmids lol bet this jont was rendered to the brim pure gold mad max far cry doom ghost recon wildlands rage 2 the draw distance on the ground seems a little close to the player grass is spawning mere meters away goddamn id are the best fps developers ever did they change voice actors for the main character this looks so much better than i expected jesus this game looks polished af cautiously pumped i hoped they fixed the repetitiveness i have been hearing about either way i will definitely buy i loved the first and this just looks like a vastly improved version crysis 4 much the game looks 224 learns one single new skill brimming with gear also cant wait to see the game not be like this bethesda and buyable xp boosts no thanks there is no way in hell the game will look like this or play this smooth at launch cmon everyone and why is failsafe in the game looks bad and boring game taster is pro this is looking better than expected holy thats clean asf count me in cant wait to nut on all those creeps while i slide n yeet a succ grenade at them if it will have a multiplayer then its super hit great job done by rage developers this game better have fallout level lore not kidding welp ima buy it the sequel that nobody asking for looks intresting now looks and feels completely different than the original wheres the dirty grainy look that made the original so great why these motha fockas those days use that shitty blurry effect in the grapichs anyone here think theyll eventually release this on switch wait till they announce epic store exclusivity lol okay so who did ign hire to do the gameplay for this as we know it aint you guys playing so its post apocalyptic just cause in 1st person borderlands fallout outer worlds combined into one game ill give it a shot over fallout 76 i want this trailer to be uploaded in 4k by someone will smith walks in oh thats hot thats hot does it run on the same engine as doom incredible the frenzy of doom in an open world simply incredible this game genuinely looks awesome reminds me of borderlands now thats a cool game until release why is there no music 030 ign finally letting experienced players do the vids great but why its open world why this game was awesome i cant wait to playing this gamelooks like mad max and farcry new dawn i like the style of the first game better actually supposed to be like a dark and trying to survive now its just doom mixed with bullet storm i know this games is all about stylish kills but i like my games to offer a challenge otherwise i get bored real quick in this gameplay the enemys didnt do any damage what so ever sowhy dont they use this engine for fallout and elder scrolls again i have a feeling this will not be what launch will look like i dont see a point in this there being games like ape legends out not really new gameplay but maybe on your channel it isthanks ign no matter how many vomit inducing screen effect they incorporate they cant hide the pop in definitely worth buying alright this video squashed my concern for the gameplay still sad andrew wk didnt start playing during that boss fight thought the combat looked bland in the previous trailers but damn this changed my mind looks epic af looks like borderlands without the cartoon design danggg u ask shroud to play this awesome gameplay is this doom or rage have to admit this game looks fun howl shiet you can actually shooting a whamens cool how is this any different from doom it just feels like doom with a garish colour palette open world and shoddy driving mechanics heads upa real pro gamer is playing how anyone can see any kind of value in anthem is beyond me like a mix of both of my fav games that i bothered to finish till the end mad max and doom 3 well i am very impressed hope the game really does turn out like this i think thats isnt complete yet this looks pretty dope im all about them fps games rage is gonna be freaking siiick why fallout cant be like this rage 2 by avalanche studios published by fortnite played by shroud and driven by ford 849 wise words that everyone should follow the more i see the better it gets cant wait ai seems too easily swept aside should be harder when is the battle royale mode well at least this doesnt play like literally every 1st person shooter thats come out for the last decade with different gadgets and special abilities am i right dont get me wrong this looks so pretty and well done butis there a quality story here to make someone want to buy this to be honest i get the feeling its more like a reskinned doom title with extra colors it plays essentially the exact same same movement same gun holding etc like i said it looks great but i may skip this one and just go for doom eternal to get my badass fps fix i feel like they straight up cloned dooms shooting look and feel and stuck it in an open world im fine with it tbh but i didnt expect it to look so similar finally an actual player on ign this isnt new footage though this is sick diggin the sound design id engine aint messing around cant wait much better than i could expect those abilities and gunplay look so damn satisfying and fun i love games like this where you can just be a superpowered beast sending enemies flying the robot womans voice is the exact same as the one in destiny 2 wft that fov though this reminds me a lot of mad max were just missing the boi chum bucket still waiting for a new borderlands game this is what happens when you combine id and avalanche studio fking awesome hopefully the driving control is not as jangky as mad max so is there no hud whatsoever bethesda back on track did they change the voice actor the protagonist sounds like a kid to be brutally honest compared to the previous voice actor this looks like an openworld colorful doom 445 thats something i would do even stare off at him cool but i just gonna save money for cyberpunk and borderlands 3 mei should probably stop playing video games and focus on some other things in life seeing thisfek itmust buy me a new pc d i wasnt a big fan of the first rage but this looks great this look almost exactly like doom those visuals are seriously mesmerizing i hope the world isnt empty not much looting where is ze loot but will it have battle royale next thing you know epic store makes it exclusive damn that looks fun makes me think of a cartoon version of the new doom coming out i need quake to come back well its official much like what i said with the recent anthem gameplay videos i will definitely not be getting this game nothing in this game is winning me over except for that one segment with the flying vehicle and some of the gun functions though i was one of the very few people who enjoyed the first rage hoping that an improved sequel would come out this is nothing like i imagined in a bad way still waiting to see at least one interesting enemy factionunique section like in the previous game so far theyve shown nothing of interest for me the visual aesthetics look exhaustingly punk rock which is a new direction that im not a fan of looks like i can safely skip this one and move onto looking forward to last of us part 2 ghosts of tsushima and cyberpunk 2077 now i dont feel bad waiting a year for metro looks awesome cant wait to play they show the same weapons are we gonna use the same guns over and over low resolution game you can tell nobody from ign is playing in this gameplay looking forward to this the outer worlds and cyberpunk the sound quality is amazing in this game bioshockdoom but is it on steam pre beta already making fallout look like crap take some notes bethesda oh my security detail is just my insurance plan going to mess shyt up to create a chaotic seismic damage lets get this party started by me giving avalanche my 65 to support this perfect game that is needed at this time bless yall weaponry the ai is atrociously inept you look like you play a super hero cool this game is going to be awesome ai look really really bad its like a mix of doom and mad max subscribe to me whoa this looks great this is the first footage i have personally watched and this alone has convinced me to pre order this looks awesome cant wait some people are incorrectly calling this a bethesda game it is not dont really like the glitch effect takes away from all the gore n stuff this guy can play rage 2 battle royale mode coming in 5 4 3 2 this isnt brand new gameplay fluid and impressive gameplay hopefully the ai is tweaked now this looks awesome some cool music during gunfights would be cool so far nothing innovative about the gameplay shoot enemies advance to cover repeat until the end of the area and then leave this is beautiful o wait this aint new gameplay all these comparisons to games like borderlands fallout farcry etc but the gameplay looks most similar to bulletstorms no short animation of us climbing in and out of the ride i would love to see a br game by avalanche this game looks cool but im wondering if its charm will wear off as fast as bulletstorm its like shooter is the only game genre at first i was undecided about this game but after this video there is no doubt in my mind this is gonna rock it would have been better if it was more like the first rage but i have to say that looks funny and kinda new reminds me a lot of bulletstorm looks cool af thanx for the vid look forward to the downscaled release for my gtx 1080 rig to be honest i wasnt too hyped at first when i heard about this game but this looks fuckin dope damn this looks like a neil blompkamp movie on crack so i guess the next thing bethesda will sell is gameplay videos am i right it looks too easy it looks like they gave rage the fast pace action of doom 2016 and gave more vertically to it oh brand new as in the same footage multiple youtubers have already posted and shared got it my current headcanon is that rage takes place after doom hell on earth and this is the aftermatch looks fun love how fast you can move ugh remove or change his voice is it coop the guy thats playing is amazing i bet 1000 this is not an ign employee playing this mad max in first person i want to be a student and living with no adult problems and playing games 247 the landscape feels a lot like mad max looking like doom but open world which i am certainly ok with if its on a normal i do not want to know how its that on easy that ill buy it will be the first time ill start playing on a hard u 2 it reminds me of borderlands that vehicle looks like the stingray in presequel which im playing now throws wallet at screen repeatedly its not new gameplay liers die mf no thanks ill save my money is that failsafe im seriously looking forward to this game by the way and this may sound like a silly question to some whats the gameplay being captured on i assume a pc but theres no hud so i cant tell the range on the shotty is crazy lol and i dont want to see anyone else play this anymore all the gameplay ive seen that werent devs has been down right awful to watch all these comments did people not know about the 1st game the vehicle combat was hella decent this looks a lot like borderlands if you smashed it with red faction saw this footage last night an d i was like hooolyshbeeeep who ever the dev was that did the gameplay for this video was blacking i am rage now so basically doom set in mad max like butter on toast mama butter on toast is this a br or open world i didnt know apex legends had a campaign the player just cant seem to stand straight aim and shoot anyway the game looks interesting enough computer voice sounds like failsafe from destiny 2 ign says new gameplay but this new gameplay was already been shown by others a couple weeks ago this kind of a game should have brutal finishers gameplay oooh yeah dialogue ohhh noo prebeta so alpha man this looks nice when are avaliable beta free doom and borderlands had a baby this is like bulletstorm and doom mixed this is so much fun like videogames used to be feel sorry for this guy httpsyoutubetc9ehfizqkqt282 doom 2016 dishonored mad max rage 2 looks like a rad time its like mad max with fps had high hopes for this game i dont see any replay value guess ill stick to titanfall 2 and apex legends so i never played the first rage but the protagonist seems to have some kind op nano suit his abilities remind me of the crysis series man how i wish they would make a next gen sequel to that game imagine if they completely remastered the first one for ps4 pro and xbox one x hey look ign isnt terrible at this game are we able to reset outposts and convoy events or will they forever be cleared out oh boi i sure cant wait to see the downgrades what is it shoot up dummies come on this is 2019 work on that ai what is the difference stylistically between this borderlands apex legends far cry new dawn or mad max 1 or 2 of these are great but im a little tried of the gritty yet colorful post apocalypse take is that failsafe from destiny 2 this is gonna be my temporary doom until eternal comes out old gameplay same old ign steam wow fantastic apex legends did zero marketing and now has 25 million players and now looking at rage 2 do not be fooled rage 2 gameplay right now is all postfx where do you think they spend the majority of their budget the game or marketing i am done with 60120 aaa games done i used to love rage 2 was an amazing game but itll be filled with microtransactions downgrades in graphics and bulletsponge enemies want proof look up anthem graphics downgrades and empty promises apex legends announced their game the same day it dropped and its stood on the back of its own merit very nearly bugless and the bugs that do happen are all due to the 2 million concurrent players it has on all systems its forgivable in before downgrade are there only two guns in this game lol i lost interest when i found out there will be no coop just play fallout 76 you will get rage 2 holy christ the pop outs on the ground are bad wow rage 2 is going to be fun flying on that drone looks awesome im buying it just for that i actually freaking love this the player movement is way better than the first one i can appreciate that this is apex campaign mode doom with a purpose tell them not to downgrade this game now looks like every other shooter holy smokes its like an 8k gameplay some of the moves are from mass effect i know this game is going to be amazing but it for me deviates from rage theme its mostly mad max meets horizon zero dawn port it to switch cowards this actually looks wayyy better than i expectedawesome damn i think im getting old i used to get so hyped seeing fps shooters like this but now i find them boring af ill stick with red dead 2 for now im already prepared for a graphics downgrade combat is so fun farcry new dawn is that you nice graphics but bad gameplay prebeta footage hope you guys are seeing that so you arent asking a lot of questions bad to the bone all its missing is damage numbers ai looks pretty dumb though did it annoy anyone else that he didnt check the gear inside the ark this guys aiming bothers me looks fun but the player makes it look too easy no hud mini map or radar is there a hard difficulty does this look like a rage game no it does not i thought aaron paul was supposed to be the voice actor for the main protagonist this guy sounds too mellow this isnt new gameplay its at least a month old and igns integrity continues to plummet this game reminds me of bullet storm i dont understand the hate looks fun as hell the dude playing must look like hes playing flight of the bumblebee on his controller with all those abilities geezus not complainingjust damn graphics are amazing would be better if you actually opened the door of the car and got on it like gta i bet the huge open world sandbox is filled with huge chunks of nothings and this trailer shows didnt know failsafe was in this game looks pretty but also mediocre i know its a different genre but the gun play and movement reminded me of destiny i like the whole power fantasy thing another completely generic milk toast poindexter white boy protagonist hey kids wanna buy some cheats i mean where is the challenge ugh this looks like so much fun to play is this in multiplayer what a bunch of noobs anthem in fpp why are people bitchin that its first person have you people ever play part 1 so it isnt a surprise i not gonna lie it moved a little watching this this was beautiful no thx selling xp boosters for a single player game ill past on this game this game looks so dope i love it doom but with people this game is gonna flop just a feeling lol im sorry but is that failsafe talking nope after the fail of f76 i wont buy this game 10 minutes of brand new rage 2 gameplay how come if seen all of this already no steam no buy wow actually speechless all nearby hostiles have been pacified why is first person why d anyone else think it looks blurry as hell for anything past 5 feet wow now we know why just cause 4 looks like garbage jk looks awesome i preordered and cant wait to play i feel sorry for people who do nothing but find things to complain about your life must be miserable ok this is badass af take my money doomguy needed something else to kill when he finished all demons its fun but depth of field is kinda unoptimized guess it might get better with the actual release when you play it wont look or feel as cool you got superhero landing as well his hand looks like is from the nano suit this looks fun why is failsafe in this game its like doom but its not why does it look like every enemy has the same death animation 147 nier automata tower voice actor cant wait to play it on pc maxed out whatever you guys say but i dont know i kinda like its looks and its graphics for some reason not the gameplay though looks so smooth hopefully tgey dont downgrade it brand new a long time ago the rag doll is so satisfying i really didnt think id be interested in this game it looks pretty sick looks great but also looks waaaay too easy platform day one buy for me cod rage 2 okay nice another battle royale game remember guys this developer is behind fallout 76 hes not taking any damage bigdraco voice dont think it would have multiplayer exp boost cant wait for it to come to steam i will pick it up maybe in a few years when bethesda store dies what if this was called brink 2 this looks fun honestly some serious downgrade is coming gameplay looks fun as hell however that depth of field makes me wanna puke dunno how people play with that enabled finally someone from ign can play a game properly 652 this looks like a toy that will arrive at gta online i was excited for this but then i metro exodus came into my life and i think im going to go with metro for now maybe ill buy this later on well considering bethesda has no hope anymore as a developer at least they can still succeed as a publisher i made an apex legend meme video called apex legend in a nutshell right now game of the year potential if borderlands 3 doesnt release this year this game should have multiplayer this aint it chief feels like im watchin a new doom game now you can fly well thats interesting game is so realistic and all ign lover like now why is this guy playing like he is on multiplayer mode you dont really have to move sideways all the time at singleplayer anyone else feel like there should be an animation for entering and exiting the car the elevator button had an animation far cry new dawn 76 rage edition i think this is a major overhaul from the original rage i cant wait to start slammin some fools if only this game was third person i would love it the driving looks extremely stiff to me other than that it looks great i dont like this fast moving game play id rather have the grounded combat of rage 1 the texture and vegetation pop in is annoying if they could put more work on npc facial animation is it me or does the protagonist sound kinda wimpy compared to other trailers this is a vast improvement on the first game pls no battleroyale rage 2the game which will make you rage 2 just wait for it i bet theyll make a battle royal mode for rage 2 texture filtering is crazy short looks cool though i probably wont pick it up until it goes on sale this is made for people who rage alot so instead of breaking every thing you see in your house just play this game looks alot better then the new farcry game whoever sees this just remember you are awesome you are great always smile look on the brighter side of things have a great year love you allstay awesome dumb ai games should improve in that area now it looks nice imo still better than shitdown 3 borderlands meets doom might not be the most original but it sure looks fun and frantic after metro exodus this might be just what i need looks much better than farcry 5 i dont enjoy 1st person games camera i always have headache when playing them hopefully there is a 3th person mode i cant give avalanche enough credit on how they managed to make a barren desert wasteland beautiful and varied with mad max and this game looks incredibly satisfying simply a slayer i dont know the story or even sued the first but just based on this gameplay this game is gonna be fun exp boosters and cheatcodes behind paywall killed my interest for this game why is there so much shimmering motion blur no sharpness in the game last 2 videos were the same this game is strikingly similar to doom just waiting for the review first half life 2 on steroids this gameplay looks more interesting than metro exodus cool game bro whats the resolution lol this defo wont look like this on console looks fuun but some aspects of the game looks unpolished that ai needs some working on wow just awesome theyre selling cheats anddd its not on steam nah this is the only singleplayer game i keep an eye for before cyberpunk 2077 come out youre more helpful than you realize great job hereyou know what i watch almost every video you post and i love this topic you made about well it appears that mad max farcry and borderlands had a love child with a fallout game lol any chance the ai will offer a challenge this time oh this smooth same from apex anyone else here to see people wanting their money back for fallout 76 i want it switch looks like shroud is playing if first person games are smooth like this i think people motion sickness problem will gone soooooooits bullestorm 2 took long enough this looks soo cool looks great cant wait to play on xbox 032 i believe i can fly i believe i can touch the

what the game released on literally just this the rage 2ad on this video i like the story line lol steamrage 2steamrage 2steamrage 2 mad max on cocaine and steroids rage 2 looks like itll be one of the best fps games in 2019 if doom eternal doesnt come out and mw4 rumours arent true but playing through rage 1 right now i kinda miss the serious and truly horrific aspects of that game the atmosphere was just so cool this sadly loses some of that but maybe the game without the shitty trailer music will feel different as far as gameplay though this looks very cool im definitely getting this game you can be sure that ingame graphics wont be downgraded id software thank you i got the frist one and kind of like it but the 2 looks lot better graphics are looking really impressive ohhhh it said trailer you lied to me i really hope besthesda had least as possible as can be with this game playing the first game made me wonder how could their world possibly get any worse rage 2 hold my wingstick devs please i wont be able to run this masterpiece on 200 fps so pls optimize it for sli p bethesda make the best games fortnites gonna be dead when this game comes out and im glad cause im tired of that crap game want it have they ever explained why they call this series rage otherwise doom meets mad max shut up and take my money im really iffy about this game i was 15 when i played the first one and i loved it because it reminded me of mad max a little this on the other hand it doesnt remind me of the first game in any way subscribe my new game channel support me frds finallyive been waiting years for 2 rage 2 my years of praying has finally been answered hello im luda im one of the owners of the new rage amino a community centered around the game franchise rage come join this new community and post chat create content and a lot more httpaminoappscomcrageamino cool why people like games made by sony but not by bethesda aww i have to play rage 1 one more year borderlands with noncartoon graphics thank you id and bethesda thank you for rage 1 and 2 but most of all thank you for my big fking guns lets rrrrrraaaaaaaggggggeeeeeee borderlands 3 confirmed this is the coolest thing i saw today it makes up for the disappointment of fallout 76 gonna have to play this until gearbox gives us borderlands 3 worstnt no borderlands 3 at e3 thisll have to do what genre was the first rage mad max with superpowers and mechs that remind me a game named redline but with better graphics the first rage was the game that hot me in gaming i cant wait for this the nostalgia i was thoroughly pleased with the first one im definitely buying this this looks like crap compared to the first one i absolutely adored the first game i am not obsessed with huge open worlds and endless customization like most of the world i like a cool atmosphere good combat fun weapons and upgrades and a decent storyline the original rage had that maybe a bit lackluster on the story but it was just a cool little game is that andrew wk i hear i always figured rage was another one of the borderlands and mad max vibes cant waitfing loved the first it looks like a even better version of fallout 4 another reflection game first person mad max ill keep this on the forefront first one was okay so hopefully they made this one better anyone notice how polished advanced and sophisticated the guns are if this was a postapocalyptic world where the technologies have regressed along with people and civilizations have devolved making way for rampant mutations shouldnt the technologies show that the cars are post apocalyptic but the guns look like theyve been ripped right out of a doom 3 screen and put into a mad max game the new borderlands game looks impressive why is it bethesda makes the best games is it sad that the only decent game at e3 so far is a sequel nobody asked for wing stick the new battlefield v trailer looks great the last game has zero replay value once finished i hope this time they add something after done with the main story new game plus maybe i dont wanna be a bum but will it come to the switch its the only console i own get ready to die trailer sad story actual game this more like a full game than the tech demo the first one was theyre advertising the hell out of this game when it doesnt come out until 2019 so is it a prequel to the first one i like the intro the guy talking but the rest just action seems meh i really hope this focuses on the post apocalyptic survival kind of style like the first game this just looks like sunset overdrive with all the big guns and shooting everything are there quests and bossfights a story and multiplayer coop been waiting on this for awhile finally the time has come its gonna have like ten times the easter eggs the first one had destiny horizon zero dawn sort of watch dogs rage 2 this looks like if doom and destiny had an edgy kid nice trailer please bring back the authority pulse cannon wont even sell past 30k copies calling it now did they forget about the first game what im hoping for is car customzation and cars the look familiar my problem with the first rage was that the cars werent recognizeable as something we know i feel like they should make cars more like what we know like a car in the game could look like a muscle car dropped on a truck frame and armored or something like that in a world that has been destroyed where do they get so many resources to wage a war or racing i mean the gas must be hard to come by in a time like that that is why i dont like this game wow borderlands 3 got a nice graphics improvement o this game looks awesome but theres always something really wrong i remember the good ole days when i played the first rage in my xbox 360 and cant wait to play the one my xbox one s dude so hypedbut didnt like how it ended in the first one well hope it turns out to be a good game mindless trash smh meh it just looks like borderlands i preferred the tone of the first one jeez its taken them long enough what about the broken sniper rifles when ima get my crysis 4 bruhjk i aint played since crysis 2 the original was good how will the sequel hold up those days of my life when gaming used to be fun now i think its back again with this game just nutted so rage 2 became boarderlands 3 im ok with this i dont think ive ever been so hyped for a game i need the name of the song i loved the first date for 360 if mad max and destiny had a baby and then doom adopted it with a fallout wife this would be the result is that alex andersen from vikings on the cover motion blur is not done right borderlands is that you took them close to 8 years to say lets make rage 2 but if asteroids hit and caused the landscape through instant death to many how did huge big monsters come to be lol can we get another sunset overdrive i really felt that game was underrated so a less cartoony borderlands anyone notice that shadowrun mechanic where the player puts their hand to the ground and bounces up lol i cant wait to play this on my xbox one x its going to run and look absolutely fantastic cool never played the first one this looks fun ill wait till switch gets all these games i see its the same look as doom yes please the game looks fuckin gooooooood awesome rage was absolute awesome game but short whats the music playing did somebody know doesnt look at all like the 1st one so its basically morrowind with a gun looks good but ruined by doom style action i liked the first game on how the combat was tight and quick but there wasnt anything to explore and the story is to short the ending comes out of nowhere and doesnt feel satisfying all times a raced and killed enemies felt so amazing so its god theyre making a sequel 3 mini bosses game ends not this time rage i dont need it i dont need it i need it looks and feels like a non comic version of borderlands should i play rage 1 was it good i played the first one and kind of loved it i see they combined many game elements together here hope it dont lose its own identity in the process graphic looks nice somehow i feel its a destiny kind of a game i trust id and bethesda to deliver cannot wait oh dear what a mess those giants are like nephelim rage 1 was the best but now well you know probably a greate game bad music the future of america never though they would come out with a second game but this looks dope i hope they bring back mutant bash tv music yay finally but also damn it cuz there is no doom 2 this year probably not until next year i hate doom 2016 was left on a cliff hanger but is it multiplayer i could see this being fun if you can have like a 4 man squad basically borderlands with better graphics im still waiting for my brink 2 first one was great but i felt it was too short count bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums played rage but it didnt hit it for me but this looks amazing the first rage was like a painting really pretty too look at and thats about it gameplay was boringbasic af this is a badass game not feeling the marketing but liking the gameplay yay rage 2 loved the first one d looks better than the first one bulletstorm mad max fallout can someone please tell me when it is being released this looks absolutely insane i never asked for this i dont think anyone did but im still pretty hyped the first one was enjoyable and but did indeed end on a bad notebut after the credits rolled i still felt that there was a lot of potential for the world this defiantly seems like its going to capitalize on that cant wait to pick it up planetside 2 or this the gameplay looks great hopefully the trailer bgm isnt representative of the style and quality of the ingame soundtrack step 1 make the world open step 2 add an overload of insanity and chaos step 3 step 4 profit lets do this time to buy a next gen console when is this coming out for release cant wait im not sure about this new art direction for borderlands did i see a fus ro dah with someones hand at the beginning lol im getting a serious sam vibe from this when did the 1st one come out lol the first one didnt have enough this one looks like it has too much its like a prius with a bugatti engine the platform of the game cant handle this much content overload still waiting for elder scrolls 6 take notes this is how you make a sequel by completely ignoring the 1st game sales and putting a lot of random cool in the 2nd im glad to see a rage 2 i loved the first game so underrated the first rage was such a let down for me which makes me weary to play this one by all means ill give it a go but im not optimistic based on this trailer alone it doesnt look bad and seems as though the creators took time to flesh it out a bit but ive definitely been wrong before never played first one looks interesting still waiting for es6 though cant wait for this to come out 3 i just want the enemies to be actually harder as far as skill and unpredictability like the enemies in the first game on the higher difficulties that is ahhhthe return of muties and wingsticks happy days are here again will this be a online multiplayer not digging this zany music and colorful ads i get it post apocalyptic is dark and boring blah but lets not get too carried away here ive still got the old rage game guide its a doom fallout first rage welcome to a game that represents america if everyone was given huge piles of meth oh yeah get hype this feels way more chaotic than the first one and i love it can we dash in all directions like shadow warrior because this game needs it i wish theese cars didnt in the game just shooting everything etc like doom so fallout on meth im down if that song doesnt play through the entire game i want my money back but does it have battle royal can we get dark story games these games look like there are for young teen kids please just stop rage 1 was loads of fun im so excited for this game when does it come out thats one of the best trailers ive seen in a long time seems more like borderline but with better graphics cant wait to take some nice ash screenshots on this game this truly looks terrible actually looks good ill probably buy it doommad madfalloutrage 2 will know when the game comes out getting hyped from trailer is getting old show me gameplay and contents show me if it has optimization for pc show me if it has modding andor other workshop items after they show those and then release the game then after few weeks of review i will get hyped i remember my 60 being gone down the drain by the poorly optimized half baked game that was called rage on the side note they might take dooms gameplay mechanics and put it in this one that could be good though the flow will not be the same like doom farcry apocalypse i remember the bandits being buffer but i still love it the borderlands we need right now the lootboxes in this game are going to be amazing what destiny supposed to be lol colour scheme similar to sunset overdrive dialogue like borderlands world like fallout what more could you ask for honestly this looks like what mad max couldve been this game is not going to sell well im 90 in on this as long as someone confirms that this one has an ending after prey another series killed by bethesda fallout 4 with better graphics graphics look decent mad max meets call of duty advanced high tech whateverok i can dig it great butitd be nice if bethesda would fix rage 1 for pc it doesnt play well with awesome hardware finally mad max on drugs personally i was a big fan of the first one and the mobile game was just lacking in story and things todo the mechanics and visuals were all brilliant in my opinion just missing that other half hopefully thatll be what we see here did they hire my ex gf to pose for the games cover art on one hand they want to get away from the boring colour schemes of most shooters and they use very bold colours on the game box and some of the explosions on the other you can clearly see the game is not nearly as colourful in the actual gameplay and will probably stick to the good old dark look with the exception of the desert this definitely reminds me of suicide squad they saw that colour and fun were good for selling tickets so they made the poster and trailer to suit that aesthetic but it didnt really reflect the true look and feel of the product so beware people this may turn out in the same way they sold it to me at big fing guns in a world where there are no rules insanity rules hmm sounds a lot like what liberals want good old days when i was raging whats up with all these fallout or post apoctalipic games this looks like it could be a great game but im always sceptical so we will see omg just found this loved the first game alot except for the ending this is a must buy the first rage title seem like a pilot episode rage 2 looks like coop open world but will there be pvp cant help it looks damn shitty no kidding at all this looks dope definite buy i loved the first rage and this one looks just more awesome doom is it you out of the all properties i welcome this i bet theyll use that same old flexible engine with upgraded textures because of what because it just works andrew wk is 12 people im in as long as the ending isnt as dumb as in rage 1 i come back to this every day cause it looks so gooooood wonder what next fallout will look like nobody ask but im gonna say it bethesdas games all look alike to me graphics voices etc ahh so the new bethesda fps is not doom2 nice looks fun as hellwhat else matters rage one was epic is it just me or does that head by the cannons on 44 seconds look like rick from rick and morty i want to believe but considering how much of a laughingstock rage 1 one and how pathetically short it is coupled with the sheer bs fallout 4 was i wont hold my breath that what happend to dusty first one was vastly underrated i loved the first rage game but there was something about the colors of it that would get me dizzy after playing for about 15 minutes so i had to stop playing it its about time all i can say is when and what console i hate the feeling that im getting from this trailer this isnt rage rage is a wasteland of survival this just seems like steampunk doom and duke nukem and some rock and roll and goofiness this isnt rage feeling at all had my doubts until i saw avalanche was involved they can do open world better than id thats for sure the first one had so much promise hope this does it justice want borderlands without the unique art style and characters here you go already hyped i liked the first one a lot and this looks badass its about damn time why would you ruin punk music like this finally borderlands 3 is coming out definitely has more personality and color than the first i loved the first one this one looks great ill be buying this for pc if it has an offline mode would love to get my merder on good and proper the first rage was awesome lets see what the sequel brings lol the sequel no one asked for lgbts would be grateful so many colours borderlands 3 better step up its game or this might just take my favor borrowed alot of doom so borderlands but not as fun andfunny wow that looks awesome i loved the first game rick sanchez at the beginning been waiting for so long for some reason already looks repetitive a mix of bulletstorm doom and a hint of quake still waiting for tes 6 shut up and take my money if there are vibrant and bright colors explosions mfuckin guns im in this game will rock the universe the first one was really good but my question still stands foot action multiplayer or coop all i have to say is that the ending better be an improvement from last time cool but whats with the damn pink lmao i got the reveal trailer ad for rage 2 before this vid is it coop cannot wait is this on pc release date multiplayer coop looks so much better than the first this is doom mad max i absolutely cant wait hope its longer so shooters are cool rage2 dev team this just looks so fun probably a great pickup and play game getting older i dont have the timeinterest in those old 5 hour play sessions morrowind had me running on the regular presumably coop looks ripe for it oh wow look at that its that sequel that ive never seen anyone ask for btw im jokingkind of smashing pumpkins the game shooty shoot blood crazy dead the game despite all my rage i am still just ready to cage that song would have fit better just had to watch an ad to watch the ad this game looks sick its about time we got some decent games spent 3 grand on a pc and still struggling fallout and mad max fury road fusion wow epic the best game bazillion more bazillion guns just got bazillionistwait wrong game i honestly never expected they would make a sequel to rage i liked the first one but it had many flaws the open world felt very uninspired with that i mean there was really nothing to do in the world the map was relatively small no fast travel between points that were explored very few quests no reason to go out like gathering resources by fighting bandits or looting bandit hideouts to get new gear or weapons that cannot be aquired any other way other than to progress and then the story its shallow i did not feel invested or care about the state the world was in the main villaincant remember his name was also very unintersting hes supposed to be a dictator but we never really get to see his oppressive rule in action we dont even get to see or meet him the ending was also quite a slap in the face for me if id can fix many of the flaws with the first game in this one and make it like a fusion of doom fallout and mad max then this game has a ton of pot the new sunset overdrive looks great i still own rage on ps3 lets just hope its not as rushed as the first one which was still pretty fun but a little disappointing though will the story be longer than the first one thats what my problem was with the first game as it was kickass but completely waaaay to short i have never played rage does this game include a multiplayer mode im thinking no right you guys remember borderlands the game where there was a desolate wasteland rabid gangs cars with guns to drive around in big guns and abilities to destroy people with large and diverse enemies and chaotic fun in a rock and roll style game with a crazy dude as the mascot on the cover no just me wheres the gameplay all i seen was cinematic gameplay there was no real gameplay here nice try this looks like doom had a baby with fallout and then the baby smoked some cracki love it this is what destiny should beoh bungie the remastered borderlands is looking great some borderlands madness getting in there too its not cocaine induced its lsd or acidjust call the game acid i can see they kept the atrocious driving aspects of the first one neat idk if its real fallout on steroids all i want to know is are they using megatextures or not please tell me that this one will be more like a falloutmad max style with the open worlds and days of game play not 15hrs worth lets face it it will have no single player just battle royale and lootboxes so many good and juicy micro transaction based lootboxes wait you mean a borderlands 4 wide open world to spend most of your time driving again nah if i wanted a driving game id play shitty games like forza pick a dam genre and stick with it make a shooter or make a driving game rage 1 was fallout fps game this is to color dont like wow that personality theyre going for is a major turn off damn son we got a lot of rage 2 experts in these comments link me to your reviews boys i wanna see em since youve obviously beat the thing already if you have enough knowledge to know exactly how every aspect of the thing functions we can all thank walmart haha the first one was cool but maybe a 6 hr game at tops nice im curious about the story and where it picks up after the last one are you the same ark survivor after bringing all the other arks to the surface who is the main protagonist serious lack of one last time and reuse of the same levels bethesda going full fallout 4 only in rage this time that would be fing sweet fun what else needs to be said i hope i dont haft to save before every fight so i dont die start back in the beginning every dam time like in the first one that 100 looks like mad max had a love child with destiny kek all i care see is what modders will be able to do to this game please tell me theres a settlement building system in this it would be more befitting than fo4 im ready to take a ride on this crazy train heres my ticket party till you puke andrew wk lets hope that this time the developers wrote the ending first why did they named it rage 2 this game looks so amazing and fun and could be a lot better with its own title but i think calling it a squeal of rage is a bad idea because this game looks and feels nothing like the original rage everyone saying what they think it feels like it feels like they are trying to snag that far cry feel oo this this isnt skyrim this fallout mod look so good destiny with cars its perfect if its exactly like that has lots to do with replayability and has a third person option just my opinion i beat rage 1 on nightmare mode and actually enjoyed it but this revamp doesnt remind me of rage based on what i saw in the video rage 2 just doesnt give me that creepy rage vibe that we all got in the first game this is gonna be funreally fun so everybody is desperately waiting for another elder scrolls or fallout and we get rage 2 a game that nobody wanted or asked for they wanted to do something different we were told so we get a borderlands ripoff brilliant im there big fing guns baby reminds me of the world of bulletstorm meets mad max cant wait with the great direction id has and avalanches experience in fun open world sandboxes and years of retrospect and critique i think this could end up being a huge improvement on the original this looks more fallout then fallout dose really hope they keep it an offline single player like the first one ugh this already gives me sunset overdrive vibes did sunset overdrive and red faction have a weird child probably our protagonist is one of ark volunteer that just wake up after rage 1 doom graphics borderlands mad max yes im getting a doom mad max borderlands and fallout vibe from this can make your own character in this dont know anything about rage whenever i see these games i always wonder where the guys making the bullets are or where the guys mining the resources are got an ad about rage 2 is this borderlands unless they come out with single player story driven content i wont be getting it played both rage and mad max great games wondered what a game like rage would feel like in an open world scenario like the deserts in maxnow the companies are working together to make such a game fuckin law of attractionshould think about half life 3 more often so rage now stands to its name but the big question is can you do selfies in this game sighanother 20 days to go to see a gameplay reveal if you were hoping to see borderlands 3 at e3 2018 then you might have to prepare for the worst according to shacknews a representative from gearbox told a room of journalists in may 2018 that a third borderlands entry will not be present at the show in any form but they will have other games to show off just dont mess the ending again gonna wait till the cracked version for pc need to save some money cuz there are other games coming out this year a confused mess for twitch muscle kids that will become a toxic wasteland of words whatever happened to games with a story i hope this game has a punk rock soundtrack if i wanted a fps smoothie id put borderlands fallout and destiny into a blender and this would be produced the game looks like itll be a blast to play and love the different types of enemies and combat on show weve reacted to this trailer too and would be grateful if you guys checked it out if youd like to hear what true happiness sounds like haha awesome i played the first one and loved it a perfect game for people with adhd it seems bethesda is one for second chances take note ea its sad to see the theme of rage changed i liked the original one it had a nice tone i guess bethesda is trying to make the rage 2 more like a mashup of bulletstorm far cry and borderlands i would never waste my money or time on this game if its represented by this trailer accurately to be sincere the sequel that no one wanted this looks so goood is this singleplayer or coop boring designs should have spend some more on concept art artists holy motion blur batman shut up and take my money this looks like a mix of borderlands and fallout and im pretty eh on it right now they need to hurry up and officially announce borderlands 3 ive wanted a sequel to this for soooo long now when is this coming out i saw wingsticks thats all i care about 1010 from creators od mad max it shows but looks cool the new borderlands looks great looks cool but i dont bother hyping myself up about trailers anymore to avoid being let down i just ignore games until they are out and figure out if i want it this game looks amazing i like how the weapons have more impact now they seemed hollow before cant wait to play it i love the new skyrim oh god i just jizzd in my underwear so hard that some of it managed to get on the screen this is what i get for screwing around with my iphone during my daughters recital i remember playing the first one in 6th grade im now a senior in high school ive waited so long pls be great why call it rage 2 when the first game ended in such a disappointing way just start fresh did not expect a 2 to come out looks good hopefully bethesda doesnt blow it i was not a big fan of rage the first one thought at the time that it was annoying it was worked on instead of doom 4 that i had been waiting for for years haha but this looks pretty dam good looks like slower passed doom 2016 set in mad max universe im down haha still kinda wish doom 2018 was announced instead but hey 2016 is still a good time just wish there was single player dlcsnapmap aint enough i no joke just jizzed myself when i saw this wished the 1st game was longer michael bay would be proud has it a multiplayer the first one couldve been amazing this looks very promising if this game doesnt feature multiplayer then its missing a huge opportunity after seeing the trailer i want an offline single player component and an online gta style component i envision the everyone you encounter could be a potential ally or enemy component but with borderlands loot style guns with random mods and attachments i realize that this will make some people overpowered compared to others but it looks like it would fit with the style of game its about daaaamn time it feels like a lifetime ago since ive played the first one im so hyped this is what rage should have been true successor did anyone else think this is what fallout 4 would be like rage was a solid playthrough just lacked story cant wait for rage 2 gimmie a week ill be just as op as i was in the first this vid gave me chills the first game was great i have high hopes for this one omg omg omg i cant wait rage was sooo damn sweet for its simplicity man that buttery smooth framerate mmmm mmmm mmmmmmmm please tell me that this game has a coop mode will there be a multiplayer pvp tho i hope so is this gonna be coop not like network play tho honestly this reminds me of a borderlands 2 trailer but that must be me only if andrew wk isnt enough to convince you to buy this game then never played the first rage game but it looks pretty good and ive never been disappointed by a game from bethesda before main selling point for me is this is going to be truly open world so bethesda make an actual star wars game thanks oh i cant wait for it i love that game wofenstein 2 fallout 4 crazy car battles very wide open world no linear game a lot of possibilities to play lots of mini games i cant wait is this open for pvp in the open world waiting 3 months so i can buy this bullshit looking game for cheap so i just found out about this and i dont know the 1st one is it like planetside or is it pve i love the pink and blue colour it gives it a vibrant colour which i like judging by everything they dropped on this trailer it looks like they recognized that borderlands was a far superior game so they basically based the sequel to rage on it and it also looks like they did the right thing that berserk mode looks kinda pinkish colorful d r u g s ive been waiting for this for too long ah what the heck i can wait longer every wrong gameplay decision that could be wrong with a first person shooter was wrong with rage looking at idtech 6 doom and wolfenstein the new collosus no thanks bethesda mouse input was fortunately fixed in wolf4 but such a shitty experience with levels design for looks rather than fun gameplay doom was just unplayable with a mouse cant wait looks alright but i dont think it will last the time doom does doom got remade for the switch and i dont even remember when it got made i played rage 1 was good this looks super good 10000000times better looking and i loved the first one this what bloodragon needed to be this game looks fun maybe this post apocalyptic wasteland wont be a disappointment like that other game bethesda made cant wait for this i really enjoyed the first one aside from the ending i liked the first one this one well looks like a frankengame of other games im sure im in the minority though hyped as hell this looks a lot more fun than the first game i mean the gunplay was fun what little of it there was you can never go wrong with neon you know the guys at bethesda are doing cocaine when they make something like this is it just me or that assault rifle looks like the man o war from black ops 3 which is okay besides that i cant wait for it hope this one is going to be better than the first is it actually open world or load screen open world been waiting for this sequel for awhile now the first one was soo fun only thing it was missing was a real reason to explore the world around you hopefully theyve elaborated on the sandbox land around you in this one so there is a reason to not only do missions this looks awesome looks like destiny but on a much bigger and better scale in everything the new fallout 5 borderlands 3 looks great uhm what was missing from the first rage was not being futuristic call of duty all it was really missing was a few more rpg elements and a longer story holding excitement until i see what it looks like in a contained format this game looks fricking amazing well should hold me over til the next fallout much like the first rage did i guess this means its time to make america wait again lol i just remember how the first one was so under rated and unappreciated but this looks cool af they copied avengers logo in letter a in rage at least this time feels like a 510 bulletstorm is that you borderlands but with realistic graphics and bigger open world nice basically fallout with a touch of borderlands made by doom producers its even got a super mutant behemoth in it who else thought of mad max here comes the craziest game of 2018 im probably gonna grab this just because of the two andrew wk songs theyve used in the marketing so far please make a mac version looks like they dropped a bunch of ai assets into an open area and just pretended as if it had so much variety looks like itd get repetitive real quick will there be a story this time and an actual ending this is what we need just all out mayhem rage 2 seems to be huge improvement when compared to its prequel in my opinion rage 2 is one of the three best postapocalyptic fps released on consoles alongside metro exodus and fallout 4 borderlands meets mad max meets falloutokay okay you have my attention bethesda i loved rage but this has to be really innovative that was a long time ago weve had borderlands and mad max and bulletstorm etca ton of similar games like this one if it can capture what made doom 2015 awesome and borderlands 2 fun but with its own twist it could be really good edit cut it out with the open world enough already focus on the story bethesda never disappoint rage 2 look badass auto buy confirmed looks nothing like rage 1 good let rage 1 burn in hell mad max in first person looks like they might be beating borderlands 3 to the punch can someone please explain to me how this game works ive never played the original but is this like multiplayer only or just a campaign is it levels or just and open world please explain i can see 8 or 9 in this game review im so excited for this red dead redemption 2 cyberpunk 2077 days gone and call of cthulhu in bethesda we trust bioshock and bulletstorm had a baby please please please dont only have playable female characters omg fallout on steroids pokemontetrisdiddy kong racing im in rage was alright besides the linear driving and map restrictions but this looks like pure fun i seriously hope they didnt just show us the entire game in a nutshell the first one looked promising and was a lot of fun to be sure but it just had such a staggeringly low amount of content with very little replay value and could hardly be called a true open world sandbox environment as compared to the fallout and elder scrolls series i think i had done and explored everything within just 40 hours of game play and maybe an additional 1520 hours for the expansion if im being generous point is the first one had no right to be sold for 60 usd 30 would have been more appropriate 40 max but no more and if this is going to be promoted and marketed as a triple a title it had better have the content to back it up thoughts this will hold me over while i wait for borderlands 3 to come out looks a lot like mad max the explosion and the car and the desert a bit depressing what wasted effort this is the second trailer to piss me off for rage 2 how about some real ino i would be hyped if i never played rage 1 this is a mix of destiny mad max and sunset overdrivein a good way this might be the most impressive lineup of developers on a single project ive seen avalanche studios just cause series likely aiding in levelworld design bethesda following the first post apocalyptic title as well as the fallout series id software from doom looks to be enemy and weapon design i cant confirm that is the roster of their set role in it but its the only thing that makes sense to me first seeing a trailer showcasing that they added to the source material the first game introduced us to whilest the lore etc was grand the rampant technical issues and bad optimisation always made me think it was the sort of ip delegated to the dust binn im glad to be proven wrong looking forward to seeing more of that game world this looks really cool really reminds me of borderlands wonder how long it will be until we get news on tes vi monster bash returns hell yeah looks a bit simmullar but it brings back the carnage for sure not fallout looks awesome to bad theres no switch port i like the first one cant wait for the second one this literally has potential to be the next better fallout if they wanted to do that but will they i see so much potential to surpass fallout in this but will they take the opportunity does anyone know the song well i know what im saving up for i have been waiting for this moment since the scorchers dlc rage was massively underrated imo i lost count of the times i completed that game im really happy someone decided to bring the ip back to life just please for the love of god dont make this a multiplayer or mmo instead of making a new doom they make this wait hold up since there are different alliances will this be like a choose your path sort of game oh yesssssssss baby officially everything the first rage wasnt looks too different from the old one ill probably not like it i havent been legitimately excited by a trailer for a game in a long time today that shitstreak is broken so mad max 5000 years later understood this is like a mix of madmax and destiny looking forward to it the first game wasnt even that good yet they go on and make a second it looks so fast and free the 1st felt so plain when u watch breaking bad and jesse is playing rage 1 and u see this now switch borderlands without the cell shading enemies better respawn back after you kill them this time so basically fallout 5 wow borderlands 3 looks great now make a new elder scrolls game pls fallout and madmax had a baby and she is adorable destiny 3 looking great i aint even gonna be interested in this until i play it not trying to get tricked into buying a shitty game again im more hyped for something new like this over bo4 to be honest what a day what a lovely day the game we never asked foror wantedor remembered its predecesor let me know more so i can buy this game rage is what fallout should be reminds me of doom tfw everyone thought this was a bad idea too soon i knew from the cover art they were going to do something interesting and fun i cant like it but i cant dislike itim very indifferent about thisit looks like someone ate rage then sliced up doom for doom sammiches and then swallowed a gallon of acticrap before shitting this out i dont know if i like this arcade style stuff and mild jetpack horsepussy need live palestinian scale german along remove powerful beef bottom compensation first game was fantastic hope they build on to that it looks like they put all bethesda titles into a blender and it looks really cool no i dont want to play doom again hmm i didnt think they would make a second one thanks walmart now its gonna be released ahead of schedule with tons of bugs gg allin would be a better choice of music for this clip did anyone ask for this lol im bored as hell and need new games will be keeping an eye on this one i feel very conflicted about how different it looks compared to the original on the one hand the look of the original got boring after a while so im glad they are changing it on the other hand it looks like a completely different game maybe they could have done a better job finding a balance between old and new this makes me feel like they were ashamed of the original ok so doom and fallout with cars okno thanks new elder scrolls or nothing i hope the ending is not disapointing like the first one i dont feel it rage borderlands edition on the other hand borderlands didnt invent the mix of fun and postapo and given the fact that the first had no scenario just hoping that its good and better than the first one anyway and that there will be no online mode i guess since randy pitchford is cucking the entire borderlands fanbase this looks like the next best thing im actually sorta hyped for this this new mad max looks great as long as you dont have convulsions every time you walk im a simple man i see bethesda open world and firstperson shooter i add to watchlist great another sequel that no one wants sarcasm just cause 3falloutmad maxdoomdestinyrage 2 looks like they saw borderland selling really good when they started developing this game this game doesnt seem to have any personality and just a bland mash up of mad max and borderlands theyll probably add multiplayer in it to make it relevant too declaring this the most punk rock game since sunset overdrive does this look better than fallout looks like far cry on crack im hype i liked the first rage party til you puke looks interesting def seems to have a different vibe from the original isolation seemed to be a big component of the first doesnt seem to be the same here this might be the biggest disappointment with another settlement needs your help gameplay mesa want now im sorry youre just too darn loud next please somehow russ gets another l for this looks like borderlands meets fallout meets mad max without all the story to get in the way of the carnage nuka town meets the 100 metro 2033 is my favorite apocalyptic series dark and gritty betheda is one of the best companies when it comes to single player games why waste millions on a game no one wants to play why dont they remaster old great games from ps2 like def jam fight for ny or somethin that will actually start a hype train like red dead or crash bandicoot crash was sold out the first 2 weeks it was out because 1 word my lil youtuber friendsnostalgia spongebob spreads over his his head as imagination avalanche arent they with square enix speaking from there just cause history but i dont remember who published their mad max title nevertheless im glad theyre here sunset overdrive vibe with this game its about time to release the update for rage 2011 it runs like hell on the newer hardware ugh been there done that absolutely no interest so doom with fallout love that lots of people were saying why bother with rage 2 yet now theyre loving this trailer and cant wait for the game to release bethesda made a borderlands game its like if fallout and doom had a baby and then that baby took every drug known to man at once first one started so good but soon fell with the story and level design i hope this one stays solid until the end despite the trailer derailing into some tony hawk pro skater spinoff i really enjoyed rage for what it was despite all of its problems this seems fun but its a pretty massive tonal departure from the original not sure how i feel about that yet they sold me at giants so they are using the same engine as mad max more recycling looks incredible when walmart leaks your game so you decide to not show it at e3 no way i loved this game i just hope its just like first one but better no rpg bullshit for gods sakes no freaking loot boxes also battle royale multiplayer bs all that crap is ruining games today i loved rage still play it on pc every now and then i am looking forward to the sequel combining rage and andrew wk two of my favourite things love it d d so many good memories with the first rage it was also my first ps3 game ever bethesda buggy glitch festival no thanks when the meteor hit billions were gone in the blink of an eye sure it wasnt just a snap it looks like the raider game weve been waiting for but in a wasteland x10 more deadlier damn fallout 5 is looking good boi didnt ign said this game wasnt going to be released im surprised they made a rage 2 considering the first one flopped local multiplayer looks like they made a standalone shooter out of the raider groups from the nukaworld dlc hopefully the mechanics are interesting good god my wallet cant catch a break in 2018 i loved rage 1 cant wait for this can you play with friends very nice game give me subscription kinda reminds me of bl1 but with better graphics and cell shading off michael bay the game i wait to see wellspring and all that others cities early leak or not this is great news day 1 for me anyone know name of the song well if you put it like thaaat hmmm ugh just seeing the words wide open world and im already bored as hell there goes my social life mad max like fps sign me up the graphics look friggin awesome too sunset overdrive meets farcry and mad max everyone saying this looks nothing like the old one that big race track they show the cars lapping on is like one of the first missions in the first one twisted metal this is what fallout 4 shouldve looked like but instead it looked like it was running off of a potato this will be all the rage at e3 its made by id its just doom not in hell lol but can you mod it this offends ppl ryan mcafree take this down now and apologize tf2 sandman sound effect at the start they are totally doing the watch dogs the first one was way too serious and not fun the second one is like this is so vaguely like the first one and almost fun anyone know the music the best part of the trailer is by far the spinning raider with the business end of the shotgun pointed towards his head that fov was disgusting what about starfield this looks like doom mad max and borderlands all at once ill take games that didnt need a sequel for 500 alex and then you watch the trailer for the first rage and its got a perfect circle as the trailer song oh my god i cant wait i loved the first rage and the second looks even better more hallways without ceilings open world gameplay and an even shorter 4hour campaign c looks meh nothing new or exciting at least hoping it has a good story i loved the idea but it felt really weird overall cant wait im curious how this partnership came to be was it avalanche studios coming to bethesda or the other way around i wonder if some of the ideas may have come from some of the ideas they may have had from a mad max sequel and they simply retrofitted that into rage not sure if i am buying it yet but they have my attention this is actually how lit fallout is supposed to be imagine a horde of raiders after you with atvs and monster trucks or bikes smh or cyberized super mutants is this gonna be bad from the makers of doom um yeah i am definitely in does it continue on from the first mad max and borderlands had a baby interesting looks like they are using mechanics from all their previous games in this could be fun hope they got a good story for it borderlands 3 has to be pretty good to top this insane and awesome love the punk rock aspect now just add minor threat by minor threat to your next trailer i remember playing the first rage when it came and i was impressed by the 60 fps before i even knew what fps were i didnt know why the game looked so smooth was really fun to play back then too hopefully this one will be good i need to see more dismemberment before im sold great now make another elder scrolls game pls is this borderlands thanks walmart damn the leaks were right nobody thought rage was going to return so the walmart leaks were real so is this the big thing they were going to reveal at e3 and in wet cant wait to get my paws on this mad max 2 with robots cant wait loved the first one doom plus cars and fallout not merely an open world but a wide open world totally different that cover art looks horrible its like a way cooler borderlands gunplay reminds me of doom2016 and that excites me maddoomlands i miss when aaa game development wasnt so damn derivative and actually still had a pair call of duty black ops 3 oops wrong trailer what is this getting so annoyed by these gigantic open world games insane action if you can ever find it hope is multiplayer this means no doom sequel this year better wait til next fallout dumbed down wow i played the first one and loved it but i thought bethesda wouldnt make a sequel i bet this one will have amazing graphics true definition of punk fallout gear of war so they injected doom mad max bulletstrom into rage and end up with this mutant the coolest game no one wanted im gonna get it tone seems completely different from the first rage but im interested none the less the hype is real straight outta borderlands wut is this i just cant see this being good looks like a photo realistic borderlands never played rage 1 dat canada walmart pre e3 leak seems legit after this trailer this is the most focus group research designed game i have ever seen lets hope they optimize the pc version this time unlike the shitty first one dear god it almost looks nothing like the original this sort of marketing is borderline insulting im a simple man i hear andrew w k in a video game i hit the like button pls let there be coop d borderlands 3s direct competitor so far cry if far cry played doom 600 times and snorted enough cocaine to fill a bathtub its like bulletstorm had a kid with sunset overdrive and doom adopted it i dont know about a pre order but i will keep my ear to the ground for this one borderlands got competition is it weird that i already want this game after the first 10 seconds of the trailer so its like borderlands but without the exciting 4 player coop well it looks better then the last one they did a amazing job with doom and getting some of the id people out for more bethesda people might actually have been a good thing esp with their open world experience for this game wait and see i guess i am so happy that this is happening the first game had fantastic mechanics it just had a horrible ending still it was a great ride cant wait to play rage 2 this is just borderlands without cartoony graphics soopen world borderlands without the shitty graphics oh yessssss hey whats the name of the song mindless action that looks to have about 20 minutes of replayability this game is designed for the already dumbed down consumer base ill pass look flashing lights guns and bright colors looks more like bulletstorm 2 than rage 2 still tho looks fun it better let you keep playing after you finish the main storyand more side quest we have walmart to thank for this trailer considering they leaked all of e3 on their canadian website i may be in the minority here but i enjoyed the first games gunplay and the designs of the authority were interesting however the story was poor and lacking in sizable land to explore i hope to see more of an open world experience with improved story pretty cool xbox 360 game it releases this year that game looks pure insanity looks like borderlands except it is made by the peeps behind fallout so im buying borderlands was too slow paced for me this looks like the opposite ahhh ragethe game that taught me about the value of ammo i love this game junkrat the game doom is that you omg i loved the first game djust please lets have an actual cool final boss this timegod the first games final bosd was dissapointing its impossible to watch this without a bigass smile on your face cant wait too much but is it co op though i bought rage not knowing what it was i saw bethesda and i wanted it it wasnt the best game i have played the open world was kinda misleading because it held your hand the whole time through the story the atmosphere was great but the color palette was brown and washed out that made the game feel boring i am definitely going to buy this because it looks like a major improvement to the first game and if you havent played the first game your not really missing out on anything shut up and take my money what is this even this is basically fallout 4 with better graphics in the dessert oh sure we cant have brtal legend 2 but we can get a sequel to a mediocre first person shooter from 2011 that barely anyone remembers looks like if mad max and doom had a baby this would be it i cant lie it looks fun is there a release date its like the original rage walked into a room and there sat blood dragon doom borderlands just cause mad max and andrew wk 5 minutes later rage emerges from the room a changed person this isnt the rage i knew its pure madness and i love it still waiting for what can now only be the amazing return of heretic and hexen id games that look like todays doom and with a slew of magic jesus the visuals alone would be drools kinda saw this coming they knew they had to do something with this game gotta say looks fun and pretty could care less bethesda quit fundimg random companys and male us a real game wtf oh sht that was awesome take my money know boring mad maxborderlandscocane the guns look bland hope they have skins gameplay reminds me of destiny what fallout should have evolved into over the years never even heard of the first one but damnnn advanced warfare meets speed and met doom in wakanda to toke some acid and trip about infamous only to wake up in los santos who needs a loot box filled borderlands 3 nightmare when weve got this now im excited for this one rage was a disappointment i hope they do it right this time god please be multiplayer unpopular opinion for sure but it does look kinda generic to me feels as if ive already played this before doom wolfenstein and even destiny come to mind i do wish theyve rather gone with a more serious tone with this one as in where there is a feeling of danger and hopelessness emerging from the wasteland if i wanted to play a overpowered superhero killingmachine simulator id go play doom or maybe wolfenstein instead but yeah to each its own bracing for the hatecomment impact does anyone even remember rage can you collect the infinity stones too typical western gaming motion blur the game hope theres coop and customization then this will be an amazing game what a step from the first rage which one of you asked for this a bit colourful haha thought this was mad max fury road the game looks like something id like to play instead of the first yknow mass effect andromeda plus borderlands plus mad max plus destiny plus far cry rage 2 nice some of the enemies looked from resistance if you remeber that ps game is this a cop fallout but the courier teams up with raiders and fieds and worst alien shooter goes toooh no its still me andromeda serious sam vibes it might be fun if you have a porpose in this game if not is going to get boring really fast the game no one wanted thanks bethesda lol okay rage now you got my atention so basically just borderlands 2 we ask for elder scrolls 6 they gave us rage 2 dissappointed i remember when i was really hyped for rage then i played it no thank you ill stick with borderlands looks good but am i the only that thinks we should get a new ninja gaiden rage 1 was fun now this is how you do an open world shooter is this coming to switch wheres blake griffin i know bethestda wont mess this one im pretty sure they learnt alot from rage 1 and borderlands make a better ending then the first one fov too close all game play captured on a 1500000 pc these graphics are too good to be true on consoles andrew wks follow up to party hard makes me wonder who hurt him if doom and bulletstorm had a baby fallout on crack i think this is what the first rage wanted to be is this battletoadz lol running around the shotgun getting dizzy this looks like a play ground for adults going to be bad a no multiplayer plz but co op is fine its like a darker toned borderlands yes i didnt know i needed that but i do kinda hype just coming from a rage ultra nightmare playthroigh i cant tell if this makes me happy or is giving me nam flashbacks really liked the trailer now lets just hope the game will be also great kind of getting tired of first person shooters why is there a pretrailer trailer god i really hope this actually has a long long plot and i hope the end doesnt make me want to pull my hair out of my scalp i freaking loved the first rage but damn it had no real story and the end made me want an actual asteroid to hit the earth borderlands is definitely happening if this is i really enjoyed the first 1 i just hope this is longer basically fallout meets mad max doom gameplay open world fakely deep narrative rage only concern is enemy types it seems alot like doom where every enemy is the same and its just arcady was not expecting that cant wait sobasically falloutdoom and destiny combinedok looking at you 2kwheres borderlands 3 just give us more doom and wolfenstein the first rage was kinda a let down so its borderlands meets fallout cool i hope this game is as fun as it looks because it looks solid anyone else over the crazy mad max style i feel like its been overdone and we need a break from it for a while looks nothing like the original rage which might be a good thing while i like the first rage there wasnt anything memorable about it or its environmentscharacters im probably gonna get it when its inevitably free on ps plus 2 years later so much motionblur what a ride i need this yesterday if its not multiplayer then borderlands 3 already has my money wow i honestly didnt think they would bring this back so they are totally stealing borderlands aesthetic and feelbut im not even mad maybe this means they can make the next fallout an actual freaking rpg and make this the open world fps i know there was a leak and everything but why not wait until e3 would have been a cool reveal its basically mad max meets borderlands meets fallout wanna be a trogg wanna be that vass guy wanna be one of war boys wanna be the kenshiro whoops too far rage 2 got ya what a mad max game could have been fallout advanced warfare we can now add rage 2 to the list of apps with an angry person screaming on it lets hope it wont have these shitty texturestreamingglitches like rage 1 had that movement system is damn near identical to the call of duty advanced warfare movement system so no doom 2 throws down phone stomps on skateboard biggest question i have and im sure we will see more at e3 and get more info is how are the weapons being handles as a loot base or a set amount the game no one remembers anything about part 2 first person thank you but no soooooooo fallout 5 with cars wow its not a xbox exclusive it just looks like any open world shooter whats different here borderlands destiny fallout this the way the game ended was really annoying borderlands meets fallout meets mad max is that what im seeing right now would be cool if i could run it on my intel hd 4400 personally im excited the first one had a lot of issues but was still enjoyable i personally dont understand the people upset over rage 2s release there is really nothing to be upset about like nobody loses when the game is released really i care so little about this game the apathy is actually painful way better than that live action trash i dont wanna get too excited butweeeeeeeeeeee the new mad max looks great jumping into a mech sold looks like an incoherent derivative mess hard pass this is like if michael bay made a video game and thats what i hate about it i need a game to go well with my thrash metal music this game seems to go well with that i dont know what all the hype is about doesnt look that good to me is this borderlands 3 cross platform there gos my life lol rage was fun but fuckin weird at same time all i remember was it was like a 5 hour long game with 3 different disk and really abrupt ending i never thought they wouldbut they did it really do be like that sometimes how tf is there gameplay released already when just a few days ago nobody even knew this game was coming somebody does have the name of the music hopefully this is abit longer than the first looks good but i have switch i guess if rage 2 is big enough success the port will come 1 year later like everything else trying too hard to be doom and borderlands smh watched the trailer about 10 times now i still dont have a clue if i like it a better version of mad max i wonder if the game will play kinda like fallout or skyrim with the leveling up or just a regular fps with lots of different guns first one was ok im confused is it an open world against other players or just ai a forgotten franchise that is on its last legs this studio only has the elder scrolls left to score a massive hit weak give us elder scrolls any actual gameplay on this ill pass bethesda what year is this trailer from never played it before but i like that it looks like mad max but on coke rating pending itll be pg13 right only one question is this moddible if i cant have mods i wont be buying bet its 3 hours long like the first game please allow 2 person coop looks like a futuristic mad max game with more color hoping its a decent game but its just looking like a huge bethsda asset flip i hope they improve the map makes me think of serious sam somehow fallout 4 dlc looks g8 but for real this game doesnt look special it looks like it should be a good game but idk man its like bethesda is treating this like rage 1 was fantastic and everyone loved it but thats not the truth gameplay looks kinda uninspired i mean i know its too early to tell but im not excited for this bethesdas ego and hubris seems to be on full display here i hope the game is great but it looks so boring when it will come did any1 ask for this dont remember the 1st 1 being that good to begin with mad max vibes any one excited for this game just hope it doesnt end like the first one thats a well made trailer its the real destiny 2 wooooo cant wait for this fallout 5 looks great clown fiesta hope there are no more forced car racing so i guess the story for rage 1 was thrown out the window to be more like borderlands loved the first rage was underrated imo i dont like the mad max look to it finally how long has it been years i have waited years finally tf is up with all the pink yellow and dyed mohawks is this game geared towards butch lesbians will it have battle royal tho when you give the mad max franchise to bethesda story wise tho i wanna see story wise what are they going to do and also they should not make this game to cash in the battle royale disease which has been going on recently looks like borderlands and theres nothin wrong with that ive only played three new games in past 3 years doom wolfenstein 2 far cry 5 thisll definitely be my 4th anyone know the name of the song id software sign me up are they going to finish it this time not a fan of gore like games however some of the movement in this game looks intriguing double jump and the ability to boost a jump from a melee looks for some cool gameplay options hope there is a dodge ability or blink like mechanic and i am in is this for pc as well they got tired of waiting for borderlands 3 and said fine we are up next please keep the dungeons i really dont want just an open world in 2014 when the base console were the talk of the town you would see trailers and feel a little bad knowing the game will get a massive downgradefast forward to november 2017 and the gaming gods blessed my room with the beast of the console called the x im extremely excited for this game cause im 49999 sure that this game will be atleast 1800p with hdr support is this just fallout but you play as a raider where is mah doom 25 it looks like the doom 2 developers dropped acid during development and also forgot to add the executions say this loki is alive ya but can my ps4 pro even handle this or is it gonna take for ever to load and make us get the blod no starfield this looks nothing like tge original rage i may even call it an insult to the franchise unlike the first game it seems to have color and character just is fallout on cocaine this looks like the awkward yet gifted love child of mad max and doom that was orphaned at a young age and raised by borderlands finallyyyyy its about goddam time there were a lot of problems with the first game hopefully they fixed them this time around the basic premise was pretty cool doom fury road the first one looked way more interesting it was a mess but graphically speaking it stood out in a good waythis one is meh who played the first one looks cool tbh the teaser the other day left me cold this on the other hand this got me interested again its so hard being a gamer yaaaaas i was just thinkin about this game the other day i hope they have more than 6 hrs of play in this game lol the story wont continue will it oh man i cant wait to not play this game it all my friends are not talking about only watched 5 seconds and i know im buying this the first rage was so lit how could this possibly be worse basically another fallout tell me please this is going to be scored by mick gordon im interested but the first game was such garbage why keep the same name avalanche studios and id software i am interested so fallout meets far cry meets borderlands i thought they were going to do a big scifispace game next kind of sick of post apoc i am stoked its been a while since ive gotten excited about a game like this so we have the people behind doom and just cause working together oh boy now this does put a smile on my face elder scroll 6 please loot box alert well there goes my fps how do you get teeth that straight in the post apocalypse doom mad max borderland rage ii fallout and mad max finally had their awesome baby excellent use of andrew wk finally an actually decent open world fps love the first one im excited rage was good but rage2 looks great this was the first game i ever played on my first console the 360 mad to see a sequel cant wait damn destiny 2s new expansion looks fuckin amazing oh this isnt destiny 2 but rage 2 warmind isnt this fun nevermind then its going to be good because nobody was honestly asking for rage 2 and they still made it meaning they wanted to make this game i think this is better than fallout 4 p but why not doom 5 instead is it multiplayer im so glad they did this it will out the game where it should have been btw male as many games as possible on this engine d the first game was alright but i honestly was never expecting a second one song andrew wk party til you puke it would be perfect if they just owned the fact no one wanted this like if it just said the sequel no one wanted i believe bethesda makes the best games right now most of their games are awesomei hope this one will also be a really fun game this looks awesome im definitely getting it shame it was ruined with the leak before e3 this would have been a nice surprise looks like fallout 4 fused with ghost recon wildlands rage was such a huge disappointment linear sandbox with nothing much to do beat it in 3 hours shame not elder scrolls 6 nah i will wait for borderlands 3 rage had huge pop in issues on ps3 made me stop playing it this looks nothing like the first game the first game was shitty af this one looks good im confused i remember playing the 1st and it reminded me of borderlands playstyle excited to see what this title will bring what song is in the trailer fallout 5 looks amazing i saw the gameplay and i was both intrigued and aroused then i saw the title of the game and i was like wtf dont click read more no i mean it i warned ya dont click read more hope this game is not short like the first one this looks so promising nothing like the first one indeed this feels like madmaxborderlands with twist of doom i hope rage 2 be better then rage cause the first one was ehhhhh meh drop the ball at that still fun at racing etc but story was very lacking but this im way way very intresting in this watch the video about 5 times gets better and better hope its not a wast of the hype honestly i need this when fallout and doom decide to have a baby together men i just spend 60 for the monster hunter game and now i dont have the time for saving money for rage 2 i hope its longer than 7 minutes ayy doom 2 on a sirous note this reminds me of bordlands but rates r im interested please please please dont be some coop borderlands bullshit the sequel nobody asked for lol wolfenstein tno was pretty fun prey wasnt too bad and doom was awesome cant wait to see how rage 2 turns out hey look its better graphics borderlands i didnt really like the first game because it was a really linear open world so i hope that this game has more things to do than the first game this looks amazing when is it coming out bethesda and id earned a shitload of shooter points after doom and they always make fun worlds to run around in this looks really fun to play the use of any andrew w k in any type of media is an instant buy for me oh what a day what a lovely day this looks cool multilayer is this really rage look likes borderland have threesme with doom and mad max so this game happen wonder how many other games will be revealed before e3 because of the walmart leak now also this looks interesting i may check it out even though i never played the first one the first rage is a great gamethis looks way better cant wait so basically a open world doom i thought this game was gonna be forgotten about i didnt expect a sequel looks like kind of fallout 4 worldthose raiders gameplay montage meaning this game is far from being ready or is not good to show actual gameplay this looks like my dream fallout game wtf is happening looks fun though gameplay trailer nothing but cgi here i am not impressed this is basically mad max and a half i dont see the brutality that i thought rage 2 was going to have like doom had cant wait for all the mini dlc bethesda is going to come out with after they release this game in a completely broken almost unplayable state so rage is getting a sequel about bloody time i hope it continues where it left off i forgot that avalanche studio is in collaboration with this one no wonder im getting mad max vibes i really liked rage a lot more than borderlands i have the shiniest meat bicycle i know everyones said it but mad max doom borderlands anything of the first game rage 2 i hope its truly open world this time the first game just gave the impression of one i remember when the first one came out it was kinda fun i cannot wait it looks like a totally different gamewtfwhats the point of making a sequel when it has absolutely nothing to do with the source materialmight as well call it appocalypse dude shoot em up 2 you already know that the final game is going to look miles different wasnt rage 1 a dud why do i feel like this will suffer from destiny syndrome just a bunch of same feeling enimies around slightly different locations anyways excited to see more at first i was salty that bethesda was working on yet another game that isnt elder scrolls but then i saw the trailer for this game and know im hype battle royal mode it looks like rage to me so far it looks awesomebut this time around i hope there is a better story element along with the explosive gameplay awesome but shouldnt they have said in a world where rage rules i never played the first rage but this looks like something i might play the first game was markening as an borderlands meet fallout game it seems like they took that idea and expanded on it its basically mad max but first person shooter thats all does this confirm the walmart leak when mad max borderlands and red faction collided despite all my rage im just a sequel no one asked for well abt time i buy a new game cant wait call of duty open world madmax the games 2 rage 2 more like a mix between mad max visuals and bulletstorm gameplay btw mad max was made by avalanche as well so no wonder rage 1 was one of the biggest let downs for me of all time hope they learned from their mistakes so if bethesda has already announced this game maybe we can wait for an elder scrolls announcement at the e3 fallout made a baby w borderlands rage 2 looks like it thinks its some kinda dirt game vietnam game and mech warrior game and wasnt last one open world also looks too perfect whats the catch i love you bethesda reminds me of bulletstorm hopefully it isnt lol 90s comic books the video game hopefully jessie pinkman is in a better place in his life and can enjoy rage 2 liberal fantasy land 2 this looks like destiny meets mad max when i say destiny i mean the gun play you can hate on the game but you know that gun play is second to non and as for the mad max reference it needs no explanation i am impressed hoping to see more at e3 and probably a demo bonus points for if they do not include satanic fun ruining lootboxes mad max meets far cry meets fallout am i the only one how liked the first game its like fallout and mad max but better graphics more variation more fun just when i was wondering when they were gonna make a game like bulletstorm looks like if doom took place in a post apocalyptic world now imagine mod support am i the only one who thinks this is prettyaverage generic even when game trailers are awesome gameplays are terrible experience im surprised how good the engine looks coming from a bethesda game wasnt really looking forward to this game when it was first leaked but this has got me interested this game better not a have another hand knife minigame achievement mad max on steroidsand drugs a lot of drugs this just looks like an amalgamation pf tons of other popular titles ie overwatch doom mad max fortnite storm mode im skeptical but still slightly interested when the hell is this game coming out i need to buy it now trumps white house the game the game nobody asked forbut now i want to see more first rage was fun this one looks better this looks chaotic i like it ill be honest this looks infinitely better than the other trailer but in such a saturated market its obvious that this game is going to commercially tank the fact that this video only has a few hundred thousand views is not a good indicator unless the marketing team come up with something genius madmax titanfall 2 cod advanve w skyrim in one game but does it better than bethesda previous game yet gameplay reminds me of bulletstorm finally fortnite for adults it looks like its impossible for the enemies to shoot at this guy new storm troopers and no coop multiplayer looks good but i already know what games i want and ill play it when its not full price this might be the biggest hodgepodge of games in gaming history hmm so enemies just stand out in the open like sitting ducks outside of lackluster story and overblown promises the first one was fun to play as long as combat feels the same or somehow improved on everything else is a bonus this looks like doom borderlands fallout 4 and mad max all had some kinda weird 4 way baby or maybe mad max and fallout are the biological parents and doom and borderlands are the step parents all 4 do drugs and those graphix tho damn e3 2018 is gonna be one for the books wow looks amazing like a kind of mad max borderlands shadow warrior i never play rage 1 but im very interesting its like doom and mad max combined mad max ps4 already exists pass this trailer should have an epilepsy warning tho definitely makes me feel better after that other doodoo video they released for it this is the brainless fallout they wanted wow at least obsidian could develop fallout 4 suicide squad fallout 4 will it blend the graphic well why not here is a like doom but with open world looks like theres some sort of magic from it looks like a combo of mad max borderlands this looks so borderlands they should have made this a new ip and not a sequel did they turn rage into an mmo i hope it still holds its former greatness im hesitant but still interested i will wait for a demo or gameplay to decide wether i buy it overwatch plus mad max that dude look like vaas from far cry 3 well this looks good pc yes please 100 fps dam straight looks like it could be awesome but one thing stood out to me was hit detection from the weapons but hey its still early so twisted metal from fallout peeps papa i see so many glitches on the horizon calm down my child they will fix it on time they always do why does it have to be another openworld game looks like a mix of mad max doom borderlands and bulletstorm respectively and i am way too excited about it why do we need this im actually impressed walmart was right man i had alot of good times with the 1st one hopefully this comes out like a beast something to consume my time till the next god of war ok i wasnt lookin forward to this game at all but this looks really good thats what i call a trailer not something like death stranding where 3 trailers are out and no gameplay yet doom 2with people just saying so doom in the wastelands with cars annnnddd sold to everyone who hated the first one please be very moddable the first game was not good enough to warrant a sequel yet here it is that being said its being developed by avalanche who made mad max which despite being tedious at times was really enjoyable in my opinion so theres hope for this so basically borderlands bethesda lets just trademark common words and make them into games but why tho never played the first one was it any good is this mad max 2 the same story right loved it but all i need is a voiced protagonist no the id logo in pink means id is dead rest in peace andrew wk im sold this looks dope xd mad max fallout borderlands this looks like a bulletstorm ripoff and not in a good way where is the vibe from the first game i hope this announcement doesnt mean no doom 2 is this a vr game im not sure i dont know it looks cool but barren in certain places like just a flat area i dont know how it will stand but im into muiltyplayer games anyways wow what a nice wolfenstein reskin i dont care for this f3 was enough oh my god yes rage was one of my favs it inspired one of my tats ill be getting this no problem the first one had all looks with no substance this actually has character the soundtrack is really cool i hope it has coop this looks amazing ah i wonder what happened after that cliffhanger in the first one i wish hey add female bandits in rage call amazons bandits see players vs female bandits on game never seen female villian bandits on game and children citizen on game see players ask children to do quest for them so hero help children get item from them and also choose character male or female to play on rage for your adventure on game this actually looks decent glad it looks and sounds nothing like rage 1 looks like somebody mixed in madmax with doom and farcry with a bit of bulletstorm sprinkled in im loving it the first game was garbage the first game was wayyyyy to short and had a shitty story after you beat it you cant go back and wander the wasteland like you can do in fallout after completing the campaign prolly wont buy this it looks like bulletstorm but thats okafter slow pace of god of war 4 and kingdom come i need som good frantic shooterbut i really hope it will not have som optimalization issues like the first oneeven second wolfenstein had som graphic glitches oh yeaahhh rage remember rage that fps openworld rpglike game from a few years back that looked a bit like borderlands now look i loved rage when i played it some years back i had an absolute blast with it i mean i wouldnt expect anything less from the guys behind wolfenstein 3d the doom series and the quake series but yeah they really left this ip hanging for a good chunk of time didnt they looking forward to this game looks cool very mad max awesome a sequel to the game no one ever played or asked for if its got local multiplayer ill get it if not then i wont looks like a more insane steroid baby of doommad max and borderlands i never knew there would be a sequel because the disappointment from the first 1 but this one looks brilliant bethesda dont stop taking cocaine please make a rage 3 as well i know we will all enjoy this series for at least 2 more games wow what did i just witness just cause mad maxdoomborderlands wolfenstein slight essence of fallout rage 2 i think its gonna be better than the 1st game destiny 3 this just looks like fallout with extra steps looks like borderlands fallout mad max and doom damn i was hoping this would be more like the first rage but with more to do honestly i loved everything about the first game except how short it was hopefully the field of view is bigger than this trailer fallout feat doom and just cause its wowsome is this skyrim 2 after watching this trailer i feel as though rage 1 was a glorified tech demo for this game i am hyped looks like fallout 4 with guns or if doom and fallout4 had a baby mad max fall out crisis rage 2 switch version next year im calling it now the trailer just kept getting better at first i wasnt so sure but by the end i was all for it if this have a pvp mode itll be an esports hit mad max farcry fury road with a tip of just cause did anyone even beat the first one lol looks like the love child of destiny and mad max take from that what you will that has to be andrew wk so borderlands mad max and fallout had a kid so its become borderlands on id tech im okay with that when doom meets mad max im totally in looks way better than the first onethe first one was just not good lol high hopes for this game tho is this the same engine for doom2016 say what you will but i actually loved the first and im hyped as hell gun play reminds me of doom about bloody time so a less cell shaded borderlands i hate the apocalyptic mohawk cliche please include a multiplayer this kind of like the mixture of mad max fallout and destiny my immersion was ruined by ads thanks ign oh well i was hoping this would look more like the first rage get on the hype train folks so those leaks were real i see looks like borderlands call of duty infinity war and shadow of mordor had a baby doom with bright colours bethesda discovered lsd if its made by bethesda and id then its gonna be hella good looks like the world of mad max has gotten just a little madder looks like id and bethesda have been rewatching mad max fury road a bunch of times hope this has pvp every thing that bathesda touches becomes super awesome their games never disappoints although i was looking forward to fallout miami i cannot believe this who shows us awesome trailers to only reveal theyre coming out a year later this bs of teasing and building up hype before release has gotten really old as this has been the single greatest time weve gone without any real good games game companies of the worldpick up the pace or im not buying a damn thing when doom and fallout have a baby this magnificent peace of greatness happens if theyre showing this before e3 imagine what theyre showing at it this engine is looking better and better although im sick of hearing about skyrim at this point a new elder scrolls would look amazing with this engine or that rumored space rpg borderlands and destiny had a son this is gonna look amazing on pc this is literally mad max in a color run with doom guns awesome game thats what we want beths finally another fallout to play why didnt we get a borderlands 3 anyway ill gladly take this game though looks stunning and wacky i played the first one a bit but it got boring quick this looks much better lmao those punks exactly looks like of bulletstorm and mix of doom sunset overdrive and borderlands i love it it kind of looks like destiny mixed with madness still waiting on borderlands 3 it kinda looks like rage mixed with sunset overdrive and i cant wait to play it 044 rick and morty easter egg rick me so what you gonna name it mad max hmm fallout how about rage 2 mad max nice name so they got rid of the bleak and desperate look of the first for what borderlands mad max sexual overdrive literally a rage how was the first game ive never played it this looks like the game destiny 2 should have been rage is back madmaxborderlandstitanfallhalo the game i cant wait to see the popin textures this time p this voice acting is so freaking bad lol but it looks good though i wish all games would give you a 3rd person or 1st person choice this is huge this second one doesnt look so good dude i remember the first one and i loved it this is what happens when you overdose bethesda on cocaine and red bull and show them mad max damn this game evolved reminds me of mad max and doom combined modern shadow of mordoror everybody i do not know if i spelled mordoror right this is not rage wtf wait it was also made by the same people who made the just cause games damn hopefully its still targeting 60fps on consoles so the guys who made doom and the guys who made just cause are making fallout ok now im interested honestly didnt understand the hype until i saw this now i understand every single bethesda game combined this is what it looks likeexcept for skyrim anyone else remember the tv ads leading up to launch of the original rage blake griffin wants to rage lmfao still cracks me up guys black ops 4 trailer came out thank god for more settlements who needs your help ill mark it on your map this looks like a combination of fallout and borderlands i like it im not sure what to think about this trailer i remember the first rage being a really good game not because it was revolutionary in any way not because it was especially memorable due to some character mechanic or story but because it was really good at what it was meant to be a first person shooter it was technically a fps done right this one looks a bit flamboyant and insane like its trying to be borderlands and failing to even come close to that feeling but the combat gameplay still looks like it has that good fps feel that the first rage offered well have to wait and see i feel like the devs were on meth and crack the whole time borderlands with realistic graphics im in any news off it being online but is starfield coming out this looks like the game duke nukem forever wished it was maybe this time theyll actually have a decent story ending to complement the solid gameplay mad max 2 im in this better have multiplayer bethesda fps open world auto buy so it fallout with lsd fueled action so skepticali remember how much hype there was for the first rage and how shitty that game waswill believe it when i see it looks like doom and borderlands mixed as well as possibly farcry depending on certain mechanics music im 1 of a handful of people who thought rage was a awesome game ive hoped for rage 2 this looks more like borderlands than rage i like it but hope they dont try so hard to be like borderlands i never played the first but im jumping into this one oh my god will gearbox ever stop getting crushed so if fallout 4 mad max and doom has a 3 way this would be it cool i hope it has a multiplayer and co op wonder what theyve got in store for e3 now what kind of mad max borderlands fallout doom titanfall wolfensteintotal overdose is this mad max remastered yeah but we all know these graphics are a lie and on release the game will look nothing like this damn this looks better than the first game hope it does not disappoint i feel like this is what the mad max game was suppose to beim intrigued wasnt interested until that andrew wk came on this is like the first game got roided up then did lsd i like it yes just straight up fun and crazy action reminds me of bulletstorm the first rage game was really good so im totally looking forward to this one yea you see in a world where there are no rules hair dye rules man i love over the top action games every year i hope that doom 2 get a reveal but this will do for now lmao gameplay looks fun however the graphics look generic terrain has blurry textures and the video isnt 60 hz i am guessing this game isnt using id tech this time which was a huge part of what made the first rage unique a game with its own thing but of course people are just gonna compare it to other games looks freaking fun man im definitely playing it when it comes out looks like serious sam and bullet storm had a love child the gaming industry is on a fast track to picking itself back up after its rough patch im glad a lot of triple a dev teams are picking up the pace lately only played a demo of the first one many years ago but this looks very promising the sequel nobody wanted lol yeah right doom meets just cause with andrew wk take my money mad max doom wolfenstein this crazy fucker of a game i only ever played the demo of the first one on my cousins xbox but i thought it was pretty good this looks fun so this is made by the studio that made doom and the studio that made just cause and mad max it makes sense to me that id software made the fps mechanics and avalanche made the driving mechanics interesting bethesda got me interested id got me sold someone give me the song yes im an uncultutered fool the whole neonpoppunk thing is a pretty lame approach in 2018 ill still try and give it a chance though the first rage was a solid enough concept to build on may be on switch 1 year later feeling like i wont need that wild spotify playlist if the game is already doing this for me fallout doom hybrid sold does anyone know the name of thesong or band etc i remember the first rage it was fun and mad max like but the ending left me wanting still im looking forward to playing this game is this game running on a potatoe cant stand those locked 30fps rage doom mad max video game rage 2 l if its single player looks like doom 2016 meets mad max i want this in my life already looks like borderlands tried to get it on with fallout at a crack house and the child was then adopted by doom guy i dont know looks kinda meh but looking to see more disappointed its not in 3rdperson though just assumed because avalanche was working on it it would be in 3rdperson not 1st because they dont usually do those type of games hell yeah first one was awesome and too short i wanted much more yet i think this is even better than before cant wait better not have a huge difficulty jump which comes down bulletsponges got rage 1 was such a let down take my money now when bethesda only rely on clichs edit yeah im gonna wait on this one nowa days i just buy games that are on sale it took id to look better than id they going for the initiative before borderlands 3 will finally be announced well played looks pretty good hopefully it doesnt end up sucking please have 2 player coop with the story but but i wanted skyrim 2 this game looks boring jk ive been waiting for this borderlands 3 got some graphics upgrades alright i was definitely one of the people laughing at this random announcement but damn im interested terrible box art they had me at avalanche studios and id have really turned it around with the last doom so yep im hyped really curious to see how they gonna showel loot boxes down our throats in this one oh its avalanche so we can garuntee there will be a grappling hook in here somewhere fov is about 10 i bought the first one during a steam summer sale several years ago and played like 5 minutes of it may have to download it again and give it a whirl when you mod fallout to much this looks like a whole lotta fun this is just destiny doom fury road rage 1 was great so im hype for this another borderlands game already liked the first rage and this is looks even more promising but why i meanlooks oki just find it a bit obnoxious of how inyourface it is like its from some moody punk teenagers bedroom is this borderlands 3 holy sht this looks lit looks pretty good want to see more at e3 neat but can you not call this gameplay it isnt its a trailer there are snippets of gameplay and i hope it looks like that but i dont believe you another pubg fortnite series lol i love that they gave it this new uplifting feeling instead of fallout but worse and 10 times more gritty how is this anything like borderlands doom yes remember u have to be 18 to watch okay but the real question is is this going to be an xbox exclusive lmao or also available on pc ive been waiting to long tony hawk american wasteland rage 2 i love it more adhd degeneracy bathesda belongs on a cross looks interesting but christ i hope we can turn up the fov too bad borderlands 3 is coming mad max borderlands with a tony hawk proskater soundtrack ill give it a try by god rage 2 really doesnt look like rage 1 but it looks real good like if mad max did cocaine and had some gang members hit up a circus in space big fan of the first rage anything id touches turns to gold i see a lot of doom and borderland comparisons which i agree with but this mostly reminds me of bulletstorm here is hoping that it is a larger game than the first one im sure gearbox is flattered rated e for everyone so i want this wasnt the first part a failure i enjoyed it but still wasnt the first part a failure i enjoyed it but still i loved the first rage it had the perfect apocalptic atmosphere to it and kept me entertainned the whole way thru so i will be getting this one looks different but im sure it will be just as good seems interesting but after fallout 4 im watching a lot of gameplay and reviews before i buy video games are finally becoming video games again hopefully it will be actually playable after the main story is beaten i think the game will be pretty good but i assure you it will die on borderlands 3 shadow feel free to tag in 2 years or so and tell how right i was this actually looks really good so destiny 3 what made the first rage for me so good was the ai animations hope they make it even better mad max doomepilepsy blood splatter love it already man this made my day beyond stoked for this bethesda id software alongside avalanche studios this is going to be insane i heard the first game was poop this doesnt look poop at all if they also add coop ill buy this looks like a good raging blast would of loved a remastered for the first game seeing as ive hadnt had a chance to play it hopefully its longer than the first one is it sam worthington narrating cant wait this actually looks decent the announcement trailer was kind of eh but honestly i just hope they learn from their mistakes from the first rage combat was great but the world felt just lifeless so maybe rage can have this be their comeback and nintendo switchbethesda you disappoint me alternative reaction yall better not mess it up idk if my i5500k and 1060 can handle it tbh why not in nintendo switch they just pulled a thor ragnorak destiny 3 looks alright lol bfg reference did anybody even want this i know youre busy scrolling through comments but another settlement needs our help ill mark it on your map this looks amazing i cant wait anyone who has doubts about the first rage should play it its a great strait line one time play through it wants to be open world but it couldnt get there its still a great game though playing it will greatly enhance your experience with rage 2 my fallout addiction may be cured everyone saying it looks like doom the creators of doom helped make rage after all so yeah there is going to be some resemblance finally after 8 years first rage was awful so we can only hope i guess hope they put some good combat music with it hope they bring back the mutant game show does anyone else think that we might be seeing this generations doom clone do get a sword cuz if i do then im in if you did not play the first one its a damn good game ive been waiting for the second for years now this is going to be amazing yet another shooter sigh online co op story and you got my money switch im not sure if anybody was asking for this defidently gonna keep a close eye on this game lets just hope its not like mad max the game fallout meets borderlands meets mad max meets a shitload of cocaine this looks very interesting and i think i might get it but remember no preorder just in case anyone know the music i want this if it was made by bethesda this is when they say let wolfenstein be the last for switch thank you id for being who you are 3 doom wasteland edition coming to nintendo switch looks fun im looking forward to it hopefully this game doesnt give me a vicious headache like the first one did damn this looks amazing this looks nothing like the first game i am disappointed but interested none the less maybe this one will have an ending thatll be nice games that have endings and dont just stop the gun sounds are almost the same from doom 2016 when this game coming out is it fallout 4 with better movility and probably better graphics me play this good is it me or fov is to close i enjoyed the first rage great atmosphere and solid fps action the vehicle traversal added a nice vibe to the game while nowhere near the top gameplay wise for me the atmosphere was better than alot of other games so bethesdas version of borderlands please have a coop mode i hate these laser weapons annoying is it multiplayer i have a question if this is a bethesda game and the exact same video was released on their channel how does ign have the rights to make money off of it too do they have a partnership or something mad max official game play trailer i am officially interested it looks insane and awesome this game might be worth it this is why i buy the xbox one x 3rd party games and my ps4 pro for exclussive only oh yeah so a wicked baby of skyrim sunset overdrive and mad max cool wallet wheres my wallet is this game like skyrim fallout or more like wolfenstein and dishonored it said open world but does that mean in a skyrimfallout style thats insanly cool omit the clever ai beefy weapons and dour tone and all we are left with is another generic post apocalyptic open world fps one step forward and two steps back open world shooty shooty explodey game feels so derivative by now this game looks like it will be good hope they will include the first rage yup its coming to switch mad max borderlands yes please mad max on the doom engine looking good its a bit much to ask but is it possible it will have local coop thats one of the few reasons i come back to borderlands 2 is because my dudes want to party and pop in the game for couch play really fond of it but if it wont happen it wont be a deal breaker although this game looks nice i wish people would stop comparing it to doom whose graphics are 10x better woooowww this is insane have you guys seen the trailer for that bum simulator game so this is just fallout with mohawks good job bethesda the original was greathopefully the powers dont take too much away this setting with vehicles and doom combat could be something special why does the boomerang look useless and weak i was skeptical but i may get it but this means something big borderlands 3 may actually be a thing love these types of games am i the only one that really disliked the first one not excited about this if only playstation plus never existed you will arive at the gates of valhalla shiny and chrome witness me metal thrashing guitar player in the back ground shooting flames everywhere lol please tell me its campaign coop or im stayin on far cry 5 if they think im nuts enough to buy this they are absolutely right mad maxdoomborderlandsrage2 mad max already came out rage 1 is great rage 2 must be excelent what a shitty game please let me have a sawedoff double barrel and a muscle car please people asking why there aint no dlc for the evil within 2 this is why whats with all this hair dying all over its very millenial scares me no nintendo switch version i have rage but ill never have rage yes the sequel to the first game of my name of course its open world will most likely be forgotten in about 12 months after its release well its a shooter alright how this happened ill never know but wow looks great really out the effort on it so crazy now to look up rage 1 take my money nowthis looks like everything i have always wanted socan i go all rage and bare hand everything the map looks horrible like just flat ground with a bunch of barriers like everything looks too open its not close quarter like with doom and i dont think the combat would work well with that after they add battle royale mode this will be n1 well hopefully bethesda doesnt ruin this one dear bungie and gearbox yall done fked up a game like this shouldve never made it passed the discussion phase because yall should have this this of game locked down just wanna say i loved this first gamelots of fun too much stuff 310 i want another skyrim not this i want it fall out world with borderlands gameplay heck yea looks good but i hope this isnt the only big game they are working on coop campaign maybe hopefully the story isnt crap like the first one the gameplay was fun enough tho looks to be a mix of fallout 4 doom borderlands rage 1 and a hint of mad max for good measure what just happened and when is it coming if only the world was more civilised like this looks good but maybe too arcadey and tf is up with super powers and jumps mad max vibe also cod lol im down the skybox is back my god is it attractive what is the release date please use id tech 6 please use id tech 6 please use id tech 6 please use id tech 6 yea pls another great game that is not on the switch mutant bash tv is coming back yay played the 1st one absolutely loved it for years now wishing for a huge sequel we are in for big fun they got me with andrew wk oh man this game gonna be good in 4k change the damn music to somethinf more suitable and youve got a much better trailer why mad max meets doom and far cry cant wait to play pop in graphics the game 2 ahh good old rage let me say it now so i can screenshot it later weak story with gameplay length no more than 7 hours i can tell its not gonna be the perfectly paced classic the first one was too saints row for me this is my kind of game when will it be released just make elder scrolls 6 dont waste your energy on bullshit bethesda i guess this will hold me over until the borderlands 3 announcment i hope the dead city or whatever it was called makes a return the atmosphere in that place felt so cool to me in the first game so because doom and now wolfenstein 2 are coming to the switch is there a possibility this will come as well it is open world so it might be a bit harder to port over would be cool if they make it happen is this coming to switch seriously mediocre at best so will there be an armorloot system or will it be like the first one doom is that u borderlands on the doom engine i can get with that im in im going back right now to finish the scorchers add on shoulda led off with this instead of whatever the hell that first trailer was welltheyve already got my money this looks dope i really liked the first one but didnt love it hopefully this ones way better than its previous installment coop and some sort of 3rd person besides vehicles would satisfy me please dont give me different looking armor you show me in pictures and it turns out i cant even see it the whole game hopefully there will be split screen coop like the original this will probably be a decent game but its a game that nobody wanted or cared about what an innovative game an open world action and big guns oh man im practically salivating at the chance to play something so original and unique christmas come early 3 preorder this one and get a copy of the first one remember me my main question is it taking place before or after i hope theyll pick up from where they left off took you long enough bethesda but thank you too bad borderlands 3 is coming aswell the only thing borderlandsy about this gameplay trailer is that the game doesnt seem to take itself too seriously thats it serious mad max vibes though it looks too good to be true but ill still buy it this is the last game i thought thered be a sequel to i miss this game reminds me of a fallout game with a more lighthearted approach i feel like people are going to take the word lighthearted out of context oh well completely not thrilled about it horrible trailer like its all over the place nahh i will pass on this not liking that colorful theme was hoping for a fallout 5 this will definitely hold me over looks completely trash so basically id software is like we might as well make the mad max game everyone deserves with the people who did an alright job the 1st time rage was a really fun game just insanely short and not a lot of substance to the plot throwing the little boomerang blade thing was seamless combat in video games during its time and a lot of fun and it had a card game you could play kind of like gwent im definitely on board for a sequel even though nobody asked for one lol bulltstorm and doom had baby yes uum i was expecting something more serious mad max style like the first game but better im not sure if i like this plus dont tell me that theres but one vehicle you can drive in this game if it is truly an open world i am down the first one was so insanely linear if the graphics werent great the 1st wouldve been pure garbage hoping for the best im hyped looks awesome is e3 here yet if this game becomes a hit thatll be another nail in fallout 4s coffin lol poor fallout gone the ways of mass effect and bioshock as 7th gen masterpieces that couldnt quite adapt well to 8th gen trash trash traaaaaaaash okay much much better than the teaser had me worried yesterday dozed off and starting watching the sidebar what to check next damn goodim hyped for this game avalanche studios heckin yeeh coop because without coop you might as well play borderlands i didnt know how much i wanted this played the first one on ps3 it was great i hope this one will be better never has a trailer actually make me laugh out loud this one didim totally in post apocalyptic far cry do we need to play rage one before this god i hope this will be realesed on the n64 looks like the wasteland universe from rick morty including mortys giant arm so this one has nothing to do the first one huh lame more like bulletstorm with borderlands graphics como se llama este dlc de borderlands what is this borderlands dlc called is that really the graphics will it be 60fps on consoles if so this game will be a better mad max game than mad max lol other than the fov this looks awesome so weird that bethesda put dollars into making this game they have other ips i would much rather havesigh i never played the first one i heard it was pretty good i hope this one exceeds its predecessor in everyway no switch version hell yeahhhh borderlands gets a graphical overhaul ill buy it lets hope its better then the first aww what avalanche what the hell some crappy hunting game and now this just cause 4 already doomfallout take my money hope its very bloody this looks cool but wont stand a chance against bl3 dude avalanche studios count me tf in this looks great hell yeah gonna be honest not the biggest fan of the mad max suicide squad aesthetic but luckily that seems to be a small part of its visual variety and it looks like theyre taking alot of their mechanics from doom and injecting it into this franchise open world doom sign me up now this is a glorious mess i would be happy to throw myself into looks good but i didnt think rage would ever get a sequel bro now can we get a fallout game in this games engine i waited 10 years for this fallout paintball edition mad max but crazier man that was intense af so one of my alltime favorite games are getting a sequel hell fookin yeah wow looks pretty good i hope the dialog isnt as cheezy as the first the good fallout 4 thanks walmart if they can get a switch port sure this is like rage borderlands doom and call of duty in one game skyrimfalloutwhats not to hate i remember rage being dark and skin crawling i hope they preserved that and havent gone in some weird borderlands meets fortnite meets saints row kinda direction im slightly reminded of the new mad max movie xd played the first one and love it cant wait for rage 2 looks like they took everything from the first one and up it i never did beat the first game but this sequel looks impressive from what ive seen so far open steam open library select rage click install i think i have some unfinished business to attend to its like doom and mad max had a baby i hope it has coop btw is there any multiplayer online on it this looks like doom when its high and drunk with a lot of sunset overdrive thrown in for good measure its like borderlands and i loved borderlands but im not sure about getting this game because of the last avalanche game mad max that was pretty boring for me at least anyway i loved the just cause series too its about damn time boy i cant wait to turn that fov up resistance meets mad max already looks better than the first game lets hope its coop oh those mad bastards actually did it i want one is this what the new dead island was supposed to be like just got those feels thats all im about to nut right now okaythey got me release date please this looks decent but honestly im waiting on ghost of tsushima i consume every open world game like a pig but this looks just uninteresting generic to me its like doom and boarderlands combined ill still wait to see how it turns out holy sht this is awesome looks like i was shocked when i saw title im assuming they bought in avalanche studios to work on the car physics as the first was made soley by id you guys are bitching about the tone and atmosphere from this one to the first one first off the first one came out in 11 when dark tone games were a thing second technology will make it look more vibrant than dark and finally its not made by bethesda at all its only published so maybe avalanche or id software wanted a more vibrant and alive world other than dark i get postapocalyptic games are supposed to have that but technology is where it comes in know we know what happens when someone added mutants and rainbows to madmax do you know what i dont like the box art rages box art was simply but cool motion blur the game this looks terrible digging the sheer quantity of enemies on screen curious to know if its coop rage 2 looks good but wheres my knack 3 at bro be waiting for this ooh boidont know how to feel ive wanted rage 2 for years love it whens it coming to switch tho hey you know mad max hey you know sunset overdrive hey you know doom well here we go so is this a looter i didnt play the first rage is this running with part of the doom engine love the first one just hope this one have a better ending this gives me a borderlands vibe looks like fallout without fallout branding and some more color knokknok whos there knok off this looks like it could either be really good or really bad if theres one major thing i hate its generic looking bargain bin guns this looks like it has a lot of them please make this a coop game this was mentioned in the walmart leak which means theres a high chance for borderlands 3 and if thats the case theres a chance this is gonna flop or be super lowkey now thats what im talking about mad max style loved it i wasnt ready for it to look this fun im on board i just hope the end game cut scene is at least 21 seconds sarcasm first gameplay was great story was okay but the ending was like wtf fully makes up for the reveal trailer looks pretty bade ace would be lovely to see a less graphically impressive switch version but im not going to hold my breath this looks like what fallout 4 shouldve looked like visually lets see how e3 plays out is that borderlands i smell looks nice but i hope that there will be a wider fov for us pc players cuz the fov in the trailer is damn narrow ah gee whiz e3 is gonna be real awkward for gearbox lol its borderlands vs rage all over again i was aiming for rdr2 not rage2 but i will take it fallout mad max yup i want this take my money wow this is my type of game i dont care what anyone says im excited this better be better than the first one seriously what is with the music its not even summer break yet but the game looks awesome so confused is this before the events of rage 1 or after looks like something ive played a million times already destiny the earth edition about time yay more andrew wk in this trailer too looks like a fun version of fallout y do i feel they will announce a remaster for rage 1 at e3 average day in australia this looks so frigging good i feel they went this direction to put an end to everyone comparing it to mad max i like it so borderlands mixed with fallout i guess theres worse combos well this was unexpected open world doom why not d okay punk rock fallout doom i see you what a lovely day this is going to be lit i wanted fallout im actually greatful this is a thing rage had a good premise i only played the first game briefly at a friends but im definitely looking forward to playing this looks like a hell of a fun time the song sounds like party hard this looks really fun and really beautiful cant wait to hear you ungrateful swine complaining nonstop about a few small glitches the original rage was terrible and this looks just as bland the only game i want from bethesda is a new elder scrolls fallout or something new like those two games oh man ive waited so many years for this looks like a totally different atmosphere from the first game but im really digging it it looks funwaiting for more gameplay i really liked the world building of rage even though it was limited and the game was over right when things got interesting this looks like just cause meets borderlands lets hope the game has a more serious tone to it than this suggests otherwise my euphoria that this game finally gets a sequel is short lived this looks very promising actually this is how no mans sky should have been just saying i miss john carmack when he worked on games lol please make quake 5 or at least remaster quake 1 2 if i wanted to play mad max i would of played mad max it guy look like doom and mad max has a baby baby is rage thats looks awesome does this mean all the leaks are real the game is codeveloped by avalanche studios the creators of just cause and mad max thats why mad max meets doom ill give it a shot glad to see theyre making borderlands 3 sorry to say but i dont like the look of this the original rage was bleak gruesome and disturbingthis just looks like the suicide squad of videos games wow so many people who dont know about rage 1 i liked the 1st gamebut this new one looks hella fundefinitely want this one hey how come they called the new borderlands game rage 2 i hope its a looter shooter wished fallouts graphics look like this has a doomfallout feel to it why tho rage 2 gayest name for a game ever i am guessing drugs are gonna be some sort of power boost in this game looks good may be buying it when it comes out i hope butter then the last one since i loved what avalanche studios did with mad max i know ill love this this so fortnight borderlands and fallout had a kid its back this looks good btw ign cant review games hurr durr wheres starfield durr avalanche studios well they developed mad max so looks like a fun game hope the reviews are solid damn im buying this i liked the first one a lot but hopefully this is just as fun please tell me im not the only one thats getting a borderlands and fallout vibe from this pretty insane for me love it looks like a mix of just cause mad max fallout and doom and a little prise of borderlands d definitly going to look further btw i never heard of rage one the datethe date where the fuckin release dateeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee dont know why id didnt wait till e3 to show this but nonetheless it looks cool looking forward to more gameplay at e3 hmm product not yet rated eh im guessing e for everyone anyone else its like borderlands without the annoying graphics neat hope they keep the rpg elements of the first game i didnt see any in the trailer this is like boom and mad max together and yes i played the first rage which was ok the first rage had solid gun play and more vehicle action than borderlands hence the name as in road rage its main flaw was that it wasnt openworld enough to really take advantage of the vehicle stuff looks like they corrected that though this is what i wanted the mad max game to play like oh great an attempt to reboot the franchise but disguised it as a sequel the first one was great when it comes to the gameplay and the atmosphere its one of a few games that had an amazing atmosphere like stalker and metro but now its turned into generic over the top shooter with brightful colors i barely completed rage and theyre already releasing rage 2 i guess they didnt get the message huh it looks to play similarly to doom so as long as they make the enemies and environment work around that at least in the gameplay department this is going to be a blast to play story wise i hope it at least doesnt bore me its like doom meats mad max walmart has already spoil this i aint excited as i would if i would have actually first seen it or found out oh well cant wait either way i mean it looks dope but it shouldnt be a rage game it looks nothing like the first but wait ign said we didnt need rage 2thank you wal mart so walmart was right would have coop campeing this looks nothing like the first game i am interested cant wait to get fallout mad max edition doom and fallout had a baby meh gratuitous violence wow ive never seen that before hummm it looks good but i need more information so where is gearbox looks like a better mad max game than the one that came out a couple years ago lol doom with cars do you need to play the first one to play this one could this gmae be the one ive been waiting for over the top eplosive destruction with little to no regard to game balance an open world with varying destructive playstyles a game that doesnt keep your boots on the ground made by good developers wow i was just downloading rage 1 last week to play and now 2 just came did any one ask for rage 2 sweet the game actually looks more lively compared to the first one if you combine mad max and doom you get rage 2 no jumping enemies like in the first one come on wow i thought this disappeared after rage 1 o im not sold yet i need to see the mechanics i need to know the design philosophy will there be micro transactions how are the quests are they half assed or are they going to be fun stories i need to understand more before i decide anything these andrew wk style trailers just arent doing it for me although the game looks kinda neat wish the trailers were a bit better though mix mad max and doom and poof the result is rage 2 at least the gameplay is not as goofy as the awful announcement trailer made it out to be i trust bethesda but borderlands 3 will have my money first what this is not on switch finally ive been waiting years for the sequel subscribe to my channel when this comes out im grinding it non stop well this means the leak turned out to be true whats up with bethesda doing ids leftovers these days it just works hopefully its better than the first game which looked good but fell far short imagine if they used a updated engine honestly im just as surprised as everyone else that this is getting a sequel huge departure from the original and looks a lot better looks great atleast fallout has some competition now do you love video games just subscribe to my channel witness this firstperson mad max gameplay looks great just hope the story and characters r well put together unlike doom borderlands mad max doom sunset overdrive all thrown into a blender and you get rage 2 quite the departure from the tone of the first game lmfao im so hyped it doesnt seem to follow the last one but never the less im pre ordering this thing when i can this looks like a lot of fun i agree with some of the comments it does look like a hybrid of mad max and doom epic combo this looks intense and insane hopefully its good can we make our character mad max extra mad edition preorder now for mad bonus mission oh so its like elex but its a fps and makes sense im not completely dissing elex i love the game and just the other day i was bad mouthing rehashed games and now seeing this makes me want to bite my tongue even more it does look very good cool whoa fallout 4 is getting a multiplayer mode mad max destiny 2 and doom in the same game i bet it will be empty wanna be mad maxborderlands soooooo postapocalyptic destiny will this be single player or will it have co op i prefer to play shooters on pc but idk if my pc will run it so i possibly will buy it both on my pc and ps4 cuz im hyped af d its like doom and mad max had a baby and that baby found some lsd tps and fps or just fps watch me ark survivor watch me freaking cool soooits just like doom in mad max universeokaytake my money another game they hope will fill our need for elder scrolls they just keep pumping out things no one wants yes it looks great but you think they would put their fans wants first a lump of doom a spoon of fallout and just a dash of mad max still im om with this it looks fun fallout doombioshockmad max what else bethesda lolits all here soooo the leak games are real i have never played rage 1 but this looks fun as hell this is more akin to mix of mad maxfalloutdoomborderlands than anything and i think thats quite interesting i hope they have an option for 3rd person view as well whoaaa king of action games wow if you told me this was bulletstorm 2 i would had believed you not saying its a bad thing but this doesnt even remind me of the first rage game which was a bit more serious and slower paced please please please tell me this is the game engine for the future fallouttes series this stuff looks great this looks like a bunch of games sloppy seconds put into one game when i saw the announced trailer i was sceptic but now since ive seen this its a big improvement i hope other people buy this because it looks good however borderlands 3 also coming out so how long will the rage hype last should have waited until e3 imo eeeeh hopefully id software didnt spend much of there time on this game wow this looks a genuine piece of garbage guess well have to wait another 5 or 6 years before bethesda announces their real game not this little macaroni art project hope it runs at 60fps on the x when i read open world it worries me they tend to make these open world games 4k but with 30fps alright fine opens wallet they advertise this game like its borderlands even though its nothing like it if b3 really is announcemed this year my prayers go to this game motion blur the video game i guess we get to see what mad max and warlock from destiny looks like when merged its bethesda so its gonna be broke game performance wise mad max fury road vibes these games published by bethesda look prettier than the ones they develop themselves cough skyrim cough fallout like the first one i have a feeling this will just copy other shooters rather than do its own thing it remind me a destiny not that is a bad thing in terms of gameplay i was not grabbed by these not hype dont hate it or love it i dont care just like the first game good job you made the same game rage fans will be happy but who knows i can change my mind ign feeling like fools yet for saying nobody wants this game i said they would back pedal once they saw it the original rage had alot of potential and i had been calling for a sequel ever since especially it being made at the end of the life of 6th gen consoles like doom in earth eh i remember the 1st one being really bad i would rather see a new doom than this rage 2 does not look very appealing too me a battle royale mode would save this sequal from being a flop not many played rage 1 but u expect ppl to get invested in what they showed didnt work for me fallout on acid i liked the seriousness of the first one but a change in style might be for the better chaos with lots of colour made by avalanche studios hell yeah fps i dont know this is cool and all but multiplayer ew motion blur why not just show that in the first place coop please i love how there is a wide variety of enemy types and factions i just hope every enemy doesnt look exactly the same because that would get repetitive very fast if the game actually looks like this when it launches im definitely picking it up looks awesome kind of long time between games though far cry mad max doom just cause rage 2 fury road in the flesh and blood so sick rage was one of the most underrated games of the ps3360 era so ill definitely give a try the fact that its from the guys behind doom makes me even more excited lets hope its fast paced with a skill curve and good mechanics so all chronusmax and titan1 cheaters stick to destiny and division this is going to be fun i loved the first rage lets do another woooo the leaks are coming true what about eo6 bethesda hopefully its better than the first one if doom and fallout had a baby this would be it this looks really good yes finally i never thought they would ever make a sequel thank you gaming gods at first its like doom borderlands and mad max combined looks promising i loved the first rage and i am sure this will be even better d it looks absolutely brilliant howeveri wish they kept the cartoony art style from the first one so they reskinned mad max and made it 1st person no thnx downgrade update coming soon guys id say this looks like fallout doom and mad max combined wowthis look great to me definitive will add to my library as long as its actually over the top non stop shooting ill be happy about time question there will be yolandi and ninja skins can i still shoot legs i love the wasteland punk feel to this its like sunset overdrive meets mad max looks like everything destiny was meant to be opens world fully interactive doom graphics too much to mention in one comment already hyped this is what mad max should have been fallout 4 in a more colorfull vibe with more explotions and cars rage 2 it must have learned its lesson from the previous rage and borrowed something from doom and borderlands rage and kingdoms of amalur are my top 2 under rated games this looks badass like borderlands meets bulletstorm so wheres elder scrolls 6 please tell me theres coop sooo fallout 5 next the first had was really good and the graphics were amazing the only thing that could be better was that ending very different from the original i hope that the ai is still as agile as in the original welcome to the future son titan fall borderlands destiny all in one game noice so walmart wasnt lying huh is this a battle royal game open world doommad max cool nice to see avalanche keeping busy i think its in good hands they did a good job with mad max good luck to them one of my favorite studios looks like downgraded version of cyberpunk and its good that it is a downgrade of it no one asked for this why did they make this it actually looks better than erverything i thought they could come up wih mad max sequel with rage name stamped on to draw in cult following of rage not falling for it looks generic and shite doom of rage rage was a great looking and fun game to play but was a sequel necessary cant help but think wolfenstein 3 or the next falloutelderscrolls game would be better received fooled me once never again witness this shut up and take my money i always remember the first one but i never played it so maybe ill give this a go this is like doom impregnated fallout and had a psycho angry and always on energy drinks baby that has a car too so this is where junkrat came from so how are the superpowers explained i see what looks like energy being released from the pcs hand to both jump and attack i never played the first one so i dont know if its a returning thing or not but as an outsider this looks like a knock off of mad max and borderlands with a little bit of fallout thrown in for good measure ill have to see what more gameplay looks like but so far im not sold maybe if it has coop ill get it for when friends come over but this looks bland definitely a buy i am the only only one who dont fellt in love never played the first game the intro was for newcomers i take it i just hope it doesnt get crushed in the holiday sales if its release this year i loved the evil within 2 last year the fact it didnt sell pisses me off the new rage game reminds me of bulletstorm and sunset overdrive in the mix wow fidget spinners sure are big in the apocalypse a few days ago i was wondering who asked for this game now im asking for this game agreed that the first one was very good so im stoked for the sequel andrew wk for the win i swear to god if they made this a battle royal type of game im gonna kill every single human who invented that formula im relieved to see ids logo but avalanche studios are they the primary developers the same team that made mad max i mean no disrespect but that game kind of disappointed looks better than the first and better than the announcement trailer made it look this would be amazing if it had multiplayer so what about colors yea just turn them all on all of them all of them omfg this looks sick borderlands memories anybody tony hawks american wasteland 2 this feels like something activision would have made in 2001 if they had the graphics with a soundtrack full of ska bands avalanche studios woah now we know the car combat is gonna be great at least now this is more like it complete chaos and destroying everything in your path and colors are no longer just different shades of brown and orange i cant wait still trying to figure out who asked for this this actually looks good if no coop no buy bethesda needs to learn that by now road to 10 million holy hell the chaos is back looks nice but not worth my money if its singleplayer only which it looks like to be again maybe if its 10 how open world is this like fallout 4 lvl open or nah the game nobody asked for 1000th comment so its doom in the desert i really liked the 1st one pretty excited for this so whats new where the heck is the elder scrolls vi can someone explain the whole game in a big paragraph dear bethesda keep doing cocaine can i get that on my switch please the gameplay looks good but the music seems off fallout with cars yup this gonna be awesome ahhh yes so doom mad max wolfenstein and red faction guerilla had a baby huh for ppl who says that it reminds you of doom and mad max this game is developed by id doom and avalanche studios mad max should be obvious okay i cant be the only one that think this looks like a next gen game i feel like all the creators of the og rage did a line of cocaine and came up w this actually looks decent welp no one asked for this but heres hoping it turns out great please let this be good looks interesting hopefully it can develop a greater identity than rage 1 did unfortunately it didnt stand out that much to me in the long run so glad avalanche studios is still around when do the preorders go up when do the preorders go up it looks insane and i love it the real mad max game we needed this game can be four times better with coop friends but i know bethesda doesnt really do that still some potential is that the voice from woodward tv on youtube you had me at bathesda borderlands without cell shading vibes it doesnt look like anything to me remember when someone hates rage 2 yesterday the tone is the only thing bugging me with the trailer but its not a small thing it looks like they know what theyre doing this time i really liked the first rage so im pretty excited this is what you get when you put doomfallout and saints row together the result is pretty good yay the new borderlands 29 looks cool or is it mad max oooo it rage to really its like a mixture of doom and fallout hey its mad max 2 without the license now excuse while i count the number of times i hear party in the trailer when is it out oh baby oh baby is there gonna be online for this or whay looks nothing like rage 1 another randem xd game it strikes me as a mix of doom gameplay with a borderlands theme looks good might reinstall the first one to get the vibe back again i remember having fun but cant remember much about experience itself lol wasnt this game one of the games leaked by a retailer if so then those others games are lookin mighty likely borderlands 3 baybeeeee now this is a game i didnt even know i was hyped for looks alot like the new doom but thats a good thing doom extra content looks stunning doom and mad max combined we have rage 2 i dont know why but the trailer didnt grab me looks good but at the end i was like ehhhh omfg yesss im so happy rage is getting the attention it deserves this looks sick looks goodcant see why ppl hating on it may contain content inappropiate for children im a simple meni see windsticksi preorder wolfendoom fury road cant wait soo borderlands without any original art style witty characters and using the doom engine yes yes yes this game was soooo good waiting forever for a second one thank you i never played the original rage but i like doom so i think im going to pick this one up is it also going to have a story that we care about less then the developers and gameplay that was designed by a toddler and lack luster car controls and combat oh and also an open world that isnt that open and an ending that is more of a disappointment then i am to my familylets wait 4 years to find out and surely be disappointed like we already know we will be hated the first one i think ill pass on this and just wait for borderlands 3 to overshadow it cod all over again but will it take longer than 5 hours to beat looks better than god of war is this not borderlands but 10 years late finally a sequel for something i actually grew up with yeah so where is elder scrolls 6 mutant bash tv so this is the game bethesda was hiding from us i guess no new elder scroll or fallout looks interesting tho its like mad max and borderlands 2 had an underweight flipper baby cant wait to play it hope its better than the first adding this to my play list people just because it isnt starfield or fallout or elder scrolls doesnt mean its a bad thing chances are theyll talk about at least one of those topics in some way at e3 not on pc this game is for the american people only wooooooow i cant wait to play the new ancapistan simulator rage 2 never expected that how is this a gameplay trailer show some gameplay soooooooooo id guys who made all dem legendary shooters of the last decade and avalanche the guys who made the pretty damn good mad max with awesome vehicle combat are coming together to make a shooty drivey game pretty damn good combo mmmmm thats pretty good lookin looks like mad max meets fallout with a hint of doom free roam doom game hell yeah give me a decent single player campaign and ill consider it is this open world the gunplay looks just as terrible as the new doom i hope its actually difficult looks like this have more diverse environments compared to last game wicked another open world game with quite possibility repetitive side questsbusy work to make the game more fleshed out seriously whats so special about this liked the first one cant wait will john goodman make a return better than destiny ffs bathesda we want elder scrolls vi not this mad maxborderlands wannabe the doom map editor is getting out of hand i hope it comes to the switch open world games are getting boring everyone is making them game was meh but the dead city level was amazing this looks a bit more open and fun so def excited wow that explosive wingstick looks delightful loved the first one so lets hope this is good pretty random to make a sequel out of rage though fallout borderlands and doom this the sequel the game desperately needs it reminds me of fallout alot its so fallout so basically borderlands on crack and meth got it well take my moneylol walmart wasnt lying i guess did they finally decide to finish the rage 1 i was playing and then it just endedkinda disappointed as i was getting into it and bam end bethesda needs to stop fooling around and start focusing on the next elder scrolls game it is needed hope its not to different from rage cause i really enjoyed it this makes me think of bulletstorm a bit looks awesome first game was slow but once it picked up was really good this looks awesome damn it why did they make this instead of new doom gotta love andrew wk in this trailer so we have the guys who made fallout and the elder scrolls the guys who made just cause and mad max and the guys who made doom and wolfenstein all working on this game im optimistic the first rage really was a super fun and unique but semi serious shooter im glad theyre expanding on that fun factor thats all that really matters in a game isnt it looks fooking great hype is real mad max doom slayer edition doom fallout wow havent play the first dont even now that rage exist but this looks good make id great again holy the announcement trailer did nothing for me this does they should have lead with this doom feat mad max rage 2explicit day 1 buy for mebut i am disappointed they added powers like the titan smash it would be awesome if they added a slow motion ability the fps was horrible in this trailer this looks like a mix of far cry and saints row 4 im interested lets hope its story isnt as unbelievably shitty as the first god do you even remember the ending one of the worst ive experienced well well wellwalmart was right this is a game no one asked for but seems pretty good will there be a mod to play in 3rd person down the line looks great just wanna play it in 3rd person looks like they mixed mad maxs environment with dooms gun play and borderlands gonzo attitude this trailer just triggered a seizure in my brain groovy hopefully its better than doomdoom was boring and i used to love doom are u sure this rage and not a new ip it looks so uninteresting having played rage 1 its gonna be a pass dear god i hope the fov isnt actually that small in the actual game game play better be like the they showed it even the trailer is not 60 fps i wonder how well optimised its gonna be no one asked for this but then again no one really wanted an es 6 because its what everyone says whenever bethesda mention new games its looks amazing and it looks like mad max mixed with doom borderlands with doom graphics meh wheres borderlands 3 very promising indeed doom far cry falloutmad max awesomeness guaranteed why was i waiting on preorder bonus at gamestop i am already feeling sorry for my fps so basically doom meets madmax coop please and im buyin dat sucker shadow warrior 2 doom rage 2 rage 1 more darkness but will see mad max 2 looka great and i dont mean that mockingly i have been waiting for a game to come out that can fill that gap ugh way too many games with no original concepts same genre same first person shooter with the exact same guns with little variations same damn enemies set on a different planet or universe this is basically another doom copy catm i loved the first rage on xbox 360 hopefully this will be as good or even better bethesda no one asked for this not impressed i dont care if this is over the top and randomthis looks fun asf dear haters exit door is on the left you wont be missed side note are you able to get in that mech also hope this engine is being used for the next es oh i am a happy boy love it we heard the kids like motion blur like really like motion blur i dont remember rage containing an lsd trip lol i hope there are more varieties of guns at least this game looks gre wide open world i love rage 1 this seem hectic and strange meh not so impressed loved the 1st definitely getting this omg they forgot to anounce preorder and season pass bonus the sequel that no one wanted fallout and made max mixed together after the ending of the first one the game was good i said that i will not buy the sequel i change my mind cool wheres the switch version bring back offline split screen fallout and made mixed together nope this is titanfall meets madmax setting is it just me that gets the doom crossed with sunset overdrive vibe from this whats that song in the background they still owe me 60 for the last 1 jank move ok im impressed watch them make a battle royal mode the new destiny 2 dlc looks so cool so borderlands im only getting a mad max borderlands type of vibecan someone tell me how its different from borderlands just intrigued and interested now with less of the great fallout aspects that got recycled with f4 and more borderlands now this is what im talking about a sequel nobody asked not gonna lie i am fully erect right now mad max the game id software edition im not gonna be surprised if this flops rage 2 is it gonna actually run on the advertised hardware or should i go ahead and give nvidia another 3 grand would be best trailer ever if motion blur wasnt on ew the way he is flying around reminds me of destiny thank god its 10 times better than the teaser i like the tone playful side of bethesda dear jesus this probably wont happen but id kill for coop if the game allows it wait wait wait wait where is the big pre order at the end of it xd every trailer has to have a shitty pre order thing at the end lol mad max doom 2016 necromunda warhammer 40k rage 2 borderlands 3 announcement coming soon cool but wasnt rage 1 like serious any chance of coop here i could never get into bordlerlands plus the way borderlands is made made me eyes heart and gave me a headache thats the only game of all games the does that to me and the old gta games the newer gta games dont have that effect on me but this looks like it shits all over borderlands in my opinion i want this im extremely saddened and disappointed by this hmm it looks ok i didnt play the first just fyi but i like open world games and i adore farcry but the genre is getting a little oversaturated while open world is great it just seems like the games lack any true depth to thier world or have a hard time writing compelling storys or npcs that you really care about outside thier jokes but im interested in seeing how well fleshed out this game becomes 2018 is a real nostalgic year were getting great video games and cool action movies wow borderlands 3 looks so cool im all seriousness though this game looks fun as hell man thats a different thing than the trailer this looks promising at least we are telling you no wheres all the inevitable bugs its a bethesda game after all open worldyou said that last time this is america without cops in 2 years u better make fall out next year so hyped i loved the first one on ps3 looks like another wast openworld with no story and fun gameplay bethesda thinks fallout4 wasnt disappointing enough for bathesda to make rage 2 after the first one practically flopped is a bit ballsy but maybe this is a passion project the weapons look too modern and new for the theme they should be more worn out and mad max like no thanks this remind me of destiny lol fallout meets mad max andbring a child of wolfenstein engine single player or multiplayer i love punk themed games and etc its seeing bethesdas name on a game like this that makes me wonder why theres no drivable vehicles or rideable animals not fallout is this multiplayer with friends looks insanely fun loving how this new doom dlc looks aww fallout and mad max had a baby i like how nobody likes swearing in trailers while the video shows how you shoot a guy and blood sprays everywhere but why wide open world hope its a lot more wide and open then that first one was so let me get this strait the studios behind mad max just cause 3 doom 2016 and fallout are teaming up for this sing me up reveal trailer really after the first everyone barely remembers i doubt it would be any good this trailer well okay then this look promising getting some bulletstorm vibes and thats a good thing you know what this is pretty cool sign me up well done wide open world with big fing guns count me in you know this might be the sequel we never asked for but didnt know we wanted the first game was ok but this might actually be good looks pretty interesting never played the 1st one if rage 2 can happen so can brink 2 first person madmax hell yeah may contain content inappropriate for children hmm not that bad actually the acidneon colors look so dope the gunplay looks incredible everytime i see a mech suit i get giddy im fuckin sold just an average day in australia so skyrim with guns sing me up i have the first partbut i will hold off till its 20 bucks on amazon gachibass clap louder looks like a broken mix of borderlands destiny bulletstorm and mad max hope theres character customization i wonder if the map will be larger than my back yard this time i believe that this was the scraped alpha of doom before changing the direction and what was left was turned into rage 2 is it set before the first one think of it like this its kind of like a post apocalyptic doom with open world elements and dune buggies and crackheads instead of demons have you ever wanted doom to be open world looks good all shiny chrome the intro remind me of pacific rim intro im thinking about playing the first rage should i get it on pc or console i dont really care about the graphics just whichever one has better controls and is better gameplay wise alright i was a little let down that this was beths big announcementbut after seeing the game play trailerim all in but will it still have splitscreen thats some firstperson mad max with lot of guns and water ofcourse i guess those walmart leaks where real so you kill thingsyeah and more things if at first you dont succeed blow it up again could they not get andrewwk to do song oh we going destiny now i remember playing rage and being pretty disappointed in it overall but so far this looks a lot better for a sequel omg this is just another game looks surprisingly good i just hope it has coop i hope this sequel wont be as linear as the first oh and have a better ending nothing that we havent played already idk how i feel about this so this is when you compine fallout with doom you get falloom i need that multiplayer trailer avalanche so are we gonna see max orpost apocalyptic rico rodriguez mad max desyiny titanfall cod black ops 3 rage 2 doom meets fallout im so down the music and the overall machobadassgroovy theme ruins it but that was expected so no thanks so they mashed elder scrolls fallout and doom into the rage ip neat looks like borderlands and mad max met somwhere in the middle now how big of a graphical downgrade do you think this game is going to get enjoy the 30fps action cool graphics where is my rpg looks amazing i wish moderm games had couch coop looks like a mix of rage mad max doom and a small pinch of wolfenstine i dunno man this game might be to generic for me mane i been waiting on this game since the first one wasnt rage painfully average why would they make a sequel cant believe they made a second after all these years ps4 pro or slim tell me seriously without hate i have tv 4k destiny x doom reminds me of doom mixed with bulletstorm overthetop stupidity okay bethesda you have my attention the new mad max seems crazy whats a borderlands how much you wanna bet its gonna have a br mode tribes with quirky traits i hope we get a choice of flavors and im liking the cyberninja teasers everyone needs more cyberninja in their lives i hate bethesda but this actually looks good might give it a go if reviews are good good word of mouth and deep sale chill with the motion blur lol despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage swear to god if it says ps4 exclusive this is like a futuristic version of mad max doom call of dutyfalloutmad max titanfall kingkong rage cool maybe this time the game that no one asked for looks good and kind of fun looking forward to more who tf thought this ended in rage 1 did you guys not see the ending it was a horrible ending that didnt explain much so i figured rage 2 would come along sometime and fill in blanks im getting a ubisoft vibe from this game like if ubisoft had bought id software yeah ill be getting this i enjoyed mad max a lot so i know this game has to be really good as well if this has any kind of loot system like borderlands i think this can be a really good game this could easily replace borderlands if done right with avalanche studios behind this you can expect a gorgeous fun playground with no interesting story to pull you through the actual game hope this time it has a good story and no mtx bs rage max doom of the sunset border preorder for textures to load in 3 days early looks great though i think they should have just made this a new ip rather than trying to carry over the rage brand either way it looks like it will be a blast to play potential gameplay looking forward for it rick morty season 3 rickmancing the stone the game coming soon this generation of gamessystems feels like a golden age of gaming looking forward to trying this out was there a rick and morty reference looks cool but not much separating it from far cry yet another shooter but we should wait and see we will wait the downgrade v nowhere near as cringey as the announcement trailer dude this is awesome looking what is up with these garbage trailers can we just slow down and explain something anything character creation multiplayer whateverits a bethesda and avalanche studios game its gonna be fantastic when a video game can debunked all stefan molyneux arguments okay i need to complete the first rage before i get this good thing i got it on steam for 283 teaming with the guys who made mad max eh this should be fun add multiplayer splitscreen like the first one and perfect not gonna lie this looks 100000x better than the first game lol hope its not repetitive first one was alright decent story and gameplay but it seemed shallow felt more like a tech demo than an actual game fans we want es6 besthesda what do you want fans es6 bethesda i cant hear you intro to spongebob fans es6 es6 es6 bethesda ok here is rage 2 enjoy fans ok but on a serious note i look forward to this game since i played the first game back in 2011 and enjoyed it i mean graphics wise it looks great great job bethesda now why dont bring skyrim 6 ive grown tired of this kind of setting and aesthetic very tired but i have to admit it looks really fun the combination of id and avalanche its a really good one because i thing they complement each other very well avalanche does big scale open world very well but controls usually fell clunky as hell id does small scale and extremely fluid controls so we get big scale with fluid controls and crazy violent fast action coming from both studios if only it was a different setting i would have preordered it right away wow this looks sick been there done that why is this even a thing the first one was a failure wow cant wait who asked for this couldve made something better smfh now this looks evolutionary can everyone stop comparing this to mad max the first game came out before the mad max game was even a thing hella excited for this looks worst than the original imo it is like they want to be boarderlands mixed with fallout but i cant see this being any good well at least this is open world a must for mad max type game fallout doom intriguing but highly disturbing welcome back old friend nice to see youre still kicking so let us just hope that this game comes out before borderlands 3 its gonna be a bust at this point should we still hold out for another bethesda game at e3 like elder scrolls or that sci fi game they are working on or is this it cod and borderlands and rage 2 wow that look insane this js just fallout with cars looks super dope lovely a little andrew wk makes any game trailer 10x better im pretty sure avalanche studios also made the mad max game interesting why no switch version bethesda if this is same engine for doom and wolfenstein 2 and they are coming why not this still waiting borderlands i have room far cry killzone fallout bioshock and boarderlands vibes and i looooooove it i cant wait to play this a year from now but this time better be coop wow ign is early for once saints row new update is pretty dope the lovechild of doom and mad max im onboard the hype train whoowhoooooo looking good will get it on day one just like doomevil within 2prey and wolfenstein 2 good job bethesda bring me a warthog from halo in this game we good looks like a mash up of farcry fallout and mad max better be good this looks good d i hope this will be longer than the first game i do like the rp standing lets be real its gonna be a hard m for mature looks like the mad max game everyone wanted im hopeful but nervous looks great wonder if itll have john goodman in it like the first one this looks amazing from the guys who made doom from the guys who made mad max comes a game thats from both of those guys greatness ensues hopefully a switch version will come soon destiny doom fortnite madmax fallout borderlands wolfienstinein a blender destiny on drugs only one question when can i play it day one purchase for me pls tell me theres coop look forward to the 3rd person mod this looks like a dope recharge of the franchise looks like itll follow the sorts of changes doom and wolfenstein got still want doom 2 cool ill get this ok seems a bit familiar it feels like doom and that is a good thing not really the game i wanted but it looks cool looks like a mashup between doom and mad max not really original im so glad that leak got out so we could get this reveal early the mad max game we deserved lol doomtitanfallcod aw i smell br mode wow im impressed it looks nothing like the original in a good way this is basically dieselpunk themed far cry damnnnn man avalanche studios bases fully loaded and they sent this one flying into space it looks too happy and pumped up i wish it were more grim and scary the first game had problems but was pretty dope this looks cool what kind of destiny is this is a dlc of mad max okaymy interest is peaked hope the game is as good as this trailer was loved the first one it actually looks prity good and not trying to take it self so serious kinda bored of that recently with games this actually just looks u know fun lol i like this but why they gotta use such a disgusting fov for the gameplay in this trailer only just beat the first game a few months ago so this is good timing damn bruh fall out 5 looks fuckin weird great they turned it into multiplayer trash gunplay from the doom devs and vehicle gameplay from the mad max devs lets go where is nswitch version avalanche mustve ruined this as well just like they made jc3 unplayable on pc id be fine with the next fallout game with these types of graphics fallout of duty farcray its that you i didnt ask for this it looks crazier than boderland series did not expect this nothing is fun about playing lots of the games that have come out this year but this puts a smile on my face lets hope its not a cop out story and ending again reminds me of doom mad max and bioshock bulletstorm and borderlands had a baby guys awwwww chromatic abberation oh look its realistic borderlands dusty divot the game idk why but i hope we have a customizable protagonist my first impression from this dude doesnt really scream compelling well see so its basically openworld doom with vehicles ps bring it to switch eventually doom engine makes everything smoother doom mass effect mad max rage is this doom and mad max together or what doom mass effect mad max fall out bullet storm this is not rage atmosphere i remember but still looks good nice they went all borderlands with it ps5 4k 60fps 2019 well that absolutely looks amazing cant wait not going for this one im waiting for rdr 2 whos with me so he warlock palm him plz have better loot gun armor than destiny 2 it is similar to doom with open world aspect never heard from that game whats the genere hope there will be a story trailer it looks like many other similar apocalypse fps games the trailer feel meh to me as i cant see anything new it looks like doom on crack cool hell yesssss with borderlands 3 coming out i feel like this is just really bad timing i hope this succeed but i will be playing bl3 eeeeeuh where is the gameplay so id who made very good and the original shooter games eg doom quake and avalanche who made the med max game well im gonna assume that the gameplay is gonna be good i loved the first game im extremely excited for this one anyone know the song mmm noice i am waiting great another lame generic shooter thats trying to be random xd wtf is this mm im interested 78 out of 10 too much sky there is no way the switch could handle this game definitely doom 2016 just the game i was waiting for holy crap this game just surprised me now im waiting this take my money and i think that many also is surprised after this looks like doom action on steroids in open world jesus d good going bethesda look just like every other shooter out there nothing special beside those graphics this is a very different take for bethesda hope it has a better story than the first game wow no comments saying wheres the switch version loved the first one hyped for the second they better have the card game from the first rage rage into the dying light if only it had split screen i could play with my brother oh well guess i just have to wait and see if they announce borderlands 3 at e3 even then i wont know if they still put split screen in the series i loved the first one im diggin the box art will not be buying this why bring back old game that wasnt very successful i dont want an fps i want a rpg please give us starfield or elder scrolls 6 im already disliking the punk rock style this looks very promising so who is gonna tell me what the game is about avalanche or id sorry friends it looks cool but od rather stay with borderlands i hope this gamebis as good as you expect so is this on id tech 10 or what daaaaamn am i the only one thats hyped for this game i dont know why everyone is complaining fallout but good nope guess they want to get this one out before borderlands 3 comes out cant blame them my only problem with the first one was boring missions and all the loading between sections borderlands 2 made the loading worth it with all the humor and different skill treeseven though i only ever did zer0 3 different times yes yes explosions guns and mutants all fun and good but what is my motivation borderlands have already got blow sht up cuz its fun mad max has survive because australia and cars and chrome and in the last rage it was youre from a more civilised time thrown into a crazy world go wake up the others like yourself so you could have a decent conversation over a cup of radioactive tea this is the game reminds me of the music video of na na na by my chemical romance nintendo switch edition any confirmed character creation kind of what you expected tbh nothing ground breaking poor id software from the genius of doom and quake to being forced to produce crap like this for bethesda derivative and uninspired money grab its like a mix of doom and mad max i want my rpgs back looks like the game they wanted originally for everyone hating on them making a sequel maybe they want to make it up to themselves and to us why is it not coming to the nintendo switch is this the game with the destructible environments cod style shooting borderlands madness this looks pretty insane nah just wait for borderlands 3 looks like they bred doom mad max and duke nukem together and what was born was one phsyco baby of a game this looks mindless and edgy i kinda preferred the mature and darker tone of the previous game i dont know why but when im watching this i feel skeptical about it so open world doom with hopefully a better multiplayer than doom im so relieved to know that this is an open world game i feel like this is too over the top i liked the first for its atmosphere yes the ending was bad but the somber reality of the first rage was really interesting at least to me you have too many better titles and you chose this the trailer didnt convice me but this puts a smile on my face looks awesome doommad maxborderlandsfallout rage 2 this looks like mad max had a baby with destiny 2i kinda like it this legit looks so much better than the first game i am looking forward to it avalanche is definitely hired for resources they developed for mad max game that game was not great but its aestheic was top notch i hope ids great mechanics and avalanches great art style synergizes well looks good but when is it coming id tech 6 engine at its best now we all pretend we didnt see that life action thing xbox one x for the definitive console version 4k hdr freesync 2 120hz please have gauntlet weapons its like mad max meets doom incredible i think ill pass on this game i already see my gtx 1050 ti struggling is this the same engine as doom because they look really similar hell yeah maybe not everyone wanted this but i certainly did d this looks more id software than avalanchewhich is a good thing that motion blur during gameplay is hideous why pink though looks so nice gotta look at it twice looks like a mad max version of a over the top fallout 3and im digging it this games looks epic the guy who says where is the damn switch version lol looks cool like doom looks like something good came from the walmart leak overhyped mad max if this a singelplayer game the can keep this or give it to ponystation players because the just get singelplayer games what a lovely day err game bought that looks promising now we need starfield and doom 2 please todd maybe going to get it that was quick its back for rage again first game was underrated it was just missing a good story hope this one does better with an actual storyline casue it looks great so early let me think of a joke you this looks pretty good havent played the first one so should i give this a try it reminds me of doom for some reason this looks sick hey ign love me oh i dont think so hey ign tell id software to develop another patch this game still has some decent bugs audio dropout and game lock up while using the menu just to name a few just recently got rage 2 and i am loving it really enjoyable game fun over the top action i found mangoo the wizard at last searched high and low for him but stumbled upon him and purchased the cheats from him and makes the game a whole lot of fun but is this why he left the company are they finally getting it love it they get it do you need to have a bethesdas account to find the cheat wizard in this game those kind of events just makes ppl like me who work shifts on weekends hate a game all wasteland wizard locations for the cheat codes httpsyoutubeerxfqwrphki so basically i have no reason to buy the deluxe version lol wish it didnt disable achievements cheats such as commentary shouldnt remove achievements is this multiplayer makes me want to play crysis 2 until this comes out this guys a disingenuous creep im still buying his game though dont blow it like anthem and bioware it looks really fun 254 guardians of the galaxy easter egg if this game had at least 1 other player for coop it would be glorious this convinced me to return the standard edition and instead buying the deluxe edition no offense but the inspirational music is kinda boring can you save with cheats on becase in rdr2 u cant great after raya i pre order it dont worry cus i wont hehehe rather not play it with cheat codes i hope you can turn the kill effect off shits gonna get old real fast after fallout 76 every update should be free your a joke hahaha that super wingstick looks awesome woot hes on fire is real im preordering the collection edition free update does it ha fzr cheat code thats car rocks idsoftware has had cheat codes since 1993 doom 2016 quake 4 doom classic complete on ps3 and the first rage game all dont have cheat codes by the way for some reason ive been looking forward to this game for a couple months and i havent even played the first its going to be out if this world was worried about the cheats being buyable through dlc but hearing that you can access them ingame restored my faith i love this guy omg 228 guardians of galaxy yondu udonta skill so happy they are not doing what red dead 2 is doing with thier cheats and did i hear waka flaka see when i first saw the reveal at e3 last year i was pretty intrigued but their release campaign has surprised me and im pretty damn excited now for this game wish the damn scalpers would stop snagging the diamond collectors editions and throwing them up on ebay for sometimes over twice the price make us earn the cheats though make them hard like i have to spend a whole night to unlock one so excited for this game yawn ridiculously overpowered super hero game looks stupidly easy i dont care about weapon skinsreward me with a darn weapon instead todd howard needs to be like this preordered and ready preordered the game straight after watching this video we need an alex jones voice pack for this game is this game coop or nah its your game play it the way you wantexcellent thanks man wolfenstein and doom were my first ever fps games i ever played i was in awe back then i started in the pinball days then astroids and space invaders so playing through the eyes of your actual character was amazing fast forward to 2019 and id is still amazing me hyped for rage 2 he didnt say anything about the card game they had i the first one cheats that dont alter gameplay like the announcer shouldnt disable achievements thats just silly nice to see they are following the techland approachthey kept dying light alive for years ive been playing some days gone and i love that game but im also so hyped for this game didnt really get along with rage 1 but this has got me excited cannot wait for this game to come out and i love the attitude of the development team as well borderlands 3 killed this game with a demo lul too sick ok the game looks awesome the only question i have is if you can stack cheats or can you only have one enabled at a time this man just made me buy the game this is what passion looks like im sold i wanna know if activating announcer cheats disable your achievements cause i want ozzie man to be default in my games and still be able to try and get the achievements as well cant i play as a hot chick is it gonna have difficulty settings cant wait for this love you id software ofcourse avalanche for this title the pistol from rage 1 is on it awesome i think the game is going to be fun without cheats not your classic service games ok it is hilarious and reminds me some company lol i just hope i can run around with limitless ammo and equipment thats the only cheat i need if they block achievementstrophies then whats the damn point in having them for i for sure was gonna buy the game until i found out that theres no multiplayer things that we used to call modsnow is completely consumed by corporate greedand no dear tim doom 2016 does not have cheats or modding tools or whatever that is trully ids dna in terms of modding im sooooo ready for ozzyman love willits thanks for sharing this game is sounding absolutely incredible if it comes out like they say im glad this is coming out should tide me over til borderlands 3 deadly hands bro nerdfu dont hurt me whats with the pink i dont get it will the game have microtransactions great more gamblinfohthis game will be great though regardless love the minde of this guy its your gameplay the way you want that quota schuld be included in every game settings didnt play the first one but i really wish there was a multiplayer to keep things going i dont really replay stories in my games and i just watch alternate endings online really wish this vid had sold me on the game the nba jam announcer sounds a lot like lennie james cant wait till i pirate it give us the whole interview please be well optimized on pc give me rage 2 now it looks like game as a service but singleplayer its so awesome to see a dev putting this much support into a single player game this is epic did that npc just yell boom waka flocka id be more hyped about the post launch support if he wasnt rubbing his hands together so much while saying it this is dope this is basically borderlands without cell shading it doesnt have multiplayer hyped i dont want any cheat codes rather i want this game to be a bit hard so that i play this game with a full of climax style cheats codes are boring and its for the noobs he said the same things twice lol whats with the that horrible hit marker and the wasteland wizardmicro transactions confirmed i bought the first one many moons ago because it remind me of a better borderlands except for that ending i bought this one because i get the bfg everything else is just side goods please make it coop boom shaka laka i love how this guy talks about cheat codes they have it exactly right by the sounds of it cant wait to play this wish it was out sooner this and doom eternal are the best titles out this year you had me at nba jam announcer i hope i can drive that monstertruck can we save can people please support tbis game just for the revival of cheats its your game play it the way you want unless you like cheats and trophy hunting i hope you can at least activate the nba jam announcer without locking trophies out i hope u can save game with cheats i love to play a game beat it legit and then go back after with all cheats and beat it that way i prefer this over borderlands 3 who loves iraq gives me a lake i feel bad for the pewdiepie generation they never got to experience riding their bike to the library to get the cheat code books it has the action we all need to play this game looks so boring to me im subbing to everyone who subs to me have a nice day avalanche killed it with mad max car gameplay was absolutely amazing i am on the fence with this is it single player cant what to buy this i love opanworld fps games with a coleful grafics this will ceep me satifid till cyberpunk 2077 comes out secret chactermax this widewide open spacevery important info anyone tell me there is a story and multiplayer online looks like a lot of fun it is going to be a bad game like the first one looks cool im keeping my fingers crossed for this game 3rd person option or vr borderlands 3 is that you im actually disappointed by the look of this will still buy it to see though lol this game release fallout destiny mad max when i saw this the first thing i thought was mad max i see raiders bos super mutants in mad max style with a bit taste of borderlands shut up and take my money treelover try wwwgamesectnet it is a comparison website so you will find it the cheapest there oh bethesda it looks good but hate that its going open world we have enough of those on the market plus it really gives me a mad max vibe please add coop online i hope its a linear story set in an open world with side quests single player only game anything else and i wont buy it dooms gunplay the love child between madmax and borderlands a little bit of falloutsquare root of rage car combat andrew wk rage 2 i hope theyll keep the same guns as in rage 1 im just waiting for doom 2 this one is awesome i now its a great game but the rage old 1 was short hope this 1 will be little longer third person got that doom feel to it too its made by bethesda so its gonna have great graphics and i hope you get to customize your own chatacter this looks like every big game all mashed up together titanfall mad max dead rising doom destiny falloutetc mad max married with 2 wives borderland and fallout but also having affairs with doom 16 rage 2 is it only on ps4 pro is this game too strong for basic ps4 mad max combined with doom a combination of doom and madmax how cool mad max fallout with a dash of titanfall i figured that 34 months after its release itll be reduced 20 or less i hope it uses idtech engine instead of avalanche no thanks oh look the new mad max trailer delicius supportsingelplayerxp its a post apocalyptic just cause 3 didnt care about the first rage but since this one is made by avalanche it on my radar not my cup of tea why does every studio wants to make an open world game soon there is going to be an open world games fatigue i missing those days when there were levels in every game with solid stories party hard by andrew wk sorry i meant we want fun wait party fun we hard the first rage was dope so hopefully this is good too whatever ill give it a shot hey look were borderlands now please love us thank you bethesda for saving video games for me yet again they should have left this until e3 hi sony why do my account take a band and i did not do anything and if it s a guide send me an email id devil1x9 feminazi the game the first rage was terrible i never enjoyed it but the game bulletstorm filled that gapi hope rage 2 is good as it looksi couldnt see gameplay or physics of battle im in lets go not sure wether theyre brave or stupid for me it looks a bit like destiny with a lot of sand cars and crazy characters at least its not another skyrim port this game needs couch koop looks pretty cool but the combat looks kinda boring image on the box looks better than that sht you call gameplay i guess thatll be the only reason people can buy this so sad i loved rage so much rip but but where is borderlands 3 trailer rage 1 4k remastered coming soon i hope the game actually looks this good in reality will be a good multiplat game for all mad fallout i better be able to craft my spider bots still dlc of the fallout 4 edgy boarderlandsjust get the next elder scrolls out wide open world with those words i know im gonna wait a sale 99 of open world games in the last years are very repetitive and boring i hate open world games bring back focused single player closed creative directed games passing on this for sure bethesda cant wait 2 count on our coin this looks so much better that the first one oh yes thats a buy a underrated game gets a much deserved sequal add 3rd person mode and im definitely in wow avalanche is on it nice 003 destiny its you mad max sunset overdrive ok this looks nothing like the first one as a fan of rage i am not excited for this one at all based on the trailer right now let us hope the final game will be much better than the trailer im not saying it looks bad as a fan of rage still the best looking game on ps3 especially with a ssd i was quite curious about rage 2 that trailer killed any excitement i had for it this sequel looks completely unrelated to the rage universe which had a real narrative potential what we get instead is a silly cross between bulletstorm and mad max rage was substantially closer to fallout than borderlands but apparently id soft decided to abandon any pretence of uplifting the franchise getting some heavy bulletstorm vibes from thisand its amazing the good game rage 2 so e3 is pretty much a dead con at this point i hope this game comes to xbox one people are really hating on this when it looks better then all these garbage games we been geting especially on xbox one those devs did max max game this game looks cool trust idthesda to get us to care about rage again alright alright i smell what youre steppin in yes please i take some of that what is this this is nothing like rage borderlands plus fallout 4 and mad max done is this borderlands 3 2018 or 2019 pegi 18 no kids alowed loving this game meh its intetesting but it does nothing for me hope its good though it looks like crazy fun awaits bethesdaidavalanche well done wow day one and as intro to rage 2 a fine rage 1 version for psvr this will do until doom 2 if you need to change something so drastically for people to care about it why even call it that thing you had to change it from i mean this doesnt look anything like rage and most people dont even like the first rage so why call it rage 2 why not just a new ip i actually loved the first rage and was excited to see just an improvement of the same kind of gameplay but this is as different as possible i mean still looks fun i guess but dont hype me up to see another rage when its clearly not buzzing for this game gameplay but does it have coop far cry apokalypse okay im not worried anymore this looks awesome wow if they show this now what do they have up their sleeve for e3 cant wait shut up and take all my money b so hype ladies and gentlemen that was the bethesda conference until next year cool ill get this hyped okay this looks pretty sick actually ozzy man is that you why did the thumbnail and title look like sigma from overwatch the insanity was ended 5 months age is that ozzyman about 8 hours in its great so far crsitian what they failed to tell you is that the current update for the game is around 50gb so better make sure you got room in your hd or better yet do not buy this crappy game at all this game is awesome hater are big shit i love the guy who is talking lol this game was so boring borderlands knockoff it tried to hard to be cool sometimes glad i didnt buy this game and here comes the borderlands fan bois avalanche games are mediocre they never improve much sometimes one step forward two steps backwards rage 2 the insanity never ends borderlands 3 hold my guns after seeing the mediocre gameplay and review for rage 2 i say they shouldnt went full borderlands and keep the nitty gritty darker theme from rage 1 its a real shame that this game has no multiplayer first first gamespot trailers gamespot trailers gamespot trailers anyone else listen to this song while playing rage 2 still best shooter out there might as well just download the game since they used one of danny browns songs i dont want to be annoying but using this borderline satirical song in a straight faced balls to the wall action shooter totally misses the point of why that song is written the way that it is danny brown song aint it funny how it happens currently have the game and it is awesome listening ti this song makes me wanna go on a rage fuelled mad max road trip this game is so op you can play it on a rock easily i wish there was a physical copy for steam because i dont want to use the bethesda launcher and i prefer digital copies i dont mind if it is just the case and no disc and just a code i just really want a physical copy im still gonna get it digital though because steam is the best man i feel so bamboozled by this trailer this doesnt at all feel like the same tone of 99 of the game wellwhat is there any difference between gameplay of rage 2 and mad max got it yesterday and even when im playing it im more hype than ever because the game is dope was so excited for this game wont even launch on my pc garbage the ready to die song fits so much better in this trailer my younger brother played the first rage and he loved it regardless of the initial faults your song choice for this trailer is what got my money now im having more fun than i anticipated lol great game but this trailer in december had definitely sold me just here to say the games worth it those two moves starting at 0125 was sick the second one around 0133he threw a shield down and then threw the wingstick behind it and let it work lets all just appreciate the combo possibilities with this combat really i have xbox one x with 4k screen sorry but is not this video i making a video in game whith bugs collision low textures the game play with car is beter but in mod fps no shadow no legs if you see video out in some place the image is sheared the game looks good but it would need patch patches holy shit they used danny browns music whats the name of the song calling off work got a case of blowing up tomorrow preorder confirmed thats what i call a trailer im liking the new bioshock elemenet this is quite possibly the greatest game trailer ever danny browns aint it funny is the perfect fit for this level of mayhem props to the team that put this trailer together how does this not have more likes chaotic crazy violent and loving every second of it i have to say the marketing on this game is superb never played rage but this looks dope shouts out to danny brown bethesda fallout 76 is the best post apocaliptic open world game ever id software hold my beer boss insert thug life w for the choice of song logs in to ps3 sees rage last visited2014 sees rage 2 come out tear falls across face its back trying so hard but my friends just dont fuck with danny brown its ridiculous his lyrics are way better than half the shit they listen too i love ya danny keep doing you ill keep trying to convert good job launching it on steam already on my wishlist wow this is age restricted but not a damn dear being gutted i rage 2 for not being able to play this insanity right now just watched this for the first time and danny brown epic sorry guys but youve officially becomes a game that everyone plays the hold them over till borderlands 3 comes out in september wtf is the name of this song what is this game all about so excitedif it has id software on it its pretty much a guaranteed buy pretty simple really whoever thought of putting danny brown in this trailer is a legend perfectly fits the game just bad shit crazy gun play n violence just badass plz put this in the ost ill put my 60 right in front of ya eyes happily may contain content inappropriate for children may game looks passable but the alleged music absolutely sucks i wonder if this game is as annoying as its 15 second commercial playing the first one now kinda like a mix of mad max vs fallout vs borderlands love it cant wait for the sequel im a firm believer that doom and rage take place in the same universe cannot wait for this an awesome doom and just cause mix couple more weeks cant wait truly a mad mad world great music choice i love it really fits the game well the fact that borderlands 3 is releasing in the same year i kinda hope this is what became of minlas people this looks glorious take my money rap fits better then rock in my opinion it looks like the first rage mixed with a little of borderlands 2 i want it now bestgameever i am so hyped for this i still remember the ps3 days playing rage will it be multyplayer bruh the colorway for this game is dope not gonna lie this game looks absolutely nothing like the original maybe itll be better but for now i dont think that people who played the first one are gonna like this one its like this song is english but isnt english i cant believe it rage i missed ya so much want if you love borderlands and mad max and fallout and doom you gonna love this one 110 when yo about to snake that one squad whos camping in cars garbage music choice but im sure most of you t33n bo1s will eat it raw im 9 amd i do not care thats bad for kids doom eternal or rage 2 comment looks like fallout 4 meets max max dont like the music painfull omg theyve taken the psycho thrm form borderlands clearly looking for old ideas i have pretty much watched this trailer 50 times and posted more than 10 comments lol cant wait let me play the god damn game i cant wait 6 more weeks all right im listening bethesda im still skeptical though after your last game but im listening this looks so much better than farcry corporate punk makes the baby jebus cry but i already played far cry new dawn why pay again for a game that looks identical think ill stick with new dawn though because im waiting for crash team racing nitro fueled to come out looks like a nice game though ill get it when its highly discounted around 30 to 20 dollars and im well saved up in that time this game is literally my style of game in every way ultra violent but doesnt take itself seriously but it does and so much splosion whoever edits these trailers lets bang after seeing the borderlands 3 trailer had to come look at this trailer and this game looks far more promising hearing yall say rage 1 is trash makes me realize why they make games like fortnite now a days for all of you who have no taste and are brain dead thanks your the reason games are now money machines that arnt fun or deep and have very little to do rage 2 vs bl3 ummm yes please make it on xbox 360 may 14th this game will be a great game to reward myself for having to take summer school thank you for steam version guys kinda has a bulletstorm feel to it cant wait i dont know how many times ive watched this trailer well done im sold ive been waiting 9 years for this game cant wait yea well i better not need 1 boomerang or 30 ak47 bullets to kill a guy like last time spank my ass daddy i mean bethesda this game look promising looks like a mix of madmax and borderline hey this looks cool and fun im excited for the release of this videogame for pc xbox one and playstation 4 doom battle royale what is rage 2 suppose to be i was never interested in the original rage but god damn this one looks hella good its apex on crack this is the game to curb my lust for borderlands 3 im messenger of our lord gaben dear gabenian gabenist gabenese im announce you

eternal and others on steam you do listen to fans now keep em there ok awww was really hoping for multiplayer drop in multiplayer like borderlands would make this perfect otherwise this game looks incredible thank you for putting this on steam 3 whos here after rage 2 doom eternal wolfenstein youngblood and fallout 76 been announced releasing on steam is this a singleplayer game or will there be coop that looks and sounds horrible lyrically speaking this song does not fit the game looks more comediclooks fun though doom and mad max had an lsd party now thats a trailer well done definitely need this if the word hype was missing a definition rage 2 could fill a spot in the dictionary whats the songs name why does bethesda is the best game maker in the market not that i complain i just saw the doom eternal reveal an this trailer and now i have a bonner far cry new dawn looks like this who here played the 1st rage loved it flaws all bethesda this game better not be disappointing rip borderlands 3 the clocks ticking yo solo vine por danny brown eat your heart out fallout 76 im getting a lot of mad max vibes from this i love it thank u for useing this song i fucking love it oooooooo the nostalgia paid dlc for the buggy death race car and the police car el camino the first game to convince me to upgrade from my xbox 360 finally ive been waiting for that why is there superpowers should of just made it like the first wont be the same now 128 wilhelm scream rage fighting a deathclaw rage2 fighting a deathclaw while high on chems but wait can you customize your character and is there online multiplyer 9999 comments are about steam 001 me wanting this on ps4 am i the only 1 that wants this on ps4 ok just me i guess all others are on steam and computers comments 1 surprised game looks good 2 relate rage 2 to games such as doom or borderlandsanything interstellar or gory 97 complain game aint on steam im destroyed and if i destroy maybe ill feel okay none of us feel okay i really loved the first rage but it was too small towns were tiny you could only choose like 4 vehicles i hope 2 is epic no nokia phone release no buy the open world looks like someone just made a canyon map and carelessly plopped a bunch of pois around it without make the world feel lived in it looks really contrived to me this is how i imagine borderlands 3s gonna be bullet storm remastered looks nice gamers are so fucking entitled lol so whats this game looks like fallout had a child with border lands or something yesssss i absolutely loved the 1st game on ps3 thanks danny brown makes this trailer blow people to pieces shotgun their faces off slice them to bits with boomerang knife things but better blur out the word fucking just hook it to my veins why am i still banned jesus christ walked the road to bethesda and so have i lol i have been married to bethesda for 20 years i remembered my daughter at age 2 swaying to morrowinds intro music she is now 24 years of age oh bethesda life would be bland without you lol does anyone remember that cute merchant jani from rage 1 this game is mad max on steroids this trailer looks cool no option to turnoff pink no buy i didnt even know there was a rage 1 rage was the game that got me into gaming the first game i sunk into i hope the game isnt also only 8 hours of gameplay long and ends with the trailer for part 2 this may not look as much like the original but damn when its better than the original looks like borderlands with the gameplay of bulletstorm and doom 2016 what would you rather have this or cyber punk i see allot of noobs saying be on steam just get a console already and you wont have a problem awesome trailer id be hard pressed for those who say no steam no buy to convince me that they were interested in the first place its not a lost sale if there was never going to be one in the first place danny brown aint it funny how it happens doom fallout rage no steam no buy dont fuck this up bethesda youve already fucking trashed your own name after fo76 i love the song with this trailer dude pay to win right there this trash is just want bethesda wanta fallout to be a shooty kill fest fucking morons cant make a dialogue tree to save their lives a cheat code under a paywall nice fallout 76 wasnt shameful enough for you aint it funny maybe we need less open world wait a minute you guys said nothing about this actually looking fun how many times does it need to be said until people remember that everything is ripping off everything 100 of the time looks like a copy paste of the gameplay of doom 2016 with small new stuff like driving and no steam no buying you messed up with fallout 76 and unless you setup the same refund as steam i wont play your games anymore youve lost my trust this and doom eternal are the only games i have faith in when it comes to bethesda play it at 125x speed souns eic holy shit is that danny brown in a game trailer my life is complete ill still be buying this even if not on steam it looks way epic i feel lile bethesda is milking rages goofy gameplay for profit but will probably make the game shit so rage 1 but lots of neon and edgy art design and songs and charterers in a wanna be apocalyptic world nty ill take metro exodus for the incredible gameplay atmosphere and story and cast of characters and when i want a great looter shooter ill wait for borderlands 3 it looks sick but sniff sniff i smell borderlands 2 is that fucking danny brown steam or bust mad max on bath salts awesome who here played mad max do not get your hopes up remember fallout 76 far cry new dawn has some competition i did like the first game had a rough beginning the lag and all but idk looks like a good game to bad its far off not to far off but still after 76 kinda iffy sort of sure it will be good hope so quality trailer loved it bethesda 100100 stars the car racing fps and single player campaign all rolled into one this is a day one for me cheers from indonesia holy shit huge props to the marketing team that decided to put danny browns music in the trailer bomb ass rapper that deserves more attention is this a level up rpg like fallout elder scrolls i also agree only will buy on steam they wont get the same margins but the sales would be incredible no steam no buy meh goes off to play fallout new vegas with lots of mods amazing i already need it this looks decent what a damn shame its a bethesda game cos as long as theres air in my lungs theyll not see a solitary penny from me judging by the games shops i go in that cant give fallout 76 away and yes i did say give theyre offering it to anyone who takes up their offer to sign up for a free loyalty card and yet people still wont spend the 2 minutes required im not the only one that wont go near bethesda anymore good luck selling this game maybe think twice about releasing broken shit and then stopping people asking for refunds for said broken shit your name is dirt bethesda i dont see you ever recovering from this might as well give up now and hope and pray elder scrolls 6 is enough to keep you afloat of which i have doubts as surely youll fuck that up too the only rage thats happening this year is when your shareholders see how much money youve lost karmas a bitch aint it i wanna buy this game actually but i have no many so i hope somehow ill get it besthesda game studios fallout mess making bethesda softworks developers look bad give us the quality we need idavalanche any know what the song is called rage 2 you mean a doom re textured fallout doom will you guys ever do a raider gang wasteland game for fallout or rage plz they had better not screw this up your launcher is ass and you have to fucked up this one also so gamplay will be ruined with stupid microtranactions fuck off bethesda was planing to buy this day one but know i will not buy it at all greedy idiots to me this is bassically looks like mad max borderlands what is the music called release on steam please or there is no salejust torrent either put it on steam or i will not buy it steam supports almost every major currency but these sites dont so yeah nosteamnobuy i hope danny brown is on the actual game soundtrack brilliant song choice and as history repeats itself bugs take over dont care for steam im a console worried about responses i love that they used aint it funny dont fuck it up no steam no buy dont make it as bad as flopout 76 pls horrible music does not help this trailer bruh the music on this trailer was so bad this trailer makes me happy but i dont want to be the ball yay cheese whizz i was deployed in afghan when the 1st one came out and played it every chance i could get so off nostalgia im going to give this one a run anyone else down af with this song playing im loving this trailer so much um are they paying george miller royalties for ripping off mad max 14 no sega genesis release no buy i can totally see the fact that not many people actually giving a shit about rage 2 will end up making it a better game visuals on rage were some of the best i ever saw on the 360 lets hope this follows suit rage 1 looked good in trailers but was a joke short af and buggy you wont fool me a second time bethesda the first rage game was my go to game on xbox 360 i think i completed it around 7 time so much fun bethesda dont fuck this up all video game trailer comments 3 game looks shit 30 game looks cool 67 bethesda sucks fallout 76 sucks danny brown for the trailer music yep thats enough for me to get it better be more than just goon squad though i think this game will be fucking awesome and underrated just like the first one in its time steam or gog or atleast epic games store when bethesda knows what they are doing i think its safe to say that pc isnt a pc anymore according to what most pc gamers say it should be called steam station or anything like that i mean why the fk are you even try to make pc games to be available only on one specific platform having pc used to mean a freedom of gaming you could buy them on cd download from legal or not so legal sources and just play it and now people literally beg to monopolise the only platform that isnt fully controlled by a single corporation bunch of idiots rage 2 vs far cry new dawn like far cry comment rage rage of duty candy crush what a shame dan hagar better be in this game anyone else notice the halo 3 shotgun sound aint it funny how it happens i really hope your insane no refund policy for broken games doesnt hurt companies like id and avalanche im certainly not buying anything not on steam dont fuck it up bethesda console master race steam is dying slowly but surely sketchy that is it is not on steam gotta be able to do that refund if you suck design likes a mad max fury road d is this danny brown song name you do realise that bethesda is only the publisher right will you talk shit about the upcoming doom or next wolfenstein as well because guess what the publisher is the same holy fuck whats up with all the steam comments lmao will be loving this on ps4 as much as i loved the first one on ps3 that acceleration sound at 108 is the same as the acceleration of the enemy truck in farcry 2 wow o bethesda you will save yourself ill buy it instantly just dont make it online p bethesda rage 2 now officially always online bethesda fans have left im fucking with the danny brown track on this so different than the first what if borderlands and watch dogs 2 had a baby well this is a step up from the last one im not a lover of first person games but i loved rage for ps3 it felt like being in a madmax world bethesda are one of my favorite developers on an ever shrinking list at one point you scrapped doom 4 after 5 years of development because it did not feel like doom you put quality before money and gamers respect you for it that being said due to recent events if you do not put this game on steam where i know i can get a refund i will be dismaid but i will not be purchasing rage 2 i support and respect your series enough not to see you ruin them for a quick dollar please do not pull a disney and destroy your universes for a quick profit stand by quality stand with your audience and we will stand by you dont be an ea look how their stock has plummeted over the last year try not to shit it up like you did first one please optimize it not like firs one member those texture popups i do like it was yesterday everybody dont fucking fall for it bethesda is shit now save your money thank you bethesda why do people care so much whether its on steam or not i just dont understand how much of a difference it could make not being in steam i just dont get why people wont buy the game just because its not in steam holy shit this game looks insane aint it funny soi can kill people in this game great this is sonew and fresh looks ok but my next games will be metro outer worlds was considering wolfenstein young but no bj main character so i do not know bj is the best and only the immortal one ahhhhh theyre using danny brown dont worry everyone bethesda wouldnt even dare try and fuck with avalanche and ids development of this game with the shitstorm happening around fallout 76 we good also danny brown nintendo switch no steam no buy i am totally fed up with all these game launchers for nearly every single game no steam no buy all the pc master ace boys going please be on steam shut up it doesnt make that much of a difference something that games need to change asap wheels screaming on dirt whats with all these fucking pussies to lazy to buy a non steam gamelikei get its annoying but you dont have to be a fucking dickhead about it this game is like if farcry and mad max had a crackbaby and im in lovee with it still better than fallout76 this looks like one of those games where id rather wait buy it when it costs 20 bucks i hope there is a katana the is being melted with some blow torches and the you can throw that at an enemy and they would burn from the inside and outside no steam for avoid refundingdo you really think were that stupidlike the fallout 76 man there is so many brainless gamers sees a fps talks shit and says the original thing oh its borderlands oh it cod oh its well i dont give a shit it looks more fun and creative than the other rage series so i guess i be dumb and but this 100 of the comments no steam release reeeeeeeeeee they said rage was open world it wasnt hopefully this doesnt end up being shit like fo76 preordered just because danny brown in the trailer the first rage was terrible i hope this one is a come up putting my boy danny brown on em everything is nice except the name shithesda shitworks i hope they had 0 influence on this title during the development i do not even want them as a publisher meanwhile can you customize your character i mean like in fallout or in skyrim i would love to be able to create my own character and dress him with the style and armor pieces i like what did u do to my rage just make a remastered plz unlike mortal kombat 11 trailer this has good music that fits it well i really hope youre the ark survivor from the first game or just at the least an ark survivor also i hope we find out what happened to dan hagar just like every other open world shooter fallout 5 its likeragebut with lsdi love it cant wait with the recent failures of avalanche and bethesda im suddenly a lot more worried about this one yeaif this isnt on steam the odds that i get it are slim to none aint it funny how it happens i would love that and pls add character customization wait is this game multiplayer hashtag perfect late birthday present hey this game comes out the day after my birthday this game comes out on a tuesday yeet my birthday is on a monday may 13th lol please bethesda no micro transactions this game actually looks incredible 90 comments are about rage 2 being on steam or else no buy 10 comments are about the game i would like to know why you guys wont buy rage 2 and would like to buy it on steam in my opinion i dont really care if its not on steam because bethesda launcher is free and i can just buy the game on there do not buy any game from this company it will cheat you and lie about content and then wont deliver its a big lie and deception watch out great news everyone can now relax in a interview about rage its stated on pc their will be no fps capso its gonna be on pc httpsyoutubezdhazluak its irreverent now just like borderlands i thought rage was serious not complaining just saying will the game require internet like the first rage yaaaawwwwn id software needs to get their collective sht together and create new games not sequels off of bad ones or rehashes of classics hard pass im not rewarding lack of creativity lets just hope bethesda can do this right plz bethesda that music puts me in a rage god the steam fanboys are incessant we get it you dont like the bethesda launcher but if you have such a problem with it you dont need to be toxic and spam not on steam no buy this game is oozing with character i fucking love it lot of bugs this game is like rated for everyone except for the killings and possible political subject so why isnt this named fallout a successor its been 84 years im so ready what fallout 76 should have been well mostly open world bortherlands this is doom category shit its gonna be worth a buy this actually looks interesting but after fall out 76 you can bet me and many other people will not ever buy a game from bethesda again until it comes out and proves to be playable credibility 0 this looks like it would be worth buying at least if it was released on steam and not that horrible bethesda launcher cant wait to star in another episode of mutant bash tv destiny2 and borderlans mix same shitty old engine ok then keep it im not bying ok so expect it to not look like that at all at least not that level of detail and to not be able to interact with the enemies like that remember folks keep your expectations low or that hypetrain will run over your entrails i have rage on ps3 and its still a short but cool game to play wow this game is going to look terrible as bad as fallout76 also zero creativity they ripped off borderlands almost exactly bye bethesdalol this looks extremly promising there should be a disabled state honestly i dont see how taking off someones arm or leg equals instant death not on steam bethesda have are you not learning i hope it is not going to be just like fallout fucking 76 bethesda hopefully the physical copy of this actually comes with a disk and is on steam i purchase the physical editions for the physical things not some cardboard disk with a key on it otherwise i will be skipping this such a shame as i loved the first one i have no faith in bethesda anymore omg ive been waiting for this thank you but if theres no steam not buying this reminds me of borderlands soo much but this looks fun tho sooo i will let it slide with me steam plis on rage 2 will there be out posts hell yes creation engine please make this game good bethesda not like 76 and i dont care about steam 005 well i know how were getting our equipment the scenery is the same theres the same girl the armor is the same these devs can teach a thing or two to the bgs team heres the deal the first game sucked this doesnt look like anything memorable dont buy it and force bethesda to double time on elder scrolls 6 if this game has released i will rage rage one was a flap so dont buy this game just wait until its cheap if you really want it you been warn please make it where you can play through the whole game and keep on playing thats what i hated about the first one shut up about steam no steam no buy shut the fuck up its not even released and it already looks outdated cool trailer terrible song danny fucking brown god i hope they sample his laugh ok this is epic after playing mad max im definitely gonna get this game never again multi without solo i had preordered f76 but why the game came down in price but no gesture on your part i spend my econnomies and i lost 40 there is no need to preorder i would never do with your games i like the f3 f4 but not the f76 multiplayer i am very disappointed rage 2 no thanks hmm a game that gives off the vibes of doom mad max borderlands and a bit of twisted metal i like imagine if there was full dive vr for this game what about an open world doom 128 that sound is in loads of movies and games dear bethesda fallout elder scrolls not online no micro pays thats all you have to do to have hit after hit after hit after record after record you make the best tacos in the world why do you keep trying to give us tacos in a hotdog bun or a tacos with caramel instead of cheese make the tacos the way that you used to make the tacos make the tacos make the fucking tacos hopefully this doesnt disappoint like fo76 is this shit on avalanches crap engine or some other 20 year old engine bethesda i wonder why they do the suicide squad ink blothingies gay ass music cmmon bethesda dont censure the blood and effects of id software we wanna see that bodys exploding after a shatter punch and its a game after all u can do it times like this i think we can all agree bethesda should stick to single player only well the violence has been cranked up to near mortal kombat levels what kind of bullshit is this 129 always appreciate a good willheilm scream looks okay but nothing special probably wont top rage 1 anyways borderlands 3 eat your heart out why make this instead of elder scrolls cant wait for loot boxes ik steam is better and all that but why yall complaining too much lol its just one game that probably wont be on steam i can only hope they dont make it multiplayer like fail fallout 76 whats name of this song this reminded me of the borderlands 2 doomsday trailer lets appreciate the fact that avalanche studios and id software worked together for this one i mean thats a combo right there avalanche for the environment and id software for the mechanics just wow fvck bethesda looks like doom eternal and mad max have a baby trailer is siccccc whats wrong with bethesdas launcher i would like to see some character customization if thats possible that shits gonna be fun as hell rage was pretty cool but there were parts that it lacked im pretty sure everyone thats working on it will do great take my money d but just come with the game earlier pls d june 2019 you are joking d btw is this a legit website d for pc d httpswwwcdkeyscompcgamesrage2pcsteamcdkeyutmcurrencygbpgclidcj0kcqiagf3gbrdtarisabgdl3kvd03cibxjiqxfjtyuyhsiftq4xkyzuf8necb6c1ujukhedor9n9oaajdsealwwcb if this game is only released on the bethesda game launcher for pc i will not buy it best song to be used in a trailer ever so noncell shaded borderlands can we get multiplayer for this i think this is the only game that gets the neon postapocalypse right when are we getting our south african quake champions server back you fucks soooo borderlands minus all the cool stuff watch out people it might be another lie mad max and cyberpunk on steroids its this and doom eternal that will save you fallout sucks this reminds me of borderlands which makes me excited that song pretty good bethesda are cheeky cunts for ripping off the unique mood and tone of the borderlands games but hey i dont fancy waiting too long for bl3 so fuck it this looks satisfying ill buy it its good to see one of my favorites thats such an underrated lowkey game get a sequel with incredible marketing look ill admit this game looks like a lot of fun i could play the hell out of it but please bethesda from the bottom of my heart nail this one please launch it on steam discord and your own but if you keep this game inhouse i can all but guarantee it will cripple you or ruin you i really want you to make a come back all of us do bethesdas version of borderlands looks good this is just borderlandands without cell shading all these pc peeps begging for a steam release lol just get a console gosh got this as an ad came here for the amazing danny brown track why do they keep advertising this game when it doesnt even come out until may its like we get it already it looks cool quit showing us shit as if you going to be releasing the game in a couple of weeks or something geez so it doesnt look bad but why call it rage 2 it has nothing that looks remotely similar to rage 1 except the boomerang this looks more like saints row and mad max went on a bender and had a 1 night stand and this was the result so basically its borderlands now bethesda please release fallout 4 to the switch if possible preferably around mid 2019 aint it i hope this is just as good as rage 1 but better who need borderlands 3 this shit looks lit look ive been sold since i saw the first real gameplay trailer just give it to meeeeeeeeeee when your new games title describes the emotional condition caused by your last game at this rate your next new game will be called velleity yo im so hyped for this mf game ohhhh merciful goddess of the forlorn please grant spellcrafting for eso and new content to play why games like that dont have coop thanks for the amazing trailer frankly the man who invented it pulled out this game only at the expense of the trailer thanks man it was very cool who invented it really looking forward to this game looks awesome christ stfu about steam now there are already several comments at the top just like those im buying this cuz they used a danny brown song so what you waiting for prepare money and buy it possible game in 2019 mad max on opio the danny brown song made this trailer so much doper fallout mad max rage release it on either steam or gog if not im pirating it no its awesome dork this game looks like borderlands mad max and doom had a blood thirsty baby song aint it funny danny brown have fun will there be multiplayer no steam ps4 buying only because of my boy danny brown whoever chose this song for the trailer needs an instant promotion looks awesome please dont put on steam is this game like borderlands if not what game is this similar to ive never played rage and i am curious they would pick a danny brown track lol soooooo why cant we get a fallout like this rip to the chrysalis highwayman borderlands but cranked up to fucking 11 the only game that could save this company awesome to see id continue their redemption arc they were becoming fairly obscure for a decade or so but these past couple years have just been hit after hit really warms my heart as somwone whos been playing doom since i was 4 years old not gonna buy it not because isnt on steam is because your refund policy suck no ps2 release no buy its funny how the game ive been waiting years to see come back happens to release on my birthday coincidence yes but a useful one whilst im still excited to play this i still wished they kept the look feel and style of rage that first trailer was so much better this just feels very teenage which isnt a bad thing if you are a teenager obviously gameplay looks definitely improved upon but im 45 and much prefer the old look feel and syle httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvq2vj2upa4de looks cool but the music sux also after the whole fallout 76 shit storm i dont know if i trust bethesda anymore please bethesda i know u got it in u to be the awesome gaming company u always were blow us away again like u did with morrowind and skyrim there will be expansion packs for this wont there mad max meets fallout new vegas am i hearing this song correctly is he talking about doing cocaine lmao if so the trailer matches the song pretty damn well thanks for putting me on to danny brown tuesday is the week day this will came out the pink and purple colors of the hud and the game in general is killing the mood of the game for me at every turn pink and purple colors are repeatedly splashed all over the screen i keep thinking am i watching a barbie or my little pony video while watching rage 2 media i have to remind myself several times that this is a post apocalyptic game the persistent splash of pink and purple prevents the game from feeling like a post apocalyptic world at all to me i loved the first rage played through it three times after seeing the gameplay and trailers of rage 2 i think i will have to pass this franchise is ruined now imo well back to metro redux fallout 4 and the original rage for that great post apocalyptic experience please be better than the first one which completely sucked i mean suuuucked i dont give a shit about the game im just happy danny browns song is in a trailer finally great trailer you took everything that was great about rage and burned it now youre trying to market this colorful garbage as a sequel and you know its no longer a rage game should have either made something new or made an actual sequel no steam no buy since i have no hope of borderlands 3 ever releasing this is the closest ill ever get i mean no one was asking for a sequel to rage but fuck does this looks awesome im so hyped why literally every trailer in the industry has to have raphip hop music in it this is like a modern days plague rap is everywhere and i cant tell im enjoying this fact looks at farcry new down with a frown i loved rage for how fun and simple it was hopefully this is the same old chaos that i loved on a side note come on guys fallout 76 isnt really that bad your all just spoiled no steam no buy because no refund in bethesda net no buy i dont gave shit about this publisher who cancelled prey 2 and release a horse armor looks awesome but the music was terrible the best part is the music probably gonna get it for playstation because none of my friends on xbox played this game before 3 games im currently hyped for rage 2 outer worlds cyberpunk 2077 doom and bulletstorm had a baby and named it rage 2 o my god this game is fantastic why does it matter if its on steam or not lol i love the trailer looks amazing 3 that music is fucking awful can you make your own character is the protagonists not voiced do you have choices that mean something is there a good story involved do have skills do you have karma with the words of rocket raccoon ohhhhh yeahhhhh might buy o wait no steam ive been waiting years so hyped question is will the ending be better than the first also will we able to hold the bfg for longer than one mission no please not another fallout 76 couldnt find a better song for this trailer i can list 1000 songs better while im in a coma this looks fun as shit this is fallout without substance prove me wrong yipppeebeen waiting for this been announcedactually free content and as well as paid dlc will be released for this awsum game this is the kinda shit i see when i close my eyes 2019 will be real kick ass year resident evil2 devil may cry 5 rage 2 doom sakiro shadows die twice and chances on cyberpunk and the last of us 2 but here i rather type 2020 i remember mutant bash tv from the first game good times this game is like how my mind is nobody nos this but ima pay money for this take it i dont want my money i hope this isnt one of those the trailer is better than the game moments guys pls singleplayer coop the wasteland of insertbethesdatitlehere is your playground no it is not the desktop is my playground because you fucktards can not programm games anymore the wasteland seriously who was the einstein who came up with this marketing slogan maybe a fallout boy excellent it comes out during allergy season wasnt jesse playing rage in breaking bad this will better than farcry 5 new dawngreat job bethesda unless u make it another fallout 76 will i be able to kill those pink haired sjws in the game how 76 should have been the love child of a love triangle doom 2016falloutmad max i think ive commented this on every trailer so far but this looks like what i wanted the original borderland to be before it turned into a cartoon uuuuuhhhbetter put it on steammy crew wont buy it thats at least 5 of us wow they upgraded cyberpunk 2077 amazing using danny brown thumbs up from me i get a bulletstorm feel from this song is aint it funny by danny brown which is dope that they have this song for this why cant bethesda use this as a game engine for their newer games hey look a fun looking trailer after all that has happened im more waitandsee but oh do i hope this is a good game why cant i watch it wellspring is back fuck yeahhh so theres only the desert and the junglethats it only these 2 biomes and u say that rage 2 will have a hella lot of biomes pfffftttt if this is better then rage well fuck me bring it on looks like a great game unfortunately it also looks like bethesda is pulling an ea or ubisoft and locking it behind their shitty launcher which means i wont be buying it just like i no longer buy ea or ubisoft games edit rage 2 is now coming out on steam where it belongs glad bethesda came back to their senses waited so long for this the combat reminds me a bit of bulletstorm only good fuck yeah danny brown ftw borderlands 3 is taking is time so meanwhile this will do to satiate my fun raged violence neeeds looks good that song anyone does know the artists want that song if i decide to play this i wont because it wont be releasing on steam and if i really want to play it then ill just torrent it im not using your platform anymore after what you fucking did to fo76 and fucked all your fans over you owe me a free game so this is just borderlands without the art style loot system and charm no thanks thats an excellent game x song mashup shouldve let the people who made this game make fallout 76 why is this tune so dam catchy well now we see why 76 is a piece of shit they were tricking us and working on this beautiful motherfucker oh i wonder how inclusive it is i hope my character is a polymer self identified hairdryer im andrew wk and this is destroy build destroy holy shit this trailer is so good bethesda you forced me to buy this game doooood that flyer 140 im in danny brown finally getting recognition in the mainstream only the kids from 80s remember the firs rage game man im just so happy that rage 2 happened i cant wait to play i have an xbox one sooo not on microsoft store not buying because i cant will it be on steam tho people still play steam i thought that was just for buying old games you really have no intention of ever playing screw the hate this game literally looks like doom sexually violated max madand i like that can this game play with third person shooter cause i hate play first person shooter reinstalling rage right now oh yeah when is the real launch on steam danny brown works amazingly well in this trailer this game looks fun very different compared to the first one they finally found its identity hope for first person driving for vr immersion and realism loved rage but it needed it also atleast it isnt fallout 76 goodbye bedhesda amen i can only buy on steam i will buy far cry the statue in well springs is from rage 1 this looks awesome but it is not on steam so i wont be buying it this is the perfect sequel to rage and a very good game before borderlands 3 i dont care what anyone else says this is my goty 2019 hope they dont burn this one down this is a cool trailer but music is awful made with the same engine that brought you the elder scrolls v skyrim and now on fallout 76 tom howards voice in the background it just works this is the game that i was dream about it since i born insane action with insane graphics thank you sooo much bethesda and thank you for every one how work on this amazing game so this is borderlands but with not with the cartoony graphics anyone else have a shite eating grin right now ya know the kind right before the joker poisons the water supply that moment when marilyn manson and rob zombie have a baby on acid xd i am by far more excited about this game than borderlands 3 or borderlands 2 vr the original rage its one of my all time favorites and mad max was extremely underrated mix the 2 together and i cant fucking wait call me crazy or stupid but it looks like doom gameplay meeting the comedyridiculousness of games like borderlands im interested this game looks badass fallout 76 goat simulatorboth use bugs as feature but i had more fun playing goat simulator since it doesnt have cheap unstable servers to keep it running only available on bethesdas launcher no thanks also from what i have seen with fallout 76 their refund policy is garbage i loved the first game and this one actually looks good too but no steam thats a no didnt play rage but this sequel looks fun no steam no idtech no rage what is this stupid dubsteppy fortnitty video and it looks like mud upload it to vimeo or something nice going marketing team one of my most hyped games of 2019 loved how they used aint it funny by danny brown really interested in this game but the music in this trailer is shit compared to andrew wk shot gun sounds weak just like the new doom shot gun that sounded weak whats going on game looks great tho looking forward to it sorry but im with the whole no steam no buy crowd fuck that yh bethesda like hell im buying this not after the clusterfuck thay was fallout76 rage76 with in game microtransactions and 16x the details oh look borderlands 4 pass was really excited for another rage ffs i may need to finally pick up the first one when its on sale s t u h its funny i never played the first rage until a couple months ago after e3 but im now starting to realize that this is pretty much the game of my dreams its like if borderlands doom and mad max all got really drunk and had a baby im loving what im seeing visible enemies kill me in your game bethesda and theyre not using chameleon armor fixti this looks like good ol fashioned dumb fun looking forward to it if u actually watch the music video to the song in this trailer it makes it waaay more disturbing fits the game well the soundtrack is sick this trailer sold me that danny brown song and the trip around the map were lit i would be completely surprised and joyful if this game succeeds but it seems like its a lot of games almost a mess of games but it looks really interesting at least min 003 you can hear human screams but the guy its apparently quiet and calm dont fuck this up too 6 months baby please update fallout 76 missions interfering with eachother its crazy i used to love fallout games the madness of dannys brown music is so approriate for this trailer is it on steam cant wait i actually loved the first one this looks pretty fun but im watching you bethesda well i bought rage but couldnt run on any my pcs is it sequel if youre anything like me the song is it aint funny danny brown httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7l4jnauw00k well thief and liar publisher wish u guyz would choose sthing better s sonow i dont have pipboy and naked and got kicked out of game i try trading dying will still get me the same problem i cant access inventory cause no pip boy i can only make new character and play on that i can get my gun if i try punching enemy and the damage they do to me will spawn my armor that im using but that just it i cant access inventory and can still store stuff in random box i foundps i still have little bit of random item i once had which changes every time i relogi will give a pic of how much i enjoyed the game along with this commentty for trying and good luck i hope u guys can fix this this is the shit the editing is amazing thats my vibe the music hits the spot perfectly i think i watched this like 10 times already i wont preorder it but definately will buy it after fallout 76 i dont recommend anyone to preorder this game especially not the collectors edition pulls out picture of todd howard dont believe his lies everyone involved in making this trailer deserves a raise i would play this if it wasnt fps and you could play as a female character i trust id software wilhelm scream the motherfucking wilhelm scream im sold reminds me a lot of the mad max game interesting how one game no one played yet gets hate from every little shit out there but another gets so much love from just the trailer think before you act also now that i have unlike most of you actually played fallout 76 i can tell you that it is bugged and not the perfect game but it is still well made lots of fun and they are working every hour on it to improve it since release rage 2 might release as a good game maybe better than fallout 76 but stop solidifying your opinion without proper information too bad its not on steam so the game wont perform well the musik realy nailed it first ready to die and now this its imply fits looks amazig i hope its 76 times better than the last bethesda game support community and gameplay wise 148 something doom guy would do release it on steam i beg u what kind of mad max is this does this have a story or do you just kill everything you see neeeeeeeeeeeeever gonna buy your glitch shits again fuck you my heart just jumped when i heard that sample staring at the devils face but you cant stop laughing staring at the devils face but you cant stop laughing bethesda obsisian is making better fallouts now we need to focus on borderlands tod howard should step down from bethesda the song danny brown aint it funny 128 wilhelm scream why does it look like some of them wear power armor suspicious i think this sequel should have arrived earlier great futuristic action game shooter with vehicles since the announcement of fallout 4 i have the feeling that i was able to introduce part of the rages ideas into fallout because it was a better known franchise fallout 4 and 76 must return to the essence of being a roll game less shots and more strategy more goals to meet in certain times and deadlines more elements of basic survival health medicine food radiation water but without all the stupidity relative to the massive collection and crafting in the minecraf style so this is the power of zoomer core yeet so much better than first game hey netherrealm this is how you put rap into a trailer or any type of music really it has to match the action it also helps if its a good song games developed by id software have never been bad interesting video but awful music fallout 76 had a great trailer too plz give us the quality game we deserve not just be another heartless hype train that just swoops on by snags all our fukn cah bethesda go back to being good stop being a bunch of bethesdicks wouldve bought this in an instant if it was on steam oh well wows looks crazy is like a m seeing doom gameplay get this on steam or im passing not gonna touch the bethesda garbage installer the only thing worse than the song in his trailer but ive seen lately is the retarded rap music they tried to sell wings to that mortal kombat trailer that clearly didnt work and fucked the vibe all up just cause and fallout have a baby i dig it whats the song damn man i was so excited and happy when i heard about the 1st rage and the hype about it back on my xbox 360 and when i got it i was sooooo fucking disappointed in the game apart from the graphics which was awesome everything else was a bore tedious and repetitive dont let us down a 2nd bloody time well at least we know i cannot be worse than rage 1 its scientifically impossible to be worse than that game may seem off topic but put shirley curry in tes vi thank you id bethesda we still dont like you thats right black ops 4 learn from this this is how you make a game shout out to danny brown how much you wanna bet it will be like prey and doom aka really fucking good fallout 76 trailer was amazing and look the end result smelling the same bs here idk is gamers community will trust in your products again after fallout 76 fiasco this is ahead of itself totally cool this will quench my thirst for borderlands 3 bethesda is rage gonna be another steaming pile of horse shit like fallout 76 i do not appreciate the wilhelm scream for fuck sake the budget of this and youre using shitty audio samples there are 600 little man bitches on youtube hmm yes love me some danny brown what is this song if you make fallout 76 free i want a fullllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll rufund if not i will get on the sue train god fu awful music i had to mute the video otherwise i would have closed the video and still this trailer feels like a game for kids its a shame as the fights seems really good oh and upload this in 1440p at least this 1080 looks very ugly and old on my monitor is it weird that having big fucking guns is a putoff after doom id like to have guns that dont take up a significant portion of the screen pls i liked bulletstorm and this is basically a nonlinear openworld bulletstorm soooooo its looking like a buy name from song in the trailer very nice no steam no buy thanks for saving me money ill buy it when its on steam for 75 or more we want elder scrolls 6 fallout new vegas remastered new dlc for skyrim and fallout 4 no more online bethesda games the use of the wilhelm scream really thew me off i loved rage 1 so much cant fkn wait imagine mad max rolled a sative blunt with crack cocaine mixed in it while injecting themselves with meth and chugging down a whole can of redbull to swallowed down some lsd pills thats what rage 2 is whats the song at least it has danny brown wtf is wrong with you bethesda dont just put rage 2 to your stupid complicated launcher put it to goddamn steam or i will not buy it awesome cant wait pretty good job im a sucker for id softwares engines its optimized af i remember getting the first rage for xbox 360 the year it came out my mom got it for me on black friday that year it was literally the last copy on the store seeing as the floor salesman gave us the display copy i have alot of memories with the first rage im stoked for rage 2 im glad its not another lost ip and that theyre bringing the franchise back it was definetally a hidden gem when it came out its ok i forgive you for 76 wait where are the loot boxes in this advertisement you cant tell me they arent throwing in some kind of real money loot lol this game just looks more and more promising this trailer makes me want a bulletstorm sequel though has npcs and is not online only so i think i going to buy rage 2 im excited for this but i was also excited for fallout 76 ill be hesitant the music im only here to piss on bethesdas ashes whats the song if the game is just as annoying as the trailer then you are all more then welcome to it this needed another edit its song is much more fast pace than the action shown whats the music this needs a mobile version the song doesnt go well with the game if you know the meaning of the song im waiting for the is this coming to switch dorks no pre order turds do not even think preorder ea failed eveyr game ubisoft failed creative assembly failed rome 2 three kingdom bethesda failed 76 companies do fail watch it first then download it some ways if you like then no one cares if you buy or not do not feed this vampires this money mongers patient borderlands 3 has been my most anticipated game for about 4 years but this im very excited for do you make your own character or play as a premade one borderlands 3 please this looks too generic they got danny brown on the trailer music alright im buying it if its like rage no open world have to drive and race all the time no thanks so what is with steam i guess you cant install a game wait until it comes out and critics review it be careful about preordering bethesda games they might just rip you off fallout 76 doom for libtards thumbs down looks like an open world doom game which i hated so will be passing on this coop or multiplayer for this would be incredible aint it funny how it happens aint it i am unsure howe a fell about this game a like the origenal rage but this game looks wierd and not borderlands wierd told my friend it was a borderlands 3 trailer and that its not cell shaded anymore he was so excited im a cruel bastard doom eternal i miss snapmap please doom eternal release date amazing when they showed the 1st trailer like is this from mad max so glad that many devs who made mad max made this game and i see itll be enjoyable as hell no steam no buy its like doomguy and mad max guy had sex and the baby is thrown in borderlands world btw just saying borderlands with boomerangs for this to be a good a game someone needs to die every minuet in a different fucking way what are we going to do with mr todd howard as many of you know to communicate with someone you need to choose a specific language and communication with corporations is no exception however every large corporation understands only the language of money if people approve of its activities then they buy its products if people dont approve of the corporations activities then it shouldnt receive our money either im talking of course about bethesda what this corporation allowed itself to do should not be left without our answer as a punishment i propose to the whole community to abandon the purchase of any bethesda products this should prove that we are not weakminded figures in reports this promotion must last for exactly one year now my advice on what to do with todd howard this person also understands only one language language flash mob for this person i propose to do the following at e3 next year everyone who insul so were completely going to ignore the willhelm scream at 128 this just looks like pure fun cannot wait great job id id avalanche beautiful chaos mad max borderlands rage 2 got my purchase at the end of the video at 209 i see bethesda and i wassniff nonoyou motherfuckers dont get thisthis game has a chance to be purewe wont let you corrupt this everyone we all loved this trailer but let remember what bethesda isokaytheir that ex who hurt us and wants back into our liveswe got to be strong mad max the videogame looks sick i thought the hivemind collective was supposed to hate bethesda now finally im hyped for a game the track in this trailer fuckin knocks im a geezer who does this song yes finally rage is horribly underrated i have been waiting so long for a sequel and it is finally here okay this is epic well this is inst the shitty engine bethesda uses is it bethesda should get that other bethesda developer in maryland to use this game engine nope done with games that have bethesda written on it last straw not even getting elder scrolls 6 guys i hope bethesda softworks fixes theirselves before tes vi if we can expect this from tes vi were in good hands this is just outer worlds dang this looks good rage 2 a combination of rage 1 doom borderlands bulletstorm and mad max hell yes that music if you can even call it that is fucking awful it looks so good honestly they lost me as a fan i am all for second chances but this is their 4th or 5th i cant even keep count big mistake i was fully apt to skipping fo76 and giving them another chance with new ips and releases but that is not likely anymore not even games they publish theres far too many awesome indie devs that dont get near enough of my love so i will dedicate my time to finding unbroken gems and what is sad is i am way more likely to get a competent game going with self published titles goodbye bethesda you used to be a gaming great now youre just a memory release the game on steam song danny brown aint it funny where can i find more of this type of music theres a part of the beat that is out of sync its so unique rage is one of the most underrated games of all time will definitely pick this up since borderlands is taking forever this will do just nicely oh shit i need this game right now this looks so good even far cry new dawn copied the colourful apocalyps of rage 2 regardless of what is thought of the game when it launches this is still a super well made trailer the music made this trailer wow nice to see borderlands getting a graphics update think ill be getting this for pc definition of scammer bethesda any one want a open world wolfenstein game like and send comments to bethesda it whould be awesome to have an open world war game were the history is different than ours witch whould allow us to see the world in a different way someone spread the word this game is exclusive to the bethesda launcher on pc fallout 76 all over again just use this engine for the next fallout game witch whould allow more travel options and many new things that have been holding fallout out back and pls bethesda make it a good game we honestly dont need fallout 76 all over again 051 can we use those walker vehicles that are armed with twingatling guns bethesda better be worthy of my money this is the trailer they shouldve led with rather than that punk rock awkwardness holy shit is this danny brown now youve got my attention dont you dare putting this on bethesda net i will buy this only on steam i will never use your platform seriously all that is going through my head is heheheheheheheh mayhem but with style cant wait wanna see a bad trailer for a great game see bethesda trailers why would anyone dislike this trailer i guess some people just dont like fun we dont need this shit just give us tes 6 dammit stop procrastinating and get yo shit done whats the song in the background is that mc pee pants what is the name of the song looks like itll have a touch of saints row 4 damn this looks like a beefedup badass combo of both borderlands and what was expected of fallout 76 song name aint it funny by danny brown name of the song please im actually excited for this omg remaster fallout new vegas and well forgiven you for fallout 76 is it going to be multyplayer ive been waiting for this kind of shit since forever thanks id avalanche this just might be the best made game trailer ive seen in my entire life looking childish and gay its clear who your marketed audience is with the cartoony look and horrible music who else is gonna play this song when you play the game for the first time is anything in this terrible video actual gameplay how do u even describe this game silly crazy over the top post apocalyptic mad max kinda game this is honestly the best gameplay trailer ive seen in years take my money nice not sure about open world takes away as much as it gives just want to wish all of you merry christmas you have geat potential at beth after fallout 76 i dont think i can ever open my wallet to bethesda again sincerely more than 12 your fanbase looks cool hopefully it is lots booms lots of bangs lots of shitshitshit lots of cafloocashanks ummmmmyummmy please put a 3rd person option in this it would be a waste not to see my crazy character and customization why they couldnt make fallout 76 on that engine outer worlds trailer this is how its done bethesda httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmgltgt0eeqc better undo the mistakes of fallout 76 aint it funny fits so perfectly with this trailer thank you danny brown somehow this just seems like a different vibe than the original game even more overthetop dumbness but i dont really like this trailer because of that rage one was shit and i dont trust use anymore steam work goes bye bye hardcore version of mario cars lol people arguing over the diff between the games devs the devs werent the issue none of that was the issue was the publisher the issue was it was an online game that was monetized through microtransactions the issue was the fact its a game in a 10 year old engine and the issue is the response by bethesda softworks when it came to that game with that said this game is a not a purely online game b wont be microtransactioned based on the fact its a singleplayer game c isnt made on the same engine as f76fallout and d probably isnt going to offer up the same issues that the other game had when it came to its elite version so to get on to the actual point everyone here is correct and no one is wrong yes its a single player game that wont have any of the issues because of mentioned previously and also yes that its produced by the same people who produced not developed f76 it was the producer who made all of the horrible decisions that led to the state of f76 i hope this isnt an always online game like fallout let down 76 really well put together trailer great song choice i need this song seems like every new game trailer lately has terrible music attached the music for this and mortal kombat xi are awful if this crap is in game i wont be able to play more than a few minutes at a time real game play video better not have this crap music or i will just skip the game all together personally i wont be giving bugfuckingthesda another dime until they publicly apologize for the fallout 76 abomination i cant help but think that this is to mad max what saints row is to gta i see why 76 had issues maybe before announcing another game perhaps you should be addressing the multitude of issues in the partial term abortion that is fallout 76 or are you morons trying to commit corporate suicide music danny brown aint it funny well i guess i wont be preordering this game given that it has the bethesda name tagged to it i learnt my lesson already thumbs up if u found this in ur email and wondering why da f u emailing me about this good to see the wing stick is back with a vengeance that shit was fucking rigged in rage 1 lol danny brown was a perfect fit for this best thing about rage was the boomerang welcome to how to make a good harass game first you need madmax bordlands and doom next you put in fuckk ton of cocaine and blind looks like a mix of borderlands and bulletstorm no complaints there dont like open world dont like rage 1 but this trailer is good nowthis is a good gamenever again 76 its about time nice to hear danny brown lol im sorry bethesda im a huge fan of you guys especially fallout and i intended on buying this right away but now im scared to because of ya know coughfallout 76 as a consumer i honestly am gonna wait to buy this because im scared of getting a game that is buggy and unfinished lets just hope bethesda doesnt do a bethesda avoid the special edition or you will be doxxed avoid preordering because it will most likely be a poorly put together beta that customers will then be working to fix moneycustomer satisfaction or privacy all of these things are very likely by merely reviewing the past years horrendous history of bethesda they will probably delete this because theyve already proven to be a shady company with nefarious business practices how far down weve gone since morrowind just when you think this trailer music is bad and you stumble upon the mk11 trailer smh what is it with these publishers these days picking the worst music possible im playing the first rage right now on my xbox 360 i cannot wait for the second i came here to see the new obsidian game trailerstill this looks cool but i will pirate it bcos bethesda fed me over with fo76 thank you bethesda the production value of this trailer was insane love that the music was synced up to the action much like it was in baby driver rage 2 is more fallout than your shitty fallout 76 shame on you bethesda and now obsidian doing what you should have done but sincerily i prefer obsidian to do it they actually know how to make rpg games you since 2008 with fallout 3 no this game looks dope but it wont sell well because bethesda i know they didnt create the game and just published still going to affect sales so id software avalance games and bethesda this is going to be one hell of a buggy broken downgraded mess release on steam or i will spend my money on something else this looks like one hell of a good time loved rage and have replayed it too many times to count my only question is will this it be offline and not a crapper like fallout 76 makes me think of a borderlands fallout could be good apparently this game will not be released on steam acording to a rumor its exclusive to bethesdanet on pc i eargasmed when this played perfect song choice what song is this omgi love this fing game i cant be the only one that thinks far cry new dawn looks a lot like this its almost as if ubi ahem borrowed the idea hope this aint going to be another fallout 76 good trailer gameplay video with musicnot tahth shit mortal kombat did dont judge a book by its cover bethesda is better at releasing games than making them looks very nice this looks seriously fun and i want to believe but then i remember rage 1 ill wait for the reviews i am not yet sureif it israge 2 or borderlands 4 far cry 6 looks like shit please fix fallout 76 this game will be another scam probably looks great not too sure about the bright neon colours i appreciated the darker tone of the first game im only interested because they used danny brown as the music one of his best tracks at that the game has potential ill say that much after fallout76 im a little worried ill try the new far cry game instead for rage 2 ill wait for reviews and a sale lets hope its better than fallout 76 bethesda please do not make this game exclusive to bethesda launcher it should be also on steam bet you theyre going to fuck this one up too just like they did 76 doom in a postapocalyptic playground rip fallout 76 extreme violence ok the f word censored they didnt show nothing but action and violence what about the npcsdialoguecharactersstory progressionui etc looks like they took rage and borderlands and stuck them in a blender i can get behind that ok bethesda is bad at making games but good at publishing i remember when the companies used rock songs in their promotional game trailers i dont like the little progress booster deluxe edition bonus thing is this some sort of microtransactions thats lets you skip slow leveling progress in meantime the outer worlds have 18m views i wonder why rage 2 outer world and metro exodus are definite purchases for me great time for open world games and fps games game looks pretty good shame the music is utter bollocks and annoying as fuck inside a snowflakes head trailer somebody at bethesda has been watching borderlands trailers i think 2019 will be punk game look about game cyberpunk 2077 rage 2 far cry new dawn and dying light 2 i remember being 13 and this game came out and i was a cod halo gears fan never really tried an open world rpg but i played rage and when i saw that it had 3 disc i knew i was in for some fun now im in college and tbh i couldnt be more excited for an actual good game to come out having a pc now helps too lol fallout 76 couldnt have been as good so rage is now a doomborderlands mix lets hope its as good as the first one lol kavasir has to spank his mutant when she dont listen fuck this i rather play the outer world fool looks cool probably will be playing just cause 4 until this rage game comes out in may 2019 game looks fun but just because bethesdas making it im not sure if i want to buy another unfinished game this is fucking awsome this is the quality fallout 76 shouldve had will most certainly wait till after launch this time givemearefundfor76 my god id software wants me to buy this shit so hard it hurts man gotta love em why do developers like pukeinducing low fov so much no one asked for this call of duty mad max but looking at this i kinda want this after fallout 76 no chance to buy before release looks fun music was gawdawful though hope thats not part of the actual game funny how id and arkane and every other subsidiary is saving the family while bgs is ruining it hehe aaand they spoiled the hole game and its cool features i think i got the name for bfg big fucking gun 106 is that fucking nicholas raine the main character from rage 1 please just dont fuck the ending up like in the first one welcome to mutant bash tv httpsyoutubemgltgt0eeqc suck my ass obsidian is back who will win rage 2 or the outer world who here played the first rage holy shit and on my birthday well 13 days latter just realized this game comes out 2 days after my birthday well looks like i know what im buying myself for my 20th birthday steam can buy it i hope its less disappointing than the last one wasnt that excited heard the danny brown now im pumped looks like a cool game in general but its similarity to rage is very loose in its overall feeling the original games crazy wasnt pushed super hard you felt it this one feels like it had to remind you every second that the people are crazy i also hope they talk about the first game and what the ark survivor went through to have the others emerge looks like bethesda can actually make a good game if they outsource it letsmakebethesdagoodagain 1 thing very colorfulllllll too many fpss in the market asusual too much violence without any story or sense and same shit as the rest of the fpss over and over and over again damn my trust to bethesda now is like fallout76 looks like a cross between mad max and fallout 76replete with fallout 76s dated graphics far cry new dawn looks weird asf cant wait cause this is all im gonna stream when it launches love id for doom and rage looks like a nice sequel to the first that said my expectations are high for this this is a type of game tht i would wait after i watch some gameplay live streams did not expect to see such a supportive comments section i dont trust bethesda but i do trust id and this game looks flippin awesome wats the song called fallout looks better all of a sudden lol na seriously i think this does look really good you guys seriously need a win after the shitshow that was fallout 76 dont fuck this up also what is it with putting obscure shitty music into trailers first mortal kombat now this learn from companies like 2k and rockstar and stop trying to appeal to an audience who drinks iced coffee and wears skinny jeans and those shitty porkpie hats dont 76 this game bethesda yes another post apocalyptic game how exciting and original maybe they will make a far cry post apocalyptic game that will come out a month earlier cant wait looks like a cross between mad max and the hills have eyes for anyone wondering the song featured in this trailer is aint it funny by danny brown stop having other things in life to do besides elder scrolls in case someone needs to know the song its aint it funny by danny brown you can thank me later thats nice but does it have a plot that builds on the original game or is it just a slaughterfest ah the violence the beautiful violence the fuck is this retarded beastie boys music fucking discussing looks fun however i think they will deceive us again and it will be super linear like the first danny brownnow you got my attention game im a big rage1 fanso much that i had a copy for my x360 and ps3 and i still play rage1 via backwards compat on the xoim more than excited for rage2this trailer is awesomebdw if anyone still wants 2 play rage1 coop missions with me my gamertag is darthnexus27 on xboxonei cant find anyone 2 play with in the lobby anymoresucksany rage1 fans out there so far cry new dawn is releasing before this i can already see people calling rage 2 a ripoff im pretty sure the building is a reference to newvegas well springs instead of good springs bordermax with wingsticks d d d d so you made the rails longer and called it open world we shall see not trusting bethesda anytime soon 76 looked good too refraining from being too critical im not sure about the style this looks like a mix between bulletstorm sunshine overdrive and cod while the original rage had a more gritty feel will just have to wait and see i guess also preorder bonuses ugh works 1000 times better with danny brown i went through the first part very much looking forward to the second i really like the game its just a pity that my old pc wont pull it i like your games very much and i love you if fallout smoked dust this would be the result looks cool just hope it doesnt try to be too comical looking good just one little problem bethesda made itbut i am looking forward to this game but i am no longer going to preorder games cool just dont release it on bethesdanet please must buy remember this is id not shitworks bethesda are you offering a canvas bag with purchase damn this trailer has style amigos meh whats with all the fast cutscenes hiding that it may be boring ok bethesda this is your chance to retake my faith in you dont fuck it up they really did use dannys song it would have been a good game but its too cartoonish and the music sucks this game better not be as much of a let down as 76 hope its better than the first one it showed so much promise yet failed to deliver probably be a buggy mess well that does not make up for 76 but looks good my ears are bleeding from what ever that sound was any chance youll be launching on steam remember how bad rage 1 was remember how bad fallout 76 was yeah you aint see nothing yet this game will behead your family members uhrage 76 hope not cant fuckin wait it looks good but with all that is happened i wont be getting it it will no doubt be unfinished and buggy as hell why are all you pc gamers supporting steam ive despised it ever since it first came out it killed the single player offline industry and yes im a pc gamer as well the music makes the trailer more hilarious than something that gets you pumped for an action game please be on steam please be on steam please be on steam please be on steam this is friggin bad azz where is blake griffin all he wanted to be was in rage whats the song ooooh i really hope theres tons of microtranasactions please play in gamestation 3 uhhhthis doesnt look like rage at all if only fallout 76 had a fraction of the content this appears to have fallout oblivionvault 110 spike building new yorktwo sisters a lady with fire already interesting most excellent day for a release on my birthday hey nice thatll make a perfect bday present may 17th baby and may i just say that combat is lookin crispy af doom fallout may 14thits my mother birthday its an m rated game but they censored fucking not a huge deal just thought it was odd but will this game work fall out 76 is garba wait whats this bethesda a game that aucutally looks good why couldnt you do this with fall out 76 gotdammit hope its nothing like far cry 35 128 was that really a wilhelm scream jesus christ i hope that fuckawful rap shit music isnt in the game if so im staying well away from it now this is how you advertise a game country roads take me the opposite way of that game west virginia the more i see of this the more excited i get to play it cannot wait fix fallout 76 we no longer trust any of your games yes please no steam release omfg thats the new borderlands nice bethesda may 14th works out perfectly after fallout 76 now you try to sell this no thanx name of that song please i think it could do with a little less contrast and bloom but otherwise looks great so good can wait to play it d no steam no buy bethesda please put rage 2 to the steam if not i wont buy it doom plus mad max danny motherfucking brown ladies and gentlemen atrocity exhibition seems like far cry new dawn copied on this bad boy cant wait for the release damn i never played the first but ill definitely pick this one up it doesnt matter who made the game theyre all owned by zenimax aka the ones most likely responsible for the shitty customer practices you guys really think bgs cares about microtransactions or nyloncanvas bags i highly doubt it funny fallout 76 bombed and then this far cry and the new obsidian ip pops up to fill the voids this looks insane does it come with a new graphics card that was surprisingly good looks like it could be good but i aint getting hyped bethesdas track record is too shitty at this point lol 144 x04 gigawatt power armor is that you this looks amazing wait is this on the same map as the first one o thought it would be some place else i dont know looks nice but i dont get same vibe from original rage but that horrible music more like torture audio whats up with that is that a mistake also please stop trying to be fortnite is this game supposed to be for 1012 year olds do not fuck this up perfect use of aint it funny looks good no steam no buy you know what to do is it just me or am i seeing shared assets from both fallout 4 and 76 just dont fuck up like yall did with fallout 76 yeah the four peters nailing the soundtrack looks cool but will probably be as trash as 76 you are so going to fuck that game up what if borderlands but normal graphics fucking epic 3 3 3 mad max bulletstorm bioshock borderlands this love the graphics and gameplay but that horrible song i couldnt finish watching the trailer because of the tune or should i say horrible noise i guess i couldve muted the sound and pumped some journey vgv nice response to obsidian huh my brain cant handle all the action just wanna remind you how shit and scummy your company is good gameplay and great music allow a little dull the pain due to the lack of multiplayer the virgin mortal kombat trailer feat 21 savage the chad rage 2 trailer feat danny brown what the f is with this borderlands feel are there gazillion weapons too 1 for wilhelm scream way better than your online bullshit looks promising even though i liked the atmosphere of first rage this looks amazing will the npcs be in a free update or the paid season pass asking for a friend okay wow this looked way better than i was expected super psyched for this rage 1 was a good game imo lacked a proper ending was a bit too shortsmall but i thought it had better gunplay than borderlands and did a better job of making a believable postapoc world than fo4 or 76 just did im liking what im seeing in rage 2 amazing lets hope 60fps is the standard in ps4 pro nice psx graphics just give my opinion for strength and weak to foucs on developing for free good luck start with strength open world no rules can drive car full weapons demo in middle of fight like it entering inside bases clam top mount etc i like the rage ability work on 3 os weak point single player only you should work on online so more players join fight main character run or moving like old games need to be more realistic run slow need little speed abilities again copy from other games bring new ideas game characters you just copy lots of old characters like orc warhammer wow mad max bad boys halo nothing new no purpose to keep playing this game if you guys keep it single focus on storyline it should be remembered and add some drama the moment you see this and you remember that they just released fallout 76 this game most likely has the graphics gameplay crazy world and storytelling that f76 should have had far cry is copying you guys no steam no buy for me fantastic job on the editing and choice of music so violence and gore are in this trailer but they still censored the fucking hows about fixing some of your mistakes before venturing on to another accidental misnaming can happen to anyone the real title of this game is borderlands 3 is that cypress hill looks better than the new farcry but still very similar on behalf of all bethesda fans out there please please please dont fuck this up too but the development team deserves a nice slow clap for how awesome this looks half assed bullet storm and that was half assed so half ass cheek since you guys farted out the last fallout game im skipping this launch maybe when sales kick in is this an apology for fallout 76 having aint it funny playing in the background while some absolute batshit insane gameplay is playing is genius trailer sucks because of the haterap good job plus i get no sense of story or gameplay everything is so disconnected and cartooney like you are trying to sell borderlands not rage 2 rage 1 was boring i am glad they approach a new route it might be risky but at least they are not ubisoft no steam no party lol its my birthday then well i loved first rage game but this one seems to be like borderlands 2 which is ok yet id rather want it to be like rage one or even metro exodus fallout 4 reskin with vehicles best not be the same engine what comes after fallout 76 rage fortnite season 37 doom will have 3years and 1 day when this high game come out suitable alternate title america 2060 libertarian ultra free market wasteland very very excited rage 2 doom eternal quake champions my unholy trinity glad people are now realising how terrible bethesda games are cant believe people thought they ever made a good game i wasnt sure about this but it reminds me a lot of borderlands before gearbox ruined it i really hope the characters are good boh fallot 76 people remmember no preorder you get screwd wait for review first looks cool and stuff but my faith in bethesda is ruined so deeply because of fo76 myself being a fan since fallout 1 which i played hundreds of hours back in the days i will not preorder i will definatly not get a deluxe or anything special version and i will most definatly wait for a few months after the release before trying to buy another bethdumba game i wish the engine is the same as fallout 76 great song choice whats the song in the trailer danny brown as trailer music so sick the armour looks the same as doom guys needs more andrew wk youve certainly lost my trust but this doesnt look half bad on paper ill be waiting for a review first though i approve of danny brown as the music choice this is a great example of how song choice for a trailer can really make it better this was an amazing trailer looking forward to this is this because 76 didnt do so good seems they took the borderlands 2 rout looks great but definitely not pre ordering from bethesda for a while after the last monstrosity fo76 hopefully this one is as good as it looks anybody else hear the wilhelm scream hope this game actually has an ending the first rage game had great combat but the game just stopped lmao like they cut the last 3rd from the game still looking forward to it and tip for bethesda game studios we know you like money and like to save it but amazon has an engine that star citizen uses and looks spectacular but the most important thing for you to know is that it is free i know you probably dont understand that concept bfg powermy friends this looks like ghost recon wildlands borderlands mad max an upgraded version of fallout after ive taken 12 psychojet you guys got some competition on the colorful post apocalypse open world game with farcry put this on steam or i wont buy it excuse mebut uh what the fuck woah were going to wellspring again hell yeah the gameplay is awesome but the ost is pretty annoying my opinion no steam no money dear rage 2 please forgive me for not giving you the time of day before i was excited for you sure but now well youre an adult and im an adult and we should do adult things love everyone can you guys dont made starfield and skyrim 2 with creation engine for some reason i never finished rage one but god i loved it amazing trailer looks great wont buy because bethesda the publisher can go fuck itself when mad max meet saints row iv even the music is on point yup day first purchase here bethesda is in charge of it what basiclly means that i will have preorder beta access payed dlcs an overpriced costum store major bugs because to early released the combat reminds me of bulletstorm danny brown wooo so much better than that shite new mortal kombat trailer rage 2 looks like the love child of borderlands and doom remember playing the first one years ago its such a great game and im looking forward to this one as well im going to be poor on 2019 damn this game looks amazing i love the mix of borderlands fallout mad max doom wait guys what if this is the real fallout 76 while the other one was a social experiment right lol please ok well now im sold good job between this and obsidians new game coming out i choose obsidian bethesda has caught on too much shit for me to trust them il play the outer worlds before i try rage2 avalanche sweden should have worked on just cause 4 too do you have the materials to finish it this looks so good shame that if i have a technical issue with it my personal details might get leaked so no thanks progress booster good job definitely didnt alter gameplay in order to push the consumer to buy the special needs deluxe editions locking content behind special editions is one thing but including a progress booster its shadow of war all over again pure retardation its only going to push players to a wait a year for all the content to be put in one package at a discount or b torrent it finally a game that isnt tainted by sjw propaganda ssssssss i wasnt so sure about rage 2 when it was first announced but after this trailer i think i might give this game a try appreciate danny brown in the trailer the game looks fun but you couldnt possibly select worse music for this trailer why cant you use an actually good engine like this when it comes to fallout and elder scrolls holy fuckign shtit danny brown and mdma the video game steam or i will pass say no to bethesda launcher well what do we have here borderlands without cel shading the question is will the charaters be amazing like in borderlands or stupid like in rage 1 rage fallout so much money involved and wilhelms scream is still used does this game come with a nylon bag mad max assasins creed farcry fallout borderlands bioshock game which i dont remember rage 2 the frankengame there we go song is danny brown aint it funny borderlands 2 already got released and is most likely hundred times better than this i tend to despise open world games without car races chasing and stuff so maybe this might be it ooooooooh and they releasing doom eternal in the same year 128 tf2 scout scream xd i gave this video a like then promptly removed it when i heard the wilhelm scream sooooo are there only 4 guns i cant choose obsidian is making a game but bethesda to oh god someone help me choose this looks fantastic its a game on punk steroids lol would you please fucking stop requiring your shitty launcher for every goddamn game you make damn were getting this and outerworlds in the same year this games looks like it has been made by some hardtrip fella lol about time a good trailer for the game comes out balls to the wall doom 2016 meets mad max with lots of love for killing action and explosives nah i aint paying you lost the good will i love bethesda i bet this aint the creation kit engine no buy from me if it is only on bethesdas platform rage seems like a mixture of doom and beyond good and evil 2 song is annoying but the game looks great makes me want to replay the first game please dont fuck this up this game looks pretty good so i might buy it day 1 song please have to wait and see 76 trailer was way better graphics than theyll ever get the actual game to be and this trailer was like a thousand times better rage was my favorite game until i played fallout nv only on bethesda launcher nope whats the name of the music please i think the outer worlds and rage 2 are gonna blow me away in 2019 shut up and take my money this game looks amazingi am glad i played rage 1 back then most people dont even knows it existed in first place yet i still feel sorry becouse this game will be crushed under hells of borderlands 3at least with the sale numbers ifor myselfhate to compare games and also hate the ones who compare games with each otheri love rage 2 and borderlands 3 oh boy another installment that doesnt even resemble its predecessors can you make a game that takes place in a zombie apocalypse with the workshop like fallout4 one like equals one agree sorry that i keep re posting this but i love your games feels like we will be busy for a while before borderlands 3 comes i wanna kick like in bulletstorm on the low bethesda isnt the developer so its going to be awesome keep your little hands out of this one todd thats how you make a trailer that reflects the style of the game inb4 the fallout 76 comments begin looks real fucking good cant wait to play it somones trying to beat obsidians new game the outer space a little to brightfull and colorfull world but still beter then fallout 4 and 67 must buy for me postapo fanboy rage was a huge success hope this one is as good d assets of doom used in this one damn havent heard danny brown in a minute looks sick kind of reminds me of doom id software and avalanche studios are making a batshit crazy game and i love it i have mixed feelings about this maybe less borderlands more mad max vibe with a pinch of first rage will calm my heart of course now it matches current trends and maybe i have that irrational passion for those old good games aint is funny how it happens to turn out to be a nylon trash bag even though i am very tired of open worlds this one might be amazing if it would feature coop and ofc great gunplay still better call it doom fashion the anti climactic ending of the first one annoyed me but jesus this looks great and more importantly fun yesssssfinallybeen waiting for this for a while now fuck you bethesda im not a fan of first person games i have no idea what is going on and i love it wow bethesda this game is awesome cant wait for it downvoted for the music mortal kombat 11 pulled this shit too can we get music that actually fits the trailers is it online though oh i hope open world doenst have anythinh to do with softy survival yes please this game seems crazy and i already love it gonna have to be a wait and see on this one for me the use of idtech and involvement of id is a good thing the publishing by bethesda and involvement of avalanche a pretty blevel developer tbh is reason to be cautious friend are you gonna play this song while playing rage 2 me explosions and shooting in my head right now say what now aweful song chiose i must say but fun trailer either way this is looking better than doom kinda like if borderlands was more like mad max and a bit of fallout looks good this game looks so chaotic i liiiikeee it xd no matter what happens with fallout 76 we all know that bethesda makes cool games bethesda on a roll lately maybe ill be bored with fo76 by may 2019 this game looks sick shitty soundtrack makes this hard to watch good job guys im honestly excited for this one hopefully it has a better launch this time than the first one did looks pretty hype also looks like its time to build a new pc so many great looking games coming out next year coming during exam season feelsbad please explain to me why is this game so hyped i mean this looks like a better version of borderlands series looks good but youre going to get hate because of your ugly cousin bgs its probably not your fault but you know how these things go shrugs hopefully that thing in the beginning of this trailer isnt the only largeboss type creature one of my major gripes with the first one was a lack of boss creatures i sincerely appreciate this level of violence holy crap one thing i know for sure is id and avalanche know how to make good trailers looks freaking fun wouldve been cooler if you zoomed to a top view of the whole map and pointed an arrow at your tiny little character car blip or whatever to give it a sense of scale they lost me as a customer after releasing my personal information its going to suck to like fallout 76 is it coming to steam or not if its bethesda client exclusive then im out as your client has a history of malfunctioning and your definitely cannot be trusted with paymentprivacy the lack of regional pricing also hurts a fuck ton to a lot of us who are not from the us or euro currency zones wanna know how you can tell it wasnt made in the creation engine it has lighting heeey thats pretty good make fallout great again btch will it have a rave bomb the statue at 105 expresses how i feel about this game precisely shooting peeing enemies in the back looks like fun must buy d mortal kombat take notes this is how you mesh a song with your game properly this trailer is so dope trailer to test how long can you really stay mad at bethesda for f76 ill be so pissed if this game does not release playable in english in germany most bethesda games are fixed to german here why is id software becoming the best part of bethesda looks fantastic looking forward to see how the multiplayer pans out from the original creators of fallout lol open world lots of boom boom to mr transfromers dudes wet dream screw bethesda for running fo to shit w their crap online cash grab if bethesda for the games a single player is the best this game looks amazing better in xbox like if borderlands didnt have a comicbook art style will it be on steam i want to preorder rage 2 on steam remember real pcmasterrace dont preorder the game looks amazing bethesda needs a win badly after the last disasters no thanks i will stay away anything bethesda related for a while thats what i wanted from rage and now i will finally get it i just hope they release this one on steam and not just on there platform can you imagine this game with fallout lore this wouldve made an awesome fallout game and these are all raiders i think bethesda should stop making game and just publish game only cant fucking w8 those who smoke weed will definitely enjoy it cool to hear danny brown looks good but if the looting system isnt similar to borderlands i am pretty sure i wont be motivated for very long borderlands has had so much influence on the industry so its the mad max game with superpowers and through the id lens this doom trailer is weird the combat really does look like the first one but with movement and combat abilities as well as the healy ones and the style is actually not much more wacky if u remember right at least bethesda still publishes good games when that new doom too fallout 76 is so bad but this game may save those lost souls who lost hope you see in in preorder bonuses progress booster that will another game with throttled xp gain and full of microtransactions sad reality of gaming 100s of turd brown games come out every year gamers this is normal more than one game with the colour pink in it comes out gamers whats up with this weird trend lol see this netherrealmstudios this is how you choose music for your trailer fuckin terrible marketing for this gamecertainly put me off the game for a while talk about try hard one of the best made trailers ive ever seen game looks great cant wait does anyone know the song this is where the just cause 4 and fallout 76 budget went is it gonna be a broken half assed release again fallout 76 with tes vi is big different systemengineand more so dont hate bethesda just hate farking feelout 76 since the first trailer ive thought itll be a lot closer to rage 1 than a lot of people seem to think why is the fov still so bloody narrow good grief man will there be nukes omg looks incredible if it is on steam i am happy i think another bethesda launcher only game is going to hurt as fallout 76 has already made people think that it is too unsafe im a bit surprised there arent more comments mentioning danny brown is somebody german and play xbox hey outer world by obsidian just got announced looks more like bullet storm 2 but shit im not complaining dont fuck this one up it looks sick as hell look at those comments who doesnt know the difference between a developer and a publisher is the game going to come with loads of false advertising greedy business tactics and a shitty engine you got a link to that song not sure what was better the song or the trailer i loved the first one so much this one looks good too is that cypress hill looking forward to all the games im not going to pay for after fallout 76 not gonna lie i like this trailer not because of bethesda basically bioshock set in the mad max wasteland with a cypress hill soundtrack you gotta be insane in the brain not to like it you could have used the time for a game people wanted no hah the wilhelm scream just after 127 p love me some danny brown just letting yall know the song is called aint it funny by danny brown now this looks like a fun game to play nice song by mc peepants good bye borderlands 3 couldve teased something but rage already got my attention listen this games is published by bethesda softworks and made by id and avalanche studios bethesda game studios who made fallout 76 have nothing to do with this bethesda softworks also publish bethesda games studios are we clear now if borderlands and fallout had a kid but will the same enemies spawn back after 5 minutes you leave the area this is basically the cancer of all open world games hope this one will be different this game looks like a blast just good old fashioned fun about time developers started making games fun again so eso gets mass dislikes when eso did nothing wrong but this ones fine ya damn hypocrites this looks fun i like it so much but ill remain cautious oh boyo does this game look fantastic no i just need a rig that can handle it this is super game the vehicle combat and variety has me pretty excited not falling for anything wont look this good at release itll be like most openworlds and be kinda empty between points generic quests etc looks funny and i love the art style though good one id software also fuck you bethesda for 76 holy heck the music 115 fury road this trailer lowered my expectations it looks arcadey and i love it it saddens me that so few people are talking about this game rage x doom x borderlands x mad max x fallout looks amazing looks good sounds terrible no thanks outer worlds will be it danny brown in a big video game trailer yeeesssssss this 1 looks promising i have no idea what is happening in this game but i love it hype is real upload this in 4k please basically looks like if ubisoft made a saints row game game is nice but the music could be better though this shit looks dope whats that song its fn awesome this game looks like some good care free killing with lots of tools to do so with im in will this one also include false advertising and doxxing your customers no steam version no buy from me not after my experience with fallout 76 yes those dreaded words the outer worlds looks more interesting i still play the first one weird futuristic mad max new fat cry or this so beautiful so many cry babies in chat spewing hate because they dont understand the difference between publishers and developers youre idiots and i hope you arent old enough to vote on actually important things i have hope for this cause i trust id hey look npcs in a shooter whod have thunk it wow danny brown in a game trailer he has made it after 76 and jc4 i am really keeping my fingers crossed i like that they have a statue of the main character from the 1st rage in wellspring hopefully panic button is bringing this to nintendo switch was anyone else really disappointed with the first rage i found it just terrible and boring and extremely short i really hope this one is better fingers crossed the song sucks i wait for the elder scrolls 6 who tf would pre order after 76 wait dont answer that this is the kind of game youd get if you put mad max borderlands doom in a blender with 5 pounds of cocaine i feel like this is going to be the game we all didnt know we wanted country roadstake me ho wait this game actually looks good that moment your comment gets more likes than the release date shit graphic hurt my eyes wtf fuking full of camouflaged props and shit at least bgs didnt dev it i liked the atmosphere and gameplay of the first rage but the length of the game and the lackluster conclusion to the story was extremely disappointing so while this looks amazing i cant help but feel some apprehensions about it hopefully itll make up for the shortcomings of the first game and continue the trend of amazing gameplay im still not convinced bethesda absolutely nothing like the original first rage and barely resembles it looking pretty poor and shit looks like a completely different game to rage youve gone punky and colorful with this was the first one like this no so why turn rage into garbage looks great watch the farcry new dawn trailer after this and it will put you right to sleep i should be able to upgrade my pc befor this is out please please please add stealth to the game cuz im a stealth gamer i hope this game has multiplayer like borderlands getting doom vibes from this game and im not complaining i was kinda hoping they would have another andrew wk song for this trailer but it still works im so hyped for this and it comes out 2 weeks before my birthday its gonna be a long wait wellsprings and is that tv show returning thats rad not on steam you guys are fucking up again if so hey i want my high quality canvas bag with proper stitching you dinguses thought this was borderlands at first broke my heart when i realized it wasnt im just having fun looking through all the comments complaining about bethesda ruining this upcoming game because they didnt like fallout 76 when little did they know that bethesda did not create this game they only published it well see i never finished rage 1 and fallout 76 bgss turd made me fully skeptical of bethesda now where i wasnt before hopefully you guys made pc optimization and high frame rates a priority far cry new dawn looks amazing nope not picking it up after the fallout 76 bs u guys did can i just live in this world god im so pumped for this game for a sec i thought it was titsnfall i canvas bags are included in this one refund me for fallout 76 you fucks bulletstorm in crossout danny brown amazing song choice look better with every new traileryour move borderlands this is one hell of a step up from the first game it actually has personality meanwhile at every other bethesda studio it comes out the day after i get out of college should have showed starfield to calm people down from the fallout 76 glitch train this is why they couldnt afford the canvas rage pulling a borderlands 2 rn cant wait for them to make a battle royale mode out of this and manage to fuck up twice in a row yall love borderlands over at bethesda huh lmao dont get copyrighted now i would be excited but obsidian had made this entire company irrelevant a few hours ago bye bye bethesda you wont be missed whats the song name outer worlds and rage 2 are here to save us from the mess that is 76 so many people dont know the difference between bethesda softworks and bethesda game studios this is not made by the same people as fallout 76 whats the trailer song bethesda bans people from playing games they dropped 60 on for saying mean things so i dont buy bethesdas games anymore even if it was fallout 76 and it was probably doing them a favor its the principal i hope there are alot of guns and not just 10 like the old one this better be on steam this is the engine fallout 76 should have used definitely looks better dont watch this with a hangover the outer world todd pete hines hiding in closet lol no show in tga 2018 now this is a good songtrailer matchup this and far cry new dawn look awesome why all those peasants compere id software game to shitty borderlands rage 1 was long time in development before cartoonlands game looks great the music in this is bad though i wasnt really sold on it at e3 but it looks like its getting better lets fix fallout 76 first its like a sequel to borderlands and thats not a bad thing id never fucks up this game will be amazing my favorite moment in this is at 025 when he takes the elevator and the musci just stops only for it to start after shotgunning the guy at the top xd now we know what all the fallout 76 guys were working on good lord the music is horrific what the fuck couldnt even make it through the trailer not interested in a game that has a soundtrack like a troll with an air horn blasting my fucking ears the song name i hope you guys know that bugthesda isnt making this there is a studio called id software making this this trailer has a very fortnite feel to it the humor and style i mean for the trailer im still super excited for this its just something i noticed with a lot of new games and how things are changing to a more humor focus with the violence than dead serious gaming its a nice change of pace lol i forgot about this game im sad walmart ruined the hype factor this game looks amazing id danny brown fits this trailer perfectly amazing twisted metal doom and mad max all in one the vehicle gameplay is like twisted metal 143 best the moment of trailer bitch let the ewok touch you 106 thats nicholas raine the protagonist of first rage yooooo they got danny brown for the music thats amazing lmao cant wait for ghosts of tsushima the real explanation to everything fallout 76 news steam release or gtfo lets hope you get this game right all this game needs now is handsome jack to be just like borderlands thanks id software and avalanche studios for this wonderful game omg that song choice like nails on a chalkboard well anyway its not a game i would buy at release by a long shot but im looking forward to playing it maybe in a couple years when i can bag it for 10 bucks you can trust bethesda i love the music selection for the trailer anyone know the name of it dude its danny brown i love this soundtrack bethesda i love you its coming out on my birthday hyped i cant wait ready to rage this looks like a mixture of multiple styles and games any parents looking to give a family friendly gift to the youth look no further this looks epic did bethesda hire the entire team of cirque du soleil because their games are becoming more and more like a fkn clown show with each new release obsidians the outer world trailer was dropped today too im sorry bethesda but yall are holding the biggest l of 2018 oh bethesda whats with the neonapocalypse theme far cry new dawn has a similar color scheme no offroad driving wtf so much better than the fcnd trailer cant wait for the plastic collectors edition boomerang that will turn to cardboard due to limited materials seems like such a big change up energy wise from the first game i like it i cant help but think of crysis so this is just doom just cause mad max fallout right you better no 76 this one not hyped 2019 will dry the shit out of my wallet insane action i watched this on 05 speed fallout 76 update is looking good i feel like this is just borderlands mixed with sunset overdrive with a hint of mad max please look better visually than just cause 4 this is awesome aka the worlds most unexpected sequel is the game actually finished obsidian has already beat this game with the outer worlds yall shouldve just let them make a nv2 so how long until its 50 off dont hate on the game because of 76 this game was actually made by good developers but just published by bethesda woah bethesda are you saying that in the deluxe edition we get the classic doom bfg 9000 please take my money now oh shit not mutant bash tv i had a terrible time playing that part in rage and then it was in the main storylinebeerk could do without forced arena in an open world game i dont know if its just me but after watching the outer worlds trailer it made this feel bad terrible even rage 2 looks alright might be fun but i just cannot get exited about this after seeing outer worlds danny fucking brown go away bethesda you are worthless especially since the trailer for the outer worlds just got released this looks 100x better then farcry 6 it looks like borderlands and mad max furiously fucked and this is the baby is this available for pc how about you check out the trailer for outer worlds instead bethesda has to earn our trust back before we support anything from them lol this looks awful you should sue ubisoft welp i do like me some mad max vehicles with this and farcry new dawn im gonna have quite the post apocaliptic adventure i hope bethesda is not going to be assholes for this game so proud of the team on this one looks amazing pretty sure u shouldnt realise this since you are literally being killed season pass or dlc free can we have more doom eternal trailers well ive learned my lesson with bethesda and 76 which means i wont be buying this game until i know they respect their customers again which all should agree rage 2 will kickass i know doom eternal would be better than rage 2 something that will safe bethesda no more forget it bugthesda you can make a game run smoothly like that but for fallout skyrim keep the shitty engine no more does this mean elder scrolls isnt coming out ever aint it funny how it happens lol so edgy is it a free world game i see post apocalypse is the theme for 2019 far cry new dawn outer worlds this man nuka world looks a lot different than i imagined mad max and borderlands love child i like it im getting this and doom eternal both on ps4 next year this can be really good youtube content is it online my wifi cut out as they started to show this well i dont give a shit about the moron people think this game is suck or not interested im gonna buy this game fianlly a real game and not some half ass lame excuse of a game rage 2 gonna be awesome hopefully doom eternal comes out in 2019 take my money like for bethesda looks like mad max if mad max is a cocaine addict is this mc chris its literally just borderlands and im okay with that ill play this until borderlands 3 comes out trash awesome rage was great i can still play that game and have an great time well i swear i was soft a minute ago looks like farcryubisoft is trying to copy you guys with this trash i just went from six o clock to midnight getting hyped danny brown now i just want them to use atrocity exhibition for the soundtrack highkey this is it chief im more excited about mk11 lmao game awards literally just started this trailer the name says it all looks alright but i want to see some more before i think its worth buying what a terrible choice of song bring back andrew wk you better not make elder scroll 6 shit after far cry fallout edition fucking hell fine ill buy this too along with far cry 76 and outer worlds its gonna be a raging good gameim too corny someone is gonna somehow slip fallout 76 into the comment section a bethesda before you do anything how about you fix fallout 76 then you can do a new game wheres the nylon bag edition at this is game is what would happen if inside out took place in my mind important suscribed to pewdiepie where is my doom not buying this since u guys fucked up with 76 damn i like these fallout 76 graphics like if youre from the video game awards knowing bethesda they will mess it up fuck your mom i finally did it switch ive been looking forward to this jesus im earlier than you first first am

objectsd bethesda softworks i love this whole game i mean seriously this game is whole next level about techs and upgrades i just want to ask you about one thing that dash ability in your prebeta gameplay its little bit different than original game but i like this pre beta gameplay dash ability 344 440 455 516 first i thought it need upgrade to dash like this in your gameplay so now i upgraded this to its complete level but still no dash like yours i love pre beta version of dashthat sound during dash is also nice please in next update of your game do this changes that halo needler 550 and the shitty driving made it to the release versionagainlike rage 1 seriously what is up with driving and your games id hey bethesda great game but how do i take raines armor off is it even possible to change back or is that in a later update or not at all damn it looks almost as good as crysis 1 how far weve come lol who even are you forgot that this game is coming out looks like ill be needing to finish playing through the first game this weekend lol 220 oh cool detroit smash i didnt know that this was a my hero academia game to all the peeps who preordered dont forget you get the hes on fire cheat for free cant wait for this game i dont like the numbers like the hit score and also the colorful sparkles in the target hit it looks like hack and slash games this is a kind of game that i dont play and im away from they see him shoot at him at 844 and drive off right next to their base wut looks damn amazing though failsafe is that you ai totaly retarded wait so is there gonna be a hud played the first one loved it this one looks great but i hope bethesda doesnt fuck it up those grav powers look like a ton of fun to mess with why is it being played at medium settings motion blur settings fov slider these are necessary for console motherfucking game is is crazy iam soo fuckin hot to play rage 2 damn looks like console gameplay and graphics but hey gameplay should be more important vanilla fps with quirky physics and abilities which will be fun for approxamitely 20 minutes it seemed more like bulletstorm than rage tho pay 40 euro for this singleplay yeah ofcourse youll have fun killing the enemies in different ways but not 40 euro fun no coop just walk n shoot alright not sure what yall are seeing but from the footage ive seen it aint anything special unless im missing something that makes it worth it i hope this has an open world multiplayer similar to gta 5 that would be dope it doesnt even need a battle royal mode cool but i need another doom game are the enemies using nerf bullets or is the person playing rated the best player in the world as much as i like the whole single player genre i now have a friend i always play with on xbox and just wish you could slap co op into this game because it looks so damn great to me and my friend too we arent buying unfortunately because no co op i just hope this looks that good at launch and they dont nerf the quality ive seen them talk about how rage 2 will have community content so far as anyone is aware have they confirmed whether its gonna be one of those always online games anyone knows if there will be a day and night cycle a firstperson view in vehicles i cant wait until this and cyberpunk comes out alreadypaid nothing better than rage2 to wait cyberpunk2077 this game looks like a ton of fun i guess its the same guy who played doom ethernal slayer reveal take my money please this game is like mix of fallout borderlands looks awesome reminds me a bit of mad max and please dont make mick gordon do the music i want tunes not noise almost nobody will agree but i would prefer rage 2 with megatextures that seems similar to the whatsitcalled in the halo games 547 that draw distance is atrocious id say i hope it will be better in the release but thats unlikely this game looks like a ton of fun to get into rage 1 was dope this looks even better cannot wait its like mad max i hope there is or will be a first person driving i cant wait to get my hands on this masterpiece and remove that goddamn depth of field hi crysis can i copy your homework sure laughing and giggling and waving my wallet at the monitor hell yes so was this pc gameplay or console gameplay lame its the same thing as the first game also borderlands and rage are both the exact same game im not playin this crap again ps4 has no original stuff they have to make sequels because they are unable to think of any new exclusive ideas and its just pathetic ps3 was the last greatest evolutionary thing in gaming and i will never get a ps4 its like prophet from crysis got all hopped up on goofballs and did several lines of borderlands im there borderlands 3 just reminded me that i cant wait for this game 2k can suck it anyway greedy douchebags this and doom are the only shooters im buying looks amazing nice looking borderlands there damn this looks fun had a blast playing it at e3 would love to play beta it looks fun so i preordered just like first game hope endgame boss will be there this time am i the only one who thinks that this game looks too easy ahhh fuck take my money uhhhhhhhhh was he game is out rage 2 omg its out damn this looks amazing i was sold with the blackhole grenades this this is mirage voice i cant get bamboozled the combat looks amazing but they need to have physics on the objects in the world it doesnt make sense that bodies explode but a little barrel stays put this looks to much like fc new dawn the whole pinkwhite theme is to familiar to me the setting is very different though but just the whole theme is basically modern fc why is this trans singer pink on the cover if doom had a sense of humour well at the very first sight my jaw dropped i was like yeah thats the game ive been waiting for i doubt anyone here remembers the original rage gameplay of notreleased game 70 fps gameplay of released game 23 fps for me i do not preorder your game since f76 i would wait for it lower price the game seems to work for the solo its already isnt that failsafe from destiny at the beginning when he goes thru the door wow looks like every other shooter i like iti like this type of shooters i cant believe im late on this but this game looks bad ass i cant wait to play this and doom i think that i will wait for cyberpunk 2077 edit i preordered rage 2 on steam reminds me of bulletstorm trust me dont preorder it or prepurchase it look what happen to fallout 76 this is not the rage i know finally a game that is not a fucking battle royale shit whys everything so blurry the gameplay looks awesome though i just came twice and only 130 in giving sticky keys a whole new meaning when is the rage2 release date it looks like a lot of assets were recycled from doom i loved rage 1 and i was worried you guys would ruin this game but you did it just cant wait to explore another boring dead repetitive open world they somehow made rage which wasnt even that unique to begin with into an even more generic and boring game plus i hope to hell that isnt the actual voice acting and that terrible depth of field better be optional this game would be perfect if it had coop like the borderlands series openworld reskinned doom with more physics weapons this is exactly what i think we all wanted kinda reminds me of bulletstorm nd it was a great game thank you for single player games game looks great but seems like a try hard on easy difficulty omg 2 studio that made mad max and doom thats why the view like in mad max and combat shooting like doom so much i cant wait for this game haha d d omg this one make me want madmax 2 same studio same engine game smooth as fk d what the fuck is wrong with bethesda turning every game into fucking doom first wolfenstein and now rage prepare for dishonored too fuck this shit so a sequel no one asked for to a game no one cared for that looks like a mix between bullet storm and borderlands but with a map that has as much content as the one in fallout 76 yeahhhhh thats worth 60dollars its on steam day one buy for me thank you i am so happy this is doom but gay the entire motion of the character is similar with the that of doom bethesda im super happy that you put rage 2 doom eternal and others on steam good move but do i need to create an account and play through your launcher cause i dont want that i can see downgrades looks incredible is this running on the idtech engine that face palm tho 445 game just looks boring like smashing shit will run its course super fast and this looks like 0 effort and 0 challenge i was so hyped for this to be like the first game and its just a mish mash of other games and looks super rushed i think ill pass this pre order i have 0 faith in bathesda after what they did to me with fallout 76 and all these shit skyrim reboots instead of a new elder scrolls the company just hates its fans goodbye my old saviour you used to be a company i could rely on to make really good games i could pre order with full faith now you are just a lie and a memory from my teen years this looks good i hope its actually good too good to be true dude this is sick d i hope there will be more than just a mix of farcrylike outpost cleanup borderlandslike combat style and map design and crysislike upgrade system combat seems total biased npcs are poor rugdolls tumbling around waiting to be shredded by overpowered weapons and melee powers it looks like the only challenge will be being outnumbered and bosses fuing boring guys looks cool though bethesda cant have made this the game actually looks good it just looks like doom and mad max it doesnt remind me of the first rage at all next thing youll know its going to be an epic store exclusive i cant wait for this game single player looks amazing i hope the multiplayer is kinda like dooms multiplayer i wanna play with my friend on this game is this going to be online to or like coop borderlands vibes increase literally no one i wonder what would happen if the dragonborn got trapped in a shotgun bethesda hold my beer 115 rage 2 directed by michael bay let me guess loooooot right ugh why i dont trust these lights hope the final result will look like this cant wait to play it im impressed i dont know how far down the campaign this is but it looks like the difficulty needs to be maxed out for me anyway i wanna be squeezing my pad with sweating hands when im invading these bases looks a bit casual at the minute so beautiful and dynamic though i cant wait to play it ive only been waiting 8 years edit i posted this before the mech fight at the end sheeeeeiiit after seeing just cause 4 i dont think this game will look anywhere near this good i wish this had battle royal mode omg wtf the doom slayer is doing in the wasteland ok im convinced whats with the no hud thing it annoys me turn on the god damn hud its more immersive with hud than without hud alright i like the style of this game the first rage was decent but i wanted more like the last authority area it had a cool mad max similarity though i dont know why the ammo crate asset is practically being reused here and for the same purpose it looks like why no plans to bring to switch i know this game has a new engine but i just was told doom eternal uses a new engine too well at least it will see a switch release thank god for that and thank the parties involved im not gonna boycott or anything but ive never dealt with micro transactions because ive never seen fit to deal with any consolemakers online service yet id love to have my mind changed you better not have me start the game with a fucking pistol again i actually wanna have fun this time the original rage was boring looks good was excited until bethesda store only ill probably pick it up if it ever comes to steam i 100d mad max and rage 1 recently so its pretty disappointed if ill miss out edit hype its on steam now instant pre purchased deluxe edition i gotta get me a boat bitches love boats best dialogue thus far looks like cod on acid but this is million times better hahagetting this one am i crazy or is this just mad max remixed for 2019 this traducer spanish the game finish stormtrooper npc shoots from 2 meter yet cannot shoot the target op as hell this shit looks amazing and a new doom game give me this and splitcsreen open world and im sold this is a weird fallout game ready to play the manta can finally fly finally a good bethesa game i have been sitting here watching this demo just giggling my ass off some of these kills are hilarious the same engine that doom good to hear failsafe is still an ai the shooter genre is so oversaturated pls bethesda allow players to customize their armorcharacter hmmm this isnt rage all they did was call it rage 2 to try and score some money from fans lets face it this might be a cool game but this isnt rage 2 this is nothing like rage so why call it rage 2 looks like a better defience i feel like you have to many powers tho if you can just rotate through them why do you have a gun the ai doesnt seem to challenging aswell this character needs glasses so youre telling me the fallout 76 bethesda made this get out of here oh look an actual video game okay 1 shooting and fighting and driving and flying and big world top notch 2 but then what do we know about the story 3 how does your role you play feel in this world how does this world feel is their any lore 4 are there any places with people actually being you know people 5 im getting a sense of being overpowered every time they show gameplay footage of rage 2 i know they want to show al the good stuff abilities and dying in a gameplay video ruins it a little bit but anyone else that feels like this game is going to be fairly easy very good quality the good it looks beautiful but thats a doubleedged sword since i know at least my rig wont be able to make it look nearly as good weapons look really cool the bad the enemy variety looks really dull this is definitely where borderlands has the competition beat they not only had a lot of visually distinct enemy types but they also often required you to play around their gimmicks to beat them the voice acting makes me just think it wants to be borderlands but is too afraid to go that weird looks decent but the graphics are aimed straight at console plus they made the game look as good as possible using as many weapon variants and have preplanned the play through to look as good as possible that being said the weaponry is inventive ragdolls look fun dismemberment is a bonus as well as gibs few slow mo kills wouldnt go amiss i pre order the collectors editon can we expect a free demo i honestly dont care if this game is on steam or not if its good then ill get it cause i respect id software reminds me of bulletstorm i loved that game hopefully its as good as the first one no ones gonna talk about how the driveing and layout looks exactly like mad max the game looks pretty sweet and creative the gameplay is a bit too fast for me i like to enjoy the surroundings and check details cool this is the only yearly access game footage that but a smile on my face and i will be bouncing in anticipation for the release seriously that was boring that ark was brimming with tech bullcrap it literally only had a ground pound upgrade acting like ground pound is something brand new ugh do brink 2 instead id rather see that or how about elder scrolls 6 single player only tho none of that online only nonesense 442 yeah youre a tough one arent youbye looks like they got someone who knew how to play games that boss fight with the robot looked pretty cool and dynamic that flying thing is so ut2004 too fast just another over the top colorful gory game i like rage 1 but this no rage 1 was alot more realistic an did not need a bunch of color it was creepy scary bizarre odd just hope more games can be more like fallout games and rage 1 i hope gta 6 does not turn into blood gore and over the top speed and color then again they already have with the new races sad seeing all these people like hyer speed where are the people who want to explore and takes thing slow id like to challenge any gaming company to make a game realistic speed runningwalkingdriving and colorful but no over the top and no weapons at all no fights no violence just a social online game where its about being the best racer and also the best creator of or making racers look good in there clothes and make the cars looks nice and people could create the tracks atvcarsbikes something realistic and fun looking and make the vehicles move like gta5 so its no difficult like some of the more realstic ra i cant wait i want this game noooooowwww take my money now please this game is looking so polished cant wait looks really cool damn this game looks fucking cool cant wait to play it outposts outposts and more outposts gee what fun i think anyone who played the first game will agree they destroyed the rage universe bethesda is going downhill fast if i learned anything from this video it is to aim for the ass so people knew an asteroid was coming they had enough time to build ultra high tech arks to save a portion of humanities best killing machines ie you they also threw in ultra high tech weapons and weapon mods as seen inside the ark and subsequently looted by the player and given all these facts and time involved we are lead to believe mankind could not have built a device large enough to either blow up the incoming asteroid that laid waste to the earth andor effect its trajectory so as to avoid a collision with earth makes sense a very coherent and believable story its kind of like real life really why be bothered with actually making sense or caring about anything or saving humanity when you can just kill people and blow shit up i am very optimistic about our future as a species does anybody else get a doom vibe from this really digging it very well bethesda you may have my currency what is up with this depth of field effect it is completely overdone this is just another prerendered piece of crap is this the actual game play where is the hud i hate when its so fast please make it normal speed nothing special feeks like you get access for a tech demo where you can try out cool guns and interesting physics to eliminate dumb ai enemies meh not for me too boring mindless nonchallenging shooting omg its like borderland on a different level lol this game looks like a lot of fun bit sad its bot idtech new engine shut up and take my money looks like more of the same first person bullshit will sombody introduce these guys to creativity that the dream cast games had smh meh i am not a rage gu shows the new features i need this looks freakin great the game looks pretty great so far ill be keeping an eye on this one pls dont fuck this one up bethesda is rage frenzy comming back can it be playable on a i3 7100 8gb ram gtx 1050ti 4gb this game is like fallout and mad max on steroids do you agree with me bethesda is the apple for video games their products are not the greatest but people including myself by there games it looks like a copy of doom eternal except its humans instead of demons so stoked for this top ten characters who could defeat arthur morgan even with the lancaster repeater bloody i like it i hope not only punks enemys here and where stealth kill the people that are for whatever reason comparing this to 76 have a bottomless pit in their heads it looks great might try it out if this game goes well it just proves that bethesda can add vehicles in their games those popups of ground debris and tree lods at close range are very ugly and distracting i hope theyll fix it game looks beautiful and fun those ships that came in at 720 can we ride em i really do love the mechanics of your shooter games wolfenstein doom and hopefully now rage 2 too all is super smooth like butter looking forward the game for kiddoesanother one was really looking forward to this on steam this looks awesome im a pc gamer but i would like to play on an xbox 360 controller if possible by the nine see this player makes the game actually look fun i have just one concern about this game and its about the ai enemy and the variety of them the first rage was fun as hell i cant wait to get my hands on this this game should keep distracted from the wait time for cyberpunk is that a gauss rifle xd pre beta so its alpha then congratulation you got new shout now try it i love skyrim i love rage rage 2 put 2 of that together i might like it this is a wasteland why do devs show off games on pathetic mode even if the player knows what theyre doing it makes the game look like a fuckin joke you can show off all the same stuff on a proper difficulty unless you dont wanna scare spastics out of buying stunning looks like one of the most original shooters to come out in years cant wait no steam no buy this is just gorgeous and cyberpunk 2077 nervously smokes on the sidelines where the fuck is my wasted clan wheres the challenge a god vs peons gets boring reeeeeeeally quick here is a good idea how about you guys finish a game before you start making a new one but this game does look good tho the contrast is giving me brain cancer its not rage and looks a bit goofy but it plays like doom so ill buy it is this video sped up to play a faster fps loved the original rage cant wait for this one as well this games atmosphere and characters are just perfect 3 yep bought if id made mad max it would be like this the fxaa is hurting my eyes love it 012 cliffjumper is that you it looks very doomish cant wait looks like a mix between borderlands and far cry why is everything so blurry damn a lot better graphics than fallout 76 ai is basically unpresent from what i seenone of them really bother to try to shoot at you thank god we need more singleplayer like this why this generation of gamers wanna have multiplayer and battle royale we need more singleplayer i will buy if it looks at least as great as here fallout meets cyberpunk looks good is this still gamebryo this looks fun make sure the game is finish not like 76 idgi looks like it has nothing to do with rage 1 too many 1st person camera breaks this looks amazing awesome prerelease footage of a game that will be nothing like advertised you play as a autoroty thats sucks should reduce the colourful blur and borderline like appeal to the game at least make it optional was expecting more of the 1st one dna photorealistic like places with a touch of fallout but still it looks great expecting to see massive bosses intrigues and storyline a la ho4izon zerodawn and the 1st rage and amazing weapons good luck bethesda this looks like a mix between doom and mad max a bit more colorful maybe is it just me or is it awfully quiet yet amazing sexyyyyyyyyyy my insides are creamy bow why doesnt fallout have this style of graphicsgameplay bethesda games like doom and wolfenstein all look phenomenal sorry if i sound like a moron i dont play fallout but have genuinely wondered why that game looks like so bad in comparison to those and now this rage 2 this looks like funcant wait elder scrolls 3 morrowind remastered before i die please kinda disappointed it didnt stick to the gameplay style of the original now it just seems like a bulletstormborderlands rip off looks pretty great but they have got to get rid of that blur when you stomp its nauseating no steam no buy achievment and coop what is that shitty voice acting are you serious 034 my god all day to do that this game will be a fckin trash im sure of it this looks fucking incredible pray to go this is how the full release will be but better if only bethesdaepicetc other than steam has regional pricing a launcher is not my problem i just dont wanna pay in usd would i need to have played rage 1 to understand whats going on in this one or is it a separate story deff gonna get this regardless i hate the weapon sound effects very artificial cod like looks absolutely fucking stupid and utterly ridiculous i love it we need more games with guns and superpowers like destiny 2style gameplay this and the new doom are my most must have games right now i especially enjoy how their armor busts off nice touch any word on game length too much pretty pink purple and baby blue colors constantly assaulting the screen maybe this game should have been called rainbow warriors instead the lead character could be kaitlyn jenner unless you wanted to be male then it would be bruce jenner lmfao this propaganda is effective first one looks way better than this soo sad if its anything like the first game then we just saw him beat half the story the gameplay looks incredible 3 its a mixture of doom borderlands 2 and mad max i cant wait wtf destinydoomanthem realy lol nice gameplay dont preorder thank you id dont you want to fix and finish quake champions are you developing only beta and early access games this rage 2 is still prebeta and we could preorder qc is the same do you think we are only cash without brain where is john carmack please save us the combat is being developed by id so i think its fair of me to criticise why i think that combat doesnt work or at least shine as well here i think there are way too many pauses between combat scenarios because with doom you had these lock down arenas that lasted 1015 minutes and you felt like they didnt drag on or werent over too quickly but here in rage 2 it looks like the doom gunplay isnt used to its fullest you have little pockets of group of guys and then you ahve to do a but of walking then kill some guys then silence again what has bethesda done this time to frack up this title and grub a few dollars more please list below how many fools will simply ignore those things and still buy this game and encourage bethesda to do even more money grubbing to be honest this looks like a borderlands ripoff looks so good to be true these mechanics remind me of apex legends so much kinda looks like more doom outdoors hope the rpg elements are goo and dialogue looks great nice that a developer got someone that looks like theyve played a shooter more than once for their marketing videos the bugthesda launcher eats up a computers resourses just running in the background say no thanks to bugthesdas botnet will this come to steam later this feels like bulletstorm more than rage to me this is only one action consol gameplay what i ever saw this game looks like a combination of doom and mad max which isnt bad at all the only thing i was wondering if the bots dont shoot at all in prebeta version too bad i cant play like this they make it look so easy whos the dumbass playing jittering around like hes got ants in his pants like 90 of his movements are absolutely unnecessary and stupid the side to side stepfooting just makes you look adhd as fuck lol no more bethesda for me this looks like doom and borderlands mixed together wow bulletstorm clone anyone basically doom gameplay looks more smoothed out compared to the hands on gameplay at e3 the first rage was bad this looks right up there with it the combat looks boring and unrewarding the driving oh boy dont get me started on the driving them graphics pretty bad too mkay add in the unfinished nature of all bethesda games and the bug fest will be akin to early access titles bethesda been doing ea since day one looks great but are there any interesting characters voice acting dialogue in this game all i see here is a lifeless conversation so is this going to be singleplayer multiplayer or online far cry and rage im down bitches loves boats xd this better be 60 fps and look exactly the same as this gameplay bethesda this might be the last shot you got to redeem yourself after the big fails you have had in the past that was sexy af looks high quality even bethesdas overly critical fanbase is probably going to have trouble keeping their discontent in the spotlight if this game comes out with minimal glitches sure if it comes out perfect youll still have the regulars who say pessimistic things about how the game compares to doom fallout and borderlands but doom fallout and borderlands are all aaa bamf games and the usual critics will be out weighed by the people who compare it to those games with optimistic and happy comments something tells me this game is coming out smooth i dont think bethesda is going to release their very next game before its finished extra i just hope they continue to work the kinks out of fallout 76 as well because it has got mad potential i like it i like fallout 4 way better but 76 is good in different ways all of the people who talk the most shit about fallout 76 probably are still playing it dont listen to them especially rusty and colorfull aww man missed the betalooks freakin fun ai looks slow to react and unintelligent i hope thats corrected this game looks sick better than doom this game looks hella fun looks almost like what doom should have been brahm is that you welllooks flashyalot of actionbut stillgeneric enemy who acting like bulletespongeno satisfaction fallout 76 oh crap damn it rage2 wooh yeah woooooo oh i so cant wait till this explosion of insanity comes out im so pumped this reminds me of doom except without the challenging enemies is this game optimised well for ps4 doom or rage fail dude i am blown the fuck away finally something of quality fuck yea i didnt like rage so im on the fence about buying another cup coaster if you do to this like th did to fallout 76 then im absolutely out well borderlands 3 hasnt been announced or teases so this is a good replacement operatorperry looks cool and funny but do you really need to use so much pink and purple those colors makes the game less serious this doom is farcrying mad max feels of rage hopefully it doesnt crapfully end like the first one why is none talking about how similar this is to borderlands getting serious halo 1 on original xbox vibes from that pistol love it operatorperry brought me here 3 bois this is called gameplaygasm man this gameplay and editing is top notch is this multiplayer can this game be on steam sale for pc please i dont want to install bethesda launcher and yes i need steam cloud especially for open world games which is obviously gonna have some dlc or expansion what is with the getting into the car no animation or anything just sloppy slide edit to the 3rd person view also when you look down do you even have feet or is this the old float screen you can tell the amount of detail in the game by the small details like that someone whoever developed this game must have just been introduced to the glitch effects and heat distortion lol knowing bethesda even as a publisher this game will be released with problems the company in general is just tanked in quality take my money already bethesda this looks like if borderlands and mad max had a baby but they both died in a horrible car crash so then uncle doom had to raise it ive seen that exact hand model in dooms multiplayer so same go to this base clear it get something rinse and repeat every games is just a fast past shoot em up these days i feel like ive played this game 100 times that new metro game is wonderful atm slow paced and beautiful its doom meets farcry and it looks amazing and this was only pre beta stunned its if doom and wolfenstein had very passionate sex with blade runner i dont like how theres no hit markers maybe they should put like a vibration feedback or something like that to lets us know when we land a hit the combat looks seems to be mixture of doom and bulletstorm looks promising though i do hope they make the ai more of a challenge it looks better than the 1st rage hopefully its worth buying damn this looks like the first single player game id enjoy since halflife could we please stop making rocket launchers that feel more like throwing bottle rockets at bad guys as much as i wanna play this im on the no steam no buy band wagon dont want my pc cluttered with a million different launchers i would probably double dip if this came out on steam getting for ps4 this game looks beautiful guys nice gunplay so far i am looking forward to it as i have still faith in you but could you pls stahp with these preorder bonuses i mean progress booster rly wow this shit looks amazing the baddies look a bit too generic and weak but hopefully higher difficulties will solve that but damn i saw this randomly without any previous knowledge of these titles and i must say im fucking impressed by it would be even more awesome if it has multiplayer wrecking shit up with friends in that open world would be endless chaotic fun why does this look so good nah thanks sold to the man with the braids in his hair amazing far cry seriers nervously side smoking i would buy this game if this was any other studio then bethesda talk about action pack gameplay here folks looks damn good this a doom copy lol used to love your games but now i cant stand where this company is going and its not up bro this look nasty im going to preorder this they are showing so much gameplay they know they have something special wooow thats what i call a awsome gameplay video wooow hell yeah this is worth the money i just pre ordered this on xbox when any game bethesda releases is better than the one they make themselves reminds me of borderlands but without a cartoony theme for some reason the gameplay reminded me a lot of bulletstorm which now makes me sad that we never got a sequel bulletstorm was one underrated blast of a game cant wait to go to the options menu and disable those horrible depth of field motion blur and bloom effects this looks effing disgusting wow cant wait great everyones favorite game that hasnt come out yet so when is wolfenstien 3 coming why am i still banned the setting and tone of rage was incredible and yall literally just added bright colors and cranked it up to 11 im sold if its on steam has else anyone noticed how they significantly increased the players sprint speed since the e3 gameplay a lovely mixture of bulletstorm and borderlands love this game ok i dont get it how is posible the gameplay in this game is amazing and bethesda released fallout 76 the gap between both games not only in mechanics but also in technology is huge like years apart not months looks nice but i am not pre ordering after how scammed i feel with fallout 76 i dont trust in bethesda anymore movement speed is way to quick its like they made an open world doom with more colour i was hoping for slightly slower pace with more exploration over constant combat the graphics wow they are actually released a human being playing the game instead of a 80 year old attempting there first try at a videogame lol its a bulletstorm next part no multiplayer smh id much rather play this than anthem combat is actually satisfying so many people hating on rage 1 here i loved it personally from the graphics to the atmosphere the weapons and how u could change ammo was so cool but they gunplay was one of the best take my hat off to id for having still some of the most fun gunplay going around sure the story and how it was done wasnt groundbreaking or anything but still fun id still created a great world and had to be explored again i am so happy and cant wait for this game its at the top of the list as far as im concerned just not sure about all the pink colors and atmosphere yet like a full 80s throw back but we will see come on id i know u can do it again coop in this would have been pretty damn fun either way im lookin forward to playing this game to see more of rage 2 click httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi1dzotqldk just waiting for the downgrade dont get your hopes so high i only wanna see loosum hagar take my fucking money you guys pretty much ripped off projekt red way too much going on words cannot describe how excited i am for this game ive waited so long for a rage sequel and my wishes have finally become true i see the game bulletstorm in the game play so this is kind of like doom meets mad max meets borderlands i can dig that looks pretty cool will this have a multiplayer so i can murder everybody borderlands 2 without outlines its like a new doom bethesda your launcher takes up nearly half a gig of ram fuck off no one wants it put your games on steam or ill be pirating the absolute shit out of this game doom eternal so basically just borderlands but good holly shit looks cool damnnnn funnnnnnnn 547 the most satisfying gun sound i hope they wont change the original rage shooting feel the game had but this looks refreshing however this should hold off my borderlands 3 appetite for a little bit please dont release a single player game in beta seriously tho this game be looking like a movie gotta say after the shit show that was fallout 76 im extremely skeptical of this company ill admit this gameplay looks pretty nice but frankly ill only believe it once the game is out and others have played it this of topic but why the fuck did bethesda make fallout 76 so crap i want rage looks really fun to play i hope it has a better challenge tho it looks great those bloom distances are horrible definitely getting this as it looks like borderlands one of my favorite games but on steroids or something downgrades stinks of mad max is this a room it looks like it might be a half interesting game however after paying full price for what has been executed as nothing more than an overpriced early access for an error and bug ridden fallout 76 also considering that the huge immersion busting imbalances in ammunition crafting and the damage tables for firearms that bethesda cant seem to find the time to fix not did they even use anything close to readily available real world numbers for muzzle energy max effective ranges or velocities for example 556 ammo takes more resources to make per round than 50bmg and any weapon using the 50 bmg ammo is so nerfed that 308 is more powerful than a the 50 which has nearly 6x the muzzle energy and twice to three times the range how the hell does a 50 mg dish out less damage per round than a handmade firing 556 is it because its the same ammo used by the scary black gun that you have been gas lighted into believing is a powerful cartridge why are black powder weapons using epic been waiting for this for a long time now im off for some metro exodus in the meantime woop woop well god dayyymn those graphics this looks like someone threw the new doomguy on pandora and said have fun look this game looks amazing but dont even think to make cheat codes in the game or i will make you pay for wath you did in this cuple of moths now speaking seriusly on 25 may is my birthday and i wold like to play rage 2 but if the game is sooo bad if is on bethesta luncher if is so bad that it needs chet codes to complete the campain and is impossibol without them i gonna make sure that you really come in banckruptcy have a good day will this be a new fallout 76 thank god for id wouldnt want another 76 style game great job guys looks really fun thank you for not making this another battle royale game this game is going to be a masterpiece rage 1 was good but this one looks off the walls honestly dont like how they gave it the call of duty treatment i wish it was like the first rage just improved 430 fucking wow what even just happened rage 2 comes out on my bday im a pc gamer and im sorry but if you complain about what launcher your on your a huge fucking pussy this vide will be taken and used as the gameplay for a game you can download on ur phone in an instagram ad this looks excellent do i hear sam riegels voice i really do hope this game succeeds it looks so good so doom meats bordelands wicked good i hope you dont fck up everything again this game looks soo good and fun soo switch anyone definitely copping an playin on the channel man looks very good and it got that mad max vibe why all the downvotes the footage looks amazing imo incoming downgrade super soldier with 30 superhuman abilities walks casually through hundreds of naked guys with rusty antique guns with 0 effort thats how youre marketing it anyway trying to be borderlands 3 for sure the protagonist voice is cringe come on now is it really going to look like this are we pulling an ubisoft here please tell me that i can jump off that flying vehicle and do the slam this looks siiiiick would be a nice br game as well d you can start the hate comments below thx xd hello humans i will be live streaming rage 2 daily starting may 15th xanderpark on twitch looks like borderlands doom and mad max all combined still looks really cool though looks sweet some borderlands influence in there for sure this game moves faster and more fluid than doom you can jump that high as well fuck this is what i want in doom not that slow ass piece of shit we got back 2016doom eternal doesnt look like any much faster either same goes for the movements its still feel very limited and tied downwhy cant they just take quake champions movements speed and put into doom eternal that be a masterpiece to little partical effects raise that shit up with 2500 did thoes ship come out of happerspace im wondering if these outpost will become quickly boring like if they are in the same vein as far crys outpoststhough thinking about it far cry allowed the option for both stealth and run n gun but this only allows the latter so they might get even quicker boring why is the video so blurry it looks like a scaled up 720p video rage 1 was a classic great atmosphere and setting people need to get a grip with the prospect of new launchers we went through this same saga when bf3 origin came out and we all still here ffs this looks great this game better be on steam i bought doom and skyrim after pirating it because i felt bethesda deserved the money i aint buying it if it is bethesda launcher exclusive like failout 76 looks like teenagers will delightnot for me poor story the same stuff on repeat 100xspecial building unlocks special weaponsno purpose or sense of why interesting chromatic gfx and sounds oh my godness this is awesome i finished rage 1 3 times recorded it on yt and im ready for this well it already surpassed its predecessor this would make for some nice multiplayer igntoo much pink cg you just destroyed another franchise you just couldnt keep rage1 style right incredible graphics but not my kind of shooter game this guy just took out stilt city in what three minutes approx this game needs way more enemies not enemy types just way more enemies with the abilities and weapons just blowing away everything so the fights average out at 315 sec man you will just run through this game so waaaaay more enemies or this will be the shortest game ever that knife thingy reminds me of the predator disk from avp2 the game the monolith game the one that took place in lv1201 i thought crackdown just came out jk this is way better looks fucking great this game look badass seems like a bulletstormdoom clone these graphics give me hope for future bethesda games no steam no buy for those who are not buy the pc version thumbs up so bethesda can see i wish clockner did this gameplay it was quite great to be fair but with him behind it it could have been such a crazy way to showcase the game and its capabilities loved it anyway you got me i will buy it solo or multi its the same as borderland on cinematic you can hear the bullet casings hitting the ground small detail but pretty dope since im a guy who loves detail doom bulletstorm mad max rage 2 and im in becose i like all this games hope it lives up to its point unlike some other game i know hint hint this looks epic i hate black people looks really great 957 bethesda it looks cool will buy for sure but that progress booster scares me remember what happened with ubisoft and there 10 dollar xp booster this had such a lot of mad max fury road in it ok when is avalanche studios making mad max 2 i want bikes i want trucks i want i want that flying copter from that one movie and a alot more refinement at hand to hand combat career mode and and game completed mode so get to it guys till then ill rage 2 da max lets hope 2 is better than the first one 700 come on man i know you guys can do better this and far cry new dawn are the only games i want this year until e3 just release a good offline game that you guys are famous for and fire the people that came up with you monetization strategy on fallout76 asap are there any other shotguns besides that one this is the way i imagine borderlands 3 to behope so anywaybut with lots of claptrap and gun loot 636 is that john st john this is not rage at allits the aborted fetus that doom and borderlands had with a sjw dip on itill stick with rage 1no thanks borderlands and doom had a baby why does this say prealpha footage shouldnt you be in late beta by now 824 almost got run over there is the ai still retardartartarted looks good but feel bad that game will have a lot of bugs in the days after the launch if doom and borderlands had a baby new fallout is pretty good needs more dialogue however looks great too bad its not rage this gameplay looks tight wow just wow it is extremely rare that i watch the gameplay of a game start to finishit has to be something special and this really fucking is its absolutely beautiful guys im sold already got my custom made prop wingstick to throw at shit while playing release this on steam that flying contraption feels like the exact opposite of badass gunplayquite weightless and uninteresting i just realized theres no lootingsmh tone down the doom id this game is rage the first ground vehicle the players driving the driving feels exactly like how shitty it felt to drive the quad in rage 1 let avalanche do their thing like they did in mad max where the vehicles felt fucking grounded and good to drive not like theyre sliping on a flat sheet of ice just look at those 90 degree turns ffs i know id you like fantastic feeling game and gunplay that said just please make the story complement the gunplay and be awesome cof cofunlike rage 1 which felt so blandfalled short by the end game has no soul sorry i didnt like it it not like a fallout new vegas looks good but why are the enemies so aloof they seem very unaware of the player and unable to do any damageor is that just me textures look blurry unfinished lods popping in are horrible draw distance is really bad console pre beta i get it but i think if anything is to be learnt from the apex legends surprise release it is that you should not show off your game until its fucking perfect this looks really prebeta and is just going to dull the effect it has on release imo this kind of gameplay was something i was expecting and imagining in cyberpunk 2077 while it was presented behind back doors on e3 instead it was not i want to play this new rage2 so bad pretty fkn good so this game is basically going to be a walk in the park uhm will the enemies fight back in release version it would look cooler if they had keyboard and mouse movement very impressive lol this rage 2 or the next cod omg games suck anymore i started gaming 20 years ago went downhill this game looks sick reap off of bulletstorm u play for god or what press 2 button gameplay so fun why buy another one of these millenial i cant die games that pose no challenge i will pass couldnt find on steam oh well thanks anyway let us know if you change your mind cutscenes seem pointless they show you where you aregoing to be in the next few seconds bit of an immersion breaker for no reason you can have the voiceoverquest dialogue playing as you move through 327 that sound really turns me on for some reason gonna play that in cinema mode with my psvr ps4pro kinda like real vr much better than only on tv its not just a game its the game to learn how to cook people like gordon ramsay in postapocalypse theme world that digitaleyetrollingeffect makes my eyes burn 1no blood 2difficulty 3i want to wipe blood off the screen just like in metro this aint the rage i used to knownill passed looking forward to this game the most flintwood mac intensifies pretty good but enemies resembling loot pinatas or health or whatever the blue things are looks completely ridiculous and super annoying it looks great very fast paced like new doom and looks so cool if it will have a great postapocalyptic world it will be a hit better add this hud preset to the game this is fucking arti love it this game is obviously not developed by bethesda either that or heavily modded wasteland wizard cheat codes you serious lets just hope bethesda doesnt meddle too much in the development of this game borderlands rip off i dont care what garbage 76 was im not letting it stand in the way of me playing this game at all rage 2 mad max and borderlands had a baby only to find out doom was the real father bitches love boats the game looks amazing but why no hud hell yeah thanks rage 1 ending was bullshit hope this one have a good one wow bethesda fucked up yet anther game they are the worst publishers ever i am boycotted the ohhh a new game looks awesome im gonna buy it asap repeat over and over again getting doom vibes with this the ai looks dumb slow and the aiming of a stormtrooper nice clone of borderlands you selling loot boxes too mod support fov slider for both pc and consoles vulkan api support put it on steam you idiots honestly at first i was very sceptical about this game but seeing this gameplay has me sold you can use ads in rage 2 finally hey bethesda if id adds qcesque movement to the game i will definitely buy it i dont want to drive or fly when i can strafe jump crouch slide or use air control the speed cap has to be high too i hope the story holds up i got a strange far cry vibe for awhile and not in the good way oh this is a bethesda title skip never buy their shit idc how nice it looks 034 i am buying this game purely because of this cool when does the unfinished version of this game get released for free to play because ill never purchase a bethesda game again i was bored after watching about 45 seconds so its a no from me just a reskinned doom dull so its doom obviusly gameplay mechanic with neo cyperpunk style plus that shotgun but be carefull with the pre alpha footage ill never buy a bethesda game or anything they are affiliated with they just want to grab your csh and dont care about quality or content the fastpace gameplay reminds me a lot of doom i just cant help it i thought we would eventually get sucked into a hellworld where doom slayer would pop up unfortunately after the whole stuff going on with fallout 76 we just gotta wait and see if this is truly going to be a polished game or an absolute bug fest todd howard has some competition the movement seems a bit too fast and artificial but the weapons look interesting im worried that the setting might get stale depends on what other parts of the game feature why is everything out of focus i feel like i need glasses after watching this this gives me more of a bulletstorm vibe than a rage vibe loved the first game but this looks like its too much hectic shooting for my taste i liked the slower more tactical and storydriven approach of the first game n whats wrong with couch co op stop letting everyone ruin my fun thats left to my mates eh mayb have to wait n see ya cant just go wasting money ona bethesda game until u seen someone else play n u see the truth then ill make my decision neat now fix fallout 76 be me come home and buy this game 6 mins into the game finally finish tutorial game starts youre finally awake todd the boss fight looks awesome d it reminds me a of cross between mad max and doom by far the best gameplay video of rage 2 fast paced chaotic first person i like that doom but outside this wont save you bethesda lol massage to bethesda when is skyrim special edition gonna get fixed forget about that wank of a game that is fallout 76 and fix something that people actually give damn about no coop borderlands still better by this this looks so funi only wish it was on steam instead of bethesdas shitty launcher whats up with the extreme low draw distance for the ground clutter is this running on a switch if this is a bethesda luancher exclusive its a no buy i hope there are actual setllements in this world that you can go to and explore that stiltown place looked really cool for a kill everybody place my pc is crying in the corner knowing it cant run this but is going to be forced to where is the pc version for a post apocalyptic world the terrain looks beautiful looks like far cry 5 tried to oneup you w new dawn or you could ya know finish doom eternal already why or why no multiplayer can i get a 3rd person perspective 1st person motion sickness that ark was filled with amazing gear only got one upgrade so where was all that other gear chromatic aberration the game yay pre order sees the bethesda logo yeah maybe not fuckup76 i want to preorder rage 2 only on steam no steam i will download this game from torrent no remastered for the first one i love it i cant wait this engine can be perfect for a new fallout better have an option to disable this horrid blur bots are really stupid and what have they armor fall resources too much arcade please do not implement this but there is no landing animation correctly it is not needed in the end will get tired if you can see how the door opens and come in speed of movement spurt ability to action everything is fine will this game have coop this is game should have coop like borderlands wow i love it will there be multiplayer or just single gameplay looks rlly fun but jesus the blurry vision kills my eyes the movement options look satisfying to master ai acting like they have no care in the world lol cant come out soon enough i am so bored with gaming lately turn off the motion blur i cant see shit will we have an option to disable these television color effects for some reason this really reminds me of the equipment used in the guardians of the galaxy films anyone else is this doom hey no steam no buy crowd its not like they stole you money andor game and hijacked it another platform like deep silver go on we wont miss you id software knows their guns damn looks like what would happen when borderlands and titanfall had a nice steamy night together i like it cant watch gameplay without hearing danny brown now cant wait for this game cousin of doom dystopian world check cool guns was that a needler check driving vehicles check mowing down mobs check count me in everything looks great except the flying looks kinda awkward i dont buy farcry newdawn horrible this game is good if downloading a launcher to play a fucking videogame is a huge problem im sorry for you that blur is fucking unwatchable baby mode difficult so shiny so chrome looks too easy and anything bethesda i wont support why is it so blurry like ps3 please please implement some kind of photo mod like in mad max this game looks amazing still looks shit shouldve called it a new game not rage 2 as this is not rage you better drop what you still doing and start working on br version dayum this looks like alot of fun why its so blury can you put those graphics on fallout 5 pls fuck yeah lets get itttt cant wait for this game man love you bethesda woah manthis is like a scifi doom love the first one its been so long now use this engine for fallout or elder scrolls now please looks great i want it now prebeta do you know what that means funny bandits in this game looks like nowadays social justice warriors huge fan of the original rage but i have zero interest in this looks just like any other futuristic shooter out there this gameplay is on pc i have a big doubt about the fact this game runs like that on console at 60fps maybe on x but i dont think you made it run at 60fps on console it looks fun and all but so far it seems like one of those sequels that only really have a link to the previous title in name only this game just looks like doom reworked into cyberpunk mad max haha it had some amazing gearbut it only showed you how do a move is that a gear now so no one even paying attion to him he could just walked up to the thing and they would done nothing compare this gameplay with the neanderthal they let showcase metro exodus lol now will this be on steam or the bethesda launcher cant wait then most things about fallot 76 now calling a alpha a pre beta this is not new gameplay i saw it like 2 weeks ago here httpsyoutubemim3yg0zl0 only difference is that this bethesda gameplay is shorter its beginning is 318 of different video so in that video you had 3 minutes more you better put this on steam so this basically cyberpunk doom this looks so good and would sell so well if it wasnt only on bethesdanet fps is awfully low this game is looking sweet cant wait to play fingers crossed for no multiplayer and no release bugs the problem is that its stolen from borderlands the style i mean rage 1 was boring but it was realistic leave the comedy to borderlands to your own thing cool game weapons look awesome game play is great the game looks boring as fk so its fallout 76 open world up to a point where you clear out areas donno new games dont have the heart they had in the early 2000s late 1999s i hope someone find these types of games fun gl with your game this game looks fun on pc when he walks the world looks so freaking huge and when he drives even the buildings looks so small just like the car thats weard looks awesome really looking forward to this movement and combat seem really fast doom run speed that ramp into the ark fix that please for all those wondering the wasteland wizard cheat codes are an ingame item that you can purchase with ingame currency from a vendor and will be available in all versions of the game so basicaly its another doom but with boomerangs is that a frickin nanosuit it looks like crysis doom bulletstorm d love it would be an amazing br gameijs loved it 10001000 stars if this game had a br modecuz the graphics are godly yall fucked us so hard with rage 1 youd have to be a complete idiot to buy this game its lookin so good cant wait this game looks awesome huh why does the player character not take any damage yes this is a borderland not original why is everything so blurry dear bethesda i have a question maybe you answer in the deluxe edition of rage 2 is a thing called wizard wasteland cheat codes it would be nice if someone explained that thing to me because many people are scared and think you are selling cheat codes to them many people wont buy the game because of some youtubers claiming that are paid cheat codes i wo love it if someone would answer me have a good day max i dont know i expect something more unice more agressive but now i understand thats will be boring game where need just run and shoot ehhhh soo disapointing rage 2 available now in technicolor hard to believe bethesda studio got help from them in fallout 76 hope the graphics improve sort of lackluster low detailed textures lol all you pc elites are so mad just have both platforms you fools ill probably get this on xbox anyways dont be hyped this is bethesda dont forget fallout 76 this game is soooo cooool i like the gameplay but no steam i cant buy this game awesome is it available for pre order if far cry mad max and doom had a child dot be fooled guys we know this game finna eat more ass than 76 stuff i will spend my time doing in the game 10 actual story following gameplay 90 ok this corpse launch is definitely gonna clear that mountain over there this time check it out the gunplay reminds me so much of bulletstorm dont know why but im loving it i dont trust bethesda after the disaster of 2018 is this the prey game that was promised in 2011 that takes place on earth cause the game looks so beautiful and the slam ability was so satisfying its a little messy to see but ill trust its better at full resolution and not youtube compression gun play and fighting mechanics heavily remind me of the bulletstorm which is a good thing d i see you bethesda trying to get that 10 minute youtube atoms not selling well enough huh the sound design is really great here guns sound loud and not just punchy good visual feedback too the blur all over the screen is awful though depth of field never seems to work well i really hope these arent the only weapons were able to use i love all of the wastelandish makeshift weapons meh who cares they havent fixed other games yet this is the same gameplay you released to the press last week new gameplay my ass did i miss something this game play is not new they showed this a week or two ago the only thing i really didnt like is foot soldier ai they seem to prioritize taking cover near the closest fence instead of shooting the player even if hes right in their line of sight and they arent able to combine running into cover with shooting back please fix when i watch it thinking about tes6 how will it be id remembering us that the the only thing worth seeing popping out of enemies on an fps is blood limbs guts or armor plates and not shot damage output values avalanche studios working on an open world game extremely dated memes regarding bitches and boats this game gets me 1 take out the microtransactions 2 let people buy it at steam 3 learn with your mistakes 4 just make a new engine every 5 years its not that hard bethesda you are being dumb one of the most basic rules in every business is you need to spend money to get more money dont try to cheap out or cut corners by keeping stuff that you know people will not like people are smarter than you think and need twice the respect you should give themthat is how you keep potential buyers crappy ia how in the hell are these common enemies gonna be able to fight you in the main game when you have all these gadgetsmoves and powers that can literally rip them apart they have no chance stop bitching enjoy the gameplay everyone is talking about the steam what do you guys mean this is damn impressive man starting to love id games man from new order and d00m all their games seems to be delivering very well like delivering a new born baby every year is it annoying anyone else that he gets out the right side of the car 254 that pop in tho fck you betheda and you game of trah lying company guys better buy cyberpunk 2077 and atomic heart than rage 2 and fallout i just want to shoot things in the face with that shotgun for the love of god take my money those are some phenomenal gamepad skills charging for cheats now wtf bethesda game look tons of fun juicy smoothly is it just me or is it a bit blurry looks like the dof is too strong otherwise it looks like a lot of fun fallout 76 more gore then its beast solid gameplay but bethesda wastes the developers fantastic efforts by making us pay for cheat codes and adding xp boosters this trash seeing this graphics makes me wonder how tes looks oh god i cant wait its basically doom with a steampunk mad max skin looks more fun than all the fortnites that keep coming out i played the fallout 76 beta and was happy with what i saw and because i love the fallout series and have never been let down by bethesda games i preordered a digital copy of fallout 76 when the beta ended you broke my heart bethesda you chose money over quality and not just in the abhorrent quality of the game but the microtransactions the duffle bag scam then offering 500 atoms insult the plastic rum bottles etc now that i have a game that is still very much broken and 100 not fun you will not get my business again anytime soon and im sure there are many more like me who feel the same way you let greed in the door and it will end up costing you far more than you would have made if you had done things the right way gudjob bethesda for bringing out this epic madnessfeels like doomfarcry5bulletstorm mashup done awesomely right together it reminds me of borderlands series when is bethesda going to make a offline mode for fallout 76 i literally told people today i gotta get a boat so towards the end in that camp the enemy cracked me up bethesda really needs to up their marketing for rage 2 because people just dont seem interested even though it looks like a great game anybody else remember how good the first one looked b4 you played it its like doom with bulletstorm yes its funny but isnt rage id and avalanche should work on the next fallout game this looks great it really is refreshing seeing someone actually good play the game instead of the usual inept people we get for gameplay videos dont let this be another comment you scroll past fools add a battle royale mode to the game that is free to download and play add skins usable in battle royale but only obtainable in the main game make them the best most flamboyant skins profit honestly idk why its so hard for these retarded fucking game companies to understand omg why are they so slow hopeless bastards 10 out of 10 gameplay very excited for the release such a shame i wont be playing this at least this looks like a good year elsewhere if only the ai combat and animation was as good as the original game the game will be available on ps4 xbox bethesda launcher let it sink in it looks like andrew wk fucked a can of spray paint and then smeared it on mad max so it looks great this looks amazing 445 thats todd telling sweet little lies only beta theyve made look good definitely getting this looks like yet another game with shit ai just mindless runandgun with minimal strategy or danger isnt prebeta called alpha the protagonist sounds exactly like a character from new vegas just cant put my finger on who im feeling its someone from the ncr game looks good just hope they fix that pop in before release that is so 10 years ago cars engines sounds like gta san andreas cars lmao welcome back to 2005 add more foe minimize ttk smth like l4d 2 more foe but ez to kill them all will give this game more dynamic thats what all wanna from rage 2 also im understand that this is prebeta game but where animation getting in car on 258 its one of killer feature car traveling and cars as all what a waste of a nice engine ids version of boderlands no one cares bethesda make a new engine fix fallout and skyrim be better dislikes becaue its only on bethesda launcherget over it people its happening we will have steam gog epic bethesda moaning wont change anything i bet after a year or two everybody will get used to it this is great guns sound great but this ark was brimming with some amazing gear dear god that was cringeworthy a wasnt brimming b was an ability not gear c noone uses brimming in that context my bowl wasnt brimming with some amazing cereal this morning i have my colled preordered i just hope that isnt in the release i will unpack and corrupt that sound file if i have to 400 junkrat is that you looks great man cant wait to try it out from the rage 2 devs on twitter lets clear this up progress booster cheat codes in the rage 2 deluxe ed are things you buy from npcs just like ammo and health packs its an optional starter pack for players who might want em right away cheats can be acquired from a guy named the wasteland wizard sure his name is lame maybe you can help us with a better suggestion but he doesnt require you to spend real world so in other words chill the fuck out peeps there are no pay to win or microtransactions the air dash and slam abilities make me want to play rage 2 will this be on steam epic games store or only bethesda store for pc it looks beautiful i hope this one is a success bethesda needs a win looks great hope that the camera changes when you see a new location was just for the gameplay trailers and not for the released version as it is kind of jarring the fact that there is no hud is also really imersive and the physics look great what pc gameplay from dev am i dreaming anything that has id working on it is pure brilliance man i hope they will have some sort of multiplayer also will it be available on steam on release date ive got my popcorn ready for release day just in case bethesda acts like you know bethesda cant wait to see how theyll fuck this up that guy at the end sounds like mojojojo literally this is a mix of overwatch with mad max wait for downgrade and more bugs this looks mental this is what the first rage should have been like bethesda please bring this to steam and take out the microtransactions youll get a lot more sales its not rocket science the guy who played this gameplay did definitely played cod before this looks so much better than that game obsidian is working on bethesda this looks awesome since its being made by id and avalanche i was going to pay full price but its on your launcher and has greedy microteansactions two strikes 104 this next 30 seconds is beautiful getting some bullet storm vibes from this its not a continuation of rage but its almost doom and its a good game but as a continuation of the series of rage is very bad first i want to like rage but better im really looking forward to seeing the dead city the leveling up and customisation and upgrading side of things also i hope you have to work your way up to the mainbest vehicles and start on the motorbike and the hover bike is endgame looks like a really fun and wellmade game no steam no buy though im really really hoping that the fps combat will be mostly indoors linear sections since thats what id does best also im looking foward to seeing more boss battle type stuff and its nice seeing old things return but better im liking the fun new guns but what im really hoping for is a doublebarrelled shotgun sniper rifle to change up combat minigun and smg all like in rage 1 also some kinda semiauto rifle grenade laucnher and railgun which may have been one of these enemy ai look absolutely terrible looks good but sorry the bethesdanet launcher exclusivity needs to go tone down the motion blur ffs it will go on sale in 23 months im impressed i have to admit not a fan of recent shooters in a past few years but this really something different while this looks really polished or at least the footage theyre showing off is it all feels really gimmicky combat too focused on all these special abilities rather than just making combat meaty glad i pre ordered the deluxe edition now hm hope it has some difficulty and maby something to turn off the glitchy screen effects i get the aesthetic but its just fucking with me eyes so are you robocop if he downloaded doom and was in a post apocalyptic world with a mad max society whats going on here ok that guy who said i got to get me a boat bitches love boats is that a reference to alucards line from hellsing abridged teamfourstar get that bitch a cannon bitches love cannons one of the best gameplay demos ive ever seen just wow so excited for this game im getting this only when it goes on a deep sale due to your preorder disincentives sucks because it does look really neat oh well the enemies are cannon fodder boring as hell right right morons will come rage posting its a demo dude moronic assumption based on what exactly nothing fucktards do you realise theyre showing us that their ai is shit no hahaha i guess its a good marketing move nowadays i hope this will be 60fps on consoles good old rage which was great dubiously enhanced ruined by the worst bits of far cry 7 and bulletstorm finally gameplay that encouraged me to buy rage 2 i am in stop it just stop it bethesda is an amazing company and they have made and are still making amazing games i play f76 and i enjoy the hell out of it im gonna play this too and still enjoy it and what about doom huh that game is spot on and is everything that i enjoy its like the original but better it is and now doom eternal looks frickin amazing awesome super cool just enjoy the game before you a make a judgement okay this doesnt look bad by any means but it sort of looks souless high tec mad max nah looks dope guys good stuff loved rage 1 but why cant this be on steam i dont want to install yet another launcher looks too easy and boring this will definitely hold me over until doom eternal why everything so blurry why cant companies make decent engaging fps ai why is the ads age restriction onim 14 its like doom bulletstorm and titanfalls combat systems had a lovechild the first rage is an underrated masterpiece looks very fun to play looks disapointing the fov is ridiculous the gore have been drasticaly toned down while all the dumb pink teal things pops everywhere on screen the amount of shader and motion blur is dumb the ai is even stupid and underwhelming as ever and it frankly already look boring after 10min nothing is engaging gratz bethesda on making a fortnite hd while kids just dont care about rage and offline solo experience gratz for making a hd fast pacing offline shooter while gamer are now all on apex legend gratz for wasting a aaa budget on something nobody asked if bethesda dont redeem themselves with starfield they will have to do something insane with tes6 to not bankrupt for good bitches love boats booooom ahhh hahahahahahahahaha when i first heard of this game i wasnt too sure what to think didnt really have that much interest for it either the more i see the demos though it is actually looking really good i love the punchy id style gun play and the vehicle roaming looks pretty fun ill definitely keep my eyes out for more game play keeping my fingers crossed for a good release so will on steam prebeta looks quite polished and ready to me oh man i love this just drop the damn thing lol no steam no buy im not the first saying it but lets start a thing why do game companies love hiding the hud is all their gameplay i just want to see what its actually going to look like this is basically the equivalent of a prerendered cinematic trailer heavy metal choir please do port it optimized double check everything if you have to man this makes me wanna play mad max hope it gets a sequel i like the way it looks but i absolutely will not buy it on the bethesda launcher nothing else than violence always the same looks good too bad i wont be able to pick it up until its on steam this is looking like it is gonna be great not sure why your bothering with pre beta since nothing will change in the official release i can see a lot of doom in this game and thats not a bad thing i dont understand why people say this game looks so good the ai doesnt even pose a threat to the main character is the game not meant to put the player in any real danger or is this just a shooter thats supposed to make anyone who plays the game feel like they are good bethesda just fuckin make elder scrolls 6 or drop starfield smh fallout 76 mod for only 59 i really hope that you wont be limited to carry only 2 weapons at the time prebeta but im scared the game will be downgraded and look worseat release itlooks okay clearly not trying to be any sort of predecessor to the original and just a straight up reboot but eh do what ya want i guess kinda just feels like an open world shooter is all not really alot of substance outside of that but if thats what your looking for im sure thisll have it in droves but obviously ill have to wait on this one since its a bethesda game never thought id have to say that mad max with superpowers the problem with this is superpowers totally destroy the mad max setting and then it feels like disneyland madmax probably very good gunplay and amount of content but this tone mehhh makes me think on other franchises instead think that im playing something different that has his own place it gives me more interest on go back again to mad max game or to borderlands instead playing the game prebeta cant companies just finish games and stop making consumers do their jobs sigh please fix the blur before release i beat the first one like 3 times on 3 diff systems but whats with either dof motion blur or aa that making it look a lil blurry though ill just wait for blades and elder scroll 6 both those games are potentially more my style ill just keep switching from oblivion and skyrim for now when it comes to bethesda games this isnt new footage this was reused from another channel the gun sounds are good i just think they need a little more full bodied bottom end to them this looks amazing is this gameplay from console or pc nice gameplay but dull storytelling and fing outposts again no steam no buy that pop in no steam no buy this game looks like fun but the vehicle control doesnt look good and while flying or moving high speed i can still see grass starts appearing in or vehicles popping in the middle of the road thats much better than oblivion but physics is still weird fix the fucking floating bridge at 722 never played rage before really looks fun though looks awesome i just hope the difficulty is turned way down for the sake of the footage it looks really easy ive started playing rage 1 in meantime so ill be able to catch up the story when rage 2 comes out all that bombast means nothing if ai are running into your bullets first 4 minutes is like watching overwatch with mad max and borderlands this is amazing the youtube settings say that the video is in 1080p but so why the game is in 720p 0913 nice looking fire effects just wish it was coop looks fun enough but the ai actually seems dumber than in the first rage this looks fucking awesome man im sad because it probably plays amazing and everything but its gonna bomb pretty hard doom eternal tho doom eternal please stop fucking up beth i actually had hope for you to redeem yourselves all i see here is a bunch dumb npcs that cant shoot too bad i have a switch what people didnt like the news about our paid exp boosters and cheat codes hurry release a video showing them cool shit if bulletstorm and borderlands had a baby gonna be honest here the gameplay feels like its gonna get repetitive really fast i dont want to say that this game looks like a very pretty shooting gallery that seems to contain very little challenge and while i agree that sometimes you wanna play a game that makes you feel godlike i never got that from rage id has a thing for sticking clenched fists into kiosks why does this have such a madmax vibe it looks like madmax but just with super strong guns and awesome powers rage 76 mad max meets destiny in a singleplayer freak show i really hope they add a 1st person mode for driving i can see shadow of battle royale steam store or no buy bring it to steam no aguardo greetings from brazil why is the image soft and blurry that or some very aggressive resolution scaling to maintain the framerate i know this is prealpha dev gameplay but did bethesda just forget to add player damage like are game so focused on making you an unstobbale force that every ai just doesnt do any damage to you wheres the challenge more depth of field and motion blur please because who the fck actually wants to see anything while playing its doom but a madmax style do not preorder bethesda games mouthwatering i had a good time with rage but this one looks leagues above it cant wait for the downgrade comparison for this one shame cuz it looks great the game looks just too easy unless they were play on very easy mode for the video motion blur off dof off this game reminds of a neill blomkamp movie another promising game thats probably going to be ruined by corporate bullshit that main characters voice actor sounds so familiar blur or soap in my eyes this surprised me reminds me of borderlands looks good bethesda is now selling cheats fuck this game and fuck bethesda congrats avalanche youve managed to make a game without any ai when is it coming to steam quote on quote new cuz all this gameplay was all over reviews last week but its fine nothing to get butthurt about shoutouts to operatorperry living the dream we all wish we could i see gravity grenades already interested but wheres tes blades yepp old gameplay seen that but i more interesting in new microtransactions what you put in game what the fuck is that image blur and im not talking about the motion blur stop using taa jesus fucking christ it sadly looks like the assault rifle is gone be a peashooter again you shouldnt need to shoot an entire kitchen worth of pans off an early game enemy to kil him this game needs more recognition it looks absolutely stunning the game runs at a solid 60fps and the gameplay looks fun and addicting definitely game of the year material oh shit theres a boomerang im sold loved rage 1a lot of people complained about the ending but that didnt matter that much to me cause the game so provided so many hours of fun before then cant wait for this game at least get it on the epic games launcher bethesda no one will download ur stupid launcher prebeta gameplay just stop it already hoooooooooolyyyyyyyy shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit and this is prebeta yup definitely getting this pre beta isnt this game coming out soon i fear for this game not because of bethesda but because everyone is going to hate it just because they have they name on it this looks seriously promising lets give this a chance rage 2 and doom eternal are definitely the first 2 games on my bucket list make fallout graphics and smothness just like this game looks like bulletstorm from peoplecanflay oh yesyes indeed it looks great but i am not buying it no bethesda launcher gunplay looks hella meaty so nice hope the story is refreshing and not a typical apocalyptic plot this really is the sequel to avalanches mad max ive always wanted fuck yeah id is back in the game plz be on steam pre beta just call it alpha lul this is what fallout 76 shouldve been like the ai seems so non threatening hey ahaha hey this is doom but without all the red textures and vehicles literally doom look alike hope the story is actually good edit um put on steam please nice this may be the first fps in years that i want to play world looks good the guns look like they have a real kick lots of abilities i just might check it out not gonna buy it sorry bethesda you suck i guess they resampled many assets from the mad max game do i hate that fkin no its awesome looks and sounds really good rage doom wolfenstein quake unrealthey all have 1 thing the samefantastic gameplay d d d looks awesome but the soundtrack is lacking couldnt you have hired mr torque for some sick guitar riffs d hooooopefully this get a release or delayed release on steam for the sake of sales at least give it the broadest possible audience you can still take peoples money to the bank even if they hate the bethesda launcher no steam no buy i like how things look and run good in this engine if only bgs had access to this tech very promising gameplay looks great but the enemies dont even stand a chance whats the point of a fps if theres no challenge holy shit that looks like so much fun id software and tango gameworks both are the last salvation of bethesda anyway nice footage this game looks so good why isnt this video in 4k i wonder if well see more game footage or a release date for doom eternal sometime soon im ready looks cool as hell may wait for it to go on a sale tho will have to see how it is on release when the doom guy meet madmax in a just cause party under lsd need some badass musics tho seems like red fraction ah yes the beta that was rage seems to have served this one well the game looks really good but this ai is definitely worrying me the enemies are so dumb in this gameplay perhaps its on easy but even so changing difficulties in games usually dont make the enemies smarter just harder to kill they become bullet sponges i am definitely waiting for some reviews before buying this you want us to believe the game will look like this ha ha ha good job avalanche too bad that this game is published by bethesda so no rage 2 for me not gonna install bethesdashit wow this looks really fun to play but im not re downloading the bethesda launcher again so ill give this a hard pass bruh this looks so gooood i really love the colors too looks like shit gameplay boring run from point to point and repeat killing why do they think only because its open world it will be automatically good ahem elderscrolls blades coughs badly i hope the color is gonna get overhauled burns the eyes out your head it looks terrible but apart from that everything else about it is great please dont be another fallout 76 disaster doom and mad max had a child i thought wow no dismemberment whats the point of this grudgy hellhole aestheti guy exlpodes nevermind ill be buying this officiallyim so hyped for this gameits looks awesome okay now you have my attention count me in on this this looks sweet this game just screams yeet prebeta thats just alpha but it launches in 3 months either the game will have no content at launch or somebody needs to learn how development phases work straight to the hardest difficulty this looks promising universal fallout 76 refunds when this looks freakin awesome ill never understand why they made a second one the first wasnt even good this is aids wtf is this this aont the rage we love why you gotta make it faster and more scifi seriously how hard can it be to make a good game wtf is wring with u bethesda u killled fallout now this ffs gameplay looks good shame the world of rage is blander than oatmeal yall dumbasses fail to understand that different people work on different games the people that made fallout 76 did not make this physics are comical and gameplay just like doom or quake then nothing special with this pink game is there a uncompressed version look like ass on youtube because youtube is thatfailsafe why is everything so blurred looks empty cool butwhat happened to doom eternal we havent heard a word about it since august 850 yeah i gotta get me a boat bitches love boats wtf lmao child mommy daddy can i have some fucking money to buy this fucking game its so fucking awesome parents ohh man its full of violence and killings this is not a game for a kids child of course it is its not like mature people gonna play this sort of games looks like a typical pov cinematic with the sticker gameplay there has been dozens of games that has done this and the final product was nothing close to the shit it represented dope game please include ray tracing and dlss id loves to stir up hype the protagonists voice acting is good though 427 aimhackexe lmao this is dumb its just a doom clone i cant believe id would keep making the same game for 20 years jk this game looks like so much fun looks like another build your own burrito bar shooter wow that is a lot of pop in better fucking be on steam pre beta footage meaning its a bs demo and actual gameplay will be even less plus the exp boost seriously pink flayed that shotgun looks amazing bethesdahow about that put your games on steam and your launcher so people can decide on which one they will buy it i mean you guys could make the steam release 3 months after the release of your launcher so you guys will get all the money from the people who realy realy want to play and just dont care which one they use thats just my thoughts about it good evening i wanna play this game on one principle alone that this is the original avalanche studio avalanche sweden not that shell of a studio thats been working on most of just cause 3 and then now fully just cause 4 called avalanche ny avalanche sweden is the original ogs that brought us just cause 1 2 and maybe parts of 3 till they moved the hell on to go work on mad max because square enix couldnt make their minds up on what type of game they wanted jc 3 to be instead what we got was avalanche ny which is not avalanche avalanche ny has destroyed just cause franchise its a disgrace i will follow avalanche sweden wherever they go but im quite sadden by the disaster that has befell the just cause franchise rico rodriguez deserved better with that said whats with all the damn pink borderlands but with more ways to move and on release will it be same quality as fallout76 what are the towns like how many game looks great monetisation looks god awful wake up bethesda why devs or community managers have such trash aim so its basically borderlands minus the humor the random generated weapons and the coop and instead of having class specific powers distributed in a team of 4 you can cram them all in one seriously op character nope not interested ill buy doom eternal instead it looks so good when bethesda doesnt make the game its actually good xd lul it would appear the creative team has run out of their own ideas hmmmm the game still need some calibrations no seriously its too similar to mass effect fighting in the meaning of skills i should go now hope it will be better than failout76 not gonna buy this game still mad about fallout 76 these youtube comments are actually dumbaf playing on easy yeah because they are gonna get someone to play perfectly on hard mode and only get it done in a few takes of footage smh its gameplay footage its not shroud streaming rage 2 footage rage doom bulletstorm rage 2 i cant wait could you maybe put it on steam just you know just a thought i came up with i fucking hate the gunplay it looks so wierd and unrealistic rage 2 wolfenstein young blood and doom eternal id software are the masters of fps games ea and activision pale in comparison looks like doom and it makes me want to play apex looks like a toneddown less fun doom looks pretty good ill buy it if its on steam damn i cant wait no steam no buy plus the pay to cheat and loot boxes that all bethesda games will have from this point is also a big turndown its as if doom mad max and cyberpunk had a baby that started walking the first day and defeated communism the second the ground pound aoe move always gets used as an o shit button the jump mechanic is cool though whoever is playing this has a lot experience playing battle roya codl blackout game not going to lie this looks very cool and fun now i need a new computer to play on ultra looks like far cry a little anyone who preorders should be italien back hand slapped playstation gameplay look s like on slim charging for cheats bethesda you are becoming a meme 721 bad object placement or wtf no steam no vr no buy do we have to pay to watch this too looks so fantastic its a shame bethesda continue to do everything in their power to destroy their own published games with bad decisions though please look at max payne 3 to see how to make intuitive ai i mean i dont understand why this ai is just standing there dying is the main character voiced by sam riegel from critical role really want coop i remember ending rage with wingsticks and poprockets only i waste hours playing jackpot to make money and bought that items exp boost how big is the game map gonna be i want it as big bigger than the just cause maps or bigger 13 bigger than the gtav map the visual aspect looks weird to me but i cant put my finger on whyhow excluding all the powers it just looks too gorgeous to be true like as if it was borderlands made by cd projekt red sucks this look amazing a heavenly mix of doom and mad max fun gameplay d edit whats with the down votes guys why on earth would i buy a game with xp boosters and cheat codes as micro transactions no thanks bethesda keep your rage 2 i think i will play the outer worlds instead at the end of the year so how much do we gotta pay for cheatcodes well im not getting this for xbox pc ftw hey i got a idea why not give people there own servers on fallout 76 that has there own private stash and you can download mods onto that server because that would fix a ton of things sounds like theyve changed voice actors for the main character and to liam obrien it sounds no less can almost see a bit of bulletstorm in this not a bad thing wtf is a pre beta why do weapons sound like firecrackers wtf is with the ammo floating through the air towards you whomever thought that was a great idea should stay well away from designing fps games doom fuck bulletstorm eat some acid and go into the open world looks nice is it going to be on steam dont like it dont buy it stop wanting a shooter game to be an rpg open world emotional story driven game get the f out of here this is just doom gunplay with more freedom you dont need any remote reason to kill enemies reasons to not buy rage 2 my opinion 1 the first game was a complete flop on its belly i didnt enjoy it and most people didnt neither for me hat i seen when it was released 2 bethesda launcher no refunds and its very sketchy i dont know about you but i still dont trust them after f76 and dont say wrong developer i actually know its not bethesda and its published but its still on bethesda launcher its such bs 3 wait to see what you are getting remember there are no refunds with these games im pretty sure from what we are shown here its just doom in a post apocalyptic setting 4 this might be me but the world seems empty from what is shown its mostly hills in the background and it seems like you cant even go to them kind of a big letdown for me this is the fallout 76 i was looking for well this looks fun i hope that we will be able to drive the convoy leader the developer said that its even bigger than the monster truck and it gave me some vibes thinking of the vehicle that guy from the mad max game was driving just a little bit take my money i have allready preorderd this awesom looking 60fps console xboxone x game new shooters especially cod can learn from this look no headbopping it just maeks it hard to see anything this is how shooters hould be you used to be able to turn this onoff but newer games has it on withotu the option to turn it off plus its effect is much worse in newer games why does this look so blurry is there a horrible chromatic aberration filter really poor dynamic resolution like just cause 4 or is it a dof filter its hard to tell whats making this look so bad also that constant glitching video effect is just annoying and cheapens the gameplay and then theres far cry new dawn u better fix that trash enemy ai i love id software this looks so much fun i love the way you maneuver in combat is there actually no hud at all or are they only showing it without here unfortunately people will pass this awesome game and buy farcry new down bethesda games have a very bad luck rage was never so colorful and i dont know the word jumpy what is this mess i am looking at i am only typing this on 046 lets keep watching 116 holy shit outlined enemies bad ai neon colors all over the place 218 no no no no no who asked for this who made this decision 259 no entering animation hello gta vice city had vehicle entering animation in 2002 and you cant design one now 433 do i have to witness this awful digital flickering everytime i use my ability it kinda makes it look like youre in a simulation and nothing you see is real 500 bad bad ai do they watch the trailers before uploading them 856 are you kidding me are we fighting megatron now and again why the highlight of the limbs are we that stupid to aim or to find the enemys weak spots world looks amazing music is fine vehicles look like a nice improvement cant tell how they control the atmosphere is ok but it is not a rage atmosphe the footage isnt new btw ive seen it weeks ago this game is so not going to run on my 1070 alienware lmao so is this a training mission for the multiplayer open world online game i wonder what is the highest possible point to use slam from please add the wheel thing to choose different and interesting ammo types to the weapons i loved that about rage is it true that rage 2 will be locking cheat codes behind a preorder bonus and contain progress boosters so that people can pay more to not play the game if so its one more thing to add to the huge list of anticonsumer shit this company has pulled recently i mean what is the point of stuffing mtx into this single player game youre only gonna piss people off and tarnish the good name of id software it makes no sense how much do you really expect to make off of them will it be worth the backlash and potential loss of sales because surely at this point the whole company could do with a win and rage 2 could have been an easy way to regain some faith and goodwill with your community but no youre gonna fuck us over yet again for some short term profit all the while not being smart enough to realize that you are only killing yourselves in the long run this isnt 2011 anymore chaps you have competition these days never forget that seriously zenimaxbethesd game looks so good tho avalanche studios no thanks im pretty excited for this game todd howard it just works its like d00m and wolfenstein had a baby oh boi am i excited to pay for cheats in my singleplayer game cant wait did they change the voice actor i preferred the other one also this gameplay looks great but footage is blurry as hell was this necessary to running at 60fps doom but cars this is looking great pretty excited to see more the single player gods have delivered another masterpiece take my money ill gladly support these single player studious thank you for not being like all the rest the multiplayer whres does this have doom styled combat ie push forward combat meh not a fan looks a bit easy otherwise im excited this looks good but i hated rage 1 tbh why did the ark call him mr president looks great but i think the radio would get old pretty quick fallout 76 wait for game journalists to say its too hard all your games are the same on pc version dont understand the player is immortal or what it seems like he failed to take any damage whatsoever gameplay looks superboring and casual it seems like player could instead of using all these fancy abilities just punch everyone to death ai would still miss him like 99 of the time rage should be more like doom not like destiny im so exited looks great yeah kind of like far crywish the same effort was put into fo76 jeez bitches to love boats really like how it looks and feels doomlike mechanicsgameplay but the ai seems stupid a f 430 thats some smooth ass shit heres hoping the open world is as busy as shown in this gameplay everyone hating bethesda for fallout 76 but loving then for rage 2 the main character is flynn prebeta its like fallout 76 why doesnt bethesda use the id tech engine for its games this looks miles better in comparison to f4 and f76 heck even doom 2016 looks better then anything developed by bethesda well i hope thats on really low difficulty this is just call of duty steam uplay origin battle net gog epic games store bethesda net discord nexon arc and other launchers or a digital distribution platform so many launchers on pc it so sad for me i installed only four launchers steam uplay origin and battle net and i do not want more goodbye bethesda i will download your games from the torrent looks awesome cant wait oh man this gameplay is freaking awesome the enemy ai looks rancid tbh looks like a 610 game with pretty low budget but still better than fallout 76 could they have gotten a better player for this video this guy playing wasnt very good missing most his shots granny shifting not double clutching like you should a game like this i really expected more from lol wtf that was freaking amazing first off if you cant tell the above comment was sarcasm but holy crap that was cool the player playing has skill i cant even attempt to recreate let alone learn from but the game looks amazing best high pace game ive ever seen basically doom in an open world the guy who sound designer for guns and sound effects overall i shake your hands sir double the man salary asap what about doom eternal 3 but this is doom with reskins why didi you call that rage oh my god sam riegel is voicing the protagonist my favourite gnome bard goblin rogue d no steam im not getting it these people are whiney little bitches fucking children will this game be on steam doom with a setting and enemies that dont suck im sold actually look really good just dont fuck this up just dont fuck this up and just dont fuck this up oh yeah forgot to mention just dont fuck this up shit has not been well for you all no matter what game comes from bethesda whether it be inhouse or not theres going to be some heat for a good while due to the last uhhh game guilt by association when it comes to the public and that wont change just dont fuck this up omg this game look amazing d it looks super fun i hope the side missions are worth it the combat looks amazing if the world is dense and the story is interesting this will be a solid game bring it to steam too bad ill probably be skipping this on launch thanks to bethesda launcher it reminds me of doom 4 034 wait you can throw people into the sky sign me up arent you charging for cheat codes for this game this reminds me of far cry which may or may not be a good thing that mech fight alone is worth full price day one im there i am looking forward to shooting people into orbit its like the mad max game if it was actually good selling cheat codes fuck this game fuck bethesda it was a good run boys time to bury this bitch in the desert and never look back is the mc voiced by liam obrien or sam riegal 543 cool weapon didnt avalanche studios make that mad max game that came out a few years ago steam or gtfo liam obrien is the voice of walker protagonist doom far cry rage 2 hooray black ops 3 oh wait so now youre charging real money for cheat codes in your collectors edition for rage 2 you are absolutely fucking appalling i wish you were owned by ea so at least we could look forward to them shuttering your studio despicable action by an increasingly despicable studio i look forward to not giving you any money ever again and instead playing rage2codex bitches love boats avalanche and id took the budgets from just cause 4 and fallout 76 and put it into this game id rather see gameplay without god mode activated game probably plays at a much slower pace when youre having to hide and heal no steam no buy i wanted a second mad max game but this has me hyped as hell and looks like it will definitely satisfy my thirst fallout 76 cancer finally something to cover the fallout 76 wound loved rage 1 cant wait for this why does this game look so blurry when is there a free beta on ps4 fix that mess that is fallout 76 before talking about other games please you money grabbing scumbags you ruined fallout for us i would have preferred if obsidian took over fallout from you they would have done a better job he looks great holy shit looks exciting pretty sure that was 10 minutes for the extra revenue and not 9 but eh this game will better at steam doom eternal and rage 2 its going to be the best combo of games this year for me why is there a beta for a single player id and avalanche went nuts on this one and the result is awesome i already preordered but i only trust on id software and avalanche studios dont f this up bethesda pop in looks horrible its a few feet from you no stea pay for cheat codes progress booster arr you guys ubisoft bt shittier now it isnt coming to steam doom without demons give us a switch edition paying for xp boosters and cheats is a big no from me n e x t this should just be a reboot cuz its nothing lile the 1st doom and fallout had a child doom eternal references in rage 2 how can i get access to the beta when it comes out have you given up on fallout 76 give us dlc and npcs im fucking hyped for this game give us doom eternal the press is shilling this game for the right reasons no steam jog on bethesda what a ridiculous decision i bet you then blame the poor pc sales on a dying pc market instead of your own idiotic moneygrabbing in a period where gamers are screaming about how we dont want multiple launchers etc pc gaming is healthier than ever were voting with our wallets wake up no thanks fix the games you already have out this year rage fallout i was expecting doom music for some reason ya it will be better than fallout 76 holy shit im exited i liked rage 1 the idea atleast but the game itself failed a little really hope you guys do well with this one cant wait did you get ice cream dont ever say omegalul on stream again ever 30303 hey he got it i play on pc with xbox one gamepad and unlike the other games rage 2 has an aweful handling precisely i mean that stick has dead zones and it irritates me a lot its quite hard to bear such kind of handling does anyone have the similar problem i forget how easily ray gets distracted from the story missions or hes made the decision to go to a story mission and ends up doing other activities along the way do you need to be contented to internet to install from disc or have to update before playing im looking forwards to watching the other two streams of this game ray oh man that is also my favorite line in that movie still quote it sometimes with friends why dont you make a video instead of a stream with a shorter amount of time rage two baby i get that ray likes a tidy gameplay experience but i prefer the videos with chat on screen so i can follow what he is replying to chat and also catch something from them that i may have missed having fun with this vid so far though so he got a new dog cool puts nicks armor over new armor tight fit but i gotta protect these biceps cant wait to get this game been a fan since the first one 31203 dont mind me just saving my spot cause of work dlc idea you go on an adventure with doomguy and your character just keeps talking about how ridiculousawesomeunbelievable the shit doomguy does 10645 do a flip i just think that what rage is trying to do is done better buy games like borderlands which itll probably demonstrate when bl3 drops btw cant wait for you to start bl2 ray was playing this for a few hours and had to stop when my brother walked by and said damn that life is strange lesbian complains a lot in this game too shout to ray having 1283 games yet still having 11 tb free im not sure if ray just forgets he has a dash or just refuses to use it check out my rage 2 videos let me know what yall think feedback would be appreciated 11230 shoutout to the ah first impressions stream probably 905 what year are we in even what team doesnt know how to make smooth ingame cutscenes this is the worst thing ive seen from an official company in a long time lol 2130 really really really jesus the blood is already gushing before the action takes place what even playing shooters on consoles isnt as bad its about personal preference i play on console and its fine to me i do absolutely not get why rage 2 has lower ratings than far cry new dawn they are both kinda boring when it comes to open world stuff and story but the shooting is so much more fun in rage 2 then in far cry and the soundtrack from rage 2 is amazing i could do races all the time just for the music 138 i care about the story been waiting for this hell fucking ya yesssssss purging time baby woooooo first love to watch the video to many ads on ya youtube there is 30 seconds of game play in the first 30 minutes its all cut scenes and pauses for tutorial moments it gets really annoying really fast been enjoying this game in some videos im doing about 2 hours in so far if youve played mad max or far cry the bandit camps are very similar clear out the area kill dudes open chest at end best part of the game is definitely the parts parts id worked on the shooting feels on par with doom minus the glory kills the shotgun is very much the doom shotgun with a fun slug alt fire when you aim down sights weapon wheels are a plus and the driving is silly enough well thanks to 20 seconds of this i know not to buy this mistake this feels like a farcry game just watching it this game reminds me of doom so sick of these games should i get this or days gone still better than fallout 76ill give it a spin this looks as generic as a shooter can be i love how this game doesnt even try to be serious its nothing more than over the top action definitely buying this today blood fire gore bad language and explosionswhats not to like better than that boring multiplayer snore fest called division 2 this looks so boring the first game is amazing and hli hope people dont overlook this game this doesnt have online multiplayer nothing particularly interesting to see here but i mean its the first 20 mins of the whole game so ill wait to see more gameplay for some reason this is giving me tank girl vibes down with the patriarchy am i right gals teehee is it just me or does the female protagonist sound a lot like erica mendez so we arent the same character of the past game ouch think i just cut myself on all that edge so far looks uninteresting and boring the first game made a better a impression for me idk but wouldnt you already have most of the abilities sense the player took the other high class rangers suit and he already had dash when he fought the mutant reminds me of far cry blood dragon megatron is really angry in the opening cutscene yeah going pass on these one this will flop generic and cheesy scifi this game is gonna flop so hard doom and far cry lovechild i like how they immediately kill the other player character choice and make them irrelevant like they werent gonna be the character u played as if u had picked them you can literally play half life 1 and play this the graphics and simulation is so underwhelming why are the animations so janky i was expecting this game but honestly boring character choices are boring and limited dialogs are cringey npcs are generic game is 9 hours long no multiplayer no coop repetitive mission design real money ingame shop already confirmed yeah i pass the first game was way better waiting for reviews so generic and cliche sceptic at 1st now must buy it even the commercials kept with the theme its not perfect but the presentation is excellent gj wow this game is definitely my cup of tea doesnt even read the tutorials wow choose any one 1 doom 2 rage i literally dont want to care about any of the characters shown here nor do i want to know more about them because of how badly the cinematics and dialog are done sitting at 73100 on meta read in depth reviews all say story is very short for a 60 game i will wait for a sale or something another boring killem all fps glad there is a plague tale coming out the same day its so much more interresting and mature 1550 are you kidding me did the ign dude really just try to walk though a window this game needs third person camera perspective lol dont look to have that same mad max feel as the first game i like how everyone is hating this game whithowt playing it it is cool to hate new games or what ill just wait a week for fitgirl to crack it nobody is shooting at her story doesnt seem to be the strenth of this game why is the sound mixing so garbage didnt she take the ranger armour from the dead guy how is ishe the last ranger cant wait till midnight avalanche fail again seriously how are these devs still employed smh its like far cry new dawn on drugs and doesnt have loading screens between cutscenes 500 reminds me of gears also this game looks amazing are they gonna port this to nintendo switch as well i completed this in 9 hours gameplay including doing side missions which is forced on you dont expect much pathetic gun sound looks like far cryblood dragon but not so cool what if red skull was added as a dlc i literally didnt hear the speech sounded like a cookie cutter bad guy speech anyways coulda put anyone saying anything does not impact the story any more or any less im still going to absolutely play it for the combat the writing seems absolutely atrocious so youre telling me if we pick the guy she gets axed and the guy is still called walker so they are siblings so wouldnt ones death be a big thing any way i can get some more exposition in this tutorial areas lol partner dies by flying door in first minute you as the character dont even acknowledge it day one edition hell yeah damn i have to be human enough this voice acting is so convincing i could almost feel like they are not really trained voice actors u r the only ranger bla bla whatever disappointing the promotional trailers made this look way better than it actually is just looks like a run of the mill first person shooter with a bland story and boring characters if i were you definitely play as the male walker cause his voice acting is better is it only me or the partical effects are under cooked game to dang short for 60 bucks dialogue is cringey awesome trailer generic gameplay ill pass sold take my money post the review thanks for saving my money on monster hunter iceborne and cyberpunk 2077 all female soldiers right off the bat thats a no for me dawg so basically doom in an open world oh sht here we go again same boring fps the first game was rushed with nowt to do m was short but clocked it 3 or 4 times though for the combat wow this is just generic and cringey i hope we see nicholas raine again you gotta love your woman characters looks a lot more generic than i was expecting i guess when you hit the open world you get to bring on the crazy will this be as bad as doom 2016 was for the emperor will this have microtransactions i wouldve bought it day one if it had coop still looks great though bethesda is never getting my support for their absurdly high regional pricing for the same usd5999 vampire bloodlines 2 rs1299 rage 2 rs 3999 always wanted a game version of mad max i think this would be it it look rage to me what review rating did it get looks generic rage 1 had something special arent you guys tired of open world games better be consistent and give it a low review score since the genre is being milked early squa why people always choose female characters it will have ingame real money shop confirmed yesterday sorry guys ill pass this is doo doo damn im first finaly d first thanks todd bethesda tells us rage 2 is going to have creation engine people are outraged id buy it for the trailer music theres not enough andrew wk in this world no andrew wk i do not want to puke thx no wonder things in this game reminded me of just cause 4 avalanche studios helped make this when trump finally gets rid of the brown people can i get an amen now this is epic it came out on my birthday i think what would be cool if you could create your own gangfaction to take over factions madlads the game as long as its nothing like the original its fine the original was so boring and repetitive i traded it in for gta4 lib city stories yeeees finaly i loved rage overkill big time now i like rage and play this always in ultra nightmare and can complete this without losing a life i like the way the game runs looks and sounds but i will wait to see what other options are when rage 2 comes out looking at this i will not pay full price because this looks and feels like doom and this for me is totally rubbish yes great graphics but that was it hated the game play of doom so have to wait and fingers crossed i dont know why developers go overkill on the sequel this looks funny d i hope it continues the story of the first one i want to see what happened to the new arks make it open world so you can play freely d omg yes played rage 1 on ps4 and i fucking loved it will be getting this 100 lot of flash but wheres the substance my dreams came true doom and mad max had a baby and its awsome is there pvp i hope the ending is not as weak as the first one oh my pants i hope id software dont mess this up and deliver it on time but i kinda worrying about the deliver on time part as id is also currently making doom eternal plus they also have to maintain quake champions at the same time i hope they have enough manpower to handle all the work i know this game about exploding everything but can we have a bow in game hyper realistic borderlands andrew wk rules i need this music please 044 if you pause and then you can say rick and rick and morty i hope you can create your own character because the first one didnt have a talking protagonist and he was basically just some ark guy with the disappointment that was rage 1 rage 2 doesnt has a very low bar to clear i think bethesda should just publish games instead of making them i was sold at andrew w k 100 gigabytes to install it on ps4 xd vehicles in avalanche games the horror yourvehicleisyour enemy because of the input lag uhhhh does anyone else see that in the video description it identifies streets of rage 2 as the game in the video rage 1 had the worst ending in gaming history nothing to do with the first rage i will not buy it this is mad max beyond thunderdome still playing rage 1 i am in the subterran city where there is music from from the streets the game rage 1 makes me feel that there are other people on the planetwith the same charateristics of myself who feel in a certain way a need for an adventure in the immaginary virtual reality storyline looks like mad max but with more advanced technology no rage 2 for switch fallout on lsd add coop and you got million more sales streets of rage 2 really youtube as a person who played rage 1 gotta say it looks so diffrent than rage 1 this game looks like doom mad max and borderlands all snorted cocaine and had a baby cant fucking wait to play it more pretty garbagetrailers look great but the actual games are garbage peas and rice i hate the marketing on this game looks gorgeous though what is the songd i wanna it hopefully this has more plot than the first rage i so cant wait i havent bought a game in over a year i will purchase this one either preorder or wait to see if a deluxe edition or collectors edition is released rage is still my favorite game on the 360 i guess it just syncs up with my personality my only complaint about the first one is i just wanted more suuuuper exited for this game so like borderlands and fallout and doom all in one i mean i know people werent happy with this being released but this looks pretty awesome andrew wk hell yeah this would be america if everyone was given a gun and 10 pounds of meth is this coop the game no one asked for and everybody is comparing with borderlands 3 looks unoriginaly fun looks like a mad max borderlands love child which isnt a bad thing this game is the american mexican border in a nut shell is this online as well it better be on the switch people will be banging on bethesda headquarters doors for promoting this a whole year before the release date i love games like fallout bioshock and rage they all have colorful neon lights and graphics so we get this and a possibly multiplayer fallout 76 yeah time to buy an xbox one thats not rage count down to the official gameplay happens on 10th june 2018excited if you were hoping to see borderlands 3 at e3 2018 then you might have to prepare for the worst according to shacknews a representative from gearbox told a room of journalists in may 2018 that a third borderlands entry will not be present at the show in any form but they will have other games to show off is that song a cover of counting the beat by the swingers or is that a copyright lawsuit waiting to happen also game looks dope af im excited to see how it comes along the game looks like doom gameplay is good but that logo my friend its so ugly not gonna lie i think a little something came out worst part is i dont feel guilty about it it reminds me of borderlands 2 in a way please be on nintendo switch hopefully this comes on the nintendo switch am i the only one that doesnt know the first game what is with all the pastel colours punk not dead its like mad max with steroids this will probably going to be a great game better than the first one dat originality tho coughborderlandscough ah bethesda made it of course it will be the great game nice to see some originality and not the same dyed mohawk anarchopunk crap weve seen before it looks as though well see interesting characters with a deep look into how a post apocalyptic world has affected their lives and not the generic faux crazy because ive got a crazy haircut and tattoos we seen in the 80s looks so awesome i already wanna play it if wolfenstein and mad max had a baby it would be rage 2 gameplay less than ten percent please dont have anymore texture loading issue like what happened with rage 1 and no more multiple disk for christ sake haha bethesda and avalanche fallout and mad max its beautiful i used to love killing the mutants for the in game tv show best graphics the original was a gem but seemed too short almost like they had time constraints and budget issues it wasnt unpolished though it hopefully this time around bethesda is able to take advantage of the rich lore and the open world borderlands 3 finally its a kind of son between shadow warrior 2 and serious sam fuckin aye its about time so excited i love the first one aside from the ending being shite we totally need a dukes of hazzard day one mod featuring the duke bois in the general and daisy in her roadrunner roaming the lands on a mission a mission to kick ass and bringing the hard taste of justice to the to all the creatures not deserving to live and jumping the general like a lot while conveying the important values of family and care for each others and righteousness and moonshine and american golden era detroit steel and airtime airtime like in the state of zero g mid flight majestically sailing through the air in complete silence silence except for that 383 screaming being cut loose from the drag of friction at the tire the cracking in suspension expanding rapidly the yeeehaaaaa scream you can hear over miles and the dixie horn proudly announcing the arrival of the the pride of the south they call the general lee i mean right before you pull like all the gs smacking into the ground on a flat landing like the columbia digging your steering rack sub frame and o the wastelands between fallout and mad max im in if someone knows the song id use the title 16 player coop campaign please please dont use just cause 3s engine 1 crash and ill do a murder borderlands titanfall fallout doom bulletstrorm rage 2 the psycho wonderland cant freaking wait is there a release date is this battlefield v trailer hmmm doom serious sam bulletstorm borderlands in 1 game i hope we can shoose between the factions and it will be real openworld mad max x fc3 blood dragon looks sick cant wait so this is boderlands 3 i think bethesda wants me to be broke bethesda never let you down dude i sold my xbox one buying another one tonight xd this game looks awesome where were all these fans for the first game andrew wk tunes id software 100badass finally dirty borderlands ripoff shame on you bethesda i mean people has asking new elderscroll so long and then this is what you came up with hopefully borderlands swipe this under the carpet and lay its badasstetude on it experience the wastelandthe way it shouldve been bethesda soft workse3 really wish i knew why fps trailers still use motion blur and 70fov and console aim youre literally downgrading your trailer rage one is my favourite game now i get an add about this pretty neat seems worth my money ive been waiting for so damn long hopefully better than the first one avalanche studios and rage 2 wild ride that will be game of the year what happend with id guys they doesnt work solo like in rage 1 or quake etc meybe im wrong about this examples but i think they was working well solo this looks apsolutely insane im buying that definitely buying this it seems a bit like mad max looks like mad max fury road and boarderlands inspired i hope we dont have to play as the good guys this looks different from the first one but it still looks cool hopefully its all in one disc instead of three reminds me of sunset overdrive fun upbeat punk while slaughtering a bunch of stuff sold for me ill buy this game for sure rage is back this isnt a gameplay trailer just saying the rage i wanted for the first game open world but will it run at 60 frames a second on console what the mad max game should be like fuck yeah rage what a game what a lovely game my equation for this game farcry big guns insanity rage 2 and last year cant wait for this i am also looking forward to agony reminds me of fallout borderlands watchdogs far cry and doom bethesda releases doom and thinks hey if we glue this to bulletstorm we can redeem rage this comment is not a complaint im so glad the boomerang is back this was so fun to use whats the song omfg the hype rage was criminally underrated but theyre finally releasing a sequel is there multiplayer im sorry i do not believe you you did a giant cinema for rage 1 i do not have to cheat twice i will look at the exit as it will be fallout raider simulator 610 too much rage id software sweet this has the potential to be fun as hell im gonna download but never buy i dont have affiance to bethesda anymore so where can i preorder if you make a game similar to mad max then please and make the pumping of cars as in md and pumping the character is more accurate than his weapons etc thank you so much for making a second rage because the first one was great and this trailer looks amazing thank you bethesda ive been waiting seven years looks like the combination of bullet storm mad max and fallout clearly a clone of stalker shadow of chernobyl from the trailer having the exact sentence of big fucking guns and so much action even doom blushed a bit i really hope this is basically mad max meets doom they go out and get wasted then decide to smash the world to bits if this game just doesnt take itself seriously and is a giant and hilarious actionpacked adventure kicking in the teeth of anybody in your wayid probably fall in love if i wanted a fps smoothie id put borderlands fallout and destiny into a blender and this would be produced the game looks like itll be a blast to play and love the different types of enemies and combat on show weve reacted to this trailer too and would be grateful if you guys checked it out if youd like to hear what true happiness sounds like haha when will it release its made by the people who made doom and just cause so theres no way this can be bad all you had to say was that this was being codeveloped by avalanche and i wouldve gotten the preorder i have mad faith in avalanche studios especially after just cause 3 wanted es vi but i guess this looks alright the nukaworld dlc we wanted damn this looks awesome how pre order doomstorm fury road finally came out omg finally this is the timesplitters of our generation on steroids though this is like the sunset overdrive version of mad max i absolutely love the crazy tone they gave to this sequel definitely gonna buy it borderlands with noncomic graphic holy shit hype hype hype the first rage was way too short i hope they made this game much bigger every time a gameplay trailer comes on i get so horny and this guy keeps telling me peggy is 18 as long as the ending doesnt get rushed like last time im happy and there better be a john goodman appearance or i will be very upset cant wait for this f yeah post apocalyptic world check mad max style waste land road warriors check mutants and giant mutants check mech suits and car mayhem check verdict take my money lol bethesda avalanche and id all joining for a rage sequel ok now this will be interesting i think they need to make a coop looter out of this like warframe destiny and borderlands for example but open world with rpg feel oh avalanche studios cant wait for a game to have a largely empty world with extremely repetitive side missions and story missions with no substance also who even asked for a sequel to rage rage wasnt a good game the song is another by andrew wk called party til you puke rage on everyone first scene with that grafik looks like shiti destiny but the teaser looks greate xbox x owners will be loving this high graphics and frame rates guess the playstation owners will enjoy it on their weak machines too should be illegal to put avalanche studios together with id software to create an open world action packed game what kind of music does it play fallout 5 looks great all new information about rage 2 yo can find on my channel fuckin hell people were shitting on the idea but this looks pretty sick yeah now im excited so fucking hyped rage was one of my favorite games of all time as long as the open world doesnt feel like a ubisoft game then im in looks like itll play like doom adrenaline surge in coming im glad avalanche have joined the development i need this game heres hoping in this one you can have stealth options first person mad max on lsd and meth set in america instead of australia this looks like a fallout 4 of raiders game lol i liked the first rage game even with the crap storybut all i got from this trailer is nothing looks like a mess where is the story is there one a game without one is not worth playingunless you love online multiplayer mode i dont see the point to this game ill wait to see a review or a better trailer before disiding and racing with cockpit view i hope id put a world even bigger than fallout 4 and with a lot of possibilities and variations this looks cool but if they announce borderlands 3 this might go under the radar what happened whit borderlands xd played the first game and aside from the texture issues and mediocre ending it was really good this one looks better than i could have expected im so piss off this is only on ps4 so when you cant beat borderlands or fallout join them aye i feel like crysis looked better than this graphic wise other than that the game looks extremely fun so this is basically mad max far cry i mean it looks pretty cool love u bethesda i hope it not end up with another settlement needs your help alright the gameplay looks weeelll not originally i would say simple and kind of boring but what i disliked is the games name rage good time to steal borderlands spot do it right and this is going to last years i personally think bethesda doesnt have what it takes to join this specific genre this needs loot lots of loot hundreds of weapons and some actual balance between them basically the oposite of what bethesda is used to deliver but we ll see as a bethesdas fan i really hope im wrong i would love to give those greedy bastards from borderlands presequel a lesson i would love to have this on the nintendo switch please make that happen im getting borderlands vibes wich is a good thing ofcourse whats the song tho been searching through andrew wks songs but cant find it i like this congratulations i am a punki surely this rage series cant be better than skyrim what a game what a lovely game what will borderlands do now so i never played the first one because it just looked really generic and graybrown but this looks interesting is it strictly 1st person or can you switch to 3rd person mode here comes the craziest game of 2018 this pleases me i hope it will run better than dishonored 2 not loving the douchebag punk vibe shouldve just made mad max 2 this doesnt feel like rage hope my mind is changed when we see more how nice of bethesda to remake borderlands 2 this is not elder scrolls 6 aready im skeptical of the gameplay value the combat looks mildly interesting and it seems that they have tooken popular pieces of hit games and combined them to create a mess of a game but idk tho im only basing this off of what ive seen in this trailer and the past rage game took them long enough i hope they have racing in it like the 1st one the trailer didnt show any that i could see this looks like a great open world game with doom graphics if it has the same optimisation and a good story and the same freedom and chaos of just cause this will be a master piece does this mean you bastards will finally get to work on the next elder scrolls game looks like mad max style driving and theme and quake gunplay why rage bethesda i loved rage 1 hopefully this will be even better bethesda shut up and take my money the sequal noone asked for to the game noone asked for realeasing in 2019 maby idk hope as soon as posible i love this hope its open world idk kinda looks like it if it had coop i would cream my pants this looks pretty cool imagine how amazing a fallout game could be if it was made with this game engine love bethesda rage2 hype iv waited so long dear bethesda you just took this game and made it better expect my pre order 1st new game in 2018 i am looking forward to rick and morty easter egg on 044 make kick ass character creator and you have mi money love bethesda and id even more now d rage one was awesome and graphically ahead of its time im looking forward to playing the second game this is when sunset overdrive bulletstorm and batman arkham knight had a night of drunken frivolity and produced a mutant of a baby hopefully a good borderlands alternative destiny 2 isnt doing great unless bl 3 is coming yawn another openworld game what else is new not this game that is for sure they still have rage when bethesdas fallout and doom have a baby this game looks n feel incredible i must play this game if i have to sold my kidney for it ill do it literally all they have to do to make this a success in my books is make it open world cant wait more like mad max with boom boom gunz bad trip shame theres no preorder option for canadians this feels like a mix af fallout 4 doom and mad max isnt rage 2 concurenting itself with fall out or is it something differnt apocalypse crazyness does fallout 5 comming i love the way bethesda trying to mess around with the colors yawn looks so boring the big question is if you have to purchase all side quests dlc and items in the bethesda creation club store that would be a great way to even further destroy the game looks better than good someone got the song name finallyborderlands 3 looking great whens the switch version coming p i do love the variety of landscape that was showcased and the choice of andrew wk it almost seemed too outrageously chaotic at times interresting change of feel the first rage was gloomy somber serious and this looks like goofy borderlands style we will see how it fits hopefully they add an ending to this one and dont have missions where you go to the same area youve already cleared and follow the same linear path maybe in reverse killing the same enemies you did before preordering the shit outta this music i really dont like how they try to bring magic into scifi by trying to explain it being science based like im mass effect destiny and now this seemingly oh yeah rage is mad max and bulletstorm had a baby please make it coop meh its trying too hard to be edgy borderlands did the overthetop stuff better and i think most people are over borderlands style games rage 2 should have been done by id software with them learning from the mistakes of the first game why do so many modern fps titles feel the need to cover a quarter of the fuckin screen with the weapon model im nearly done with far cry 5 and ive seen the same problem there too even maxing out the fov doesnt help i was just thinking that the driving and some of the environments and character models are really similar to the mad max game highly underrated btw and then avalanche studios comes up then id comes up ive gone from knowing nothing to wanting it only because of the people making the game will this one have a better ending because that first one was terrible great game and all but seriously switch hmm totally different than the first game man those were some doom references now i wanna play reminds me of bulletstorm god gamn this looks hella fun oh dag i thought rage would never get another installment cool d is this multiplayer borderlands with cool graphichs i want to play this fucking game i mean rage was so anticlimactic that this just feels like a waste of time especially when it looks like a reskinned borderlands but is there split screen coop need something until 2020 when borderlands 3 is anticipated fallout mad max this single player traditional offline campaing like the first one this is singleplayer streets of rage 2 i dont like it looks like multiplayer gargbage rage 1 was a good game except for the ending co op please say yes this game is different from the last one the first one was a mix of horror and action this is a hole new game cant wait to play this game wonder if the wingstick will still be instakilling god looks great love you bethesda this something i wasnt expecting or wanting but now that its expected i want it i liked the first rage a lot this looks like some new ideas have been added which is cool i am concerned with the double jumping power using forcepalm looking parts it just looks very similar to how destiny trailers look and i really dont want some mmo moba pubg thing if its not single player or coop focused i will be very disappointed the mechs look cool and are a great addition so no concern their why the hell are people so salty stalker 2 has been announced for 2021 lets fucking goo time to build that hype boys and girls doom 2 or five next please better not drop the ball on co op hope the story is decent this game just gave me a boner just a small spoiler im gonna be in this game too never heard of rage before but this was looks pretty cool i wonder if theyll bother actually putting an ending in this one maybe with a decent boss fight rather than the anticlimatic wet fart that ended the first game also mutant bash tv xd finally ive been waiting for a second rage for like 10 years lol this looks badass im getting it played original rage felt like inside mad max i loved it it was scary not to scary caves are creepy n they hit that phobia destiny 3 rage 1 amazing game unfortunate ending though this however looks like its about to beat its predecessors cheeks red raw i loved rage 1 i thought theyd never make another one heres hoping its good oh guns and explosions and explosions and guns anything new so game finally completed lol i dont feel the mad max vibe anyone else the first rage was my favourite game every hair on my body just stand by watching this doom on steroids with cars idk what i just watched but it looks pretty cool so im interested okay first thing first we need the war rig chumbucket strong from fallout 4 the chain gun from doom and the a princess in distress quest from witcher 3 for no reason why this is our demands do it and we will be very happy thanks will there be loosum tummy big guns wide open world or just wait for borderlands like a good patient boy i promise it wont be as faggy as the presequel song andrew wk party til you puke if its gonna have doom vibes and if its gonna be at least partially as fun as doom was then kindly please take my money its pretty much a mix of falloutborderlands and destiny it seems one meteor wasnt enough ehhh would a rather borderlands 3 which soft drink is this ad for 103 dude ive been waiting for this since 2011 i did not expect these graphics on an open world bethesda holy shit might think about it in a post apocalyptic world i wanna hear andrew wk in my tape while shotgunning a beer and shotgun some heads please have coop on pc and please please please dont have pop in textures my god i loved the first game so under rated but for the love of god no pop in textures please seems pretty good but futuristic a tiny bit but ill still buy bethesda do big and beautiful so well frickin awesome 4 player co op please if you are tired of pretrailer before the trailer bullshit fashion write fu pretrailer on a comment below man whatever looked like this that i am just glad that id is making some games when i see their logo makes me fuken day i am old i am nostalgic i am from quake 1 days ha ha ha feels kinda like mad max and bulletstorm with a hint of doom i likey take my money please this looks cool but i got a terrifying feeling that they are going to destroy the first games atmosphere imagine being so entitled that when a new game is announced you say i didnt ask for this what a shitty community to be a part of anybody know the name of that song having a difficult time keeping my panties on right now the game is open world nothing in this trailer makes me want to play this it just works is this some mp only shite i hope this time it has better scenariocause first one has no good scenario dont look very special for nowwaitsee i guess its like mad max and sunset overdrive had a baby im throwing my money at the screen but the game doesnt come out rage 2 looks like what would happen if mad max and borderlands 2 had a baby its beautiful about bloody time this game was made bullet storm and mad max had a baby rage 2 this reminds me of a mix of titanfall and mad max soooo this is their big release iamverydisapointed okay you have my attention i was thinking about this game looks like fallout and mad max combine and there on my screen pops up avalanche studio wow so excited loved the first one though it had some flies 044 i could watch this 10000 times so fallout with cars basically wallmark knows after success of doom 2016 i couldnt be more excited about this this is awesome can you still strafe jump though multiplayer plys i hope you can play multiplayer with 4 or more people this is not game play this is worse than the live action trailer hell yeah sounds like deacon having a problem recognizing the inconsistencies between his lies get it together deacon its the commonwealth and the bombs fell not the asteroid doom style open world game hell yes first wolfenstein comes back with a bangthen prey is fantastic now outta nowhere rage 2cant wait this better has a mods support this game looks great juggling with a gun d looks super fun taking a game that imo was already great and making it 1000x better like a hybrid of destiny and mad max i never ever even thought about that bethesda is making rage 2 its just blowing my mind the first game was ok i played it rage 2 its just blowing my mind that last scene was straight from call of duty commercial flark yes this game looks flarggen awesome you better not downgrade the graphics mad max on crack cocaine this game looks fin awesome finally were never getting cars in fallout are we i hate rage but after seeing this trailer i fucking want it 044 the face looks like rick from rick and morty looks cool hope theres lots of cars and gun variety races and all that cool stuff from the first rage 2 the spin off game until the big one comes just please tell me well be getting doom 5 as well i need my fix man tonal clash poor editing the crescendo culminates at 041 with a dude slashing at air ooh what a renegade truly no rules fire then sue your ad agency looks like it might have the intestinal fortitude to replace just cause 3 as my new favorite over the top openworld shooter color me intrigued is that walmart thing for real is borderlands 3 coming the music is party till you puke by andrew wk i mean this looks nothing like the world of the first one and it doesnt even look like it takes place in the same universe but ill see how it turns out honestly this seems more like a doom game than a rage game that makes me afraid that it is going to ruin its balance of atmosphere that i believe was the first rages strongest points is that single player or multi i liked what id did with doom 2016 and i also like what bethesda publishes last years this one looks fun ill likely buy this game but why really hope theres plenty to do in the open world and hopefully it isnt repetitive andor boring love the bfg reference rage where is the new elder scrolls a big meh here mod support or fail i hope this has battle royale i love how game play trailers are basically cinematic trailers nowadays guess those walmart leaks were real original rage wasnt without quirks but i liked it yup take my money rage 2 is this a remake i didnt expect a sequel i remember finishing the game it was purty cool count with my money bethesda loved the first part cant wait for this to me it looks like theyre incorporating what made bioshock amazing into a game that fell short maybe itll be good maybe itll be a flunk we will see cant wait to see this running on my xbox one x this looks very promising this borberlands mod looks pretty good ive never heard of this but im hyped af now doom borderlands fallout hell fucken ye 045 what song is that what kind of scifi madmax doom wolfenstein is this im already in rage for this avalanche studios made the criminally underrated mad maxi am in did bethesda buy them man andrew wks music is so much fun im wondering if itll have coop is this america lol new brink trailer looks awesome getting vibes of doom gunplay great borderlands charactercool and something else i cant put my finger on seems interesting i hope it doesnt flo the gun play reminds me of destiny 0 appropriate choice of music being as how i havent thought of that game or band in years the game looks fun but andrew wk is some cringe music to choose how to stop watch this huh description matches the game elex im actually really excited the first was good but was okay this just looks fucking awesome and fun af like someone injected borderlands with steroids haha i wish they used bad reputation by joan jett for the song omg yes finally rage 2 i really loved rage 1 i played it when i was like 10 or something either way it was an amazing game maybe this one comes with an actual second half of the game smells like bethesda trying to have a multiplayer fps shooter online my fucking god this game is awesome combined so many components of others game and this came out of it a creation of bloodlustfpsdriving open world massacre helli played with doom but this game worth its prize for real i never seen any sick game like thismaybe borderlands series but this is way sicker than that game bethesda and idyou always come up with brand new ideas to improve yourselves and thats good to know great job getting doom vibes from this definitely gonna buy and give it a chance why cant we just get a fallout game that follows the lore to the letter but this fallout 5 looks good looks like another generic shooter dat fov tho since i havent seen any new borderlands announced im on board they should put in the advertisements this time with a ending that wont make you feel like you wasted your time playing this game for the story ok im honestly surprised youd bring back this series the first rage flopped right like majorly if memory serves me well so why bring it back it sure looks fun wide open world is great as long as there is something to do in it aside from go to the other side of the map kill 69 rats and then go to the other other side of the map and bring this to me and ill make you a microbikini made of dead rats ass hair this game looks insane like literally this reminds me of borderlands 2 batshit insanity looks like this may be the mad max game we always wanted so another generic open world game that will most likely just rip off borderlands yawn rage 2 the borderlands 2 doomsday rage easter egg become true its says 50 off on rage 2 and doom 5 there is rage 2 now how about doom 5 madmax fallout same clunkyness or is this same engine they use in recent doom whats with these dumb and cringey hair styles replacement for battlefield i been waiting so long for this i had absolutely no interest until i just had interest reminds me of far cry style set in the fallout universe looks entertaining the game we didnt know we needed what track is that was so hoping it would be rage 2 they unveiled d i think i need a cigarette and new pants from watching this 019 what are those storm troopers couldnt hit that stationary wax doll whats the music sounds like motorhead marketing of this game is so cringy lol this looks like the love spawn of sunset overdrive doom im sold i had no idea destiny had a baby with mad max congrats looks hella fun when the asteroid hit like fortnite interesting crossover the shooting looks kinda lame it has no bunch doesnt feel like rage 1 tbh rage one was more like fallout this one is more like borderland bulletstrom ish less mature imo feels more like coop multuplayer games with short single player not sure i hope it turns out great since i loved the first rage game looks amazing but slightly disappointing if this means no star field at e3 will this be online or more of an rpg style game i wish id helps to correct avalanches bugs just remember just cause 3 didnt like the mad max game it was just kill this and kill that and world didnt feel immersive that pulls me in i hope avalanche didnt make this rage like mad max because original rage was not full open world but the way they created world felt open and mission were really good and felt immersive lots of people didnt like rage because they probably hoped it would be like fallout even though different studios rage had something special that always pulled me in the way game looked the way world was created and how missions were felt immersive and realistic and it was one of the very few games that you can forget about everything and play game as you are in the game very few games are immersive like that didnt like the mad max game it was just kill this and kill that and world didnt feel immersive that pulls me in i hope avalanche didnt make this rage like mad max because original rage was not full open world but the way they created world felt open and mission were really good and felt immersive lots of people didnt like rage because they probably hoped it would be like fallout even though different studios rage had something special that always pulled me in the way game looked the way world was created and how missions were felt immersive and realistic and it was one of the very few games that you can forget about everything and play game as you are in the game very few games are immersive like that looks a bit too silly for me personally i really hope it inst a procedurally genetared game with procedurally generated fun if its a borderlands clone it will fail it if its a destiny clone it will fail if its a singleplayer game it wont fail looks a bit like destiny but actually fun and interesting me likey very much potential day one buy looks awesome rage 2 you guys from bethesda better repair and release quake champions first i see the same character movement and abilities in rage as if programmers already switched project it about fuckin time looks like the sjws have taken over the game industry every trailer has a snippet of a cutscene that has a woman beating up a man but never the other way round could there be a chance of remastering the first cause if this is coming out id like to play the first again god i hope this is co op this is one hell of a game love child a sort of open world mad max but with just dumb shooting nothing else like an outside doom if i see another shipping container in a game im going to die lol will b getting this 4 sure though so its like fallout huh but on every drugs in the rainbow a shame cookie cutter clean narrator non threatening characters with silly coloured hair and music that doesnt go with the premise however the other 70 looks great the love child of borderlands and sunset overdrive im really looking forward to this game im so happy this made my day stalker 2 seems pretty good during teaserppl look like mehi hate rage but when this comei have faith on humanity lol i really love rage beforethe very impactful weapon soundsmooth gameplaythe only i hate just the world become empty after the runnothing to do hope they do better in rage 2 okay will it be a true open world this time thats all i want from a new rage fallout 5 is that you any multiplayer or nah still gonna buy this game i have a problem i cant stop watching this why avalanche studios is helping idand i know with which mechanicsdrivingmad max was good in driving ohh what a day what a lovely day never played a more brokenunfinished game than the original rage i couldnt believe any company would release such a mess of a game and promised myself that id never buy a bethesda game again trailer looks good though please tell me track playing in second part of video the music is unbearable please change it to girls just wanna have fun thanks in advance there will be epic story on this journey what happened to star field i dont want a madmax fallout game this trailer would have such a bigger impact on me if it was a surprise showup at e3 when noone was expecting to see a rage 2 yeah if this has multiplayer this will be getting copped now this looks much better than liveaction cringefest trailer im actually interested now anyone else get the feeling that this is a vessel for a new engine i feel like they chose a game that nobody was really expecting sort of as a pilot run for a new engine everyones been talking about how bethesda keep using the same engine thats been outdated for ages maybe this is a step away from that im in commentary channels are quaking knowing they have new background filler mad max titanfall fublished by bethesda damn oooh two hours of game like the firtt part suckers i didnt like the first one but this looks good well ill be damned theyre finally going to put it out meanwhile rockstar releases a new story trailer for red dead redemption 2 i love bethesda games but i wish they wouldnt waste their and our time with generic crap titles like rage 2 they build the most immersive open worlds out of all developers yet they waste it on a game that might as well not have one 110 bethesda at least this crap is out of development fillergame fallout 5 with cars of mad max fallout and doom had a baby that was raised by mad max i wonder the size on gb of the day one patch to just starting to correct the crap that always comes with bethesda games o hhh yea i look in to the future and i am whatching the same auto tunning depending on your sistem crap feature of the first one as one of the seven people that actually enjoyed the first game i can honestly say this is a welcome surprise you can sell a trailer like that in usa but dont even try in france this is atrocious the game itself doesnt look like containing purple haze fumignes lol and those silly punchlines for teenagers wow this is so dumb i hope its gonna be good this time this with some rpg elements tossed in could be pretty nice i hope we get third person as an option they turned rage into a bro shooter andrew wk has convinced me to get this game avalanche studios mad max game possible do the car gameplay god ive missed rage when doom guy comes to earth better than destiny 2 and 1 saints row meets fallout skyrim 9 for the ouya like mad max fury road but u cab play it down af to be honest this looks lile doom 2016 gameplay with a rage 2 skin in need elder scrolls vi gameplay looks really cool and fun its as if doom banged mad max and had a colorful crackhead baby i dig it its like doom and fallout had a baby on steroids awsome for me first rage was rly funny game with good shooter i liked second rage wait its just doom with the color pink it looks like a colorful hipster abomination with probably sjw content and retardation culture lol ill wait for ion maiden this better wont be a online game essentially its a open world colourful doom ugh raiders already got sick of it from fallout 4 knowing you the trailer is probably hyping some broken bugged and unfinished game just like fallout 4 was however nice job on doom i have low expectations for this because i felt let down too many times by bethesda but i hope that im wrong and this turns out to be a decent game please please please be a decently optimized game that runs fine with a stable framerate this looks cool but the double jump bs and powers are gay and overrated garbage lol mad max doom wolfenstein in the same game wtf borderland 3 looking a lot more high def but whyd they take away cell shading andrew wk yeah im getting this game like if youre buying this looks gorgeous and fun o insanity rules 059 are there plasmidsvigors in this game so am i the only one who noticed they spelt borderlands 3 wrong the actually gameplay doesnt look too bad but overalll it cant be denied that it looks to be a bit of a rubbish borderlands clone now especially when you watch this trailer after the cringeworty announcement trailer simple make it long story like witcher 3 with tons of stuff to do bethesda where the elder scrolls i hope they expand on the original game and make it a tad bit similar to fallout with lots of side quests a compelling story all that jazz its not fallout 5 tho doom plus mad max with what looks like some shades of bulletstorm thrown in im down lol rage was a decent game but the shittiest ending ever no replayablility my god so the leaks was real looks like a mix of wolfensteins gunplay dooms movement and a bit of fallout raider behemoth enemies looks a lot like borderlands im just hoping its not a bust like the first one this is basically fallout on meth wellok i just hope its better than the original rage oh fuck yeah i need to play through the first one again rip off of borderlands oh boy i was in rage when i was told rage wont get a sequel it seems he was wrong hahaha thats awesome i am going to play rage again damn getting that ps3 days when he did the most outrageous twist on the ending this game takes place after the first one were you awaken the other survivers from their underground cryogenic arks will it be available for mac naaa joking i was skeptical until i saw avalanche studios now im on board fallout on meth heres hoping the reason you keep pushing skyrim is because you were to damn busy making this here marble hype is real i wonder if it will be solo only online only or both i really liked rage so this should be pretty good but thisthis puts a smile on my face like a punk version of doom finally a game i can actually look forward to playing looks promising im one of the 7 people that enjoyed the first one please dont let this be the substitute for fallout 5 i didnt get excited for this whatever it still looks good perfect so this is borderlands in a mad max world rage 1 was garbage but i expect nothing less from bugthesda the good thing is bethesda usually announce games not far from their release like fallout shelter was announced the day it came out so time to play rage holy fuck thats unexpected since when were we supposed to be excited for rage i saw bethesda and said to myself i wouldnt be interested unless id made it now im probably gonna buy it looks ok would have preferred doom 2 but this could turn out ok well thats a proper release trailer not some weird crappy liveaction stuff i hope this one is better than the first and there it is fellas the gaming community falling for bethesdas bullshit again lol who the hell wanted this finally a proper trailer hell yeahhhhhh i want it has that doom vibe to it as well rage 1 was under rated got it for like 3 and loved it ending was shit thou walmart leaks on point so far how many channels are getting paid to leave positive comments please dont be 50 off within a month and probably would be buggy af day 1 it says bethesda want it now omfgso sick suddenly a wild preston garvey appear rage is one of those games where you play for an hour and then for the next 6 years you keep telling yourself that youre gonna finish it i hope this game is better rip fallout please add a co op mode first one was rubbish but this looks pretty decent ok im in im definitely in the elder scrolls 6 coming up in 2045 reminds me of mad maxx and that is looking like good fucking old rage yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaa the nut hasnt stopped since yesterday ok now this seems more interesting rage 1 was alright but i hope this one does have a talkative character and a i dont want a generic ugly blond guy i want to fully customize his appearance totally bogus opinionrage is a great game sure its not perfect but ive been playing fps for 20 years and this game is underrated if anything the sequel will probably rock rage was so good i could get the sequel without knowing anything about it fucking amazing i loved the first game even though it was unplayable most of the times due to bugs this looks like a grown up sunset overdrive i am so happy i loved the first game so much and now years later i get to see the sequel im so ready lawbreakers could of been this if they had original ideas rip mad max and destiny crossover someone pleeeeease tell me if its going to be multiplayer hows ready for over the top doom style fucken fun hope the gameplay is fun looks so fun cant wait to play it so how long will 2k wait before releasing a borderlands 3 trailer to respond to this i loved playing the first game but was extremely frustrated with the rushed incomplete ending i have been waiting for this well that was interesting cant tell if this is borderland 3 or fallout 5 preorders for a game that doesnt come out for more than a year and a half no so basically doom meets mad max im sold and yes i know that avalanche studios created the mad max game and id created doom its like fallout and borderlands had a baby can also feel a mad max vibe as well omg its a love triangle 119 holy sht they brought back the cerebral bore as a boomerang weapon shit count me in omg rage is comeback whao its amazing gameplay trailer like the gay sjw brother of fallout not gonna buy it heck i dont even want it as a free gift kick ass song alright this looks dope yep rage 1 was a hidden gem now this is gonna be a gem on a pedestal hi hopes low expectations there goes my birthday money literally who asked for a rage 2 tbh lol looks cool this has battle royale written all over it try to not keep it too open world looks great though like if sunset overdrive had a baby with fallout and got adopted by doom bethesda id avalanche now thats something you dont see everyday im sold man i hope this shit dont release in 2185 i thought destiny 2 came out last year this game was apart of my childhood for real cool another game full of brown didnt realize borderlands 2 had a new graphics mod but to play it it had to shut down the bazillion rng gun generator sounds like jason brody take my money honestly rage 1 had its problems but i really liked it definitely stoked for this oh another raider dlc for fallout 4 another announcement before e3what will you show us there bethesdaaaa add the game oh i guess this confirms the amazon leak missed you i mustve played rage through at least 5 times in its day and felt it held great potential as a big franchise the first game was almost like an extended taster thankfully the makerspublisher behind it have not given up on their new ip and are willing to give it the blockbuster treatment it truly deserves welp unzips pants here it comes they sunset overdrived it its a good thing rage had a lot verity to it or else this game might end up like sunset overdrive this looks awesome big guns open world count me in anything to move on from the overly disappointing destiny franchise first of all elex is better and second of all why is the xbox case infront of the playstation and pc cases is no one else in uproar of this blasphemy fallout mad max this fin awsome the first person gameplay looks wonky and weird please keep it co op please all i can say is why just take it for what it is ffs it looks refreshingi am in damn open world looks like far cry yes this will be amazing its like the lovechild of borderlands and fallout the best game i never adked for i need it now will it have a cliffhanger ending like the last one 112 hehe bfg reference needs more cocaine uncontrollably shakes where is doom 2 well shit i did not see that change of styletone coming still buying it because i loved the first rage i was excited until i saw bethesda not a buy with the history of game releases lately dont get your hopes up looks good dont get me wrong i hope to get it if it comes out alright just dont let the hype train take you away if no mans sky sea of thieves and others have taught you anything i feel like this has e3 syndrome i want it for my nintendo switch looks cool but i already kno borderlands will do better id sign me the fuck up what is the song fallout with doom and far cry im on the hype train shut up and take my money blows off the dust from rage disc fallout 5 the raider story time to revisit rage fallout mad max borderlands doom and far cry had a baby i think its a boy i like the cover art i loved the first rage and this one looks like doom and mad max had a baby i love it this is a engine the next fallout should use rather than that trashy one theyve been using since skyrim and fallout 3 i liked the first one this one can only be better i also hope the soundtrack will be as awesome as the song they used here 100 boomerang is back ubercool what no battle royale mode yeah im loving the pink mohawks us grrls are gonna rule the wasteland yahoo yeah were not gonna be endlessly raped and enslaved yahoo rage 2 battlefield red dead 2 ill be hibernating at my pc this winter looks sooo much better than the first first 4 hours of rage 1 was great after that it was a hard struggle to finish so this trailer didnt sell me i expect that whole trailer happens within the first 2 hours then the game is down hill from ther looks beautiful what mad max couldnt do you guys nailed it 10fps for my potato pc all i wanna know is mick gordon doing the soundtrack p haha looks sick though john carmack rolling in his grave avalanche studio and id software this is an interesting turn of events might give this one a look thatll do when does this come out i wonder if theyll put in mods support for consoles rage 2 battle royale v very next and no preorder or season pass bullshityet on one hand surely it cant be worse than the original on the other how often do you get a sequel to a bethesda game thats actually better than the one that came before it i cant wait to play this looks good but i hope they dont go too far down the borderlandsbulletstorm lol so randum an crazy path i liked the pseudoserious mad max tone of the first one i will own it please hire john carmack and john romero ummm their alliance about to lose with aim like that 0019 rip chances of a new fallout hey look its borderlands 2call of dutydestinyfallout 4 i want it so its in more of a suburbian area with forest no doom 2 then hopefully they actually let us pick up guns off of enemies this time will be release the next year theres rocket jumping heres my money so just a bethesda competitor to destiny and borderlands looks like a mix of destiny borderlands a bit of bulletstorm and the robots from titanfall with the cringeworthy edginess quirkiness and how do you do fellow kids 2hipster4u tone of watchdogs 2 colour of sunset overdrive and the edgy tryhard and taken entirely too serious qualities of far cry 3 and 4 with cringey humour from all the mentioned titles splashed on top see very little of rage in this or any sort of arpg it really looks like they phoned this one in and are catering to a very specific and casual audience shut up and take my money fallout 5 name of the song yessssss this is was i was waiting for rageaholic here and i approve of this trailer over that awful pink haired gym teacher last one this will be my first preorder deluxe ditch the cheesy rock and pastel colors all together this is rage baby i loved the 1st rage when it was on ps3 so im definitely buying this one especially since it looks so sick looks like a really strong hit nice job i love that ducking buildup looks like this will be a stereotypical apocalypse sorta thing then turns around and goes mad max on our asses so excited oh my god yes i have been wanting a rage 2 since the day i finished the first game back on the xbox 360 and you can clearly see the influence of doom on this game just yes this actually looks amazing doom mad max sunset overdrive thats a combo that i can definitely get on board with sick but will it work with vulkan i think my computer will shit itself if this doesnt have vulkan be rage 2 not borderlands 31 id like 2 different games here not clones please heck ye return to cyberpunk desert i loved the first one beyond happy this is actually happenin and it will come to brazil with the double price joke this needs a soundtrack i hope this game comes with a 3 or 4 player co op so i can play the missions with my friends looks fun cant wait just cause 3 fallout doomthe best combo about god damn time oh shit theyre playing party till you puke by andrew wk thats sick finally a game i can play to replace battlefield1 i just hope it doesnt havea bland lead character like rage 1 or fallout 4 okay that looks pretty cool im so fucking excited loved the first one gonna play through it again right now on pc if i cant change that field of view then i cant buy the game llooks way cooler then fallout to be honest and i love falout wow this looks great man no thanks your still making fallout 5 right it doesnt feel anything like rage1 which is a good thing why not save this for e3 normally id be happy but this is the new bethesda so it probably means the game will have its price doubled in australia and they will force paid mods on us and call it innovation this is the future that liberals want yes sorry not just yes fuck yes i guess that diwali coloured chalk dust from farcry 4 goes everywhere is this a mod of doom do not ubisoft this up avalanche if its anything like the first one im in mate d but the final boss fight has to be better this time id like to fight something enormous just like in quake and doom bethesda and avalanche xd its looks like fallout advance warfare editions launch trailer should be to the tune of party party party because i feel like the devs are fans of helsing ultimate abridged rage was a failure and they make a sequel lol looks even worse for a new game it looks like they might actually achieve what they set out to do with the first one bethesda needs to fire their marketing division the initial trailer looked cringeworthy but the moment they showed the gameplay it got me instantly hype looks like they are taking the speed from nudoom and just throwing it in an open world which sounds good to me it looks absolutely amazing but i would rather have elder scrolls elsewhere of a new fallout dammmmnnn i was really hoping avalanche games were working on mad max 2 in rage the was an easter egg saying 50 off on rage 2 and doom 5 ironically it came true in 7 year since 2011 this is doom but its outside this looks like dooms combat system this game is trying to be borderlands ill wait for the sale bin two games for 40 im such a dad son im not dropping 117 aud on a lousy game that will make you feel isolated aggressive and suicidal wait so we have destinys melee with avalanches mad max driving with a borderlands feel and a fallout theme half the people who were doubting this game are now all about it the other half are sitting there with a smirk on their face like yeah well well see when it comes out i liked the original game the story was meh and the boss fights were shit but the vast majority of the gameplay was really fucking fun uh fallout would you mind if i change game for awhile mad max doom hope they throw a little bit of fallout rpg sistem in resemblance of borderlands who else is excited i was a little skeptical but this looks badass well the first rage is certainly interesting but storywise its shit hoping rage 2 to be better its literally far cry blood dragon and doom people were hating all over this on bethesdas instagram teases of this game saying stuff like waah why make a 2nd rage where is next skyrim waah seems like people changed their minds open worldgreat looking gameplaystudio behind mad max and just causeavalanches car combatids great shooting mechanics and gunplayand if the story is good this time and the guy who made the soundtrack for doom 2016 makes the sound track for rage 2this could potentially be game of the year matireal borderlands mad max hell yeah im in gonna go buy the first one and play through it so looking forward to the release but please god do not let that screeching noise classing itself as music be in the game damn rage was so good im really glad it got a sequel fuuckk yeaa didnt even know they were making this i loved the first game open world huh so they have destiny gameplay but a borderlands meet fallout aesthetic hope they make this fun hah this looks like its going to be a blast and people were rolling their eyes at the leaks about rage 2 d i was down before but now im downer i have to admit this looks sick hopefully this year heck yeah im sold holy shit welcome back rage looks ok but no trailer is good enough to make me do something as stupid as preorder can i press like button 1000 times hmmm very skeptic about it will wait a bit after realease to see reviews and ill try it myself to see how it holds up but on the spot the reveal trailer was kinda off putting this gameplay one looked completely empty and this is worrying very mixed feelings about this oh hell yeah im definitely fucking getting this game when it comes out if this aint coop they can rage on ma dick not gonna lie this looks nothing like the first rage but im going to try and remain optomistic probaly wont get it if it doesnt have a fov slider though im going to need a better toaster this looks fucken awesome fine then wow its like borderlands had sex with fallout and this was the abomination that spawnedill adopt this baby for sure looks focking wicked m8 anybody smelling the downgrade too omg i love the first game i always wondered if they make another game for it and now i got a officially answer if this has an rpg element or maybe the same system for loot drops like bl or diablo then we can call this an open world borderlands with some elements from mad max and fallout pls the optimization plsss holy fuck its colorful just hope it dosent come out near october i was one of the few people who absolutely loved the first one i dont know why it gets so much hate i understand that they tried to do a lot of different things therefore halfassing most of them by spreading themselves too thin and the ending was atrocious of course but ill always remember the thrill of boosting through the dunes and the soundsfeels of the weapons were fucking spot on i loved all the minigames and i felt the game was actually pretty immersive im stoked for this doom mad max this is what u get this looks like fallout mad max and destiny in one game looks more interesting as a multiplayer than single player no switch version boooooo lol okwhy am i getting destiny vibes from this looks interesting and im the sceptical sort when it comes to open world games lets see what the game will contain fallout 4 the good version the hype is real hype post apocalyptic teain here i come woooooh cant wait for it and cant wait for e3 this year okkkkkk this is the trailer i needed to see cant wait to see more looks pretty awesome looks fucking amazing just wow never beat rage 1 though i loved it but avalanche studios as well damn im excited looks a lot more fun mad max was solid looking forward to it art style is nice ooh this looks really good i cant stop rewatching the video over and over mode battle royale is coming rage meets bulletstorm yes please also a ps4 and xb1 remake for rage would be cool id sell titanfall and destiny for this game now do fallout 5 ok just dont fuck up the ending cant wait i am so goddamn happy right now also does anyone know what song that was i want to tattoo it into my soul its weird the game looks like rage but at the same time something about it doesnt not sure how i feel about it maybe its because it has that trendy graffitti colorful with generic pop punk music style to it which the original rage didnt have its almost like this game is not taking itself seriously and going for more arcade when the original rage had a more seriousness about it the ending to first rage was pretty epic said no one ever day 1 purchase season pass digital complete deluxe collectors anarchy edition ok now i have one question when plz for nintendo switch looks like a mad max and farcry5 failed abortionbut i guess i will have to play it i hope this is good but all i see the the teenage offspring of fallout and doom apparently neon hair dye is in abundance doom meets fallout with a spice of borderlands kind of surprised they didnt wait till e3 to reveal this hell its only a month away its like doom and fallout had a child but the child got lucky and ended up looking as good as doom im sold far cry on flacka wolfenstein shooting avalanches mad max vehicle gameplay sounds like a sweet deal i actually dont mind this please do not use denuvo and i will buy this day 1 this trailer was much better than the teaser trailer im wet its little similliar to bulletstorm yup thisll hold me over until borderlands 3 comes out i hope this hype will be good at last fallout 4 maried doom and gave birth to a mohawk neon baby whose name is radical extreme esquire the 3rd this is fallout 4 lol to all the youtubers who made a video doughting shit please the exit is to the left dumb ass bethesda thank you for your good a games i love you 3 the vehicles look like they handle similarly to the ones from mad max which isnt the worst thing if they bring back the vehicle combat system in its entirety over from mad max too then it should be all good on the vehicle side no doubt id will be handling all shootingfirst person elements why would the make this sequel the first one sucked maybe because its not impossible to improve it in the sequel if borderlands and doom had a baby i bet the game is nearly finished or maybe already finished im not surprised if they release it on sept oct this year edited its a shame it will release spring next year im so hiped on this i have 1 tiny problem it looks a bit to much like doom switch version cant wait to play this on the xone x its going to look amazing in 4k doom mad max open word rage 2 brutal still would prefer the elderscrolls 6 hopefully next year epic count me in this is being made by avalanche so this is like mad max part to right im down af to buy it mad max fury road the game call of duty black ops 3 open world edtion so wheres the gameplay please tell me its not shared world bullshit that its single player awesome game like the first one until i know theres a decent story behind it pass for now omg im so ready to play this game and also make rtcw remastered thats how borderlands 3 will be look this is what i wanted to see i was a bit scared of the final look of the game because of the yesterdays teaser but watching the gameplay and now that i know avalanche studios is involved remember mad maxs creators i can breathe a sigh of relief i enjoyed the first and im interested what direction this game will take with avalanche being one of the developers this is what fallout 4 should have been hype is real havent played the first one but knowing bethesda it will at least be passable but this looks great they gave it the saints row 34 level of bat shit crazy to it i approve of this sold definitely preorder from me hope there is a normal coop compaing this is so crazy hypeeeeee real question here where is the ailen not going to lie this looks pretty fucking awesome like if doom 2016 and mad mad had a baby something is very right about this game this is just rage their tagline should be rage just cause yesss rage on if this runs any less then 30fps locked on consolesdont bother with the open world and this needs destructive environments postapocalyptic doom im in love its like doom and fallout together mmm i dunno if i like the overtop approach the first one was cool this looks promising i had vague memories playing the first rage with my cousin but i enjoyed it for what it was maybe this sequel will fix many problems from the first rage finally something i look forward to so this by the creators of doom and the guys who made just causemad max take my money now looks like something i would have enjoyed had i been 13 years old i dont know how the first game was but i prefer something grittier like metro 2033 or last light to this reminds me of rage 1 and brink great presentation but horrible execution both were fun in their own right but both had such glaring issues that were hidden in the presentation and completely made the products trash rage if you play it its fun from start to just about after you get done with the mutant city which is half way rest is literally the same crap more bullets and the driving and races really and i mean really took away from the game you want to have the best car out there in the waste to not be annoyed with the random attacks you get yourself into well you gotta do a crap ton of races and other crap you most likely wont have fun doing you want to go through the gearheads or whatever faction that had all that metal armor in a reasonable amount of time too bad youre going to blow through 10000 armor penetrating rounds and then run bone dry out and still be pushing their compound it was an annoying direction they took the game and i was super hyped for it when i this is what happens when you combine id software and avalanche studios aint it good that developers make games they wanna make and not only 910 games making 908312903812948091254812903 dollars hell yes loved the first one cant wait i hope this game adresses that pathetic ending from the first game congrats bethesta on betting your cards on a rage sequel me differently than most people apparently weas really into the first game and loved the setting im really glad that well be getting this sequel and even more with the studio that brought us mad max looks incredible is this going to be 1st and 3rd person like f04 andrew wk party till you puke i wonder if rage 2 protagonist is the same guy from the first one nicholas was it would be only fitting considering how anticlimactic r1s ending was imo would be cool to see old characters return like sarah from dlc and my bae from the first game loosum i loved the first rage but a part of me for this one is worried its just going to be another fallout now dont get me wrong the only reason i feel that is from the open world and how it looks with the enemies remind me of ghouls and such i just hope its similar to rage 1 where the focus was cars and fast paced combat where as fallout is much slower paced it looks like thats what the game will be so hoping bethesda adds some game play similar to how they handled dooms gameplay to make it stand out compared to other titles they make that are open world first trailer left me a bit meh but this has definitely caught my attention now cant see shiet because of this blur thats how you are supposed to make a game ea stupid sons of bitches looks incredible its like doom and bulletstorm had an open world baby i fucking loved bulletstorm mad max the good videogame im still waiting for es6 on my way to the corner market anyone need anything never played the first game so i wont be bothering with this one its not a game that ive got any interest in so ill save my money for something i actually care about why ps4 this great but looks like theyre going for a borderlands vibe but in their own way liking it so far though hope pc version it will not be hold down by consoles this looks really good although i was hoping it would be more colourful like the live action trailers tone suggested this is still a massive improvement over the first though hell yeah but please bethesda no graphic downgrades please music and marketing materials cover stills etc steems to clash with the acctual game footage it tries so hard to be colorful loud and energetic while the ingame footage looks bland browndrab and muted just like the first rage this looks really uninspired shut up and take my money it looks awesome just like the 1st one was lol love how the sheep have changed their tune yesterday it was we dont want rage 2 i wont be getting this and all of a sudden today its wow this looks sick man grow the fuck up mmm is this multiplayer or singleplayer because this trailer is not clear enough maaaaan i want to play its previous part but it dosent work so i am gana try again to all the people who said why do we need ths and its pointless what now game looks awesome not sure whats with the super powers but whatever xd this game looks meh to me ill wait for reviews fuck yes thank you for making a rage 2 as the first one was amazing for its time it looks like the new doom and rage1 had a kid hell yeah bitch rage 1 was fucking awesome cant wait to play this one needd moreeee goonssss i hope this game isnt capped at 60fps as well does this mean no starfield i just finally beat rage recently and now they decide to come out with a sequel itd be really nice timing if i cared for the original this game looks sweet as hell but the first one ended on a what note i liked the ai in the game but the story seemed to evaporate right when it was getting captivating not sure ill pick this up got so many other titles to work through takedowns on mutants the trailer released yesterday was fucking trash this one has my attention rage 1 had promise but was ultimately a letdown for me i hope they build on the ideas that that game had because that would make an awesome fucking videogame plz dont have unnecessary headbobing i loved the first one but it made me nauseous all the time i seriously hope this one is gonna be a sequel to first game as awesome as borderlands 2 was for the first one and it seems on the right road i need this at first i was skeptical but it actually looks like a ton of fun so how difficult is it going to be to commandeer one of those xabungleesque mechs as much as i like this gamei hate to say it but can we please have a switch port as well rage 2 the borderlands 2 of rage series made by the same people that made the new doom and wolfenstein im already sold please for love of god do not make a checklist open world game and lets hope it doesnt have cringey humor and its just an advertising stunt niiiice gotta get the sequel right guys coz the first had a lot wrong with it haha first game was crap why are you idiots getting so defensive when someone makes a negative comment this looks like a sit down and smash everything have fun type open world its id softwares so it better be great like the trailer well shit this looks better then that shitty teaser from yesterday im getting some heavy brink vibes here with the oversaturated colors and the garbage people and thats a good thing this world could use more colorful gritty shooters looks cool well im hope on doom ii announce oh what a day what a lovely day looks like borderlands meets madmax with just a smidge of wolfenstein looks super cool and fun awesome the first one was amazing i just hope they stick with what made that game great dont liked the trailer yesterday but this one is insane looks little bit like doom in the outland it looks like the first rage has done 2 or 3 steps further but you can see its ragethe battles the races cool cant wait top play the final game i just want starfield totally mad max vibes im sold i was hyped from the live action trailer already but this just seals the deal for me my only concern is the pc requirements ive got a ryzen 5 paired with a gtx 1060 6gb dual hoping it will at least run better than the console versions otherwise ill buy it for my ps4 instead wow well i want to see a true gameplay combat looks funny i was afraid to get my hopes up for a sequel the first game was fun even if flawed in story and replayability the second game looks to be a far more scaled up game with hopefully similar mechanics and fun factor i cant wait for this game to come out graphic looks nice however the premise and gameplay doesnt really grab me that much just a personal preference i guess edit i just watched it again and really noticed the cars this time okay i can see how the car gameplay will be fun looks like mad max honestly fucking well better not get preston garveyd i sincerely hope that after the shallow radiant minecraft clusterfuck that was fallout 4 youve learned that decent games requre a decent amount of depth mad edgy to the max hyped where the fuck is borderlands 3 ahh yeahrage 2looks fine i guess who would rather have the space game that we thought i think the space one would be cool but this looks like a cool mad max fallout but ive never played the first rage why the fk double jump doom v mad max ill ave a bit o that pretty much cheesy doom they nailed the music in this trailer rage is all about being crazy and just fucking kill every living thing in the world hell yeah im down for part 2 would be more interesting if the protagonists in the trailers didnt look like theyd get triggered if you said there are only 2 genders well this seems awfully redundant as avalanche also recently made a mad max game perhaps they reused like 23 of assets from that game cranked the color saturation up slapped an oversized fidget spinner on top of it and called it a day s loved the first rage despite the crappy ending wing stick was great fun definitely getting this borderlandsish vibes for me lol might get was skeptical when i saw the teaser but thank you the actual gameplay looks amazing mad max open world game done right hmmm whats the song when it kicks in high action borderlands far cry fallout rage 2 fallout 4 story edition certainly exitcting and happy to see the rage 2 first part was simply amazing its like watch dogs and saints row took jabs at farting on each others faces and puked and crapped this crap out after the poorly thought out game that was rage this is refreshingly badass looking bravo id bravo indeed i am so fucking pumped right now mad max x doom makes since with id and avalanche like tony hawks proskater and fallout had a baby so a watered down fallout how much u wanna bet it has a battle royal for the adhd kids you know this is an id game when the reveal trailer is 90 gameplay and not just cut scenes keep them alive bethesda keep them alive looks fun anything from id is a fun shooter looks good with it looked a bit dark and grittyer and less cartoony its like doom mechanicsgameplay in a fallout like setting odd but lets hope its a good game looks like it would be fun bethesda and avalanche sign me up i loved rage and i like andrew wk so im hyped i loved the first game cant forget of the clouds in the first game too bad theyve changed it but thats ok its just a detail calling it now this is basically going to be far cry will buy it when they give it a coopcampaign the ending from the original rage has to be the worst anticlimax ever to exist on a computer gameand i completed the original et please dont let the work experience guy do the ending of this one if its anything like fallout or tes then im all in hope its multiplayer i cant believe this game is getting a sequel im surprised and down for it i didnt ask for this and i still want it bonus credit for the andrew wk song this looks like fun i liked the first game apart from the ending this looks like trash though and i knew why as soon as i saw the insignia for avalanche pop up i dont know how to feel about this yes i loved the first rage i hope they show more ballistic weapons not a big fan of energy weapons borderline titanfall fallout days gone warfare its like fallout with cars give it time ign and the lot will be saying its the dark souls of open world shooters looks fantastic looking forward to seeing how intense the gameplay actually is i hope its not this hioctane all the time i prefer exploration over action anytime borderland 3 will destroy this looks great hope it comes out this year or early next year never played the first one but this looks pretty fun a 144 ago i did not know i wanted this why did you remove celshading from borderlands nintendo switch the question is megatextures or not yae this will diffidently keep my distracted till borderland 3 is announced and released diggin the punk theme i was skeptical until i saw that avalanche logo pop up now im sold this is batshit crazy i love it hell yeah loved rage cant wait for this this will quench my thirst for post apocalyptic games im sure if they dont have that dope ass card game in this one im out i can play that shit for hours this game better be super difficult we should be able to suffer from decent ai and ammo scarcity improving the badassery when you wipe a horde of raiders off of the map with improvised weapons and movements all of the animations taken from the newest doom im afraid that its going to be another game made with lowest effort pretending its not im not sure if my love of andrew wk is blinding me to anything negative in this trailer not made by id really i liked the original game but the overworld stuff was kind of bland hopefully they improve that part hopefully they get rid of that dreadful camera wobbling to simulate walking from the first game hard to tell from this video thomas hobbes state of nature someone primary concern is gameplay but i am curious since the game obviously has a story and character driven side quests will the ones in this game be worthwhile whats with the shitty framerate what kind of borderlands is this the spinny frisbee thing reminds me of the soul cube played the first i bet this will be better lets just wait till the game comes out then we can judge it then dont make it to the point where you just it and dont make it where you will discourage new or vet players i wasnt impressed with the first one but ill see how the second one goes i really am fucking with this this looks loads loads better thank goodness the wingstick is back loved getting my krull on in rage 1 is it better than the first one cause i dont even remember the frist one its not like i wanted a new fallout or something its alright i always wonder why hype something now that is not going to be released for another year or two why not keep it quiet for a bit longer rage 1 was decent until the abysmal ending oh how ive missed decapitation by wingstick first game in many years im kinda hyped for remember me as a young teen beeing super hyped for rage it didnt blow me away its was good thou pretty damn good cant wait to see more of this well done boys please let it have coop please let it have coop i wil be happy it it is close to beaing as good as doom 4 thats all i am hoping for if t is as good or beter than it great but i wont over hype it thats yust asking for pain i hope they keep the sentry bot you could deploy in the first game looks like a decent sequel lol the xbox channel showed this and i thought it was an exclusive but no no offence doom but this looks better that borderlands 3 trailer looks nice looks pretty cool so summer of 2018 right please seems like bethesda allowed id to give the franchise another shot nice do not dissapoint me like last year bethesda thats all im gonna say well i wasnt holding my breath after the failure of the first game this video has changed my mind slightly but videos have done that before lets wait until release fastpaced fallout the first trailer must have been a combination of it with this one to little game footage in the other to get hyped for anything by the way so glad nuka world got its own game dont shoot dont shoot idk why i saw so many new journalists asking who asked for this gee willickers guess game devs can only make a game when fans want it well after the new doom i certainly have my hopes up lookin good hooooly hell just like doom but with mad max style my money is ready take it the teaser literally had the same feel as the gameplay trailer its gunna be pretty insane while still being a serious shooter i am unsure how it is cringy then again thats the cool kid word nowadays didnt ever expect a sequel to rage loved the original and hyped for this looks about how i expected as well the same great driving probably better considering avalanche made mad max and i remember that driving being solid and the gunplay looks more doom esc and hopefully most importantly enemys wont be bullet sponges this time my only complaint with the original rage where is the n switch hell yes mad max y doom are the best friends yes loved the first one when it came out so im happy xd i hope it runs at 60fps like the first one i suppose that e3 does no longer exist and thats why you have to announce it in a random date could be a 9 could be a 6 well see please tell me theyre gonna pull off borderlands 2 here this game has nothing to do with first rage and this is not a compliment double jump really this looks great however there better not be microtransactions of any kind associated with it psycho another settlement needs your craziness ill mark it on your map fucking hard pass this is a let down the teaser was eh but the gameplay trailer oh my and there goes my wallet the first game was meh this is too late for me zero interest i think i need this played the first and loved it except that hand game pissed me off but i beat it this gave me borderlands vibes even more so than the first rage lets wait for broderlands 3 e3 and ill decide from there doesnt look like the old rage i hated this could be good fun is this remake of the first one with the actual ending the first one sucked i love bethesda could this be game of the year material bethesda please native support for multiple monitors this time the previous version took an effort to get it working at that resolution oh no i feel so bad now after seeing that the leak was right poor developers fuck the leakers fuck me want that everyone should watch this trailer with the 025 speed option you can find it in the options setting of this video if avalanche is helping develop this then im hoping they make the car combat just like mad max 2010 called they want their graphics back my only issue with the first game was that it ends so abruptly being open world part 2 might not end at all lol im excited basically looks like borderlands 3 now this this is better than the first trailer in fact i see the game better than the first rage now i think i ll still prefer the first one but he s looking so cool d if i can run it insta buy really like the color palet so long as i give a shit about whats going on in this open world hoping it doesnt have a large sandbox with nothing fun to do well thats way better than rage 1 this boosted my testosterone levels by at least 111 alright the first teaser sucked but the shooting in this looks fucking incredible will the card game be back what fuck mad maxfalloutwolfensteinrage this is really cool id tech 6 99 here and vulkan api the first rage game was a bit of a disappointment for me with what i felt was a generic storyline and basic shooter vehicle segments tacked onto a shallow enemy variety corridor shooter but this looks a bit promising though uncertain given the change in tone and avalanche having to step in probably will wait to see how it fairs before deciding whether or not to get it i need a new fallout game im so fuking hyped man when is this coming out well damn might be worth a peek autocorrect lol its meh i guess will have to see more first i am so fucking down for this man i hope id will port this game on switch id software is there at lest we know it gonna be well optimized at first i was like who tf asked for rage 2 now after this trailer im begging for it looks like regular trash from bethesda trailer of the e3 2018 show i admit i was initially annoyed with the rage 2 announcement but not gonna lie this actually looks pretty cool im happy to see an open world fps game im sold so give me the release date plz you killed itim out this is like if fallout mad max and doom merged together lit basically what borderlands was going to be before they decided to go down the cell shaded path im more than okay with this this looks awesome glad to see rage back in full force surprised i didnt see any pre order now and get the super dupa deluxe edition to get minuscule in game things so we can make more money with avalanche on this game i have very high hopes for it the perfect choice of music the pace of the gameplay looks great just what ive been wanting lately cool but i still want new doom more since the release of doom i dreamed of rage 2 on id tech 6 2 years later and boom dreams really come true i guess yep thats all i have to say yep would have prefered a fallout by obsidian but ill take it i was concerned with the previous trailer but this this looks awesome i say bring it on id bitches love cannons not digging the whole cringey insane world theme the first thing people do in villages or towns is make rules and laws and some semblance of order authority is inherent in humans its not like people go buck wild when nobody is looking rather have brink 2 tbh screw this i want the elder scrolls 6 the soundtrack good as always i never ask for this please dont break the pc version this time take borderlands bulletstorm mad max doom titanfall and of course original rage give them to avalanche and we could have a killer open world shooter my only reservation is them leaning too far into the big guns schtick which i think is well past its sellby date we dont need another lawbreakers in tone well this was unexpected more vibrant than the original now to dust off my authority pulse cannon mad max from avalanche studios on lsd no more questions thats all i need that fov is insanity what was the point of yesterdays trailer again but where is authority soldiers 044 is that rick sanchez i spy oh boy cant wait for another on rails empty bug ridden bethesda open world game release this is literally borderlands without cell shaders avalanche studio now i have serious doubts about this game but i like the varied environments though oh yeah this is gonna be the most greatest insane game ever looks like doom and mad max put together in a world where rage 2 is announced before tes vi so this is the skyrim of mad max nice one walmart canada andrewwk one love 3 borderlands with cool graphics i really liked rage 1 despite tall the shit it got i really hope to see this game being good too the game will not look this good mark my words seeing this trailer i get wet i was wondering why this game seemed so much colorful avalanche studios im hyped please no more texture pop in ugh crysis mad max any other bethesda game rage 2 heeyy who did put doom looks really good this is insane not on swtich looks great hope this doesnt take me 5 hours to beat like the first one did loved the first rage super hyped about this personally id change the cover art youd probably sell more copies if you do track pls the first person perspective fallout game i always wanted well looks nothing like first rage but more like bulletstorm and im fcking ok with it i love bethesda bets on battle royal mode i cant believe it its true hopefully they have in depth rpg elements alot to take in at once looks worthy of postponing es6 production a cooler destiny then looks just like borderlands but with realistic graphics sold out i quite enjoyed the original game despite its flaws and the horrible ending with avalanche studios behindim very interested it looks like a lot of fun random dude we need a new bulletstorm bethesda hold my beer idk guys this actually might be pretty good they wouldve learned dark and creepy to pinknot what i would of done i want to like it but they seem too focused on the silly bollocks pvp multiplayer okay i admit this might almost be worth seven years and the disappointing story of the first game will this pick up right where the last one left off though cant wait for the switch port a year later do you have to have played the first rage to understand this game yes yes yes yes rage 2 at last i hope they dont fuck this up though out of all the games i was praying for a second chance rage was at the top of the list i dont like the scifi elements at all the guns especially well there goes my epilepsy no doom 2 this looks good though firt trailer was cringy now this one has me very intrigued okay bethesda okay you got my money made by the guys that developed mad max im sold is this like mad max but with esteroids i never played the last game 109 random predator clicking sound lol cool cant wait for this as long as this is open world and good but thats a given this will literally kill fallout for me looks great just sack the guy that made the promo trailer could this be the vr action adventure in the works they were mentioning on their website i damn sure hope so also want first person driving finally i waited for this for too long d i liked the first if the trailer is not lying i definitely would love the second p what kind of borderlands is this fallout bulletstorm and borderlandsi love it is it connect to rage 1 in some way because im still not sure what happened to the protagonist the resistance all the arks that opened we gonna tie up some loose ends there in this game fallout meets mad max meets cocaine rage is my favorite game said no one ever my pc is sooooo not gonna run this i want to join the authority the sequel no one asked for forget fallout 5 game of the year right here some sort of mad max bulletstorm doom looks pretty good so its basically just borderlands but without the cel shading got it this looks like a significant improvement on rage one and somewhat inspired by doom i like it though i like the original rage too hopefully they pull it off thank you so much i loved the original and this looks even better this is going to be one of the game im looking forward too is anyone else getting a borderlands farcry vibe with this call of duty bulletstorm mad max rage 2 i hope the enemies are somewhat spongey this game gonna be bad this game is not for hardcore players i prefer rage 1 gameplay hopefully it doesnt suck like the first one d this feels as if doom tried to be borderlands not bad people keep saying nobody asked for this but i was always quietly waiting for a sequel very nice open world calls my attention will have the 3rd person option or just 1st person view okay the teaser had me worried but this this looks fucking epic welcome back rage is this borderlands 3 wont show the word ass but the trailer was 104 seconds of bloodshed this looks like my kinda game i love over the top gore like gears of war 040 are the 2 dudes wearing the german stahlhelm wtf avalanche is working on this game im hyped it looks interesting and all but it may be all smoke and mirrors yeah i think im gonna get this so long as its not online only which considering who all is involved theres a good chance it wont be just online only but it looks awesome cool bring it on i love this doom now this shoot them all d haha looks awesome but i am afraid of the lore and atmosphere hope it wont be fcked up why because first rage was the game that didnt look like anything else but now people associate and compare the second part with games like doom or mad max in my opinion perfect rage mustnt be something like doommad max rage 2 no way actually looks really good what a day what a lovely day was the first game also a non cartoony borderlands i remember it being quite serious mod support cant wait for this i loved rage 1 i like the plasmid jump thing okay ill admit im intrigued looka good but i hope its more serious than what the song makes it seem lets leave that for the next borderlands and those people saying no one asked for this you dont know what you want let them innovate chaos and punk i can see whats done here rage ending didnt fare well with me an open world concept and endless frags wont change a thing unless mayhem and shenanigan between all faction disturbs the landscape this is the first trailer for this game i dont remember the first one and neither should you okay now this looks sick are they going to continue where they left off with the campaign yes intensifies now this is how you make a trailer all i want from this game is for boomerang to work so perfectly well as in previous one the creators of the fallout series by bethesda just cause series by avalanche and all the doom series by id software holy crap its like a dream come true this games gonna be dope af sothey add glory kill system so borderlands but more realistic i see small dead maps with fake looking layouts that make you follow them in this video hope they were just for the trailer yeah im totally down i actally liked avalanche games mad max and doom 2016 i one of my favorite games so im really hyped for this now this is a big improvement looking forward to the game what fallout 4 should have been is this an addon for doom no nintendo switch i hope this is coop looks like mad max mixed with doom and fallout enjoyed the first one so this should be great idk why they didnt just port it to switch not bc i want it because they have the id tech base engine code already running on switch like all they need to do is compress assets and minor work arounds in terms of rendering and ai it wouldnt be that hard for what its worth in terms of profit but okay fallout borderlands mad max rage 2 rage was one of those games i thought wouldnt get a sequel guess i was wrong the first game did seem like it wouldve been better of it was open world to begin with so they went with that ugly ass liveaction trailer for the box art why the mad max game that ive always wanted am i the only one who actually liked the first onedespite the ending and wanted a sequel since then looks fuckin sick hope its 60fps on consoles this years e3 is already better than last years bring back the wing stick looks like that walmart leak was true guess i wont be surprised about anything announced now lmao the gun play is almost the exact style as shadow warrior 2 awesome looking forward to it war war never changes looks like a destiny and doom mix with hopefully a better open world experience looks pretty good i wasnt keen on the original this looks like a improvement over it basically what if id and just causemad max had a baby thats rage 2 for yah who else missed rage avalanche studios worked on this i dont need another reason to play this i really want to support bethesda for their sincere efforts in trying to save single player games in todays time is the first rage worth going back to ive never played fallout with cars made by the studio that made mad max count me in if this has the same gunplay as doom im already sold that game played like a beauty kinda have no idea what to think yet its very different from rage 1 so far dunno if thats good or bad shut up and take my money be cautiously optimistic and keep your expectations low in a good way why are you using andrew wks music thats amazing as long as it has a normal health bar and not regenerating health like the first game im in also a snapmap style thing or a sdk would be cool too it was great that they added rage to the backwards compatible program this one will look and play best on xbox won x bethesda game are all shityy gotta love that ending i hope there is coop i bet this will be more of a fallout than fallout 4 was eh less doom more rage would have been nice hopefully this has a story to it the first one was pretty good firstperson action looks stiff as all heck when for nintendo switch doom meats mad max fucking awesome jokes on you bethesda ill just keep re playing your post nuclear role playing games holy shit it looks like mad max doom which is amazing i hope that it has the smooth and awesome gameplay likr dooms and the selly yet serious story like wolfensein 2s this looks sick asf rage 1 was a great game now we have it with updated graphics will buy on day one tes 6 would make everyone alot happier and generate more money so essentially bulletstorm 2 im hyped for rage but wheres my new elder scrolls so its litreally ids last game mad max at first you had my curiousity now you have my fucking attention looks like if they mixed mad max with the style of sunset overdrive i happier see rage again man this is going to be good its going to be a good open world game now hype is real please dont spam it with a shitload of unmemorable weapons that we have to spend 5 hours total at choosing which ones to use the original rage was perfect at this this looks really worth something to hype for borderlands bulletstorm doom all together this reminds me of that game lawbreakers i really hope it doesnt turn out like that the sequel nobody asked for why has no one noticed rick sanchez yet at 042 first one was good could have been better i feel like this is bethesdas take on borderlands less guns but has the potential to be amazing rage 2 mad max beyond border lands hope this will be fun with pals and single player much better than the announce trailer if non coop i might by it in the cheap bin later if it has coop i want to play it as soon as i canlol rage was excelent rage 2 will be better i hope a lot of people arent happy that they are wasting time on a title that didnt sell well and wasnt that greatly received i for one enjoyed the first game and i love the art direction they are going for this one hopefully the pc port is good i never played the first but i always wanted a sequel to mad max im glad avalanche is getting another shot at the post apocalypse genre this looks like a lot of fun i just hope that there isnt too much open world busy work looks like a better e3 this year not like the past 2 years first thing come to my head borderlands farcry5 this trailer im impressed buying this for sure as long as theres a demo to try already looks better than destiny 2 oh deer this game is insane d no thanks framerate seem bad the ubber low fov is absolutely atrocious i fear the besthesda half finished game but that can be fun with proper optimization proper fov weapon model fov fk your weapons in your face settings options on pc not fked up by 50 drm layers to kill performances like our dear ubisoft do lets see what fallout 4 should of been noice do not screw this up bethesda get panic button on a switch port pronto please holy shot that looks awesome awwwawawa waited sooooo long for this mutant bash tv cuprinos and wingsticks all return fuuuuuuuuuuuuck yeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaa definitive gameplay in real time would be much better thanks wow its like skyrim with guns year of gaming god of war rdr2 and this whats next i never expected one of my favorite games from last gen to get a sequel thank you bethesda and fuck off walmart canada wait youre not from the vault anymore whatll happen to the defib mechanic just tell me theres coop switch hopefully it is better than the first rage game any way this will be coop sure would love to run through with a buddy this time around this looks entertainin one of those games you olay even after the story cause of the gameplay and open world also seems like a non cartoony and more grounded borderlands any info yet on whether this will be multiplayer coop bethesda id avalanche fallout elder scrolls doom quake mad max just cause 3 this is the game development equivalent of that us basketball olympic team with the nba players the voice at the beginning reminded me of tom hardy narrating mad max see bethesda you can have vehicles in your fallout game ive been wanting this avalanche make great graphics and open worlds but the framerate on just cause 3 was miserableee and the game was tedious hoping this is way more engaging i loved the first one omg o im so hyped id tech engine avalanche design its sure to be a looker and fun running on an x1x im just left to wonder what will be put into the single player its sure to have some multiplayer aspect which always takes away from the former i loved the dark atmosphere of the first is the case big enough to hold all 12 discs hmm not sure what to think of it looks like too much action for a bethesda game but who knows it might work release date when i played a bit of the first one but got sidetracked by other games and never went back it was an ok game but no lasting hook to keep me playing the trailer for rage 2 looks interesting but im keeping my expectations low considering all the overhyped flops as of late absolutely loved the first definitely was slept on and overlooked words cant describe how happy and excited i am for this well its still derivative as fuck but ill admit it this looks fun it is smart of id to team up with a developer that has more experience with open worlds that was the weakest aspect of rage 1 looks like a mix of harry potter chamber of secrets and ty the tasmanian tiger i remember getting the first rage game for like 5 bucks at the swap meet but when i opened the game box the simpsons movie was in there bootleg edition i hate mexicans lmao if this shit is less boring and better balanced that the first im all in boy horrible weapons what is this i mean of curse its apparently rage but this is not rage at all neon splatter wasnt rage all about human conditioning and inherited violence why is suddenly all happy go lucky version of doom first rage spoke to me this one is cackling to my face unless the open work is done correct this doesnt seem right and i loved rage 1 yes please i loved the first one back in 2011 cant wait for this one fingers crossed for a faction system woo fallout 5 i love how i was right this game looks way better then rage 1 but why does it just look doom but its the desert like the double jumping is cool i guess but that electric katana seems cooler lol to all the people screaming you dont want this when it was announced bet you changed your mind quick huh lol i taught he will say when the asteroid hit we were normal people but now we are animals xd i might be in the really small minority here but i loved mad max the postapocalyptic world here looks great feels like it wouldnt be empty and the gameplay looks so damn good i never played the first rage but this actually looks amazing and the overthetop craziness here is what i crave for in games like these looks like we have a winner on our hands omg it looks so awesome i hope its better that the 1st one bethesda youre like the best when it comes to these type of games fallout 3 4 is the best games ive ever played and new vegas i own the first game even that horrible optimization and graphical bugs couldnt stop me from finishing it i love that concept and theme i remember that apc song that was used in the first games trailer counting bodies like sheep to the rhytm of the war drums so i am looking forward to play it i hope it is not multiplayer oriented nice work beth far cry just cause looks like a ton of stupid fun like just cause but i need to see more of it i need actual gameplay not a carefully edited trailer i hope theres an e3 gameplay dermo of this this game looks batshit crazy im in 100 so much of this looks like fallout 4 lol maybe now the fallout franchise can go back to being an rpg and not an action game this looks like serious fun not feeling the music but who gives a fuck its all the badass games put into one hey lookits the new bordeohh wait fucking m e n t a l i l o v e e e e e i t t t t feels like mad max doom borderlands 2 thats the combination im looking for blown away by how good this looks cant wait now looks amazing but the whole music in the background and hyper crazy bullshit marketing really not doing it any favors def will buy as most if not all bethesda games have been my cup of tea yay and rage one was an excellent tech piece but lacked more content wowthey added jetpacks to the new codghosts2damnit really looks like a cod game so switch version announced at e3 then oh god no no they fucked it up its literally doom and call of duty now seems like way more things to do compared to the first one hell yeah just another shooter oh yeah im hyped now not a fan of over the top action its doom but open world yet another open world again and again and again would be better a semiopen world like 1st rage where is my new fallout so i can feel slighty dissapointment hard pass wheres fallout serious sam remastered this looks fucking gorgeous looks like a combination of mad max bulletstorm not bad looks fucking beautiful hopefully mad max sized maybe bigger definitely gonna buy this we want annother doom halfway through a drive in the game wait i just heard of a settlement that needs help let me mark it on yfuck off preston we need a quake 1 reboot or continuation like doom 2016 slidedouble jumpearthquake all from black ops 3 very original include ids logo on the wolfenstein games too damn you everyones waiting for elder scrolls 6 and we get this no switch bethesda i thought you were going to support it i dont trust bethesda that muchbut id software is involvedand i know i can trust themlooking forward to this 3 plus im a sucker for borderlands like games ok now im interested its doom for the gameplay mad max for the open world avalanche studios and bulletstorm for the craziness i love the 3 games i buy first day wow i wasnt expecting that at all that looks so good day 1 buy for me was not aware avalanche were developing this im looking forward to this even more after knowing that this is america this game to me looks like a much more hyperrealistic graphic style borderlands and it looks fantastic first one sucked this one looks like borderlands and far cry mixed together wtf is bethesda doing eww well the fov causes cancer so here is hoping the is an option to adjust it give me my punk rock filled ecstasy train doom shooter in a box right now ok ill admit this doesnt look bad i might buy it looks freaking fantastic good luck if it has to compete with borderlands 3 the first one was pretty good but went unnoticed hope people give this one a chance im disapointed what happened to at least fallout levels of realism who built this tech where are the resources etc etc edit or wolfenstein level of realism etc it looks alright still where starfield at force bethesda to make bgs to show it hmm that walmart leak confirmed one game so far lets see if we see borderlands 3 just cause 4 and others from the list soon looks better than the first borderlands mad max the hd remaster so i guess waltmart canada was right hmmm tho the ark survivor has powers now interesting so this is gay version of mad max maaaan rage had some awesome characters dialogues and ideas but not enough time was put into it it was pretty fun i can tell you that this looks even more insane and diverse with huge bosses cars recycledpartsmech things and mutants i just love the fact that they gave rage another shot that world was hella immersive and i loved the rpg elements though i dont even like rpg games game seriously going after the feel of borderlands like the first one why dose remind me of fallout hopefully the framerate holds up fallout doom also theres cars rage 1 felt to me a bit like a technology demo built into a game for the sake of fleshing out remaining bugs i enjoyed it but the characters werent very engaging textures popping etc i expect we will have a much better game with rage 2 please actually have andrew wk music in game you already bought the rights to two songs doooo it so is this game like boarder lands or something now thats what i call a trailer perfect mix of mad max and doom sounds interesting tbh just looks like destiny with a different skin i will pass im sold in fjhjhs saneeeee doom hotline miami little bit of bulletstorm and maybe there will be farcry capture 50 towers like that i love rage but i hope the main character is mute again oh yay this actually looks amazing that cinematic trailer was terrible but the gameplay looks awesome looks cool didnt play the firstbut i am interested free up 300 gb of space on your pc everyone i hope this game isnt gonna be over the top all the time i enjoyed the first rage so much especially the gameplay im not a fan of the super jumps and what not but im optimistic waiting announced for nintendo switch wowthis is sooo honey fun and now everyone doubting that they might make a good game this time quiets down so you are telling me we are getting a dystopian setting with doom play style here take my money if this game has character skills develepoment its instant buy for me if not its an instant nope for me well hello borderlands glad to see you again mad max doom edition yea see thats much better rage 2 or wolfenstain 3 i hope we get coop in this game with it being open world dont judge a book by its cover just because you didnt like the teaser trailer doesnt mean the actual game is trash all of a sudden some people are too quick to jump to conclusions i hope theres an actual story looks like we get abilities this time which is badass isnt that the guy from sherlock oh i remembered borderlands celshadingless judging by this gamelpay trailer its beginning to look to much like its following dooms footsteps not sure i like that gives me the vibes of being super repetitive not listening to all this this its not what we wanted hate rage coop is definitely in my top 10 favourite xbox 360 games im hyped for this looks great wow borderlands 3 is geting no outlines and celshading looks very generic to me does not remind me of the first rage gamerather bordelands and bulletstorm its looking really good but theres something on the back of my mind that still causes me concern about this again dont screw it up i really want to like it fallout mad max borderlands this yeah looks sick af love that box art i like how bethesda adapted to the leaks i respect that looking forward to the graphics compassion when this comes out and looks worse like all trailers hmmm i hope the dark and eerie look still finds its way like rage 1 had the coolest looking post apocalyptic look and feel i had ever seen i hope its not all bright and cheery throughout butt i can see where avalanche studios influence came in finally borderlands 3 looks promising but this is modern bethesda im not getting my hopes up well this is certainly interesting just waiting to see how they handle the open world thats a make or break for me i hope randy taking it well nice new bullet storm wow new bonerland 3 gameplay looking goods wheres blake griffin and the tiger dunk the asteroid just hit me id software avalanche bethesda working together am i dead is this heaven the gaming community has no interest in single player games anymore so you mix borderlands with destiny and added some doom mechanics such originality doom and fallout had a baby borderlands and mad max had a baby both babies grew up and had a baby and that mega baby is rage 2 lets goooo im fucking hyped shadow warrior 2 doom mad max rage 2 rage 1 more darkness but will see rage 2 far cry edition correct me if im wrong is this open world looks a bit like a futuristic borderlands mixed with call of duty never played the first rage but im intrieged now this definitely looks interesting and appears as though this is what the first rage was supposed to be but we will have to wait and see its just a trailer and its saying all the right things but i dont want it to feel like a discount borderlands looks like a mix between borderlands mad max for the combats in vehicles which look amazing destiny for the gunplay and doom also the gunplay a little bit disappointed with the futuristic style powers and guns but im waiting it devs plz add battle royale mode to this tnx finally rage 2 i still remember playing the first game and at the ending cutscene i thought the game is just about to start what a big cliffhanger lol do we play as the same tosser we played in the original what about the elder scrolls vi like murica fk yeah i loved the first one but the ending was worse than dog crap served up in a rotting carcass base game i didnt play the expansion please at least make an effort for the ending and make an actual ending let there be multiplayer i would say destiny killer but theyve committed suicide already was hoping for fallout 5 or a new skyrim but this looks fun too this is mad max borderlands metro basically this has always been bethesdas borderlands also i didnt see ads one time that concerns me this is a better implemented story ok i was skeptic when i fist heard of this but now i am impressed its like doom and fallout had a kid then that kid marries borderland and had another kid doom meets fallout meets far cry made by the developers of mad max and just cause it cant possibly go wrong please what does shooterverse mean guys man bethesda just have their shit together lol they know whats fun err what is this game did somebody actually want this wait were getting this over prey2 dishonored 3 doom 2 elder scrolls 6 the first one has the epic intro loved it so much was just so short i am glad its back i want the sentry bots first rage was alright but quite generic and forgettable looks like youve gone full into the mad max influence with a hint of doom titanfall sci fi and bullet storm trying to make it stand out this time im pretty ready for that so you better not make this shit releasing in like q4 of 2019 cause im actually kinda intriguedexcited avalanche studios i just screamed with joy at 102 when we drive the camera angle move to third person this doesnt even look like rage 1 not sure if thats good or bad just glad to see depth avalanche has quite the experience with open world games and mad max for that matter i wonder if they combined the apex engine from thehunter series with the idtech 6 engine in all this looks awesome as much as rage 1 was more a proof of concept with significant flaws i still liked the game hope this one will overcome the flaws of the first one but im hooked this is insane actually looks interesting hope there is a coop mode if doom fallout and mad max had a baby this is what would be born so fucking hyped and this is just bethesdas red herring cant wait to see whats next they sold me at wide open world bfg reference before trailer ah bethesdas making a sequel to rage i never played rage 1 so im not bothered hope it goes well for them though ill wait a good few years for tes vi after trailer ive change my mind i need this they should have stuck with this instead of that live action trailer this looks awesome jesus christ this looks fucking incredible all these guns and no ones clamoring over the bat come on guys wheres your insanity they gonna make this longer than the 3 hours it took to finish the first game borderlands meets mad max rage one was awful but you never know this might actually be pretty good yay another open world aaa title with lots of chromatic aberration hell fucking yea looks amazingreal game wont look nothing like this i cant waitbut in reality i know this wont look and play the way this video presented it self wow amazing let me compare two games like casual piece of shit trying to be critical smart ass analyzer some game some other this game now im pointing out how theyre not trying and only coping where is my fucking medal i take it backthis looks awesome as fck wai wha this looks insane gunplay looks very fun which is to be expected from id software one of the most awesome and insane video game trailer ever made avalanche studios bethesda mad max doom mad max 2 fps edition look pretty awesome if only fallout 4 looked that good xd will there be a single player campaign so the dark tone of the previous title its now a gay parade with guns this game looks like serious sam and shadow warrior with some guys cosplaying like wastland dancing clowns i bet my soul that this game is a bunch of fetch quests to fill the open world just a giant sandbox map 1 hour in it and you all go ask for a refund i praying to be wrong with this one because rage 1 had some solid gunfights with a rare thing your enemies reacting to shots id signature oh come on a combination of mad max doom and maybe bulletstorm good studiosshitim touching myself tonight wow this looks like a major improvement ive always loved chaotic type games and settings cant wait to get my hands on it this looks like doom on some heavy as meth love it i want this game asap was i the only fan of the original cause im fucking hyped no one asked for this but i think im gonna be glad it exists bethesda are simply incapable of publishing bad games this is incredible 058 warlock punch from destiny lol max max driving combined with doom and borderlands 2 fucking sold the acidneon colors look so dope the gunplay looks incredible everytime i see a mech suit i get giddy im fuckin sold thank god its ten times better than the teaser i like the tone playful side of bethesda looks like destiny but actually good lols rick sanchez at 043 i hope that they dont downgrade this awesome from russia with love hope it would be beteer than first rage one of the most booooooring games ever mad max meets bulletstorm sure why not it seems different fuck yeah andrew wk playing in the background now i want this even more 033 dizziness our favorite altered state of consciousness gameplay is more arcadey which is always a bad thingteenage purple punk theme sucks balls though much prefer a desolate postapocalypse theme something closer to a madmax or a stalker or a fallout 3 game arcade feel killed fallout 4 i think the devs are targeting a teen audience with this one but well see how it pans out with a more comprehensive gameplay demo yeah good luck releasing this the same year as borderlands 3 is it too much to ask for fallout new vegas rpg elements or from any other of the great rpgs bethesda made but with the gunplay of this as borderlands fan id be totally ok with some optional coop mode i wanted fallout exclusive for playstation so fallout on crack this looks good i hope they have mutant wildlife how come this kinda reminds me of bulletstorm so a cut and paste doom very original but will it still have splitscreen gamers yesterday dont want cinematic trailers i want to see gameplay bethesda today here you go wellshit this looks pretty decent so is this what the game actually looks like or is it an upscaled impossible to access version so bethesda want to make a borderlands clone only problem avalanche are making it so that mean 20fps will theidstudio editor actually be enabled this time oh i didnt know there was a borderlands 3 trailer sweet i can fucks wit it god soon be cracked soon be cracked soon be cracked its not on the switch bastards sooooo when will it be here this kind of dampens my excitement for this game im not a fan of borderlandsesque games and i think i wouldve preferred the semiopen world mission levels that rage 1 had but lets wait and see how it turns out finally borderlands 3 oh what a game what a lovely game this shit looks awesome as fuck i belive someone in development team listened to sex pistols and then decided to make a game atleast bethesda is notw working on another fallout game no switch version i guess you dont want this game to succeed i guess im going to play rage 1 now this looks nothing like the first and thats not a bad thing all sequels should evolve how much evolution is needed depends on the predecessor but rage was practically a tech demoalbeit an extremely fun one that i still play in other words a brand new style and more innovation was definitely needed this looks like a fucking blast and i will gladly pre order a special edition and hopefully be able to enjoy it just as much and play it for just as long as the first meh 60 console fov maybe you should make its more lower why not showing this trailer insted of that horrible cringy live action trailer how much money wasted on that when they have this amazing gameplay trailer working with avalanche exactly what i wanted this is what orig rage should have been when rage originally released borderlands came out and kinda stole its thunder unexpected but glad to see it better than the stupid announce trailer im interested now why tho fallout on crack it looks great fallout 4 gone bad the game no one asked for day 1 buy for me love us games theyre masters of their craft looks pretty different from the first havent played it in a long time though so sorry if im wrong on that but seems fun nonetheless buying this day one d hope the game has andrew wk songs in the game now though when you think anarchy means chaos soon as i see avalanche studios name pops up i know what kind of gameplay is gone be right away lol boom boom boom boom and more boom michael bay the video game series wonder if they will pick up where they left off with all the arks emerging from the ground the first rage looked boring this looks amazing that asteroid was made of glitter the music choices for these trailers are hideous can we have coop its ridiculous how people were treating this games announcement as if it were bound to be terrible its basically borderlands without the rng mutant bash tv is back what the first game shouldve been like if not for the hardware limitations i guess the creators of mad max making rage hell yesssss im so happy its funny seeing everyone change their tune from yesterday shitting on a game with only seeing a live action trailer for a trailer look at the comments and dislikes from yesterdays and todays i dont really understand why bethesda made another style of fallout game in the first place also idk why they are making a sequel the first one didnt exactly sell well and lets not talk about preformance issues lol why is the tech so advanced its so zany please lord gaben let there be a proper coop campaign no switch version second times a charm i guess hope this sequel is what the original failed to be ok this looks pretty sweet omg the difference between the original and the sequel is phenomenal good luck avalanche and id software snores the war will begin with the annoucement of borderlands 3 maybe not this year but idk shit happens thats destiny alright is this going to have any form of co oponline anyone know fallout 4 now with more guns cars and action at 46 theres a rick cut out it looks like shit tho but its there this looks awesome shut up and take my money shut up and take my money now this looks fun doom combat mixed with mad max and borderlands now this looks good i hope there would be less of a wasteland and more of an old civilization leftovers dont wanna play in an empty world like in a mad max what is next the next doom open world game i am sold toooooooooooooooooo the fact that nowadays every openworld game must be saints row or far cry just kinda overwhelms me first rage wasnt good not because it wasnt all that colorful and insaneish but i liked the gameplay looks really nice 005 chumbucket is that you o0 i honestly loved rage so having all these amazing studios on board creating its sequel is really exciting i thought 2k made borderlands i knew it was going to be awesome the people who are talking shit about this are regretting their words also at 045 mutant bash confirmed im very encouraged by this please just dont pull any stupid publisher bullshit on us with regard to lootdlcwhatever please for the love of fuck just dont do it make a game make it awesome then charge for it please finally the sequel that ive been waiting for forever i really wanted to like a horror open world shooter or something like fallout this looks like been here done that type of game simaliar like fc5 hope it proves me wrong maybe first fix menu in rage on pc this looks sick as hell im so in i hope to god this is coop this looks way too damn good all it needs is a guy in a uac praetor suit and advanced wingsticks this not as postapocalyptic as the first one first id game ever to have some trees man i so hope this will be good yeahborderlands 3 announce trailer gonna be a 710 this already looks better than fallout 4 looks good nothing like borderlands despite what people say cant wait i cant feel my nipples god job bethesda 112 big fucking guns i see here influence of bfg 9000 i know rage is an fps but is it too much to ask for an optional 3rd person cam yes please a polished rage with avalanche studios and bethesda on board for their amazing openworlds and id software on board for their doomlike combat fuck yeah im sold looks pretty fuckin sick 030 wow they look cool is that andrew wk i hear is the authority still part of this game i just shat my pants looks like fallout mad max not enough for getting on my watchlist forsure getting this there better be a collectors rage was short but so much fun i am really excited for this wow wasnt expecting that this actually looks really cool looks just as boring as i thought it would completely baffled by the fact that they thought making yet another post brown apocalyptic open world fps was a good idea there is nothing new here this is gonna bomb hard hmmm mad max meets doom meets bioshockish meets titan fall meets borderlands takes a peek inside his trousers whelp who else besides me now has a premature ejaculation problem awesome i want to play now if doom mad max and fallout had a baby youd get rage 2 i am fucking pumped makes the original game look boring and bland in comparison avalanche studios as well i cannot fucking wait it actually looks good i find it funny that this trailer alone has more content than destiny 2 right now loved the original rage nothing better than letting loose a double barrelled shotgun on a psychos head and hearing the sweet crunchy gameplay sound effects looks like borderlands without the cel shaded graphics yesterday i was at half mast but now after seeing this im well and truly ready to fuck the fear turkey fallout of duty never played a rage game but it looks so much fun definitely buying it soooooo fallout 4 didnt look like this why fuck yeah live action trailer was trash ha but the game play trailer looks great still my main concern is the story i hope it continues where the last left off and hope your still lieutenant raine and not some new random character hopefully they release a story trailer soon but this shit looks badass the game looks cool and all but does anyone know the name of the sickass punk rock song in this trailer i want this now you know what this isnt looking to bad and might be better than the first one already im sold doom rip off release a demo and well go from there looks very cool but i thinks this gameplay is on a high end pc wont be like this on ps4 pro or xbox one x and its gonna be downgraded a lot since its release like god of warfarcry5detroit become human and lot more just erase that announce trailer pls so when can i buy it wow bulletstorm 2 i dont know about you guys but it looks pretty cool to me ill still wait for an official review but this could be really good i actually love this concept when mad max world combined with doom like action and shooting you got a badass game i think everyone will forget this game when borderlands 3 will be leaked on the next e3 hell yeah cant wait i think we can all agree that this looks extremely badass gamedesing is godly cool shit to make the waiting for borderlands 3 feel a bit shorter good work guys when the doom of mad fallout oh wow this looks amazing why did they waste money on that cringey live action teaser that was garbage im actually hyped now i am going to fap on this video when i played the first one i literally was saying the whole time this needs to be in bathesdas hands a dream come true if only fallout ran on this engine far cry 5 has a competitor fellas i remember when you liked skyrim and now you threw it out like some peas of trash i love skyrim please consider updating skyrim also its not to old because youre making a rage game thanks for taking the time to read my comment holly shit looks awesome bethesda shut up and take my money my body is ready in various ways avalanche and id a match made in chaos and splendour heaven i liked the first rage just saying so mad max crossed with fallout without the 50s style crossed with doom looks loke doom but more crazy if that is possible love it so this games mad max borderlands fallout now sure ill buy look like borderlands with realistic graphic looks like a good sequel of a very good game when is it coming out though damn a 50 year timeskip wonder what happened to nick and the rest of the resistance kinda reminds me of mad max i like it looks ok but definitely not for me i did ask for this simple as that this actually looks really good had no interest before but this looks like it could be a really good title more of this and less cgilive action trailers publishers your devs work is the most interesting thing although a certain hybrid console by nintendo is missing from the fray and to people who respond dont say it isnt possible because likely rage 2 is created on a modified ver of id tech 6 which the switch supports so the pink is being off your tits on nanotrites it will be remembered if u cant customize your character i dont want it huh this makes me interested never played the first rage but this looks up my alley best part of the video is 000143 mad max doom bulletstorm vibeenough said i am sold 6 years of waiting for a rage 2 finally is happening maybe now there will be players that would complete the cooperative in rage but the progress is not preserved hey guys send to play rage so im guessing i dont have to play the first one to play this one a fun and colorful apocolyptic game sign me up takes queues from borderlands and mad max with its own twist in gameplay this is genuinely interesting since being part of a minority that enjoyed the first entry it looks fresh not to mention the far cry blooddragon vibes avalanche is great with their open worlds excited to see how this one turns out cant wait to get this on the switch this is what you get when borderlands and doom have a baby oh god what have they done to my beloved franchise thats a ton shift from the last game like everything from the story to gameplay looks totally different on the surface that first trailer still left a bad taste in my mouth you shouldve posted this first instead of that teaser now im intrigued wow looks unreal gameplay looks solid as well rage one was a bleeding heart hopefully this patches those cuts old school yeah if this is fallout meets jackass then im sold i miss the old bethesda uk publicity gal had the best titles and would reply to comments hope theyre still working here wait tell me that i can play as a bad tribe bandit and not as a stupid ass post apocalyptic paladin box art is ugly though rage mad max doom bulletstorm rage 2 all aboard the hypetrain fuck yeah all rage 2 soundtrack will be by andrew wk hey a post apocalyptic shooter with an openish world and guns that act like guns sign me the fuck up if this is all legit in game graphics then this is one of the best looking games i have ever saw you guys kill it with open world games and an open world game mixed with doom combat an instant buy for me release date please is the authority still alive looks a hell of alot bett then the first one does this feel like a mix of doom mad max and maybe sunset overdrive to anyone else if theres no third person play i am out this actually looks amazing the game looks good but i wouldnt even know this was rage2 if they didnt put in the title holy crap this game just surprised me now im waiting this take my money and i think that many also is surprised after this looks like doom action on steroids in open world jesus d good going bethesda ton hawks borderlands fury road wingsticksareback im just glad that its not battle royale nice this game definitely deserved a sequel a long time ago reminds me of destiny tbh looks so better than the 1st trailer the should have never released it because it just pissed people off lol switch pleasewith the gyroscope finally an id tech based openworld game nice definitely playing it theres enough dark atmospheric postapocalyptic games on the market already not that those are bad this is what ive always wanted stupid insane colorful postapocalyptic fun and its also a sequel to one of my alltime favorites looking good so far id software please dont disappoint nable the car to destroy big mutants in rage 2011 it was not enough developed by avalanche studios literally mad max 2 more than rage 2 haha pumped never really asked for it but i gotta admit this looks awesome photorealistic af looks good now im just wandering when the release date will be hopefully soon i didnt think much of the announcement but now im fucking hyped whos with me borderlands but without cellshading and good world building 2 this looks like sunset overdrive mixed with mad max looks mental and avalanche studios on it makes us happy good luck with the development guys looking forward to getting our hands on it advanced modern version of far cry 5 good but not my type i can get into this so old rage style game with the gameplay of doom thats a hell of a comination id say guess iam sold holy shit i likey who asked for this just hope they dont expect you to have a online connection constantly to play the game as i cant stand those types of games this looks fun nice to see bethesda pivoting a relatively mediocre franchise to something pulpy no third person no sale am i dreaming after 10 years finally an ego shooter who is not playable online that i may do experience that doom x fallout serious sam 4 but with more of all i love it party till you puke whos here before 2k views as someone who loved the first game i am really looking forward to this i hope they get it right this time round i half liked rage gameplay was fun when actually out in the world but between quests etc it felt really slow to me i suppose they did only have the last gen of console to work with though lools like a massive failure in the making bethesda present border rage 2 i wasnt expecting a lot from this because rage 1 was such a let down im pretty fatigued by open world shooters post apocalyptic games are so overdone and nobody was asking for this but then again doom 2016 was refreshingly good it was interesting to learn that avalanche are involved with it although it feels a little weirdly adulterous that a sequel to a mad max rip off is being made by the guys who made an official mad max game it looks like theyve injected a lot of fun into the formula though im getting lots of bulletstorm and titanfall vibes here looking forward to seeing more cant wait hope you guys optimized this game for low end if not i am so f fallout new rageous yes please what is the name of the song anyway day one purchased on my xb1 soooo bulletstorm doom mad max just cause xboxonex enhanced hell yeah son looks sick i loved rage so underrated i have one thing to say though yall enjoying giving had powers and shit lately like prey and dishonered im okay with it i mean okay sure the fact that the gameplay trailer is one day after announcement this is so wicked and crazy i like it i mean it looks good but it looks more like doom scifi than rage 1 apocalypse sci fi looks pretty good to me i played the first one and loved it i only disliked this video to be the first in history to do so on gameplay of this game lol well its not fallout but im sold im gonna make these tribes into my own legion caesar will live forever xbox gold games with augustus 2019 gameswithgold august 2019 please xbox get fortnite free dont pay for play please xbox get fortnite free dont pay for play hey xbox please add far cry 5 or watch dogs 2 why when we close in the update you freaking say you lost the internet in the philipines xbox can we ave naughty bear for xbox one plz nice the game was too easy now i can buy the game we all want killer instinct ok so i legit forgot this game even came out

replayablity about time free update you mean features that should of been included at launch i gotta get back into this game you need guys add real weapons like ak47 spas i see this in game they have npc can shoot this guns but i cant pick up this game have mode online awesome i hope they have him as an announcer for cod 2019 like in iw can we get this guy to change xbox game ads gameswithgoldwwe

can use my focus to find hidden collectibles its so close im so excited bethesda you guys are better than ea could ever be rage 2 destiny 2 call of duty black ops 4 i have no clue what the game is about but im buying it this is way better than the first one crazy beautiful game of the year maybe one of the very best things about the first rage game is so many of the scene settings were really creepy and even a bit frightening i hope they dont throw that away to try and become more borderlandsesk it does look really fun also hope they dont jump on the microtransaction train no dont worry its only cosmetic load of shit pay for the game and get only 10 of the rewards to actually earn streaming rage 2 on release night giving game away to a follower at 100 follows no bullshit twitch etwo1fivegaming000 i would like authority armor plz i wish this was coming to steam or even gog why cant they just do what boobiesoft does they got some perks on their own platform but they dont alienate like 80 of pc gamers oh well shove a cock in my ass i dont know if ill buy it after fallout 76 oh yeah thats hot right there this is how you make a dope forkin trailer looks fun as fuck will it be a solo game or always online best cool trailer ever i dont know what rage is but this trailer is amazing the music the guns the gameplay played to the beat and the sheer randomness like this 058 love it i dont know what just happened but i liked it post apocalyptic sunset overdrive wtf this hip hop bullshit totally spoils it doesnt fit with the style of the game at all everyone is saying this looks like fallout but this is more mad max im diggin that steel case id has almost never made a bad game is this far cry new dawn the world looks small what a trash game rip this franchise after original rage ubisoft is copying you guys that danny brown this game will fail if you dont release it on steam i rage 2 its not out yet loved the 1st rage this is one hell of a change in direction none the less this looks ridiculous and fun im looking forward for the game i just hate the music of this trailer annoying as fuck at least its not used creation engine looking forward to that where is the get ready to die song cant wait for rage 76 am i right i hope this shitty music is not in the game i think ill pass doesnt look remotely fun game engine changed apex engine looks cool than id tech engine far cry new dawn looks great i wonder how polished this game will be rage 2 new far cry i scared of bethesda ruin this game mortal kombat 11 lets use the shittiest game trailer music we can possibly find for our release rage 2 hold my beer another gay rapper to make it look cool but sounds like shit i would have zero problems with bethesda using this engine for fallout 5 so no one gonna acknowledge the obvious fact that this blatantly copied farcry new dawn well its looks better then first game in rage series its beautiful brings a tear to my eye yo yo yo why most of the video muted look like borderland 2 and by the gods this song is annoying dont you dare being a bethesda launcher exclusive i dont want to download this two times the first trailer created too little hype this trailer created too much hype sucks to be rage 2 right now but im still gonna try this game wonder if that statue is the main character from the first one it looks like him im so thankful for this not only does this game look great but now i feel like borderlands 3 is gonna have something to compete against and feel as though they gotta beat in a way just as soon as gearbox figures out where the 3rd hand gun is gonna come from that is rage 2 and doom eternal are for me on the top 5 games for 2019 the game looks uncomfortably obnoxious i still cant decide whether its a good thing or not i just hope they keep at least some of the good stuff from the first game all the enemies look like cannon fodder that wouldnt be bad if you could die in one or two hits it makes the game more challenging instead of easy but it dont look like thats the case mad max borderlands edition i will just wait and see how it turns out cant say this looks bad but this trailer doesnt grab my attention either after what bethesda did to fallout i am not interested in this casual crap there will be many other games which people can spend money for resident evil 2 ace combat 7 sekiro tom clancy division 2 the outer worlds metro exodus warcraft 3 reforged and of course cyberpunk 2077 and dying light 2 bethesda will try to repair its budget with all that postidsoftware crap they will not get my money for sure im so fucking excited about this one its unbelievable the artstyle music gameplay openworld i just dont know how bethesda can fuck this game up maybe poor rpg elements but who knows maybe itll just work level design is kind of crap tho need more bright colours rage 2 doom eternal the outer worlds atomic heart at first i thought mc chris was making a comeback 128 wilhelm scream official release on my birthday its a sign i love danny brown no steam no buy relase it on steam cmon i want this game smoke breakk danny brown danny getting the clout he deserves this game is about being a liberal or what cause if yes it would be really boring what shitty music i am looking forward to it so apparently bethesda tried to rip off borderlands because this is a 11 borderlands trailer from the world over the colorful style and the actionpacked gameplay down to the music and overall trailer appearance but do they have 85 gazillion guns nah the first one sucked looks amazing love that song too new doom looks sick firs one was a very underwhelming game why a sequel why bethesda couldnt do fallout 76 on that engine cant wait for this game bethesda doing it right for once this is actually border max game not rage whats that music jeeez this looks fun af what up with this people comparing fallout to everything i will leave bfv if this have multyplayer best combined by titanfallborlderlandmadmaxtwisstedmetalcyberpunk itd be cool if there was a easter egg were u can get the bfg dang its so far cry new dawn sarcastic sucks man because fallout 76 was going to be my first fallout game i ever played but with all the problems i have to pass i guess this and far cry will be my fall out games i liked the first rage it was okay could have been better hopefully this one makes those improvements but will there still be john goodman what a stupid fucking song why does it always have to be rap no steam no buy finally danny brown gets some light god i hope this noise isnt in the game its like if fallout and watch dogs 2 had a baby it would be rage 2 i have hope for this game looks to be much better than the first one at least i do want to know what song thats playing is though looks cool but idk if its worth full triple a price cars guns and absolute insanity was anyone else disappointed with ones ending i played a little of the first one it had great graphics for an old game but it got boring after a bit it looks like just a bunch of modern abilities but it could be good and it would be good if they killed destiny better this than farcry 76 danny brown killed the song ubisoft thinks their new far cry can compete with this wishful thinking hopfully its multiplayer i remember the 1st one being splitscreen but no online this actually looks fucking badass lol bethesda well see kinda ripping off borderlands style and theme though especially with the big fn guns part when i saw the pin title i thought it was far cry 6 holy shit they used danny brown danny brown getting some love yo danny brown got scammed by premium snapchats friend hey bro what u think about this game me bunch of f chaotic explosions in my head right now sorry what now what the fuck this what happens when you lock doom and borderlands in a room together for long enough as someone who actually loved the first game i still really like how the new direction looks plus the idtech6 engine is gorgeous i want andrew wk music back is that mc chris rapping next year is looking great for games i just hope they dont pull a fallout76 on this game you should have done it right the first time borderlands did all this already and likely did it better i hope this wont be one of those games where they just throw you into a world and have all these bases to destroy i hate that style of game danny brown made this game look so much better i kinda want it now bet its gonna be another bad game this year or the next how much you bet song is danny brown aint it funny so how many discs are there is that you borderlands 3 its not rage though its a whole different game i really hope this is good but given bethesdas past few games im not very hopeful this looks like a shooter with doom vibes when it comes to gameplay the story is probably just there for setting but the real draw is that insane combat looks like a great game at a discount lol danny brown really did it for this trailer defiantly gonna buy this who els play the first one you see bethesda this is what happens when you use different engines in games they function looks a lot like borderlands but better than the first rage aint it funny how bethesda is still a bad company i guess this is my new borderlands bulletstorm 2 looks pretty cool it is a bethesda game isnt it what is this mad max the music is fucking awful wait so is rage 2 battle royale now lmao hahaha looks great hate the music thought i like open world games and good story games everyone look at far cry new dawn now rage has some real competition i cant tell what im more hyped for dont fuck up bethesda mad max the unlicensed adventures this looks fantastic and the music matches it so well 5 years down the line rage74 this or fallout76 it looks like what borderlands would have looked like if gearbox had decided to go against the cellshaded art design rage was interesting and while i dont dislike this direction for the franchise it definitely isnt what i thought would become of it 129 wilhelm scream so far cry and rage 2 are basically competing for best post apocalyptic game this year since 76 is hot doo doo this trailer just reminds me of borderlands 2 and i dont know why what a world what a lovely open world so bullet storm borderlands and mad max had a menage a trois and the result was this game count me in lol borderlands 3 confirmed ive actually never played rage but i cant lie this looks pretty good do i need to play the first one first or would i be ok to just play this loved the first will definitely be getting the second just hope killing countless bandits wont get boring quick the main thing for this game seems to be the creative kills and such so i hope its not toobland after an hour of this feels like their target age is 1216 wtf am i just getting old or did this trailer cause an epileptic seizure go ahead gearboxrandy pitchford continue to withhold bl3 from us like the dumb fuks youre acting like ill buy two copies of rage 2 for how long yall have teased and never delivered for how long youre making us wait for not delivering a sime confirmationteaser trailer this game awards ill toast a glsss for when gearbox losses its bl3 thunder to rage 2 and when i see randy pitchford begging for change on the side walk for having been the dumbass he is aaaaragghhh therei feel better now borderlands 3 is that you most anticipated game of next year i cant watch this trailer enough so far cry mad max fallout borderlands rage 2 this looks so generic and boring when any guy in bethesda love borderlands xd looks awesome 128 wilhelm scream im actually really looking forward to this game far cry messed up this looks way better this game look like top to bottom insanity really hope it turns out as amazing as it looks not the sequel we expected but still looks great this is going to be so much fun im glad this game is getting a sequel though the tone seems to be going in a whole new direction from the first i am excited and looking forward to this game and i cant wait to play it for myself more fallout vibe then in fallout76 etc where is claptrap dont fuck with the apocalypse fallout and borderlands had a baby omggg wellspring is back most hyped game of 2019 what is the name of the music hyped asf well it looks fun cant be worse than the first rage rite cant wait i just hope the player doesnt feel too op with all of the new abilities mad max confirmed is that danny brown the rapper reminded me of doom looks fun sht soundtrack though this game looks pretty cool but they need to slow the trailers down so you can take in all the stuff they are trying to show off you can find full game from my channel this is false advertisement on the base ps4 the game will run at 30fps only the pro gets 60fps which is why i will buy it on pc this reminds me of rage 2 or if rage 2 had a baby dude this looks like doom in the rage universe take my money so glad to see an amazing game that doesnt have ea involved he goes tryhard mode at 915 all are talking about the game but who played it cudos to him all those combos with grenade and gun marketing done right this game looks fockin insane i think this would be one of the best of the generation if not the best in term of gameplay looks like a cross between just cause and doom wow looks really cool just looks like so much fun i cant wait for this to come out hopefully this still feels and plays enough like the orignal rage so its borderlands but not funny i hope executives dont think i am buying this game cause its a sequel im buying it cause it looks like a great game this is proper borderlands dna if nothing else who else thougght it said math 14 2013 cant wait to play mutant bash tv again doom but colourful cant wait to play this game on battle royal where is the brutality doom on steroids its clear to me that id software did the combat part for the most of it and avalanche the post apocalyptic world design looks great might give this a try in awaiting the highly anticipated doom eternal now this is the rage i always wanted to see though ill buy this on pc for that smooth 120 frames i love loved it soooooo much is this really ps4 game footage this dude never got hit wow its not even another video about eden space center mission making progress amazing hope the actual game will be like this please do not downgrade this game it it weird that id rather just chill with the goon squad they seem like my kind of people i cant wait love id software it looks amazing only when he fires his guns it looks a little lame hope they add some effects when the bullets come out of the barrell we need smart and tough ai amen this looks bad woow best game 2019 so far wow bethesda is back interesting gameplay well see this is like if bulletstorm and doom had a baby mad max meets fallout meets far cry anything that resembles doom gameplay is going to be a badass game i want them to go hard with the bossfights in this one looks like theyre getting direct inspiration from doom with the bulletspongemusic combo love it i dont care if the graphics blow crysis out of the water just make sure it runs well 60 fps on ps4 all shooting game looks same shoot and cover looks great i will probably purchase it why is the protagonist so op while all the enemiesact like lobotomized monkies this is hardly any fun gameplay looks dope but hopefully the world isnt bland and boring i want some side missions and awesome stuff to do in the game its designed to play on a gamepad i cant believe this gameplay is on ps4 like all the special abilities doesnt seem like just another runatthemill shooter driving looks fun combat looks fun game looks gorgeous day one buy for me this is gonna be one the best years for gaming xbox one x the best explosions look sick in this game i wonder if theres gonna be multiplayer like doom that would be cool if doom an cod had a child rised by killzone this doesnt look anything like the original rage the ai was smart in that game in rage 2 they just seem to be meat for the player to grind oh look a borderlands how cute really dont like turningstyle it lags and feels like low fps style controllers yeah thats the cause this looks like another cod game not expecting realism but graphics look ok cant see any real detail on enemies other than neon hair for some im sure afternoon lighting doesnt help seems like bulletstorm for crazy kills no alternative fire mode for assault rifle boring thank you for fixing the fov so this is what mafia city is like with the homing cash that gunshot sound and all the other sounds are satisfying i liked wolfenstein new colossus but i uninstalled it becouse the gun sounds where so fukking bad is this game open world that dynamic resolution really kicks in hard at some points hopefully they can clean up the image a bit by release just waiting for the downgrade the game probably wont look like this when its released dont forget this is published by bethesda and rage 1 was released with a lot of problems until several months afterwards did those issues get resolved random frame drops and texture streaming issues causing severe texture pop ins as well for pc this isnt even coming to steam you have to go through bethesda like fallout 76 im for sure avoiding this yeah i am waiting for this game left a like intro looked like i was watching someone playing doom i want this game looks dope is this bethesda it kind of has a doom style to it watching the gameplay was like watching mad max fury road 2 and that car looks all mean machine whats his back story his he the same guy how far in the future is this storyline taking place whenthis looks friggin awesome time to upgrade the old pc rig well this looks intense i was actually pretty excited about this game at announcement because it looks like a more interesting version of doom i like doom too i just dont enjoy the extremely linear story line as much finally demoed by an experienced player not some journalist i have a feeling that the gunplay will be the usual id software splendor while the open world aspect will be just another run of the mill competent but forgettable tedious avalanche affair so basically your immortal not only he or she plays well its on fun mode put it on nightmare difficulty if you want bring it to steam already bethesda 60 fps theres barely any vertical aiming this was obviously shot on consoles but the pc neckbeards have to hate on everything wheres the pre order cheat codes should be easy on highest difficulty settings im excited for this i think ill play metro exodus far cry new dawn rage 2 for sure this year or next year slamming just made this a day one buy lol this looks like a really pretty doom reskin so they basically took the nanosuit from crysis and went overboard with itsweet the fog looks like doom with a rage skin with a mix of bulletstorm hope it doesnt have regenerative health im sold i need this nao that said i really like that weapon at 0545 this is probably on a ps4 with 4 gtx 2080s hooked up to it no way this runs at 60fps at its current state expect a graphics downgrade wow this reminds me of pokemon go looks awesome cant wait this and metro are buys 2019 is shaping up to be the year of the apocalypse i wanted to say that this looks great im not even that big of a fan of fpss but it just looks so well put together tight my only criticism is that theres no animation for getting in out of vehicles this i think it would complete the whole feel of the game from what ive seen so much reused assets from mad max zero recoil must be pc bulletstorm meets crysis i hope it stays this fast paced i mean i know this may be a developer playing so clearly know what they are doing but it looks epic and fast paced and i love it im pleased just cant wait to see the finished product im not getting too excited though lol mad max graphics was limited due to planned ps3 release now well ride in real ps4 power render filters from outside car gameplay reminds me killzone shadowfall more than other similar shooter the guy played so well that made the npcs looks dumb ahahahah something about it made me think of crysis this looks epic luckily we can run spotify in game danny brown and rage 2 seem like they belong together this looks like it could make do until borderlands 3 comes out mad max fallout borderland rage 2 someone else had said it too but ai indeed seems rather dumb too simple much like far crymad max and doom need a game with with better ai to have more of a challenge the ai sounds exactly like the ai failsafe in destiny 2 ahhh this game ahh pc gameplay to deceive ps4 customers classic the bfg is a pre order bonus i knew doom was somewhere around here 228 failsafe is that you this new update for apex looks great i love how people pretend to remember rage 1 totally gonna buy this its like destiny titanfall and doom had a child i was hoping to see some in vehicle views looks sick the graphics are enjoyable if its not 60 fps imnot going to buy it its like rachet and clank borderlands and bulletstorm had a baby cant wait for this anybody else remember getting fooled by r1s early footage gameplay looks brilliant holy dang this is my sort of game fast paced run gun and smash combat yes please mad max far cry new down rage 2 that guy is to powerful looks like a lot of fun is this a single player game or will u be abke to play with friends or randoms boring where is the excitement fuckintastic are there going to be hitmarkers i like hitmarkersz rainbow doom the boom headshot meme is inside my head right now avalanche at its best the scenarios kinda remind me of borderlands im so hyped for this already pre ordered and will be live streaming xanderpark on twitch so you want to take all my money by selling cheats now do you well you wont be able to because im not buying the game anymore loved the original rage the atmosphere and the feel were really unique in my opinion it really felt like it was in a postapocalyptic world this just feels like doom and im kinda disappointed i want a new quake cant wait great trailer id still has it is this game like be fallout 76 ill wait and dont pre orderdont trust this guys anymore cant wait for ign to give this a 45 i hope the game isnt as easy as it looks here 446 some say he is still falling to this day gonna skip this its seems they will be throttling exp in order to sell booster shouldnt they know how hard a similar thing hit destiny this is what far cry new dawn wanted to be whoever is playing this is genius i waited for bodyparts flying i wasnt ready for 124 this game looks sick my brain is erecting for this this actually looks decent does this have coop if it has bethesda on it i wont buy it never forget fallout 76 way too colorful and silly dude has no gravity whatosever you shot an enemy and he flew towards the sun not buying this i prefer the old game with grayish tones and decent physics and gameplay well this is gonna get hella downgraded i like the new generation where companies dont bug test and polish the game themselves and instead have beta tests to make consumers do it for free and where is the blood i still play doom 2016 the machine gun looks like the same model as bullet storm the new doom game is lit did they switch off any enemy damage for that video failsafe is that you will this have multiplayer pt br portuguese to brazil this is not a complaint this is information february 2019 playstation plus japan playstation 3 games metal gear solid 4 the king of fighters xiii dynasty warriors 7 empires deception iv nightmare princess ps vita games silent hill deception iv nightmare princess you want your voice to be heard understood and if possible answered or you want your voice to be ignored and forgotter playstation 4 your final sample is now we still have time playstation 3 ps vita a worthy ending playstation lol this is a pc with ultra settings having to pay for cheat codes is just sad and petty i am not getting this game looks like what call of duty should of looked like i still am excited for the game but does it look like they dialed down the violence to anyone else or just me i play about 116th of that speed and cant remember the controls ill pass perfect game engine for fallout 5 it says age restricted but i dont have those settings on what the heck better than apex definitely i gonna buy it i hope the ai get better aim looks like pc footage not because of graphics but because of fast movements of player they really went all out looks really awesome but probably gonna buy it on pc so i can get pass through microtransactions in this game if they wont add it so its ps4 all the way its like apex legends and mirage is the main character empty world too boring are they running this on ps5 maybe look at those fps think a bit could be possible right this game remind to me rage ps3 game i hope this progress boost thing doesnt become a microtransaction why am i worried for this games success with metro exodus looming despite the obvious efforts put in this isnt pushing my buttons better than far cry 5 are the paid xp boosters enabled here i got a ps4 just to play the arkham games and spiderman as for the rest of this stuff im still trying to navigate my way through it all what a easy game already looking forward to rage 2 battle royale this looks cool but im waiting for doom would there be stealth trashley it look promising but map kinda empty n lifeless this is the same footage bethesda sent to numerous content creators weve been seeing for months correct except we can hear the audio this time not complaining its just not exactly new this looks promising iam surely gonna put aside bo4 and bfv when this comes out theres plenty of reasons to buy this game but i would buy it to use that gun at 446 alone wow someone who knows how to play the game i was expecting an ign employee is this captured on a ps5 already i miss the old rage oh man i cant wait looks so fun the weapons and super abilities reminds me of saints row looks like 1sr person mad max mixed with doom gameplay rage 2 9 minutes of new prebeta gameplay kinda misleading title i have seen all of this already why is it so pixelated settings display postprocessing motion blur off its like killzone on cocaine great looking game cant wait tired of the word loot tho and game campaigns and modes being built around the loot concept it looks nothing like rage rip theyve recreated every cliche going from other similar games what a shame looks like a better version of that fc5 dlc looks okay not great but not bad lets face it dishonoured 2 prey the evil within 2 doom and trashout 76 all got put in the bargain bin a few monthin cases weeks after launch anyways rage 2 will be heavily discounted soon enough avalanche is definitely one of my favorite studios out there besides the hugely entertaining side they also make truly beautiful games two things i dot love 1 it looks like theres basically no recoil on the gun there should be at least a little 2 the enemies are kind of blending into the environment looking at this footage i was having some trouble distinguishing them from the actual game worldenvironment may i please bee top comment 60fps like rage1 thx 800 isnt that scrotus if the beta is 2x better and the full game is 3x better then i will get this hope they make a mad max 2 after this is released because that game deserved it it was repetitive but avalanche can easily improve on that so smooth no way this is a ps4 footage wow is sooooo amazing its time to party so much hyped i just hope the ending wont disappoint me as the prev game look how beautiful the downgrade will be why do all these games look the same same plot similar weapons why not come out with something different unique oh wait is it because everyone from this generation likes these types of shootemup games ill pass this running on a pclooks to crispy why do these npc look so much like a bo4 battery dont forget guys this is the game that is selling cheat codes something that used to be free no hitmarker no sentimens of impact really it is final generation because the graphics this last games are awesome taking the graphics did not find it interesting this game reminds me of bulletstorm that slam will never get old metro3 rage2 im soo much hype for the two a nice game for little kids can we see the console version now thanks is this a rpg game rage 2 far cry new dawn multiplayer local please soborderlands with trick shots take my 401k cant wait the better far cry new dawn call of juarez gunslinger voice if only this game had a 3rd person mode blurry and dumb ai farcry 6 looks nah this game looks awesome i cant wait to play it the devs should definitely take there time to make this game perfect which the graphics are perfect best on xbox one x therefore making you a much better gamer disagree ask sony 2013 i will play you mean they didnt remove all human npcs and the graphics are what fallout 76 should have looked like only shooting boring mad max farcry new dawn doom rage 2 anyone just loving resident evil 2 right nowwho is your favourite character in all of resident evilmine is sherry birkin d a demo would not go amiss this looks awesome so techinically advanced but guns still using bullets i really hope you can hold more than 2 weapons at a time wow awesome its the new far cry 3blood dragon update thisll be my game after sekiro mark my words please dont release ps5 there so many ps4 games i want to play any online in this game who else thinks theyll add a battle royale new even though i saw it 2 weeks ago this isnt even new gameplay footage seen this like a couple months ago aka destiny 3 and doom combined whoa nice pc footage show ps4 footage already looks sick should i cop how can i get beta for ps4 pretty nice i doubt anyone would help me reach 200 bbrbr looks a new battle game rage 2 vs apex humm is is the best awesome cant wait to play this on pc ultra settings so this is mad max sequel nice heard you was selling cheats as microtransactions i was gonna get this game today but the darkside summoned me 19 bucks on amazon right now got sick of this game after 15 hours game feels unfinished this is seriously one of the most fun games i have ever played also the world design its amazing i do not get the bad reviews unfortunately when this came to game pass i got very excited but since i have an xbox one s i was treated to absolute garbage frame rate and 900p visuals with lastgen textures popping insane load times and just overall jankiness that made me stop playing after about the third ark ability upgrade im sure on pc running on high settings the way its meant to be played i wouldve adored this game but sadly i have no pc rig capable of running it at present so my xbox one s review is never touch even with gamepass itll just agitate you unless youre made of money and just go buy an x1x or a gaming pc lol oh well next xmas ill have series x or ps5 or both and then this will be a faded memory karak whats the square root of blue normal people nani engineers well blue can be broken into rgb values and all the values are set in a range of 0255 with 255 being the maximum for that color let us assume karaks blue has the b value of rgb at 255 and rest are 0 as then no other colors are bleeding into the hypothetical blue color so square root of 255 would be 159687 just so you know its pronounced id software with 2 syllables not idd like one word one syllable theyre pretty famous they made doom i hate the fact that the driving sections are 3rd person view yet on foot its in 1st person that makes zero sense should be one or the other can you see your feet in this game seriously 700000 views and only 24000 likes guys hes providing free content the least you could do is drop a like and share to help acg receive more recognition 530 on the original xbox one this game sucks its unplayable for me super laggy light years apart from dooms super smooth gameplay got it on gamepass played it for 30m and deleted the game already just downloaded 0ff of game pass gonna play regardless but like knowing what im getting myself into just dont buy this game deletes its own save files on top of every kind of glitching i tried every thing for a week my save file was deleted every time lost more than 60 hours thats it for me deleted the game and the save not gonna get back to it most probably will avoid bethesda altogether not buying any of their games seriously i wont be fooled again its like far cry but on meth i was a really big fan of the first game than i saw the trailer of rage 2 and instantly thought to my self nope nope nope and this is the first time i wat h anything about this game lol game is fucking awesome crocs are evil even in the future bahahahahahaha the ai in rage1 was solid sound of the shotgun in this game reminds one from terminator future shock 1319 now on steam its like a shitty borderlands and motion sickness inducing this game fucking sucks i didnt catch you stating if this game was buy right now on ps4 or xbox one i heard that it is a buy on pc but what about consoles decided to pick it up cause i loved the first one was skeptical about rage 2 but after putting about 8 hours in this game is fantastic as far as gameplay the story is basically nonexistent but it doesnt matter cause the game is so chaotic and i love it so worth it but that feeling of playing heavily up scaled game is a huuuugeee turn off s having played through it some it feels more like a crackdown game than the original rage fast and furious never tried to be death racers with weapons installed on the cars and rage 2 is nothing but trash 8 fucking story missions clearly bethesda has no value for rage 2 which is why it barely got a story mode rage was gorgeous and fun but quite difficult especially the coop levels at the begging when you get your dash when the old lady was giving her talk and explaining stuff to you i did i t hear any audio im watching this while the game is installing what is the review for consoles what did he give it heard so much negativity about this game ive watched this review a few times and with it on sale i am taking the leap thanks acg as always love your non 2 min reviews filled with sponsored bull crap what about console ps4 pro lmao at a bob ross dmt painting oh my face hurts you said it was a buy on pc but didnt say what it was for console i like your reviews a lot karak you conclude that this is a buy for me id never touch it after seeing american krogans review as i do not purchase any game that lectures players on woke politics rage cry new dawn cant wait for a considerable sale for this game thanks for this review i would probably miss this game if i had to make a decision based on all big outlets im playing on nightmare difficulty from they very beginning and i have an absolute blast it was the same situation with vampyr where everyone else were against the game but you recommended it and thanks to that i have enjoyed a brilliant rpg you are right man there are very few games like this which doesnt get boring this is the one of game youll never get bored of subscribed so manytutorialsi just want to shootso much dialogue one month after launch and this game is an odd experience there are so many things i love about this game and so many frustrating things that have gone terribly wrong i think its fair to say that rage 2 is a beautiful disaster a game that the majority of people seem to hate its super fun at times but no aspect of the game is particularly satisfying the games bugs have become legendary what bugs me more than anything is a pervasive sense of wasted opportunity the design and attention to detail are all amazing and yet there is almost nothing in terms of storytelling or sandbox customization to keep a persons interest for very long the developers keep adding little bits and limited time challenges to the game and yet none of them really feel like theyve added value to the overall game im still playing as i approach 30 hours in game but the flaws get more apparent and im doubtful ill be starting a 2nd playthrough once i beat everything tuat npc lifting weights is hilarius i really disagree that current consoles are ancient and this is coming from a pc player rage 2 is an awesome pc game my only gripe would be the recordsetting confusion of key bindings ive yet to find one that is comfortable when it comes to using all of your abilities at the spur of the moment the q key seems to work fine for me personally i did run out of good nearby keys to bind all the other ablitlies to who in their right mind would ever bind the alt key to any function in a game and yet the alt key is actually a default binding in this game the game looks and performs phenomenally on my i8700k amd r9 fury gaming rig if youre playing the game from a m2 nvme drive you should definitely expect awesome startup and load times ive been there i absolutely love this game been waiting a long time for it to come outbeing a huge fan of the first rage fun to play and a fairly easy platinum trophy for me gotta lower the merch price i got this for 30 bucks today after re watching this im excited and i got it on pc to thats always a plus been playing this for the past 2 to 3 days its really a blast to play i like that the protagonist do have a voice and talks like a mercenarysoldier im a bit cheap when it comes to bases though basically bombard and shoot the heck out of it with my phoenix before going in on foot haha but loved it fuck the drone trophy ive recently began playing rage 2 on xbox one x i have to say while there is room for some improvement overall its one of the best gaming experiences ive ever hadso far the visuals generally are relatively beautiful the sound design is generally engaging and appropriate for the context the controls are appropriate for the genre and are relatively intuitive you can customize them with different presets and also remap button functions on xbox one the combat is outstanding in this game the bugs have been minor one bandit during a side quest got stuck in a pile of junk during my merciless onslaught on their base and thats the only one im aware of that occured thus far the characters are engaging enough given the context to compell me to accomplish the next task dont expect rpg character depth here elder scrolls fallout mass effect etc theres a variety of fun and engaging things to do in the game world its not as barren as metal gear i wanted this game could not afford at this moment watching acgs review tells me more than if i played the game myself fab its a lot better if you played the first game i saw a lot of pictures from the first game ahh the nostalgia this is like destiny 2 its fun to shoot so its basically a better bulletstorm you remind me of g4tv xplay thats a good thing cause i loved with show any thoughts on the ps4 version just impulse picked it up and youre my favorite critic i cant speak to the overall depth as he did but the handful of hours ive put in so far have been amazing when you get comfortable with the powers and weapons making short work of a bandit den just feels like art the frenetic combat is some of the best ive ever experienced that being said he is also correct in that the story mostly exists to exist the clear purpose of the game is to mostly shut your brain off and go from crazy combat experience to crazy combat experience i just turned resolution scale up to 100 and graphics down runs ok i just love shooters that arent so slow the trademark id fast paced shooting and lack of long rage weapons was an instant selling point for me if i want an interesting story ill just go watch a movie or read a book thanks man im buying the deluxe edition and witcher 3 complete edition theres two camps of games obsessively fun or obsessively detailed games its fortnite vs cod with the majority being somewhere in the middle great at neither i was also on the fence about buying this dont get me wrong i wanted to but i wasnt sure if it was worth 60 dollars but after watching your review i decided to pick it up and ive had non stop fun since thanks acg is it really as goos as borderlands2 is it similar i was wondering how long does it take merchants traders to fully restock on all items a day a week a month so im on my second playthrough and am rolling nightmare this run im on pc too and everything runs really good i havent encountered anything he has im on a gsync 3440x1440 alienware monitor and a 1070 literally the only complaint i have is that we cant upgrade any of the other cars the xerxes is by far the best looking for photos but its slow as molasses also theres furry but plugs in the game worn by dudes it cracks me the hell up i just dont know bethesda really disappointed our family with 76 it might be a good game but weve lost a ton of faith in bethesda except for in cutscenes hats where they animated movie cgi you to death so youll think the graphics ill be waaaaayyy better the crazy thing is all the games that come out have frame rate problems etc makes you wonder why are they making a ps5 like technology actually took a 10 year leap whatever that could be ps5is gonna look just like ps4 pro i can bet on it so its a buy on pc but on consoles yess this has more views than igns review the continuous adventures of the new walker texas ranger god how many people actually get that joke how many people my age get that joke edit in the eyes of a ranger the unsuspecting stranger had better know the truth of wrong from right cause the eyes of the ranger are upon you any wrong you do hes gonna see when youre in texas look behind you cause thats where the rangers gonna be why do people keep comparing this to mad max have you not heard of or played the original rage this game is so addictive i quit having sex with my cousin to play just finished the game not a bad game but not good either after you have done literally everything you cant do much anymore i give it a personal score of 65 out of 10 its a decent game i really like your reviews it makes the game feel more than a game are you ever going to review outward im getting lots of framerate slowdown on the original ps4 the guy with the weights is hilarious as well as the two to the left of him engaged in some kind of biker bondage roleplay ha ha with his assless chaps and strap on doggie tail 1903 there was like 100k bucks there and all you got was 255 report bug props for shouting out other you tubers such a good reviewer dont know if you hear this enough but shout out to acg for making reviews that you legit wanna watch for fun or just to hear his thoughts this mean should be leader of gaming reviews fuck ign tonally this could scarcely be further from rage rage was gritty apocalypse with an earthy mark lanegan track rage 2 is hey we can do borderlands thats not inherently a bad thing but as a fan of the original id rather this had a different name than masqueraded as a real sequel its not like rage was a blockbuster mega success either if this was a new ip i seriously doubt it has any negative effect whatsoever so this is a pc review to be honest as a shooter this game suffers from the greatest sin of all its boring props for mentioning happy console gamer love him combat good story and plot holy shit sucked ass and they did not execute the gamemap well at all btw this heap of shit was not developed by our beloved id software as they are busy working on doom i blame avalanche studios for this disaster of a game bfg9000 breaks the game 1 shots any enemy in the entire game the game looks like excellent eye candy but its gameplay looks very cliche and uninspired i dont know how the driving resembles that in mad max it is pretty clear that the vehicles here respond like theyre too light and bounce like they are made of inflated air rubber toys thanks karak i was on the fence about this game but thanks to your review i decided to purchase the game i am having an absolute blast so far heres to you is anyone else getting issues with textures not loading in at all and falling through the map on pc dont buy it i wasted my money looks like another shitty aaa game im done diving in day one when we all know three months later games hit the salediscount marketplace rage 2 is on my wait for sale list nothing new just different i properly get the game when its on sale at the moment i got too many games and that my number one problem well 12 hours for just a basic run doesnt sound too badespecially compared to certain games which length is under 8 hours and are still 50 and counting rage 2 is farcry 5 without any of the content one of my favorite youtube personalities even if i dont like the game thanks man just finished the game after barely playing it and i gotta say this short story id software part is great avalanche part is terrible in every way long story pros great gunplay and movement obviously its id software amazing ragdoll physics fun abilities decent voice acting decent photo mode cons small and horribly designed map perhaps one of the worst maps ive ever seen in an open world game and its completely lifeless and bland to the point where there is literally no point to freeroaming unless you just wanna kill enemies and do some funny ragdoll launching by far one of the worst and shortest stories ive ever experienced in any games main villain is pathetic and underwhelming final bossfight is done in less than 5 minutes and feels like a 1996 boss not very many abilities or upgrades to the abilities vehicle combat is extremely boring and i dont think i have even touched more than 3 convoys trailers makes it look like this incredible bodylaunching ex this game just makes me want cyberpunk 2077 more great game mad max 2015 is still one of my fav games we didnt get a sequel for mm but at least we can pretend rage 2 it is one wat about on console is worth or wait for sale i unsubscribed not just to angry joe but a lot of reviewers i used to follow honestly im just over the negativity im done listening to people explain to me why i ought to hate a game or movie its not that many of the criticisms arent valid its just that i dont need it broken down to a formulaic system to the point that it sucks the life and soul out of a piece of entertainment weve become a culture that scrutinizes our media under a magnifying glass and finds reasons to hate it instead of giving in to the illusion and just playing to have fun it reminds me of this friend i used to work with in the film industry every superhero movie that came out he would scoff at and ridicule and make me feel bad about enjoying so i stopped enjoying them myself i stopped going and doing something i had always loved because it was low brow and had no artistic merit so one day i just had enough of the elitist bull shit and rekindled my fondness for comic book movies and all that s about 20 hours in or so and i am really enjoying this game it has issues but if you look at this game for what it is chaotic absurd fps mania then this is for you i think a lot of reviewers are playing this game a bit too reserved and expecting too much from it game does not look like a 2019 game foliage doesnt even move when you drive through itanother game that hypes repetitive gimmick shooting and explosions to the brain dead bobos pffff 60 doom 2016 40 rage im ready for heretic on the modern doom engine liked subscribed best game rating system im gonna buy this but ill wait for a sale because of fallout76 did you even go over the story i love the aesthetic of the game tho one of the great things i loved about the first game was its great character design which really helped sell me to the state on the world around me rage 2 not only failed in this but altogether stomped on it textures character models clothing all lost its uniqueness and lust the voice acting and dialogue was as vanilla run of the mill you are the chosen one as you can get its so bad im having an amazing amount of fun with this game highly recommended another first person shooter that most people wont play because it doesnt have a third person option whats wrong with these developers stumbled onto this channel and i got to give you props acg you seem like a legit gamer and reviewer that reminds me of tb rip subbed for sure keep up the great content in my opinion the game lacks attention to detail with the blood and gore system there are no blood splatter on walls or floors there is no squirting animations for dismembered limbs and its really just looks half ass and rushed they didnt really take their time on the game to make it worth it so it would have to take a massive sale for me to buy this game like for 15 its just doesnt feel next gen take cyberpunk for example that game looks very promising and very next gen ant wait for that to come out if it ever does and i hope they dont downgrade it as bad as the devs on this game has done to their game honestly im still mad at how disappointing the end to rage 1 was just some linear tunnels with some mobs to mow down im glad this one is good but ill personally wait for a sale whats up with the lack of multiplayer here especially since the last game had some interesting stuff going for it when it came to multiplayer im a little iffy about the skins but hey as long as they dont randiomize them or make them p2w stuff kinda its all good when i finally get the game maybe ill even buy a few skins since if they are gonna have microtransactions those are the only few ones im okay with why is the game so graphically demanding for the consoles is it bad programming or a very graphically demanding game lots of reviews bashed rage 2 but i had a feel its not the case so i gave it a go and man oh man its not a 10 game and for sure has its issues but shooting wasnt so satisfying in a long time guns feel really meaty and tough enemies arent bullet sponges but rather theres a weight in tearing down their armor my biggest issues so far are driving mechanic which is just average and lack of mission diversity i think rage 2 couldve benefited more visually if they used the doom engine id tech 6 rather than their own otherwise the game seems fun enough to give it a try we dont get many singleplayeronly games nowadays man awesome review people have been recommending you to me for a while should have listened to them earlier easily the best review i have seen for the game you have officially gained a subscriber hi great job on the channel hopefully bethesda will make the next fallout look at least this good this is what borderlands needs to look like i hope cyberpunk 2077 doesnt turn out like this the driving in this game isnt a race against other racers but a race to try and keep your car on the track it is dreadful ill say i think this game is getting judged by other reviewers on bullshit standards looks like this game mostly does what it sets out to do with that being said this bitch could use some drop in and out coop and new game plus i look forward to playing it eh stopped playing rage 2 until the audio gets sorted out wait a secwhat is the square root of the color blue blue wtf so uh is this a not so cartoony facelifted borderlands then the neon apocalypse holy shit that would be an awesome name for a band or album a lot of people were right when they said this game was gonna be an underrated sleeper hit looks so much like destiny 2 i forgot this game even existed ill wait for borderlands 3 i liked this more when there was no focus on story pointless openworld and a boring character you know doom is this game multiplayer injects psycho oh yeaaah looks like rage mixed with halo this or dmc5 i really want to see another game with a story like fallout 3 where there is moments where you can choose different people to follow whether they be good or evil and those choices affect the other factions of the game it makes your playthrough very individualized and helps cover up some lacking parts of the story if they exist the console version is not pretty ill admit it wow excellent review 1856 thats all you need to know fuck these game journalists giving the game low ass scores they are stuck up snobs who suck at fps games this review really helped me make a purchase decision gonna buy it in the next 2 to 3 weeks depending on when im free this is whatwell happen if the dems gain power again best shooter of the year this far love it ill stick with warframe this is literally gored down doom i absolutely love this game so far its pure fun but the 1080p resolution on the xbox one x threw me off at first i seriously thought something was wrong with my tv xbox or game i hope we get 4k at 30 fps soon after a couple years of playing at 4k it seriously sucks going back to 1080p i dont like the color pallet happy console gamer is one of the best guys on youtube nice shoutout bethesda hides bfg 9000 behind a 20 paywall for a deluxe edition i will just wait until 2 expansions are released and get the whole thing on sale in late fall i refunded the game in just 15 min of play cuz cant stand that hit indicator yet alone the headshot 2d sprite skull hey you did a headshot instead of seeing enemy heads blowing up gloriously here is a 2d sprite of a red skull enjoy oh and by the way let me boost that pink and saturation for you and remove any gamma or brightness level just 2 fucking details makes the whole game unplayable for me fucking ragoursly im going to wait for a sale on this one not a deep sale but a sale nonetheless it looks like its right up my alley and its 1113 hours thats what im talking about im a grown ass man with a wife and kids as much as i want to i aint got no time for no damn 50 hour games 1113 is a happy medium for me plus i bought re2make mk11 days gone and dmc5 in the last 2 months so i need to chill before my wife sends me to gaming anonymous the average score is a roughly 710 i think cause it focused too much on having a big world with lots of activites and lots of outdoors fps combat and not enough on story and linear fps combat sections most say the combat is great tho great review as always thanks for the joy bullet sponge isnt fun at the beginning on any level nightmare is broken making handgun impossible melee is weak and no stealth kills you said pc buy now but what about console you are usually my deciding point for 2 years now we have similar taste it has always seenes i will buy this all day at 1499 and thats not necessarily a knock on the game but the simple fact that its not offering me anything really new to experience 1133 i know it looks funny but that kind of lift ups do exist finally someone whos taking reviewing a game seriously most peeps nag and look for the negative thing to tear down a game you sir seems to be honest i bought the game and i didnt regret any second of it i also have rage 1 which was a good game at that time thanks for this review ill hit the sub button the game wont start when you click play in steam xbox one x tech is ancient huh its a neon mad max crispr reference in the opening monologue how many do you think get that one i saw a video of someone just showing off the game in the best way that he could that being im gonna shoot stuff have fun and show off whats noteworthy looked freaking awesome but was skeptical if its really worth the money for me as long as the fps stays at 60 im happy had a blast with doom this game looks like its if doom was made by people on psychedelic drugs and you threw in the overdrive mechanics for good measure similes in this one were on point 636 whos that dude who appears at the window this game gives me a raging boner i wonder if masterblaster is in this game some reference to them would be awesome you earned a sub today buddy like the in depth and honest review made up my mind for me in regards to buying this keep it up looks like a blast to play but sadly its published by bethesda so i dont know what to make of it maybe i missed it but what was the final rating for console i heard the buy for pc but im curious to see if the problems only worsened passed the resolution and framerate drops for console happy console gamer shoutout youre the man for that my g great channel dude mad max was boring as all hell it wasnt very fleshed out imho 1 button everything great vid man it would be nice to have time stamps for the different categories in the description i was super eager to know what you thought of the story and its length i didnt want to try and skip around and miss something like i said its a very thorough review and wanted to see it all whats your opinion on it for console though also a buy came here after seeing how shitty gamespots review of the game was i like yours better keep it up ill wait for a few more patchesupdates then ill grab the deluxe edition look forward to this game in your local grocery stores discount bin that ram move in the cars actually remind me of sleeping dogs mechanics not a bad thing sd was badass edit nice review yet again k you never cease to impress with the depth in which you dive into these reviews and so soon after release no less ive been watching you for some time now youre only getting more insightful and articulate i honestly have no idea how you arent the number one subbed game review channel its absurd when one compares the quality of the content keep up the good work man im sure youll get the recognition you deserve soon for sure i cant wait for the review on borderlands 3 i hope it gets put as a buy because borderlands 2 was the king for me in looter shooters i would never touch anything from scumthesda its a fantastic review but i gotta say the game itself looks extremely boring to me for some reason i find it ironic that everyone wants to compare rage 2 with borderlands doom and mad max and yet almost noone seems to be comparing it to the most obvious game the first rage im not surprised in all honesty because most people didnt even play the orignal rage and out of those that did only a minority thought it was anything special i happen to be one of those 5 people who thought it was actually an excellent game and it annoys me that the developer and publisher have generally acted like the orginal rage never happened and when it is mentioned they try to downplay its relevance for example mocking the ending and making almost no attempt to cater to original fans while rage 2 looks like it has excellent firstperson combat depsite being completely detached from the original thats honestly the only good thing i can say about it the open world despite having more colour and biomes seems way to large for how its actually used full of empty space has an o i hit the like button on other channels videos but not on yours how bout dat acg so its a buy on pcyet you didnt say for ps4xbox what a great guy promoting another channel always respectable acg looks pretty what i would like is a game that tells a story i loved fallout 4 it was like reading a book and making it up at the same time i have not had a game like that since what the hell is that first scene i need one of those grenade launchers games like this dont stand up with todays competition im glad i only rented this game the first two hours of gameplay were more than enough for me to realize this game is way overhyped and grossly underwhelming surprisingly i havnt seen any one playing this game on xbox checked my friends list the last few days and not a single person playing it unless theyre appearing offline im playing on a 4k tv on an xbox one x is it just me or are the graphics really shitty was this game made in 2019 yes the gunplay is fun but hardly anything has texture i turned off the motion blur and it still doesnt help when you throw the wingstick its like youre throwing a deflated football when it cuts off an enemys head the head just falls and turns into a red orb of some kind i bought this game because i dont pay my taxes im surprised how janky the impact animations are from gunfire excellent review you are the only reviewer i watch now as the major gaming websites have not got a clue what they are talking about keep up the good work karak if you had to pick between this or mad max to buy which would you go for great review as always acg lmfaowhat happens when instergramme filters dieshows a laggered whore this game looks like poop on the ps4 pro with my 4ktv otherwise a fun game but really sad that it looks so shitty id sub to happyconsolegamer if he was happypcgamer youre a top man for giving a shoutout to other smaller channels like you said its difficult to get a foothold at the moment also as always great review does anyone know where i can get ammo for the bfg9000 i cant seem to replenish it any where whats with all of the pink is like woke virtue signaling a bob ross dmt painting would be fuckin crazy lol i really appreciate this review no bullshit none of this political crap that other places are doing lovely i will be getting this off the back of your review great review its awful on the i hope they can patch it good job sharing another content creator and mentioning the difficulty peeps are having getting seen you rock i actually enjoy this game its pretty much a doom open world with a mix of madmax and borderlands its just something ive been wanting i love it 1204 vehicle seems familiar wonder if it comes in all black so for console wait for discount love this game so far but anyone else finding it really hard im playing on well hard difficulty but i usually play all my games on the 2nd hardest difficulty but im dying a ton in this game i have two issues but ones not major ill comment on twitter ive parked my phoenix and cannnnnnot find it anymore its literally not there i parked it does it appear somewhere can it be called like your horse in assassins creed odyssey loved your review for me the open world was a huge let down also very small looting system combat is amazing ive played about 5 hours of it and im done repeating on it on the shelf it goes anyone remember brink your description of this game is exactly why i bought it rage 1 was the same lots of flaws but the combat was sooooo good loved it felt like playing a modern half life or quake or something looking forward to giving this a go the second i finish a plague tale which im also loving damn this could have been a great hdr showcase dull surrounding with ultra violet colors particles gameplay looks fun to control though been enjoying this game in some videos im doing about 2 hours in so far if youve played mad max or far cry the bandit camps are very similar clear out the area kill dudes open chest at end best part of the game is definitely the parts parts id worked on the shooting feels on par with doom minus the glory kills the shotgun is very much the doom shotgun with a fun slug alt fire when you aim down sights weapon wheels are a plus and the driving is silly enough sometimes i wonder if major outlets actually play their games i read one review from one and it said the main story is 6 to 8 hours with no side quests besides bandit towns sure i guess they can finish it that fast if they just ran straight thru it and didnt look for anything else but isnt the point of a review to explore everything and see everything thats on offer if its a shitty game i can see running thru it to finish it but they gave it a decent score so that wasnt the case i loved the card game in rage 1 pity that they didnt involve it in this game man what a great review i miss this type of reviews seriously plugging other channels is that what i came here for dont make second guess watching your videos i loved the first one which many didnt like so im happy to hear this game is fun as well gonna buy it now thx for the review 1106 i wish it had that feature from doom as well your not alone lmao anyone on console think that the right stick controls with aiming feels a bit odd the deadzones dont seem right and aiming isnt smooth anyone else experiencing this it seems like a decent id shooter trapped in an avalanche game i had to refund my purchase since it wouldnt launch on steam went to get it on the xbox and the reviews for the game are pretty meh i think ill just wait on getting this until it hits 20 during a winter sale or something meh i will pick it up when it gets down to 5 dmt trip joe rogan has entered the chat 1601 the guy gets lifted like john legend from that shotgun blast and gets back up like he wasnt just sent flying like 5 feet backwards 916 is that guy fieris big brother same developers for mad max yo those reps fucking killed me based on this video i wonder if muddy graphics on the ps4 is due more to poor optimization rather than it being ancient yes those systems are old but this really dont look that much different than doom and that game runs great on almost anything hard pass i see reps like that at my gym all the time range of motion 3 inches doesnt matter if its bench press shoulder press curls squats that scene gave me quite a laugh the baby reps are real i get 60 fps all the time on pc i love it mad max and borderlands had a child is there any character customization not a huge deal just out of curiosity either way i got the game downloaded from last night since i had it on pre order cant wait to play it myself looks way more generic than i thought it would be it looks like the took destiny and added some vehicles effects and bloodgore just playing the game while im on acid its amazing d just picked up the game a couple of hours ago and i got to say its really fun i didnt download the patch which is 14gb so be aware but i am playing this on a standard ps4 and the gameplay is fun the graphics are still beautiful to look at so if you have a pc ps4 pro or one x i can imagine itll look better but for those who have a regular ps4 your still good dont know about the standard xbox one though if i download the patch im sure the gameplay will tighten up because at the moment it feels loose just like how doom was before the patch other than that im really enjoying it no buyers remorse yet if your skeptical check out some gameplay other reviews etc as always love your synonyms and metaphors is there a postend game where we still can have nonpointless exploration to do just to keep experiencing the battles love it im sorry but all i see is farcry xd appreciate you shouting out a fellow content creator shows a lot of character rage coins that you would buy with real money seem to be from 5 35 for the coin packs on psn the only true reviewer on youtube holy shit 42 trending on gaming nice damn i hate when my crusading against shit makes me an asshole but i figured i should post again to relay info if no one else knew yet it seems all the skins in the store are available in game with in game currency just found out so thought i should share i hate being wrong hehe anyway sorry to bethesda it seems what i initially took to be unfair was in actuality completely fair i have no trouble with content being sold if it is also available through a little extra work in the game they are pretty expensive but thats fair enough too many cleft palates fallout with a different skin meh 636 you seeing this or are the mushrooms kicking in somebody please stop the idiot game developer that thinks car racing games and shooters should be one you cant be both looks decent but damn that render distance is low the car at 1205 looks just like the batmobile i wonder how it looks and runs on my xbox1x with ssd in 4k hdr taking on a convo do you mean convoy or is there some sort of drive by conversations battles in this game i stopped the video for like 2 minutes to decide if this was a typo in the script or one of the most bizarre abbreviations ive ever seen this looks like a last gen game how is it so bare when the graphics are so poor crazy they been hyping this game up for like a year accepting preorder money what a joke hope everyone has learned to stop preordering already as someone who doesnt play at 4k would aa even be needed especially when you consider the impact on performance it may have crosshit reps you sir just earned yourself a subscriber such an indepth review thats lacking in some of the mainstream publications you talk like you actually played the game whod have thought that was important lol keep it up bro i look forward to your future content the guns need way better texture models theyre pixelated shit compared to modern shooters beside some games that i really want wait for sale is only my option considering to the quantity of bills i have here in australia jb was selling the game for 58 at least for launch day yesterday which normally happens a launch day sale basically to get more people to get it and from them instead of eb games im sure and for that price i wasnt gonna pass it up thats litteraly less than us60 probably around us50 to us55 plus i was gonna get it at some point since i loved the original rage back on ps3 1015 fuck i was hoping for a game for adults yet me get more hand holding than a fisher price game trails on mapsground really fuck this trend im surprised people were waiting for this game yall seen the first one rightright solid props for shouting out other youtubers 11 hrs thats a sweet spot for someone like me with a busy lifestyle who still wanna get through my games quickly and move on to the next i hate spending eternity in a game i get bored quick ill prob pick this up at some point makes me think of borderlands with much better graphics nicely done happy console gamer is one of my favorites acg you deserve an award for integrity no ads or sponsor bullshit plus you give shout outs to small youtubers it shows that you care about the community it seems as if you care about the little guy the small youtubers the underdogs ive seen some of the best youtubers bend to corporate when it comes to putting crappy ads and horrible sponsors in their videos but not acg keep up the extraordinary work dude i know these videos arent easy to make and are time consuming i just wanted to show my gratitude thank you gore looks so different than the original rage so much more cartoony yeah ill just wait for borderlands 3 love this review props friendo im so bored with video games theyre all so trash rn so im desperate for a good game idk if i should buy this im really enjoying the game its hard to replicate borderlands this man possesses the gift of gab very well spoken i really really enjoyed the original rage but viewing metacritic seems like this one is a pass shortchanged or shortcircuited dropped this is the best first person shooter and game in several years the shooting and driving are near perfect highly recommended looks incredible too at 4k on ultra its refreshing when acg gets more views than ign was waiting for your review as always champ gonna get it on steam most def the combat looks ace borderlands ripoff wait for a sale one player only if so then i might as well get a free downloadtorrent borderlandsepileptic seizures edition reminds me of that really underated mad max game edit acg just mentioned mad max comparison the mans a legend and only person on youtubes advice ill take as ign gave bloody evolve a 90 and that says it all does anyone else feel like they have no idea wtf is going on in this game because theres so much going gon hi all i can only really afford this or a plague tale innocence any advice would be welcome i like games like tlou uncharted 4 halo and doom etc so any help id really appreciate it and thanks for anyones time eh ill just wait for outer worlds i almost always prefer a voiced protagonist i almost always prefer a voiced protagonist who tf plays at 4k under 60fps over 1080p 60fps this game looks like a breath of fresh air ive never heard of you before but this was a really well done review thanks acg think ill just get a plague tale instead thanks to the most trusted reviewer on youtube i made the purchase loving it so far it really looks like they took alot from doom copy and paste with a different skin or color palate your use of the phrase state of decay extra is the meta for a lifeless npc right on brother thanks for the review it was hard for me to follow your explanations this time when will publishers learn not to release games early you only get one first impression still im looking forward to this okay so its a buy for pc but what about console as i get older im actually begging for politicians to stick their nose in videos again only to ban mircotransactions does the game have a coop before knowing if i enjoy your content or not i subscribed because you are trying to grow the community which is a rare thing today good for fucking you also i did end up enjoying your content keep it up the enemies never seem to be any real threat in this game thanks for the review dude i have found myself moving from ign it to you i never watch the whole review just the end but im struggling on console with the controls they remind me of metro very stiff but maybe because theh are more catered to pc one other pain in the ass is i was fighting that lug but monster in the sewers but i found myself dying then going back into the upgrades menu to rebuy skills that i had purchased and giving that the menu is very slow to load that creates another interface problem ill continue to play but yeah im not feeling it so far gameplay performance replayability and story are much more important than graphics if you dont understand or agree with this then go play anthem then get back to me do i get to ride a bike made of human meat edit no not buying it cheers for the review karak just beat rage 1 again for a refresh and think i might have to pick this up was a bit weary saw some streamers not liking it very much but as long as the combat is great and the wingsticks are still badass im all about it pink apocalypse maybe this game good for teenager but as for me is total cartoonish jokeworld maid of pink plastic youtube suggested this to me really good video and you gave a shoutout to a youtuber not used to seeing that on this site its very modest i enjoy that subbed i liked the original rage a lotthis doesnt look like it breath man breath im scared to buy it after buying new dawn and feeling so emptybeat the game and feel like im chuck norris whooping on enemies sup everyone lolz i love how he says that intro this game looks like its from 2012 love the game play views but after 6min into the video i had to mute you for the rest of the video lol reviewed this on joypad disappointed to hear the one x cant even dynamic up to 4k id want to try before i buy to see if the game performs well enough ill wait for saleor wait for borderlands 3 whichever arrives first i got a new copy for 26 bucks aud cant complain when this comes down in price ill give it a go for sure would i have to play the first rage to understand rages 2s story happyconsolegamer so as far as the way the game looks i gotta completely disagree with you now im only abt 4 hrs in but hot damn it looks amazing running 4k on a 2080ti put deacon in this world with his bike let him wear the armor and i think it would be a nice game bob ross dmt painting sold sounds and looks like my type of game this game literally soundslooks like the knockoff version of borderlands with the cheapest version costing more than 80 on the ps4 shop where i live im waiting for a price drop instead great interview will pick up a copy in a few months its pritty much a rip off of borderlands from what iv been reading unlike the first rage there is no multiplayercoop so cant play this with friends ive seen a couple of videos now and honestly to me 95 of the time this game looks like a blurry mud fest with low dynamic range gameplay seems to be no challenge at all point and klick repeat also the driving is a joke johnny millenium the best and karak i always wait regardless of how good the game is glad i waiting for fallout 73 which is amazing now after all the patches summary wait for sale days gone is a wait and this is a buy sigh denuvo is causing your frames to drop below 60 on that rig thats ridiculous i was hoping this game ran on idtech7 engine so i can see what to expect for the next doom but its the same engine as just cause 4 o we already have gaming journalists being offended with the portrayal of mutants so im pretty sure now its a good fucking game acg as always if ya like the video go out there and find a smaller youtube that you watch but maybe have havent hit the subscribe button before and hit it me ummm since when has this as always been because this is the first time ive heard of it lol yes i am glad u enjoy the gameplay too acg the shotgun in this game is the best shotgun i ever used in a video game holy crap satisfaction overload love this guys reviews reminds me of the hayday of gaming mags in the 90s you just cant go wrong with id software when it comes to shooters i might buy this one looks like balls to the wall fun rage 2 a near perfect game no thanks bud ill wait a month for the discount is it just me or does this man sound like anthony fantano i will stick with the angry joe review lol this guy talking too much for nothing id pay 20 for this in a year or two and this is coming from a guy who doesnt regret buying doom 2016 at 60 always loved your reviews acg and this one is by far one of our best thanks so much for your review gonna get me some rage 2 so not a buy on consoles love how reviews on yt nowadays are like 5 min long and 1 or 2 of those minutes are fucking advertising lmao i really channels that not give a crap about yt ad money and open up their own donation pages rare to find integrity today in everything basically great review and a good heads up to happyconsolegamerbeen a subscriber to him for 10 years courtney taylor is in this game ill have to get it jack from mass effect fallout 4 328 how im dealing with negativity in 2019 id prefer a painkiller game over this not a remaster a new painkiller game why would anyone say this is like dark souls just get mad max instead much cheaper especially when on sale and much better overall too with very similar gameplay and story elements im surprised acg didnt mention it everyone complaining about the stereo sound and im here deaf in one ear asking for mono audio in games i did 100 completion of mad max so i have no fuckin problem with repetition im glad i am not the only one who noticed and was slightly bothered by how slow vehicle combat felt i loved mad max and was excited for this game and then i started seeing the death machines creeping along like snails on sand paper you know what they shouldve added was the first game as a pre order bonus just saying the shout out to other content creators was pretty cool im here because im tired of steams flood of reviews from people who are like i have an hour into the game so i havent really played it but it looks good look at me because i have a review up earlier than most people this game just came out how are you already reviewing it this was a great reminder of why i subscribed to your channel and have stayed a fan i was excited about rage 2 before the reviews started rolling in but i have to admit i pretty much wrote it off based on what i was seeing on metacritic your thoughtful and thorough commentary particularly as regards the fun factor has swayed me back in the other direction though for me i think this is probably a wait for sale but im still into it do you think its reasonable to expect a steady 60 fps at 1440p with a gtx 1080 and i78700k also i love that you took the opportunity to shout out a smaller channel much love dude thanks for the review im curious about what they have planned for their wasteland challenges and world events looks like far cry 3 finally got a competitor 2012 wants its game back how is this releasing in 2019 so should i buy this for my ps4 original or wait for sale i didnt hear his end review on that i almost never subscribe or likedislike youtube vids but for acg ill take the effort love it the ai looks fake af great review absolutely loved mad max and doomso this is a buy for me game would of been much better had there been a 2 player coop option this game is just screaming for a friend to tag along blowing everything up im loving the game so farwhen im not having to restart due to bugs that is played about 2 hoursrestarted 5 times due to freezing or just not being able to move my character playing on xbox onex not buying cuz its not sold on me good review about what i would say about it on almost every point the fun outpowers the little issues here and there for me hate bethesdas cash grabbing content cutting but they certainly arent the only ones doing it wish it would stop cosmeticsskins are not paytowin but they are still content i found the armor in the beginning made sense i just found it an odd plot point that there was no armor reserved that was walkers own the dialogue explained somewhat why he was a ranger all of a sudden especially the tablet intel it mentioned he had a spot in the rangers his adoptive mother was just keeping him in reserve in case of a bad event it was weird though that although walker has a spot in the rangers on hold as a secret weapon there was no armor stored away walker just keeps on using the second hand armor he appropriated hehe odd plot hole albeit a small one i hope the content they intend to add and just raw replay value keeps me im on the fenc game looks amazing to me definitely going to buy it awesome that you shouted out hcg he deserves it now i really want a bob ross dmt painting thanks subscribed because he promoted smaller youtube channels this game reminds me final fantasy 8 a lot very similar gameplay and theme its cool this is the sad part about single player games meh doom looks better and was extremely optimised compared to this definitely waiting for a few patches and a price drop on this most important thing is ai if not great than no i swear these games get shorter and shorter by the year 99 will get you about 68hrs full story 130 we will throw in an extra 30mins with an exclusive deluxe mission is it only me or do you guys also have the feeling that this could run on ps3 i mean the game play is good but the graphics eh pass if i want to play a game with good combat ill just load up doom again subbed because of a good clean but technical to the point review also because of the respect for calling to paying it forward for the smaller youtubers instead of the standard sub beggary great review sam riegel did an amazing job with the male protagonists voiceover imo awesome review as always btw this game looks like just another garbage game that people will play for a week or 2 tops i love this guys reviews you make the best reviews around buddy objective facts honest assessment cheers this game looks really fun im going to give it a try what about thoughts on the consoles never heard you weigh in on those im sure its fun but i kinda just wish they had made mad max 2 i cant believe i stupidly criticized acg before hes one of the best hands down im buying this tonight i always comment to tell u that i love u manand i fucking love ur videos keep it going if the ai was as good as stalker then it would be good but they are just simple retarded ai like almost every game now it is better than rage 1 but i would say 30 off to make it worth it or 40cad or less like that aspects that made rage 1 memorable are here the driving mechanics to be sure disappointed that they could not optimize this game to run at locked 60 fps on the pro or x at 1080p there is no excuse for this looks like a deep sale down the line thanks again karak for another awesome review been looking forward to this game but will buy on sale in a couple months mad max was only able to achieve those high vehicle speeds as the world was empty the engine didnt have to stream much while rage is much more dense increasing speeds would only make the popin issues far worse i just want a new mad max but ill settle for this for now loved mad max amazing review youre on trending for gaming in australia mate love the reviews what about the sniper rifle coming from someone that played the previous game no 4k no hdr on xbox one x wtf acg is the only hyphenate game review channel i trust god the ai looks horrific i love the bright colors as you said its such a nice touch the art style is so cool in this game 2k is the way to go even with high end cards maybe ultra wide 4k just doesnt have the hardware yet to push those kinds of pixel counts yet what about coop your reviews are always so well done always appreciated youre the gold standard of gaming reviews i remember rage had a terrible ending like they ran out of time this game i assume doesnt suffer from this issue im on a 1080 ti and i play in 4k high and i usually get above 60 fps so if youre on a 2080 ti it seems i may have to lower some settings to medium love the upgrade system great review again thank goodness for nightmare mose also grabbing this tomo lets get to 1 million subs for acg guys he deserves it anyone here who hasnt subbed for him go ahead and sub right now fxaataa why are you using that if youre on 4k still dont know if i should pick this up or not games are just so expensive these days it has to be really good to be worthy of a purchase why do i recognize loosum hagars voice is it from farcry 5 do they explain the out of place vaporwave style hud stuff or did they just add it in because people get wet over anything 80s i come to acg the only reviewer i trust now can i gets a witness that was the exact information i needed to make an informed purchase i love these reviews thanks for doing them you know what you suggesting a smaller youtube channel instead of promoting your own even though that is expected brought warmth to my heart and i really appreciate that surprised that ign and other folks didnt made a review about it pc for the win like always d is 4k mainstream acg borderlands and mad max slammed together like randy pitchford slammed claptrap against the wall looks like its trying too hard to be every dystopian game ever with a hard mimic of borderlands but yet still looks generic doesnt even make me think of the first one not sure how to place it it just looks odd is there new game tbh i was gonna get this hoping for a fun arcadey fps and thats exactly what it seems to be so im down excellent review karak i was worried if we would be able to continue the game after we finish the story but you cleared it right up i loved the first rage and i loved mad max so i cant wait to play this this game has a 15 of being bough by me 110 if we could play in coop acg the only youtuber i know who says to give the video a thumbs down if you didnt like it am i the only one that thinks this game looks hokey looks like something you use to play at an arcade i cant wait 1727 crack sip ahhhh yep they dont make vehicles like that anymore while rage isnt my game this definitely gets me more excited for doom eternal seems like a fun time definitely will purchase this game mostly for the combat which looks very satisfying thanks acg i only watch acg for game reviews unbiased and smartly done whats this aesthetic called the whole dessert but with future space stuff as well and blatant punk style i liked mad max i will pick this up at some point really nice to see the shout outs to the smaller channels you are an international treasure can we turn off that damage indicators turn off anti aliasing when playing at 4k native 4k is sharp enough to keep edges clear of jaggies the only time you might still need it is if you experience flickering you probably could have had a nice 60 fps at 4k with the aa off sounds like im getting this next year on discount thanks for the review this dude is way beter then ign andt game spot man i love your reviewsyou save me so much money and time im sick of ign gamespot many thanks to you dude 809 the popin gonna wait i so highly disagree about your performance issues and with the statement the game is sometimes ugly i think thats bull it looks gorgeous 99 percent of the time i feel like sometimes you are really inconsistent when talking about graphics and performance between games you said the original doom looked fantastic and it had every issue you mentioned graphically while rage 2 looks better on every single way and the fps dropping from 60 to the mid 50s isnt enough of a problem to even notice so why mention it simply dropping from 60 to mid 50s and even lower 50s on console is not in any way bad performance especially at 4k isnt consistent with some of your other reviews i loved the first rage but this game isnt even a rage game its some weird combination of doom mad max and crackdown i dont think ill be buying this till it goes on sale what about the ai the ai in the first rage was actually really good and the combat was excellent too this game looks like youve seen it all after watching 10 minutes neon pink might look ok in a cyberpunk but here it looks like a texture not loading ie out of place pop in ruined the first rage for meshame they cant fix it days gone crackdown 3 rage 2 im so sick of these mediocre checklist games acg the best hopefully they listen to criticism and fix the problems if they are that bad i like companies that listen i kind of let launch problems slide until the updates roll through i want to get this game but ima kinda disappointed it doesnt have multiplayer happyconsolegamer nice shoutout great review so honest and informative i definitely appreciate your channel hearing far cry new dawn brought up few times makes me not wanna get rage 2 since i played new dawn 2 hours after owning it for 2 months rage 2 looks awesome and doesnt even seem like new dawn will be half the game this is without even playing it does remind me of bullet storm action gameplay which was awesome gamecant wait to play rage 2 i know its gonna be hell of a game thanks for review i honestly would wait for a sale it looks like a really good game and i couldnt wait for it to come out but its just starting to look like another game where you have some outposts and missions but with doom it might have been a little better if they added a multiplayer but that would also depend what it was you had me when you showed me all the upgrades yeah this is going to be a fun game buying it now i cant believe youre asking for viewers to subscribe to other channels garrick youre a good man thank you for showing the pc options menu stabbing someone with a fork to show you are hungry lol i upvoted as soon as you promoted another streamer i remember playing the first rage and getting a bit of texture and object pop in at times i was hoping that this would be fixed seeing that theyre using a new engine still want the game tho looks like too much fun to turn down great review i was doubtful from the start how open world this game would be will wait for sale pass a plague tale innocence for me hello sir how the hell are ya another hype game in 2019 thanks for the mention of the microtransactions have been waiting for your review of this i loved the first one on ps3 but was extremely short lived seems this one will be short too unfortunately still going to wait for a sale despite all the positives wow i think this is one of the only times ive seen a youtuber suggest their viewers sun to smaller channels slow clap did you ever hear of a youtuber called the dunkey video game hes pretty underground but maybe next time give him an out shout you hcg and victor lucas are the best reviewers out there thanks for the great work really disappointed with how this game looks looked so much more fun when they first unveiled it thanks for reviewing this one now ill buy on my pc instead of console probably if i hadnt watched this i would have never known that console had some issues u have saved me acg i fuking love the missile launcher design its the fallout 3 missile launcher mad max on ps4 is one of the best games on ps4 you can put a thumb down if you didnt like the review haha youre funny p youre one of the last reviewer that actually review a game entirely graphics sounds gameplay etc instead of put pc none sense thanks for doing what youre doing you got a new subscriber for sure remember when you used to earn unlock stuff like weapon and vehicle skins by playing the game and you could show off to your friends some of the harder ones to get its just cosmetic yeah that used to be ingame content once upon a time fack man ahhhshiti was thinking of getting it but if your monster of a rig cant keep it a steady 60 fps mine wont even manage 20 fps on the lowest settings oh well sup everybody this is carrot i think thats awesome that you always tell people to go help out a smaller channel amazing stuff dude been following you for years best review i have seen i am glad i got my deluxe and ready to play it at midnight today can you just say if its good or not at the start of the video god damn microtransactions means content that should have been in game is now instead in a paid store remember when you used to buy the whole game and look forward to story expansion dlc watching the review but no plans on buying i will get doom eternal great review as always but i wouldve liked to hear about that wingthroatcut thingy that was for me the highlight of rages combat i thought it looked awful in the trailers but seeing the finished im impressed of what you can see on this video visually i love how you give shoutouts to smaller channels thats amazing subbed this is like the only cool game thats coming out at all this year on xbox so i may pick it up this weekend gaming this year for triple a seems pretty weak until borderlands 3 but im not even sure about that hey fist time on your channel and i loved that review unfotunately i cant really pledge any money on your patreon at the moment but i liked and put your review into my favorite playlist idk if it helps but i hope so i wish you the best seems to me like you have what a growing number of people are looking for on youtube these days yeah it doesnt tingle my dingle worst reps ever nice one mentioning happy console gamer its cool that he actually seems to like games i find many critics to be too criticalnegative forgot about this game as a fan of the original i never expected to see a sequel im pretty stoked to play it however kinda not happy there is no coop my brother cousins and i used to play the hell out of the coop adventure in rage and always thought if the main game had coop with twice as many enemies it would be a blast if im correct you said it was a buy for pc does that mean its a wait for a sale on console crocs im currently watching this while wearing mine hey just thought if theyre good enough for deadpool hm i love the original rage but after watching this video i am not sure about rage 2 yes rage had its flaws and limitations like the very confined actual shooting parts or levels but i love the world the characters the gunplay i was crazily in love with those boomarang thingies and with the crafting systems them shooting spiders where just too cute this on the other hand especially with all the neon colors which i personally loathe looks more like a far cry game to me and those i find extremely boring silly and stupid the first person turns me off im actually really looking forward to this despite a few middling reviews as soon as i read about how good the combat was a point which youve echoed i was pretty much sold 11 to 13 hours wow that not very long mainline i feel like even when a game is a buy i have to wait to purchase it because of bug issues so id rather get an updated version of it as opposed to the launch version of the game its avalanche and its the same engine jc4 uses of course there are performance issues and of course they will never be fixed youre fucking amazing not only are your reviews great but the way you shout out smaller youtubers to help the community as a whole is amazing thank you for being such a competent reviewer and a stand up dude makes me want to go play the first one right now what far cry new dawn couldve been the anthem of borderlands awesome that you shout out smaller channels we all appreciate it dope reviewand im actually going reinstall mad max bc of this im only 45 done thanks for this review you just saved me some money ill probably wait until its on sale for next to nothing im going to wait for a sale a bob ross dmt painting really have you seen bob ross paints before lol i kinda like the detail where you can shoot bits of the armor off the enemy and hes still alive best and most honest game review channel on youtube period really like the shoutout to smaller content creators it has no coop so its a deal breaker for me personally you missed the right turn i was yelling at my phone turn around turn around lol this or days gone loved the review as always will probably wait for some patches and a sale hopefully they can fix the pop ineven though devs almost never do best reviewer in the world you and happyconsolegamer are my go to reviewers nice shoutout 1135 crossfit kipping curls johnny is the man mang im a small youtuber that permanently flickering skull is annoing asfnever touch for me this is a never touch for me absolute generic crap looks a lot like a game that ill get on a steamsale for 999 in 2022 already pre ordered i love rage thanks acg just preinstalled for my son for his birthday he loves doom mad max only birthday gift he asked for his birthday is the 20th but im let him jump in early when he is with me thursday thx my man acg actually reviewing games instead of moviestv shows and a rare random video game here or there meh i was kinda on the fence about this game but ill pass on it i think it looks worse than doom something about the visuals that looks weirdly bland at times even far cry looked more colorful than the zany rage 2 nice photo bomb 636 lol subliminal much lol im really digging the different channel plugs i hope this continues to be a thing that dodge at 332 was so smooth another shitty id engine go figure loved the review now im more excited to play rage 2 by the way i subscribed interesting opinions but i only trust ign gamespot and angry joe reviews ill take this one with a pinch of salt happy console gamer hes that gamer dude you wish was your friend back in the day love his videos mad max with a new skinill just skip this ty acg for the review looked forward to this rage 2 for a whilenice to see its turned out alright should be a good hold over until doom eternal comes out give the shooting mechanics look identical wait for sale 407 ive never been so disappointed in water physics as i was in that moment yes the happy console gamer is my favourite youtube gaming channel john is so enthusiastic about everything its intoxicating hello everybody sir davos here i already know happy console gamer but why the plug p rage whats rage thanks karak for letting us know of the presence of microtransactions will keep an eye out on those mad max was fun as hell and the first rage game was really good so looking forward to playing this one this game trailer looks good at first but ill wait for sale worst reps ever lol nice shoutout to hcg from acg if it has microtransactionsnope so is this character related in the backstory to walker texas ranger do you know if youll be able to upgrade from standard edition to deluxe for 20 i want the preorder bonus but im just short of getting the deluxe edition i did not know that you do a podcast show alsowatch your reviews for a long time nowand some how i always thought your were blackgreat reviews you give btwgonna check your last podcast now rage 2 far cry rage doom bullet storm mad max borderland all combined yo jdawg im subbed and belled but i never got a notification however im on the mobile app and your video was the first to pop up when i searched rage 2 review wow your channel has exploded in the last 2 years hmm guess i should have waited for this review or others for that matter before buying this for the console seems like a play once and be done game not something you can play for years and still enjoy no co op and not the best at anything or even very good for that matter glad i only got the standard edition i will say its cool to see that armor pieces come off only other game i noticed that has this that i have played is perfect dark zero too short ill wait for a sale worst reps ever thats a very high quality review keep up the good work what up bro all right ill go check your friends channel but let me subscribe to yours first great review did the sentry guns and card game from the first one make it into rage 2 borderlands 2 will prob piss all over this and its 5 acg shits on the main stream game activists sorry journalists again and again sorry gamespot and ign and polgon and kotuku you loose hands down again and the sad thing is you could be good by listening to acg and his work and notice he never bores us with his political views like you losers oh yer and he does not lie or plagiarise thats something else you got to work on so summing up main stream so called games journalism we find you embarrassing im 1 minute in and i was actually a little touched by your attitude with the suggestion to support smaller youtubersand then mentioning one thats so awesome and way too rare these days nice d your reviews are always great please review mk11 you said on the pc this is a worthy title for purchase does that also apply to console i absolutely love happyconsolegamer easily one of the best gamer channels on this platform you and his channels are the two main channels i watch for anything gaming wise awesome that you gave him a shout out props to karak for mentioning happyconsolegamer that guy has been consistently great for years now and its great for him to get this kind of exposure did someone port far cry to the id engine early reviewsugh the selling point for me here is the fun factor the gameplay looks great and im looking forward to the guns and the powers those main character choices which one is the girl your review is the only review respect for shouting out happy console gamer convoy the square root of the color blue is 001596871942267131 255 which is practically blackbtw good video thank u karak for bringing us yet again another review that isnt 2 minutes long filled with sponsored bull crap thanks for the review bro much appreciated if only total biscuit was here to review it how many hours the gameplay for the main story 1054 did you just use ammo to shoot a crate and get more ammo yes please i really enjoyed the original rage and rage 2 seems to have addressed most of the issues i had with the original definitely picking this up thats a shame about hdr i was looking forward to see hdr in this can i play this to the fullest if i havent played the first one i think ill reinstall borderlands 2 now what im hearing is a temporary borderlands happy console gamer is a cool dude i just want doom eternal already no mention of boosters and cheats they are selling this sounds like a bgame with some aaa mixed in and if they focused what little aaa they had on the gameplay i am down to clown i can totally tolerate the roughly animated and acted characters for quality game play moments also im an upgrade addict so upgrades for my upgrades is very compelling 60 seems high id prefer 40 but im willing to pay the 20 premium for the interesting flavor of the world next time i get paid anyway honestly thank you for giving happy console gamer a shout out one of the most passionate gamers on youtube game reminds me somewhat off oddworld strangers wrath damm that was a long time ago can you play gambling minigames for cash like the original rage that card game frenzy was great remember boys and girls congratulate id software and avalanche studios for this not bethesda bethesda did jackshit and almost pulled the plug on this game when id and avalanche asked for more creative freedom sad to see that this game is singleplayer only what a missed opportunity bethesda involved not a dime again acg continuing to carry the torch after the downfall of projared sometimes having a shorter video is really nice can you customize that monster truck gutted about the lack of multiplayer how will this run on a 2080ti 1440p thank you for the review i loved the first one and im glad there is a 2nd cant wait to play it at midnight this game is already 50 bucks on walmart dont pay full price wait for a price drop both days gone and rage 2 never caught my attention i was right what an honour getting a shout out from my favourite reviewer cheers thanks karak thanks karak enjoyed your commentary looks good mechanically but very shallow pass huh forgot about this game marketing where angry centaur gaming im one of your original subscribers as always great review but more importantly great entertaining video just wanna say i really appreciate how much work you put into these reviews it shows keep up the good work like a bob ross dmt painting your similes are the most unique on youtube man lol i love happy console gamer hey i watch happyconsole very nice recommendation 1080p on xbox one x man ill wait for a sale or until it gets on gamepass since everything by bethesda seems to end up on there looks ordinary and lame tbh can you turn off hitmarkers they took out the card game from the first one and it honestly kinda makes me wanna skip the entire game thank you for the review 3 im gettin it on console but graphics never bothered me cause doom 2016 also looked like crap but was a fun game far cry blood dragon x rage this acg and the fellas at easy allies are of the very few trusted reviewers that i listen too all others are either paid by the devs to say good things about their games or are clueless gamers who need single magic button to do everything for them thanks for being honest about the performance some people are choosing to gloss right over that definitely wait for sale then give it to me straight is it a console shooter where your life is directly proportional to the amount of hitscan jam and hit flinch inflicted borderlands hard reset cod gears of war mass effect or is it a true shooter where enemies are tuned to let a good player counteract the worst of the nonsense without resorting to a terminal case of chest high walls quake2painkillerhalf lifecrysis uh oh guys looks like were going to get just caused 4 again with performance smdh looks cool but ill wait for a sale also bl3 ill probably pick this up on a steam sale and the same with metro exodussince it will slide through the winter saleso ill wait for the spring or summer steam saleif the price isnt reasonable around february waited a full year so waiting a few more months i can do this game could not look more generic it looks like a game thatd be played in the background of a tv showwith a name like splatterkill 4 or something i was unable to hit 60fps at 4k most of the time that means nothing to most people without monster pcs i like hcg and am subscribed to his channel but does a youtuber with 200k subs really need a plug over the countless other truly smaller gaming channels doom 2016 meets mad max and blood dragon count me in i enjoyed avalanches mad max and this looks like silly fun thanks for the video as always telling people to go find a small youtuber to sub to is honestly a very wholesome thing to do keep on being an awesome dude i actually feel good about preordering this yay me the ai in the original disappointed me the enemy ducking and diving was directly based around the players ads aim point while the game itself was more of a cover shooter with a fragile player than quakedoom dancing with death john wick 3 rage 2 this week a lot shoot em up bang bang action i cant wait to play great review is the game fun to play that all matter no acg medievil review buy wait for sale rent never touch like how the game looks i think the small amount of npcs can be very beneficial to the game and the feel of its world the sense of desolation can really enhance the overall atmosphere after all the game is set in a postapocalyptic world and the downtime can be very beneficial as well as it builds up tension making every encounter in the world more exciting and memorable it is much better than throwing things constantly at you in my opinion as that can be rather tiring at times and the downtime also gives you more time to appreciate the atmosphere as well glad that days gone came out when it did because if it was at the end of the month i would have preordered this game ill wait till i can get this game for 20 cad so likely by the end of this month thinking about buying this tomorrow looks dope i loved doom and since id worked on this game i think i have to play it d i wish it wasnt so short appreciate your efforts sir does this game support 144hz theres this one small gaming youtuber i think really deserves a shoutout from you hes this really funny half chinese half german guy youve probably never heard of before happy console gamer is an amazing youtuber as alway the deciding factor of my game purchases thanx man you and happy console gamer are great my go to for reviews and gaming content the pink makes me want to puke mad max mixed with borderlandsi can dig it console owners got shafted apart from the awesome review i love the fact that you shout out smaller youtubers and giving them leverage that speaks a lot for itself respect need to play this on my oc sapphire vega 64 vulkan is the future i confirm 144fps 1080p at all time with 2080ti 32gb ram and 8700k happy console gamer is awesome i love your reviews man seems like another 710 was hoping for more i always look forward to and appreciate your views and reviews to great to hear unbiased opinions that look at games over an overal basis and try to give recommendations that arent just review scores i held off on getting days gone based on your review of it but im definitely buying rage 2 i already intended to but this review sorta helped allay any fears i had surroubding it your reviewing is phenomenal top work fella man i really want to play this 1650 the hunter becoming the hunter dont think thats the expression bro my favorite thing about this channel is that he doesnt just not beg for subs but he also encourages people to sub elsewhere to help out others what a cool dude maybe i will wait a little longer until they fix the issues you mentioned but at least the gameplay is solid and it looks fun looks like a cartoon if i wanted that i would play fortnite but i dont want to play fortnite because im not 12 this looks like shit i wouldnt play it even if it was free theres an obvious lack of effort as far as artistic design graphics lighting and gameplay goes no thank you dude are you playing an fps with a fucking controller a lot of people hated on this i didnt but i am very disappointed about no 4k on my xbox x or pro thats bullshit i will not be able to tell the framerate difference from the 60 fps to 40 but i can clearly see the difference from 4k to 1080p they made sure they killed time and made a female protag so white femenist with purple hair didnt feel oppressed maybe you should just give us 4k on 2019 instead that flickering skull icon in the hud bothers me for some reason is there a way to turn off the flickering in the options what did you think of the latest episode of game of thrones i though if you look back at episode 1 when dany reacted to the death of her brother that was a sign already she wasnt mad she was just being who she needs to be a conqueror if she had let the bells ring and let there be peace the lords of westeros would not respect her as lady olenna said before she needs to be a dragon not a sheep nice detail in this review you earned my sub sir youre the best thanks for the review no hdr what a bummer i thought this game would have had that for sure this guy is the best reviewer around always fair no bullshit purchased this is the kind of review i was expecting i dont even know why they release games anymore when they are clearly not ready this reminds me of just cause3 which to me was the worst frame rate issues i have ever experienced in all my years of gaming this belongs in the bargain bucket with far cry games just cause etc just fillers that dont really offer anything original new or exciting get them for 15 at xmas if you are bored type of games you talk too fastmuch while using the same cadence and overlong sentences makes you hard to listen to acg please review mordhau this game is not getting the attention it deserves as always great review but this time ive got to admit that something was odd for consolesis it worth a buy right now or wait for a sale i urge all games to share this channel i dont say this with anyone tell all your mates about acg this is the only channel we get the truth i dont watch any others except this and gameranx all the big names are not honest and feed false info channels like this are the ones we should all be helping to grow spread the word guys one love but do enemies respawn tho its funny because im playing mad max again right now and i pre ordered this so i can play it at midnight im definitely gonna enjoy this game damn thats disappointing hey man i love your content and its really nice to see you shouting out fellow youtube channels paying it forward what about ingame purchases can we focus on 2k maybe not many realy care about 4k yet 111 wimothy tillits tim willits id software easter egg its a bethesda game youre going to have pop ups and all those issues its nothing new is it just his choice of gun or is the gameplay actually looks boring enemy point click dead nice shout out to happy console gamer im excited about this game but open world games get boring so im just going to wait for the game to go on sale good review 19 minutes come on man im at school after rdr2 i told myself im not buying any more open world games no matter how good they look i think its partly because my life just isnt conducive to them any more but i just find them boring after a little bit if only borderlands 3 was not announced two weeks before this game releasedkilling any excitement i might have had before going into it now i am replaying that franchise with a few friends loving every second of it all over again and i forgot this game is coming up tomorrow this to me is the same as cod i dont see anything different here carry on how is this game not multiplayer its the best application for it bring rage 1 to switch was kind of interested in this didnt like mad max think ill wait until its on sale this cemented my decision keep doing you and thanks man i second following happyconsolegamer when he talks about old school games and anime i wish i was in the same room having the discussion with him hes really passionate about this stuff i like how youre talking properly in this review and not jetstreaming as if youre on adderall weirdly this is the game i was the second hyped for this year after metro 2033 glad to see it turned out good is it just me or does the original rage look better than this one this is a 40 bucks or less game for me this is the just cause 2 developer right i like the suggestion you made for people to check out smaller youtube channels great video as always i love when developers tell non pro owners to get fucked no thanks ill wait for a 50 off sale on steam already preordered on xbox one x hopefully freesync 1440p will help with the performance issues thanks for the review acg first time watcher appreciate the level headed take karak you need to update your review intro not 10 mins long this is 19 mins and i take it you mean well under 10 mins mad max was one of my fave games this looks like a decent next step but i really wish you could play 3rd person and have some cool melee moments too thank you acg for the always amazing and trustworthy reviews so glad you shouted out hcg listening to this review makes me wonder why pc gamers argue that 1080p 60 is better than 4k30 no one wants blurry outdated graphics 1080p is trash compared to 4k and there is a very big difference between the two upgrade tvs and consoles x just to be forced to play at the lowest setting possible disappointing it feels to me to me that avalanche studios wasnt the studio to use for this particular game developers should take full advantage of the consoles and hardware they utilize another damn solid review karak i never played the first game looked a bit drab to me but this i like the look of im spoiled for choice with my backlog for now but ill probably buy this a couple of months down the line who knows might be even better by then with a couple of patches released thanks for the continued stream of great content man d carrying tombstones i am still laughing thanx for the review dude endless looting bleah is john goodman voice acting any the characters so its just a newer version of borderlands love your videos brother keep up the good work like someone else said even if i have no intention of getting a game i still watch your review lol to bring back business gamestop is releasing rage 2 1 hour before it releases worldwide at least at the gamestops in my area call your local one before taking my information as concrete when is this game coming out looks good nice great review this is a game ill be picking up i am so glad this game is not another looter shooter like it could have been is the player character doom guy it is open world right happyconsolegamer is a great reviewer fact never heard of it but this shit look so fun johnny millennium is great i love listening to his stories hes about the same age as my older brothers and it feels like im listening to them recount their tales of youth one of my favorite channels on the tube as always the best review man and big ups for recommending other reviewers happy console gamer is a great guy is there any coop can i play through the game with a friend another awesome review i cant wait to play this tonight is it meor does the game feels slop paced i can never sit through a whole video from you your cadence comes off like some meth head babble xbox one struggling to stick at 30fps on 900p is the saddest thing ive heard in a long time thanks for the awesome reviews and commentary all the time acg question is it better to support acg on your youtube or on twitch i love that instead of begging for subs for yourself youre doing it for others 1650 hunter becoming the hunter so whats the change sorry i love your stuff but i just got into school so i let out a bit of anger sorry what i gather from gameplay videos and your review it seems like they took the driving aspects of mad max watered it down by making it slower and less kinetic with a less interesting world to look at the gunplay of doom but again slower and worse map design of the arena like places where you fight and not to mention that the neon punk esthetic feel tacked on i really hope im wrong and the game is good and im only cynical and bitter go find a smaller youtuber like happyconsolegamer lol wtf pretty sure everyone knows who that is is there races like in the first game death race style races thats something i wouldnt mind doing again pretty amazing that in the end after all these years it really comes down to the originals doom wolfenstein rage hopefully duke eventually we loved them then we love them now lol whenever acg goes into technical descriptions all i hear is wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah like that character from charlie brown smashes open a crate full of bundles of cash at 1900 gets 255 so what i hear is that im about to cop this patterns and moves all i see in this gameplay is enemies standing there barely moving just waiting for the player to grace them with a blast to the face basic imp in recent doom does more than anything shown in this footage not amused ha the one on the toilet looked like chris chan ha can you put time stamps in the description for the different sections of the review the game looks fun but when it comes to this type of game i prefer borderlands i just want more doom style games not fry cry hehe yo johnny millennium aka happyconsolegamer is a great guy always enjoy his videos his whole channel is pure passion towards stuff that he likes you rarely see him talking about something negatively because he doesnt pick negative topics for 90 of the time that is one in depth review good shit i played the first one and enjoyed it a lot so ill prolly be buying this one as well on my xboxx most likely a sale though i exclusively watch you for my game reviews and my cc is still in the mail and i really want to support your patreon but i cant yet but i was wondering how to do the raffle for the game giveaway but always forget how ok ive learned my lesson will never pre order another game ever funny how people didnt like mad max but will gladly accept the ideas that come recycled from it this game looks like a combination of that something like doom and in its color scheme new dawn subbed to happy console buddy man the optimization with the console versions must be shit i mean the game does not look amazing at all yet it can only be had at 1080p on x and pro at least 1440p on x should have been possible given that consoles gpu compared to rage 1 with that said even rage 1 was only an okay game and definitely not something worth 60 after watching this review im definitely in a wait for a deep sale camp i ended up picking up rage 1 like 3 years ago for the 360 at around 399 maybe ill wait until this thing drops to 1999 by the end of the year kinda reminds me of farcry new dawn with those colors lol bob ross dmt painting my type of life loll i dont think ive ever hit play so fast thanks again karek hopefully they start working on mad max 2 so you said on pc its a purchase but you didnt say for consoles ill just assume its a buy as well can the neon road arrows be turned off great review once again karak i didnt even know this had come out thanks acg nope waiting for discount nope waiting for discount i dont always agree with you but i always love your reviews sadly i cant afford the game myself but i really hope the game does great out the gate and isnt just brushed off mantalk sloweryoure way to hecticalspeedtoo much coffee i wished a fallout game looked and played this good though what happened to id rage 1 was awful im not too excited about this one at all nice review however stylistically your similies are a bit overused and delivered too quickly man this game looks really fun whats the open world like maybe 13hours no single player game should be longer imo aside from side stuff better to hace tight experience than a bloated mess the god has spoken thank you my preorder is justified like hdr well like it on another game acg the hunter becoming the hunter thats a bit redundantlol buy on pc what about console not performing well enough on x to care about this game rage was disappointing 2 would be a waste of time yeah nar ill wait for bl3 you were a fan of mad max oh boy im a bit surprised by the number of similarities to the original the trailers made it seem far more different does john goodman show up to grunt out some more lines its too bad they didnt adopt the interactivity of the mad max car combat where youre picking apart every the various enemies rather than just blowing them up in different ways unless im not seeing that i am very hestitant when i pre order a game i know nothing aboutthanks anthem this game looks decent really want to pre oreder but idk i still dont get it nice review btw but rage 1 was nothing special why a sequel best reviewer on the interwebs all you need to know acg reviews that arent filled with sponsored bullcrap proceeds with sponsored bullcrap of some youtube noname what i always compare current fps games to killzone 3 on the ps3 the arkham knight chase is soooo stolen i believe the dodge is literally the same animation the batmobil uses first time to your channel great review really broke down in fair way gunna get my rage on thank you for taking the time to acknowledge another creator during the channel plug respect 40 hours this is short i really hoped rage 2 had a lengthy campaign sounds more like a wait for a deep deep sale for me with the fps issues i definitely will not play until those are resolved im sick of having great hardware in my pc and a game just playing terribly for seemingly no reason at all lol who even are you seems like this game world is actually still pretty greybrown its just they replaced a lot of the light sources with neon colors yellow floodlight becomes purple red flares become blue etc was about to skip this one but saw your review definitely buying it now thanks rage 1 had all this graphic issues fps issues etc which was the main reason why i didnt even play that game but now rage 2 too have the same exact issue what the fuckim hugely disappointedi may not be playing rage 2 as well i guess great review as always thanks looks fun i remember rage 1 was supposed to be this good reimaginedshooter back in the day and that it didnt do so well im glad they hit the mark with this one not even 60fps with a 2080ti is just unacceptable battles were either short changed or short circuited how do you come up with stuff like that thank you for the review acg can always count on you for unbiased pros and cons for any game you turn your in depth eye on an thank you to the patrons of the channel which allow him to do this full time and do it independently games like this should have new game plus borderlands style and progress character more speaking of music do you think one day a game will feature something like spotify or different music apps to add your own soundtrack yes i know you can do that now but im talking about in the game great review cant wait to play tonight damn mad props for pushing smaller channels this alone makes me love this channel looks like i will be waiting for a sale because bethesda games reduce the price after a month i dont think its fair to complain a game cant hit 4k60 on max settings even with a 2080ti thats a big ask also i think itd be nice if you tested a mid range card at 1080 as well since quite frankly only 01 of us actually have top end hardware so its a buy for pc um ok ill wait for a sale freakish crispr dna mutated lovechild of ideas ayyy i get that joke so from what i hear its on par if not better than the original rage but better gunplay for the most part all i needed to hear xd 636 why the face popup you hiding something whats back there whats with all the pink is pink cheaper to program or was it just made my the same people as the latest farcry or as alex jones would say are they trying to turn us gay this stylization seriously looks like farcry new dawn its like farcry new dawn in the desert i preordered the deluxe edition but my ps4 home screen only says rage 2 how do i more sure that i have the deluxe edition downloaded 1209 hell yea love mad max that looks like the apolitical batmobile tank love it i wanna take my time destroying the convoys lol that old guy at 839 actally got me to crack up a little bit 4050 hours for a title like this sorta isnt enough to justify a purchase for full price imo glad its not as awful as the rage reboot a few years ago though oh hell yea im so taking on the convoy in my badass monster truck you the man acg this game is like mad max meets fallout meets borderlands with some call of duty thrown in for good measure welp since im done with red dead i think im just gonna swap it for this game it looks more fun than red deads online angry joe all the way this game looks fucking horrible great review actually really wanted rage 2 to suceed this time and bring this ip to a bit more light lol who even are you this game looks like it came in 2011 super boring to look at dude love your review of this game yup worth the pre order so pumped for this game even more now 627 who is it goons who hired goons i might be able to make an unboxing video for this game thank you for shouting out smaller youtubers they say there is some sort of multiplayer what is it coop just crack it is sad hearing how poorly optimized this game is at least in the current time great review man fantastic review cant believe they didnt include the skins or seemingly few or no others in their 60 game at launch one of the main things putting me off the game up to now has been the obvious lack of visual weapon customization ie not being able to change or just remove weapon attachments now i find out the vast majority of their weapon skins that they talked about pre launch are locked behind further paywalls disgusting i like your ratings scale love your reviews they are always fair and wellfounded keep up your great work greetings from germany welcome to rage 2 everyone and their mums packin round here it sounds like the beginning of the game is shitting on other games that sounds fairly intentional im just going to continue replaying borderlands 2 until borderlands 3 comes out the laymen having going on about the shotgun in this game for awhile now is it that good curious its too bad about the shorter main story hopefully the last act doesnt feel as rushed as it did in rage 1 at least it looks and sounds fun just get it for the rtx plague tale is the game im getting this week when it comes to videogame ai i have the feeling like its stuck since forever nice crisper joke that technology is amazing ive got the xbox one x and a pc with a 1660 ti an i7 7700 and 16gb of ram im torn on which system i should get it on that looks like cyberpunk 2077 ripoff give it 3 weeks and it will be 45 off tbh im glad i passed on this game ill wait till its patched a bit more and i can play it on the ps5 hmmm im 5050 on gettn this thanks for the review was hoping to see more of the crazy weapon modes and powers during the video but its fine just kind of looked like a run of the mill ordinary shooter have a lovely day in acg we trust so say we all pretty disappointing to hear that the story is mediocre and pop in is still a thing apparently they really didnt learn anything from the first game genuinely happy and surprised by the rating i was afraid it will get a wait for sale but can you blow limbs heads etc off of people this game always looked like a decent shooter it never screamed day one purchase to me acg can u tell me about the hidden secrets of the past lore the fiction is it there to find what is it eh i never really pay attention to graphics and issues with pop in and stuff during reviews itll most likely get patched pretty quick omfg 130 that monster truck looks so badass hell yea cant wait to drive it had to watch this part one more time cause it was so epic we needed companions cant chew this bubblegum the new walker texas ranger thank you that makes me smile more than it should if every game had this title quote in their review we as consumers would have our dignity back in this damn industry im starting to like your reviews more and more gonna kick back with this one one of the best reviewers out there so there is hidden secrets about lore and the past to find the hunter becomming the hunter yes a review worthy of our time this game seems alot like mad max and doom had a baby haha i agree with joseph inzigna even when i have no intentions of buying a title i still watch thats the influence you have man thanks again the hunter becoming the hunter i got the game early sunday and for a cheaper than retail price and im already happy with the game especially when i wasnt originally gonna nab it on day 1 but the cheaper price carrot for an early play was enough motivation ive messed around with it for a few hours and done just 1 main mission so far instead experimenting with what the game has to offer and i can see a lot of fun hours to be had in the long term far more interested in watching this review than playing the actual game and its a full price sp game with day 1 microtransactions thats gonna be a definite no buy for me this game maybe when it drops to 20 not more or even less i think it is awesome how you tell people to go check out other youtube channels that are trying to grow could be the same as with days gone right low to average press reviews but gamers say its a good game that was the case with metro exodus which i really loved and ofcourse days gonea really good game and fun to play finally the only sexy beard i trust i love your reviews youve set up the best system for reviewing game imo so i dont sub to anyone but the fact you shouted out a smaller youtuberyou won sir classy shoutout for the smaller yt channels in an era of shameless selfpromotion i was waiting for your review to decide if i buy it or not thanks karak good quality review like always thats how i felt with rage 1 it wasnt the best game by any means but it was just so chaotic and so much fun that i kept playing it anyway i loved the first game even tho the story really wasnt much of a story everything about it enthralled me back in the haydays of the ps3 can you turn off gore and bad language dude the explosion gibs in this game look so awesome no no no so wrong the silent protagonist thing is incredibly boring and over used please please support devs adding voice i was thinking of getting this but then i picked up mordhau over the weekend rage 2 is going to have to take a back seat until i get tired of multidecapitations and laughing as that stupid mounted knight crashes into the stakes i set down on the road a few seconds ago heh this game is dope please take my money whats better mad max or rage 2 game comes out 0200 in the middle of the night welp guess im not gonna sleep tonight so happy this game turned out to be good im going to pick it up thanks acg 40 to 50 hours thats disappointing be honest who else skip right to his verdict so glad i made the jump to pc no 60 frames no deal man i think im gonna wait for a price drop and patches bethesda still has to repay me my money from fallout 76 bethesda doesnt get day one buys after that shitshow i learned my lesson is the loot good i may have missed it but what is the rating for ps4 original i saw people saying that the story is going to be atleast 30 hours i guess they were wrong were the trailers lying to us they made you look like some crazy jedi mixed with a made max theme with your character flying around like crazy and force pushing people with bodies flying everywhere you made it seem very tame in the review ign reviews too short and angry joe reviews too long for me this review time is perfect good review subscribed the square root of blue is green everybody knows that im about 99 sure this game was built off the engine they used for doom because holy shit the character movements and action are scarily similar imagine needing a review to determine a purchase i feel like i would have loved this game 5 years ago maybe i just need to get it in my hands holy popin and yeah youre right the cars dont look like they are going fast enough at all still looks like a solid game though after this for me i think its a wait for sale due to the game length algorithm comment been a while since a walking the walk video so is bethesda really doubling down on microtrasactions soulless plastic game as i expected this is the first video of yours that ive come across and ive gotta say that its insanely detailed and to the point really refreshing to see youve got yourself a sub my good sir no card game mad max borderlands and fallouts drugged out son pc ok ps4 pro xbox x rent ps4 xbox 1 avoid like the plague male or female wow so not body type bethesdas games always go on sale for real cheap after a month or 2 ill wait looks really meh graphically the game is very meh ill pass 1113 hours is still longer than the first one finished that in 10 and that includes 3 or 4 side missions also sounds like the only real issues are minor things they could easily tweak and peek over time which i dont mind from what i have seen the popping in visuals is enough to put me off ill wait for the sales its from bethesda wait for the first reviews from customers when its out are you reviewing this on a xbox thanks for speaking up for the little guys acg love the review rage 2 the game nobody asked for or wanted i feel like this game is connected to the borderlands universe this would have better racing than nfs and other racing games if they actually brought multiplayer good review cant imagine the work you put in to it but i have suggestion you should add how game works on mid tier pc not only 4k resolution that almost nobody plays with nice happyconsolegamer shout out been watching him for years one of my favorite on youtube fun fact i subscribe both of you and happy console gamer for a longest time keep on delivering good stuffs this video did not show up on my sub feed weird excellent review thank you so much oh no not another buggy bethesda game the first rage was short and a sad attempt to try to dethrone borderlands great review im surprised you didnt give rantons channel a shout out p i mean id make more content if i had more subscribers or should it be i make more content to have more subscribers 1812 youre welcome i usually solely rely on acg not sure how this entire review didnt bring up any compare and contrast to the original but hey at least i got a bunch of useless references to mad max wait what did you rate it for the console i have both a xbox one x and a ps4 pro recommends happy console gamer instantly clicks of the video great review still unsure whether i should wait for the outer worlds though i dont blame people for not buying this game at launch simply due to the fallout 76 fiasco i know it aint the same studio but still it might not be fair but bethesda gotta see the trust issues people have with bethesda as a publisher car control is just what the hell happening to alavanche studio mad max is one of best driving control from theirs superb review thank you acg finally a game where the main character speaks wasnt that hard this game looks like great dumb fun definitely buying this looks good getting this instead of bl3 im relieved that its actually good do a plague tale innocence next how do u get access to the discord server sorry to say but like most games latelyits got deep sale written all over it cant be a coincidence both far cry new dawn and rage 2 both went neon colors heavy so close to each others release one or the other had a heads up and ripped them off its not the longest game wait for sale is it just me or did the original rage look better why why doesnt this feel like a rage game perhaps they should have just made mad max 2 oh wait they did just called it rage 2 so its basically the gunplay of doom mixed with the car gameplay of mad max mixed with the explosions of just cause in a post apocalyptic setting sweet it looks like ill wait for a sale i legit forgot all about this game as usual acg a damn good review going to pick this up on payday karak you have one of the better captures of this game previous videos ive watched have made the game look very blurry and bland great review btw can someone post the tldw we need a new fallout with this engine i loved the first one despite the ending ill pick this up for sure the crazy thing is its not that colorful we are just used to drab games now getting this on pc only review that matters thanks wont be buying ill wait till its 20 wont be long oh no sam riegel is voicing the mc how am i supposed to take him seriosly when all i can image is scanlan or nott im going to wait until i can get it from g2a for 10 bucks i miss when you earned skins by doing in game challenges with the specific weapon you want the skin for microtransactions have no place in a full priced single player game keep them on mobile and f2p games was that a crispr reference i just heard nicely done yeah my only real complaint after playing for a few days is those moments where the downtime drags im a bit ocd when it comes to finishing one thing before i move on so spending 20 minutes running around a larger location where ive already shot everyone to death just to find one last chest that i keep missing because its in a dark corner and the game neither has a flashlight nor a brightness setting on my ps4 version at least can really drag its more noticeable purely because the bits when you are maiming and killing with all your powers and guns is so damn fun this game has one of the most satisfying headshot pops in shooter history it is a bit short too if you just followed the story thanks mostly to the whole live service content roll out rather than have your whole game at once deal but theres plenty to do in the world and at least that content roll out does look fairly meaty thanks for the review acg i did play the first one on the ps3 and 360 and enjoy the combat and i will enjoy this one as well since slamming dashing vortexing some some goons and blast them off with the rocket launcher lol i have another category its called never even acknowledge its an offline single player shooter the fun factor will be off the chartsyoud be foolish to pass on this in my opinion already downloaded on my pro its time to rage the danny brown trailers honestly made me super excited for this i just started the video but youre about to make or break this game for me they should have get the people from bulletstorm to do the combat whats with the pink menu time for my new i9 to strut its stuff as always a great review really gives me a feel of the game and if i was on the fence about buying this game im not anymore another great honest review from acg i too was a huge fan of mad max glad to see avalanche bring some of that awesomeness to an id game looks like ill be roaming a wasteland again for the next few weeksand awesome shout out to happy console gamer that dude is awesome love your videos acg keep up the good work you are the best thank you most important thing is it fun it is cool ill be diving in tomorrow morning then on console was it a wait for sale worse clone doom nothing more that dude has a fan on his shouldera freakin fan this looks like a 20 used bargain bin game the first one was gory and awesome like doom im not seeing any blood or anything a little bummer i miss all the gibs lol adding vfx in editing for marketing gameplay videos is just lying at this point the actual gameplay you have shown looks like their marketing material only it has been in the washing machine like 200 times and now has a hole so you cant wear it outside anymore thanks for the review man 4050 hours okay so 100 hours what im seeing elsewhere is the avalanche part is eh but the id part is great this plays best in my xbox one x gonna be honest at native 4k you shouldnt really be needing to use any aa but at best you could end up using fxaa but no need for taa for that performance loss also settings that involve reflections and shadows can be quite demanding especially on games like gta v so no 4k on the xbox x 1080p is the max res you gave it a purchase on pc what about console do you think boost mode on the pro could help out the framerates since you said both the pro and x were targeting 1080p for the 60fps trade boost mode shouldnt necessarily conflict with it because theres not a pro patch right love your review still not going to buy it i remember the first rage and what comes to mind is john goodman and hands down if not the worst then top five worst video game endings of all time this to me looks like a generic borderlands and i would rather own 3 then this game looks crap glad i can put my time into a plague tale instead great vid acg only reciewer i wait on listen to i havent decided on rage yet i could not beat the first game just became bored and even if the main character says little or doesnt bring much im always happy if they talk i find it annoying no matter how small or large something around the character is to say nothing is just stupid and immersion breaking in lack of a better words imo as far as the game i was hoping it would come out swinging sounds like a decent game nothing spectacular thats my issue with id everything feels like everything else i completely forgot id made doom and wolf i became bored playing doom and as i playing wolf i thought to myself man this game feels like something ive played before took me awhile to figure it out but when you get to the point in wolfenstein you can play old levels in the current game i thought again where have i seen this realizing it was doom i grabbed wolf case looked at the back and figur been waiting for review before i bought this game thanks again for never letting me down nice review not heavy on spoilers despite long review cool which version reviewed those hit markers ruin it i have ocd shoot me i didnt play the witcher 3 cause of their 1 crappy camera rdr2 has god cameras great review i understand he rated it a buy for pc unless i totally missed it i did not hear the rating for the consoles should we assume its a wait for a sale for consoles since he only specifically said pc is a buy gamespot gave this a 6 i cant anymore im super psyched but i really wish there was some form of multiplayer even coop would be amazing i just prefer to play with friends not alone when i play games i feel like a shut in when i play a game alone for 5 hours straight because i know ill play for long periods of time with this one please add some form of multiplayer social aspects of games are great and problem is all of the multiplayer fps sucks and lack originality this would break the mould for the first time in a long time im a acg subscriber and i support this message great review as always as a 4k tv console gamer x1xpro this is a crossroads game i want to play it nowbut ill be waiting until ps5nextbox ill love it at 4k60 ill whine and moan at 1080not quite 60 will totally check out happy console gamer great review as usual and kudos for shouting out hcg love that guy hay karak is there an option in the settings to turn off the hitmarkers and kill notifications i and a lot of other people find them distracting and bad looking ive been expecting you man i love your reviews only review i really ever care about so glad i preordered and preinstalled this one on one x cant wait to get into it thanks im glad you likened this to mad max not bulletstorm the trailers made me a little sceptical sounds fine to me though just have to wrap up days gone first ive watched some of happy console gamers uploads ill check him more so in the future ive name dropped your channel in regards of honest competent reviews recently its hard for me to keep out the days gone debacle was yourself and a little more so jim sterlings review that tipped the scale i was gonna wait sale originally theres an upload that compares days gones pros and cons with tlous and rdr2s i wish i could remember the dudes name he made a very clear cut sensible argument against a poor rating each time i look at the fov it kills me a little bit inside great review man you will always be my go to unbiased game review outlet thank you for being you love ya buddy just going into thisbefore watching i really want to like this game but i can see a bunch of ways for them to mess it up crossing fingers maybe it will work as an appetizer while waiting for borderlands 3 generic trash pass i pre ordered this a while ago loved the first one and cant wait until tonight to play it fair and balanced as always its probably a deep deep sale for me personally i tend to enjoy stories in games and if its paper thin or is just lacking then i tend to not enjoy it as much the combat does look great and fun acg recommends rage 2 its time to party party theres going to be a party tonight the game is nice but there are not so many possibilities to go through the game no tactics in the struggle and the opening of crates by the slams seem naturally like the first shooters as a tiny creator its really awesome to see huge channels sending love to smaller guys youtube is definitely a mess and its great of you to be shouting out smaller channels love your reviews i always know whether to get a game or not after your videos awesome review disappointed with the slower vehicle speeds so will have to see how it feels there also seems less dust and grit than in mad max i know this isnt that game but i was hoping the team would dial that driving upto 11 and instead seem to have turned it down a little to 9 its not running at 4k well 1 of pc owners have a 4k monitor so its a null issue happyconsolegamer is great but at 200000 subscribershardly call that a small youtuber lol great review i will be purchasing tomorrow what happens when instagram filters die acg i promise your brain is wired differently bro your way with words in like every video is justamazing got this for xbox one x and cant wait to play great review no 4k mode no buy its 2019 we want the option for image quality that fits our tv wish they made a mad max sequel instead was waiting for your review as always good to know its good too bad its just 11 hours for main story when theres no multiplayer 40 hours for 100 completion is fine i guess but how interesting is it im unclear from what you said there ill wait for tomorrow as ive stopped pre ordering games also enough time to decide if 11 hours are worth the buy this is broken trash id eye dee not id sighother than that great review thanks the way this man constructs his sentences is admirable is it just me or have graphics for this generation hit a wall there was a time when id software set a high bar for graphics doom 3 comes to mind for its time but these days graphics especially in this game tend to all look the same even predictable 331 did the car just side drift that guy has a fan attached to his shirt lol acg reviews so good i could not want the game and still watch them good stuff and salute for shouting other youtubers good review bit disappointed to hear about the drab open world pcconsole performance but hopefully it will still be fun you were very in depth about the problems with the game thats awesome a shooter thats for shits and giggles like bulletstorm was sign me up a little confusing when you rate the game you specify for pc which threw me off a little and still wondering where you stand on a console rating should i get this for 45 or mad max for 15 hows the wing stick looks incredibly boring generic human enemies generic shotgun generic pistols generic ar more innovative shooters were made 10 years ago this is the bare minimum for a single player shooter but the year isnt 1998 no multiplayer residentsleeper great video my friend btw i will buy mad max now because i slept on this game thats gonna be a pass for me dawg happy console gamer is great glad to see someone else appreciate his content but do i get to play a flamethrower guitar in this game thats what i wanna know the only review ive been waiting for thanks acg hey karak would you say buy on console thanks man great review as per usual those consoles are creaking and struggling loads up red dead and zero dawn and god of war nope just bethesda are shit should i get this or days gone thank god i have a great pc setup now the console version of games in the past 2 years are just crap if u exclude ps4 exclusives nice and earlyexcellent review for pc and for consoles no veredict hey somebody let me know when his review on a plagues tale innocences cause surely youtube wont be trying to let me know about the most professional reviewer alive saved me 60 thank you og thank you for the fantastic review dude but this is a wait for sale game for me as it doesnt really grab me also karak i love love love mad max as it had to me the most beautiful wasteland i have seen in a video game and i adored the car combat and exploration i just i hope in the future that we will get a sequal to mad max as i would love to see what avalanche would do to expand and improve that game yes acg i got my bowl loaded too yess thank you acg i expected more enemies spawn and faster combat the gunplay looks tame and the arena is so confined i think i will pass unless id support modding i was hoping for a murder feast with good map design like the good old bullet storm 1080p 50 on proone x ew on ps4 do you recall an option to disable motion blur also was there an fov slider happy console gamer is awesome youre right in the money hes very passionate you can tell from just watching one of his videos got too many games to catch up on and bethesda has been quick with the price drops so im waiting looks good though sad about the fps and popin issues might mean im gonna wait for a sale or at least for some more patches before buying it hows the performance on base ps4 seems like a game for people with low standards glad that the mirotransactions are cosmetic only ill pick this up if i hear that the ending is better than rage 1 the way they finished that game just sucked ass hcg is legit one of my favorite yters he feels like an old friend you grew up with good review from acg 58 at jb tomorrow just platinumed days gone yesterday i was meant to get this on day 1 pc of course i was very concerned that this would look as terrible as just cause 4 on consoles and it sounds like it aint much better agree about happy console gamer his videos are really good karak go find some strange and hit it i hit it twice karak and i even bragged about it to my friends thank you for the happy console gamer shout out he is fantastic great review as always karak ill probably wait for a deep sale because while it looks like a bit of fun it also looks awfully repetitive for a guy named happyconsolegamer he sure has said a lot of negative stuff about canada just another fake youtube persona allow me to correct you on something m2 is a form factor not a memory type what you are referring to is nvme excellent review otherwise love the shout outs hcg is great to anyone check out the game apologist he is another over looked guy on yt so you said if youre on pc its a buy what about console imo the game looks quite boring pass on this one as always good review acg great shout out to happyconsolegamer ive been following him for a few years now and really enjoy his content also and a subscriber to him thx for great review now decided to pick up plagues tale of innocence rage 2 looks unfinished with poor graphics bad framerate poor story basically made by bugthesda avalanchegiving its just cause vibes ill stick with far cry new dawn 3 3 garbage as expected whats with rage and pop in i legit dont get it way better than days gone great unbiased review as always thank you very much gunbarrel is in the game yes finally it was only a passing reference in the first game in terms of gameplay and content quality what should i pick first rage 2 or days gone hahaha that dude lifting weights was awesome about 15 hours and ill have my copy im so stoked to play this i played the first and was really upset at the abrupt ending hopefully this game will have an ending that gives me more closure haha gave a thumbs up just because of the happyconsolegamer shoutout he got me to buy fist of the north star lost paradise while larger sites were moaning about how it wasnt aaa or ten minutes long or whatever and im eternally thankful for that mad respect for shouting out happyconsolegamer looks like a pretty sloppy rushed half assed game i guess thats what you get when bethesda gets near a product it is interesting how acg mentions directional audio issues for rage 2 while i havent played rage 2 i have experienced directional audio and audio mixing issues in several bethesda games this gen doom the wolfenstein series and prey all had bizarre audio issues when i played them even with patches good review as always acg ohoh emmy award winner sam riegel gets roasted again i guess console is a wait for a sale then i wonder what the difference will be between the 1x and pro its always hard for me to choose between the 2 when it comes to multuplats disappointing it doesnt hold a 60fps on the 1x another game that didnt take better advantage of what it has to offersame probable with the pro a mini shoulder fan wtf no hdr is very surprising and disappointing ill never agree to have a silent protagonist in a first personthird person game with a story no matter how substantial its the 1 thing that pulls me out far cry 5 was awful because of that to me bethesda is never getting my support for their absurdly high regional pricing for the same usd5999 vampire bloodlines 2 rs1299 rage 2 rs 3999 glad i picked this over days gone good thing you talk slower now its weird every time a game gets preordered or waiting for the review scores it gets a low score and leads to disappointment there was one day we were waiting for a review score to come out and it never did even on release exactly right after it was bought it got a low score good guy karak gives shoutouts to smaller youtubers who deserve more subs so what if i want nintendo reviews are there any guys out there that do those reviews woo this game looks really fun thank you for the review it was very informative bigging up other youtubers in the same field without coersion or paid for advertisement this is outrageous how is my cynicism meant to be slacked now acg s good on you mate this is a really nice thing to do and restore my faith that good people still exist i totally forgot this game will be released tomorrow this and doom eternal this year make it a good time to be an fps fan awesome of you to suggest happy console gamer hes an og youtuber and always keeps a positive attitude in his vids i checked out happy console and subbed thank for the recommendation and the great reviews man keep em coming karak this review will decide if i buy it or notmay the video begin im going to wait for a discount your first acg i wanted to play this but i dont see color you and colin moriarty are one of the better reviewers i forgot a bout this game coming out time to watch a review for a game i have no plans on buying love ya acg a fantastic reviewer ohh one minute to early lol ohh one minute to early lol

love him p keep it up zack whats funny is that house is actually the find fallen ranger house if you randomly stumble by without having any missions available could the old man from 153 be nicholas raine from rage 1 pause at 1420 are those bushes weed just use the bfg for the sentries so you just know plants vs zombies garden warfare 3 will maybe come in october or september play more of this plz hi zack im enjoying the content but why are you not playing plant vs zombies heroes very often its been a year since you played it so far zack havent watch your channel in like 3 years i forgot about this channel until i found it now great memories on channel 6 news tulsa theres a child fighting for his life he is asking to meet you ive just subscribed to you but idk if you have heard but theres a 2nd grader that is one of your zebra herd and would love to meet you he is in the hospital on news 9 in oklahoma they have a story zack theres a new splatfest time travel vs teleportation if u like bethesda you should play the elder scrolls 5 pls pvz gw not 2 play with all foot soldiers when will you play cut the ropemagic man pls do more of pvz gw2 zackot plz use flying vehicle game is horribly put together its been 23 years since i watched you zach im starting to watch you more thanks for the great content when i was smaller lmao keep it up i think you should make your videos shorter like 15 minutes maybe dont forget the splatfest started hey zack can you change your ride use others not just phoenix zack try zoybean in pv2 ive noticed a pattern zach says bad words on more violent games but acts good in good games which makes him mixed up between goodie goodie or bad baaaad boy nuice i did that on purpose i be been here since 400 subs what the heck just blew up rage 2 in a nutshell you can locate arks by using focus and looking for beams of light in the sky i was the first one i liked the video first comet firat first watch the game awards 2018 best game trailers httpsyoutubecolilbeuj2k its like mad max far cry new dawn and call of duty black ops 3 all in one game cool trailer new gameplay coming tomorrow get your wingsticks ready boys this looks insane cant wait as im literally replaying the first one atm this is borderlands fallout and dooms accidental child and i love it so in the future people with pink hair like guns i already preordered and love it 134 mixom also appears in doom did anybody even play the first game how cool is this game wow this shit looks crazyd i loved rage 1 cant wait on that i dont know if i should try it after the mess of fallout 76 i am not trusting bethesda anymore the song is by danny brown please let this game score a 9 or above on metacritic totally dishonest trailer latest gameplay looks nothing like that and is very disapointing huge downgrad from the e3 footage full of ungly huds and seems very repetitive if it is good the story might save it sigh i guess ill be playing farcry damn for a while i have higher hopes for farcry than that smoke and mirrors at this point this and doom eternal and im alright for 2019 wow this game looks amazing this just looks like doom with more colors and cars right song pls or this remix so much violence so much gore but blur out a swear word okay i wonder if we can use those power armor looking vehicles armed with twin miniguns my main concern with this game is the guns i like big guns but i dont like only have 10 weapons for the entire game i like to mix it up with other shit that was my problem with the first game this looks way better than that new crappy far cry game please bring back the nostalgic feelings trash as a danny brown fan this made me bust a fat nut john goodman voice over what is that song at the end this is what fallout 76 should have looked like published by bethesda ill pass after failure 76 bethesda if you think im gonna install your launcher you are crazier than i thought by the way nice game this is one of the best video game trailers ive ever seen wow this far cry 6 no steam no buy borderlands doom and mad max had a love child i love it just give us borderlands 3 instead yep sold so much colors borderlandfalloutdoom rage 2 this honestly looks better than the first which i could not get into at all but defiantly picking this up as it looks like a lot of fun danny brown fuckyeah damn this trailer is stylish whats the name of the background track calm down man like 20 videos in less than a day its here the launch trailer of rage 2 reverses through the game all the way to the beginningwait what insanity rules rage 2 launches may 14 what are you looking forward to most check out insta if you wanna see more action at launch httpswwwinstagramcomrage all you had to say was i can make hot girl player after experiencing the shitty save system in this game i know why its called rage everything else is awesome tho been playing on game pass the shooting is sooooo much fun you know im really pissed with these pre order bullshit the settlers pistol and bfg 9000 is a part of the game but you have to get the special pre order reward this is bullshit bethesda remember doom 2016 one of the reasons everyone loved that because you didnt do any of that bullshit well thanx bethesda i can not even finish the game cause the last mission doesnt trigger and i see more people having that issue i read in some comments i have to remove the game and reinstall it and here is the problem it has a huge update with it that takes like a hour so no thanks if i bought it at full price i would be ffing mad btw we are now many months after release its december now and still didnt fixed that bug shame on you after 6 month after release the game still has lag in the menu and is still crashing making you to reset your console because the game wont open anymore crap game stupid trailer awsome game i really really wanna buy rage 2 love how id and avalanche are working together but i wanna buy it on steam and dont wanna make an account remove that please bethesda and you have a buy thats the only thing holding me back who else loved rage for a game that is priced with 3195 especially with a doubled price for the deluxe edition i cant believe the game is so buggy i mean i can live with the lowres textures from the first game but since now the textures look nice the game crashes far too often i think the game was the last game i bought from bethesda back in the old days when call of cthulhu came out your games were far better working i never had any problems with the games back then now its far too hard to finish the game not because its so hard but it crashes so often i wish i had bought it on steam so i would be able to get a refund there were different situations where my game just freezes situation 1 upgrading the phoenix vehicle just opening the upgrade menu lets the game hang itself and i need to quit its process with the task manager situation 2 running around the desert and the game randomly stops please fix your stupid game so i am satisfied just kidding the game is aw when i get extreme i play rage 2 when i get angry i play rage 2 to let my anger out when i get really crazy i play rage 2 when i am on drugs i play rage 2 am i the only one who hates this trailer its spoils the entire game in just a few min so much spoilers dafuqqqqqq looks horrible and only toook them how long gj though on providing another sequel to borderlands okay i finished the game last night and i approve its wayyyyyy better than expected oh and the wizard is nuts releases a fucking game and cant even play on a modern pc now i need a i5 to play this game fuck you i have a i7 and this shit wont even run refunded baby hell yea bethesda is the greatest of all time can we please have the holdto exit vehicle notice taken away please we dont need it and its very irritating this is badgers gameplay hundred percent rage 1 is the goat soooo what do i have to do to make my pc graphics look like the trailer im running an rtx 2070 with i9 9900k ive put the settings to ultra high the resolution to 2560 x 1440 and my refresh to 143hz from the menu what am i missing sorry im new to pc btw that so cool i bought my dad the first rage for his birthday may 24 and turns out the second one was released on his birthday the game is filled with bugs and glitches the difficulty swittches back and forth between ultimate easy game to the hardest and the most unfair thing youve ever played half of the time through my second playthrough i see a mouse cursor on my screen when theres no reason for it to be thereand the game instantly crashes when i take a screenshot in the photo mode last time ive played the game the game thought i was offline no matter what i did i was online and even downloading update for youngblood so i had to be but the game said nah hes not not speaking about the lack of content or balanced gameplay most of the guns are useless and the rocket launcher instakills the bosses on hard while youngblood is the worst game ive played this year rage2 is the biggest dissapointment its only really worth buying for game designers to learn from its mistakes and shouldnt be a product released for a full price its the sole reason i am afraid for eternal because this g idk but it looks like borderlands and far cry at the same time i finally got bought this bring on the madness i love this game been playing this game for two days and its awesome thank you bethesda top class top notch apart from a tiny glitch containers are not always recognised whats with the race mixed seemingly overtly gay hipsters in the post apocalyptic setting bethseda trying real hard but bought this off ebay cant wait till i comes im excited tried to report this on the website but it wouldnt let me since this last update it no longer lets me be signed in while i play so i dont get to take part in the challenges and ive lost stuff that i unlocked before please fix it or im done with the game nice looking game but i hate the main characters voice i got sick of that irritating fuckers voice in spiderman gotta give it to them this trailer is fucking hilarious haha the first rage signified the decline of id software i was so stupid to preorder that game what happened to the dead city bethesda and why is it not in the game the trailer la so much better than the game cant wait for rage 2 battle royal i absolutely loved the first rage i think it was a very underrated game i cant wait to try out rage 2 who in here have actually played the first rage game play coming soon download to be continue did he thanos snap rage 1 oh this is cool ig rage 2 holy shit i never had this much fun im kicking grenades im quitting my job holy fuck wheres the canvas bags that shoutout to how walmart leaked the game early that worm at the end was not in the game was it did i miss that oo can you please fix the running but not loading bug i cant play the game and i was really excited for it is this game really worth it i mean it only takes around 10 to 15 hours to beat and its 60 just really doesnt seem worth it but it looks really fun is the game good or no i just grabbed it today its rewind time shooting was fun everything else about the game was mediocre at best one month later and still no update that includes a giant sandworm if you play offline you data becomes corrupted and you have to start new after about 25 hours or so good luck bad copy of borderlands i just got this game for my husband as a fathers day gift i cant wait til he opens it thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain exodus 207 god is real and god is love we are created to love god trust god and glorify god no matter what we cant truly love god unless we trust him and if you cant find god its because you are not looking for him god knows our hearts and will allow anyone to be deceived who wishes to be what we call life is just a test an illusion to see who loves god and how much anyone who truly loves god will keep god first keep his 10 commandments love their neighbors as themselves and do their best not to sin we all sin and have fallen short of the glory of god this is why god sent his only begotten son jesus christ to die on the cross for our sins so that all those who believe in him and do their best to live a life that is pleasing to god will not perish but have everlasting life heaven and hell exist and the things we say and do in this lifetime will testify for us or against us and determine where we spend eternity i was born in a christian home and went looking for the truth becaus sory but zero trust to bethesda he tells you somebody who bought up all your games and two or three times on ps3 ps4 pc so far i i am very disappointed with you bethesda i will know it you delete thisthis game is beta very big veta fallout 76 i dont feel so good rage 2 this is gonna work bethesda bethesda i know it is because i dont know what im going to do if it doesnt insert cocky fuck talking the whole video bethesda still cannot start rage 2 it keeps crashing needs new game plus the voice and personality for your vehicle is seriously the stupidest thing ive ever come across if i hear system activating one more time im tossing this out the window seriously lame ass voice if borderlands 2 and doom had a kid now if only the game was like that 90 of the time instead of 20 of the time and the driving was actually decent how do you go from rage 1 and the people who made mad max to having such piss poor driving that you cant even make a turn unless youre accelerating or going in reverse it says a lot when your best car is a helicopter hey bethesda where is fallout 4 creation club stuff going home with this on the passager seat with seatbelt on d is it me or is the movement absolutely horrible im really unhappy with the movement it could be so much better a game for the mentally retarded wait avalanche studio is the dev who makes mad max and just cause game isnt it no wonder why the gameplay exactly same as mad max pretty boring and the world same as just cause huge world but empty to explore most boring gameplay of 2019 a walking simulator game one of the best game trailers i have seen good game1 worth it uhmmm but theres no ending in this game it just stops cause dlc so uhm yea this trailer does not just encourage you to buy rage 2 but rage 1 aswell it is a 2 in 1 promotion i love it its animals gone wild animals have gotten smart enough to talk shit from the barking distance mistrust the owner mistrust the animals keep an eye on them the dogs connect and bark on a higher sensory than can be seen pink its my new obsession yeah pink its not even a question pink on the lips of your lover cause pink is the love you discovah pink as the bing on your cherry pink cause you are so very pink its the color of passion acause today it just goes with the fashion pink it was love at first sight i yell pink when i turn out the light and pink gets me high as a kite and i think everything is goin to be all right no matter what we do tonight you could be my flamingo cause pink is the new kinda lingo pink like a deco umbrella its kink but you dont ever tell her pink it was love at first sight i yell pink when i turn out the light and pink gets me high as a kite and i think everything is goin to be all right no matter what we do tonight i i want to be your lover i i want to wrap you in rubber as pink as the sheets that we lay on cause pink its my favorite crayon yeah pink it was love at first sight i yell pink when i turn out the light and pink gets me high as a kite a this fucking game wont run on i3 processor this is honestly one of the best trailers for any game looks like a bethesdas response to a crappy fallout 76 completed the game without unlocking grav darts bfg and the gauss cannon or whateverwtf will this game should be deserved to be forgotten just your friendly reminder to never preorder carry on very short game good tho tbh im so disappointed from rage 2 gunplay is fun but the rest is so boring and sometimes a pain to play open world is so flat and dull gfx are not state of the art 2019 looked so much better in trailers i try to like rage 2 but i cant what happened to hagger dude bethesda wheres our own private world for fallout 76 huh please add it thanks walmart canada ok honestly this game was a huge disappointment nothing like the first one non sense shootings no story way to short graphics lame overall a game to skip fuck bethesda 100 done with your greed and laziness old ass engines releasing obviously incomplete games scamming fans with bullshit ces and nuka colas taking mods that people made then only allow mods if peiple pay real money and selling those mods as if theyre your own wolfenstein 2 data being deleted because of updates i was close to getting that shit platinum which is an issue thats been around since 2017 and still isnt fixed ill say it again fuck you guys i was a big fan but lately you absolutely disgust me its like youre actively trying to become even worse than activision and ea combined at least ea can afford all this hate because there will always be idiot sport fans buying the same damn sports game every year but you you will drown im copying and saving this message in case you shady cunts delete it again this is one of the best trasilers ive ever seen very interseting idea but i dont know if its copied the game is fucking stupid all weapons are so weak and movement is very bad they reduce your health in one hit and so poor for receources can you please add at least one elvis presley song into the next fallout game where is the sandworm i have 30 hours in the game and couldnt find one its rewind time everybody hes gunna fuck my shit up i liked rage 1 and playing rage 2 atm the game is good looking and has superb combat though i am less enthusiastic about the driving the 10 finger combo system and the awful race mission still i am very glad this game came to steam which is kinda requirement for me fuck microtransactions and luthboxes rage 3 coming soon okay rage 1 was super scary but 2 is super exciting seriously 1 was like the worst but 2 is ridiculous yez luvlly game nice graphics amazing gameplayhave played and upload my gameplay so fallout but better gameplay more crasslewd minus the retro goodness phooey im not interested in this game but i wish fallout looked this good great game i can imagine that it makes a lot of fun but on normal ps4 its unplayable they should downgrade the graphics and increase the fps please the game also crashed on me two times rage 2 trophy system is bugged right now 30 fps on ps4 for 60 thanks but no fuck off hi i am missing my rage 2 deluxe content and i have done every guide on youtubecan i contact you via email or textor call coming up for pc ps4 and xbox or thiss only on pcps4xbox your new games suck is it possible that with updates in the future that they will fix frame rate issuesive had this game crash twice on me and its so laggy in alot of areas its to the point of unplayable for me it ruins the gameplay and im playing on ps4 so theres no way for me to adjust settings to turn the graphics downit makes me upset to think i paid 60 for itthe lag is horrendous this a bit over the top ans its a game nobody asked for its seems so forced i miss the rc bomb cars and spider bots hope they will come back very useful in a high tech post apocalyptic open world game in the new patch of fallout 76 ive had a problem where the legendary exchange only has 3 scrip inside of it how do i fix this i only add to the number of comments on your video with 1 small ask do not fuck up elder scrolls 6 in an attempt to line your own pockets but make another benchmark single player full at release game with additional full size dlc and retain your dignity and respect with another treasure like games of old and not a hollow cash leech disguised as fallout or elder scrolls blades this comes on behalf of every being that has ever played a game ever thank you for your time remember the fall of 76 in the shop it says nowhere near the delxe bonus description that you need to make a bethesda account to get for example the bfg pay so much extra just to be forced to make an account somewhere else without being notified of that f bethesda in the a with a tabasco covered cactus make 76 cross platform wait you guys are shaming players for playing offline wtf is wrong with you people really whatever happened to we care for singleplayer games bethesda should be ashamed an whoever made this boring game bethesda softworks this is going to be a need to fix now list straight off the bat i feel it coming on bare with me ps4 version item 1 that all successful modern fps titles should have great streamlined control optimisation options taylored for consoles the primary market by todays standards not a lassy cut paste job dumbed down originally designed utilised for pc mouse options left over the number 1 foundation option is dead spot calibration on a control pad ive turned everything up to 100 but the god damb dead spot feels like a non responsive casm until you include the option i dont think i can sail this ship i see an iceberg dead ahead you get me i need a direct line suggestion box please hook me up im litterally a control freak lets rub some british standards on these options from game to game did id drop the ball on this 1 or what 2 the vehicle look is the opposite super tight dead spot it also needs a calibration option im seeing slight camera drift pleas waterbears classy its unfortunate bethesda dragged their name through the mud with fallout 76 i probably would have bought this if you hate hard games dont get this i play on normal its still hard music eagraphics rockstardetails ubisoftgameplay cd projekt redstory bethesdaopen world the grindeeer will kill tenno wait this isint wareframe very nice and funny trailer the monster about to fuck u r shitlife facial animations i feel like this is going to be the most spoken in a negative way 227 what is that the most fun game of the last three years i have played is there no coopmultiplayer mod in 2019 you should kick that guy out who made the game like this now this is some trailer d the game was already interesting they didnt have to up the industry standards that much trailer is sick hope it wont end up like fallout 76 the record scratch meme haha games lit loving it bruh thats kinda cringe knew the voice actor sounded familiar hes spiderman from tasm2 video game reviews are in and this game is short and trash typical bethesda 12 hour campaign is trash seems 2018 has not ended in the game world but hey why care about building a real game when devs can shit on players with microtransactions greedboxes and cut content dlc another company added to my blocklist the greed has to end now really thought this game was gonna be coop nice job bethesda being homeless i heard aint that bad please if you gonna development fallout 5 that we can choose breeds of creatures at the beginning of the game as in skyrim so if i play this game on single player fighting enemies controlled by the computer will that be rage against the machine seriously where are the dislikes coming from that trailer is the beet fucking thing ive seen in years and that game is probably gonna smash it fuck ea i do hope bethesda doesnt fuck it up like they did with fallout elder scrolls for 2018 et 2019 i want to say 2 words to bethesda softwork fuck you was that daytime emmy award winner and presidential nominee for dndbeyond sam riegel that sam riegel the very sam riegel who is mainly responsible for the astonishingly successful the legend of vox machina kickstarter campaign which cracked the 75000 dollar goal in the first 2 hours that sam riegel never heard of him but he must a fun guy he needs to on shows on youtube heck even in a channel ahh if only that were real nice trailer with spoilers poor game with 47 on metacritic good job borderland its you 90 avalanche 10 id software the game is just 90 shit lol who even are you bethesda thank you for rage coins i like f2p game for 60 the voice sounds like nolan north is that him this is objectively badass how the hell did i not recognize sams voice when i first saw this getting mixed reviews hmmm a demo would help the cover chick is disgusting its called rage 2 not mentally insane 2 if this is what you chose for your cover then i cant imagine the game being any better no thanks im getting an audio bug looping of effects and muting of gunfire otherwise game is absolutely amazing not a complaint just reporting a bug its so funny how much rage 2 uses the walmart canada leak in their marketing please add 4 player coop this game will thrive with it wait so whats appealing about this game omg take my money right now awesome game check badass trailer check asshole pr check but can be overlooked at for it was to game journal instead of fans ceo not being an asshole check steam or pretty much anything other than epic fail game store check day one purchase or when my cc is available thanks for being in steam 3 what a fuck im gonna do with 1080p game on my 4k tv via ps4 why there is no 4k mode just for this im gonna pirate game and play it on pc just got this game today at only 40 from cdkeycom and i cant wait to tear shit up with andrew wk blasting in the back and getting chopped just like what they said at the near end of the trailerwow who cannot launch rage 2 with the bethesda platform steam version is running hot save 10 and play nothing bethesda pls can you make a whole video about all the cheats cheat codes interesting 3 back to old school games has cheat code hehe anyway if enable cheat code and will it block achievements progress for xbox update i got early amazing looks waiting for install totally suck almost 50gb is this the sequel to blood dragon we never got bethesda and ubisoft really put 1000 times more efforts on trailers than on the video game wow this is probably the best video game trailer ive ever seen so creative so much personality such an original idea wait was that a cat licking a lollipop so thats the secret of creating a universe im done with bethesda fallout 76 special edition nuka cola rum bottle all was trash same as bethesda thinking and support im done with this bullshit cuz they treat us like bitches i rather wait a while to make sure you didnt somehow fucked up rage 2 too even if its not your game even epic is more worthy than bethesda these days please dont make any fallout anymore lets stay this shit was end of series and please dont touch elder scrolls im fucking scared how that game which will have old fucking engine gonna end up this is how you sell a game ugh the dialogue for your character sounds like it was written by the same guy who does the singleplayer character missions in black ops 4 walker about to get stabbed walker its rewind time mad max on drugs i love it general cross is the greatest video game villain of all time buying day one it just looks like a lot of fun with all the crazy weaponsgear good trailer too bad no one knows the games coming out today at 137 that might be nicholas raine the protagonist in rage 1 dishonored 3 ok i am too easily amused so excited for rage 2 is that sam motherfucking riegel narrating you guys just sold me on this game i hope he voices the main character not sure when doom eternal comes out thisll do fn such a good trailer captures the essence of what the game is about in a funny way totally enjoyable and cant wait to play wow adrenaline filled awesome trailer guys this game looks sick i cant wait to play it this looks like shit stop paying for people to advertise in comments for you and pay people to make nongearbox tier games probably the best trailer in the world i like the thanos snap 200 lol exactly how i felt back then 8d but seriously now so excited to blow shit up i just found out this is singleplayer only cries amazing borderlands 4 other more and they are 5 now my god an awesome slap coz they will give own self i enjoyed the first rage when it came out one of the actual few open world games i played all the way to the end sequel looks great i dont mind that they put more time in this then 76 nintendo switch no ok hell yeah sign me the fuck up i played the first one and loved the adult humor hopefully this has a bunch the female character looks like shit i hope we can customize her face since she looks like a friggin grandma both characters look like they have down syndrome no offense super pumped the first game was such a blast such a cool trailer doesnt look bad but i will definitely wait a week or two after release to see if suddenly microtransactions appear bethesda you have lost everyones trust this game will fail also why does every game need a female main character just thrown in undeserving herovillain they are there just because they are a woman and its pathetic to get the woke journalists to review your garbage but no one who actually plays game will buy it womenneedtoearntheirplace getwokegobroke that boss running animation looks like he is floating no weight to his steps despite his size taryon darrington in the wasteland im down i will be buying this game later today on preorder do not fuck this up istillloveyouid fallout 76 made me cringe everytime bethesda is mentioned this trailer is porn hype my collectors arrives at launch day whoo 050 051 wow just wow are these supposed to be some knockoff weapons created from bullseye mark 2 and hailstorm from resistance fall of man roflmao urray for the creativity no sarcasm at all and whats with the final general boss clearly based upon the quake universe cyborgs pff gimme a break lol what even is this so many people ready to fork over their money with bethesda publishing at the helm id software would rather go it alone then let bethesda fuck with there content here is hoping i am not wrong who is the voice actor sounds familiar i dont get it is this game 80s themed for some reason rage 1 wasnt loved the first one then the ending was like poof wheres the rest of it hopefully this ending will be better tardigrade httpsyoutubeplqgvq2zqkt136 also was that aj traust the voice of wyatt from wolfenstein at httpsyoutubeplqgvq2zqkt105 it looks like a complete revamp which has me worried wow this gave me goosebumps incredible is this game 4k resolution i dont even remember the first rage ending is that emmy award winning voice actor sam riegel i hear ohh if only bethesda can get out of releasing 15 fucking different preorder versions this trailer would actually be great the trailer is megaa superr ultraaa coool 035 the slap this game feels like a breath of fresh air after f76 will it run 60fps on the ps4 pro anyone else super excited to try out the big and settlers pistol love the deadpool styled opening sam sounds so much like yuri so cool how they have both played peter parker developers need to collaborate more often who even are you is that bethesdas name on it it must be a scam when you only max your trailers skill 158 website is gamerfarts69 lmao looks like rage 2 will have sandworm monster cool huhwasnt even interested in this game but now lol who even are you damnit i preordered it and threw 5 bucks down i dont even think im gonna buy it after this trailer it looks corny as shit and nothing like the old one well the first half of the trailer was garbage so i hope the same doesnt count for the game 356 christians didnt like the swearing lets fucking go bois alsoomfg that character creation yessssss what a vast improvement over the original will get it its on steam i will buy but first when its gets on sale why do i hear spiderman bethesda you sucks preload rage 2 dont work on steam finaly about time the shitty marketing departement at bethesda stop with the super annoying trailers with flashy crap everywhere ugly pink spam every 3 seconds and horrible music choice i would like if i can even play fallout76 without freezing on the start screen already preordered it i really enjoyed the first rage so i cant wait for this one too wow that was an incredible trailer hope its a sign of things to come oh hey forgot this game was even a thing the perfect trailer doesnt ex i had a lot of fun with rage looking forward to rage 2 also props to the rage 2 twitter team for trolling kotaku thanks bethesda for continuing the rage oh yeah what did i just witness rage 2 is doing baby dick numbers why so few views lol who even are you bugtheda i would still bang loosum hagar the chick at 134 forbes is ridiculous theyre so immersed in trying pretend their publication isnt completely irrelevant that theyve devolved into a trashy buzzfeed ripoff whack the fact that gamerfarts69com actually takes you to the rage 2 page is what got me i wouldnt be surprised if the flashback sequence to rages and earths early days was meant to convey the stubborn rigidity and absurdity of human life and travails what with all the familial kerfuffles social rugcutting and unending warring not to mention contrast the whole thing with the wasteland dafuq why am i just hearing about his now yikes pressure from outer worlds hit them hard huh been waiting years for a sequel loved the first one its finally here woo hoo this is gonna be so good 226 the worm is the spice the spice is the worm game of the year looks promising just hope its not ruined by it being a games as a service business model didnt play rage 1 never heard of rage 1 but had i seen this trailer i would have game trailers are not usually known for making people genuinely laugh dont forget this is the same guys who made fallout 76 ehh its a fps nein thanks you i really hope the driving is highly optional driving in a fps really sucks due to the fact that its primarily not a driving game so the physics are always way off either its too stiff or too bouncy is sam reigel the voice actor for the main character thats awesome 235 yall forgettin bout doom eternal now this is a trailer u guys fucked up on fallout so now this is your last hope butits still shit kira is that u that was some horrible lipsync animation but i guess we dont really play id games for their character development interested but will wait for the reviews go home bughesda thats strange and i like it releases on my dads birthday i know what im getting him now he doesnt even know how to use a playstation yet alone play the game lol this trailer is amazing im so excited for this its going to looks so good on pc is that a motherfucking sandworm is that roger craig smith still waiting for the fallout 76 that was advertised ha ha thank you for not putting this game on the epic store they really got meta god damn this game is fucking trash far cry new dawn dlc looks dope omg i just unsubscribed until the gaming industry gets their act together these micros and the fact that every time i play a game i cant because it either sucks or it sucks and i have to pay these micros to be able to somewhat enjoy it but after that i just feel robbed from you guys i pay 65 then another 20 to 50 for a pass and thats not including the other transactions the passion is gone and you can only see money just like the music industry now this looks so good an excellent trailer glad read the new this game is coming for steam too pre ordered it already anything bethesda produces will turn to microtransaction crap and or be released half complete with mandatory dlc pay to play content gonna dodge anything this studio produces until its corrected its ways that voice actor sounds super familiar why are launch trailers released before the game kinda makes the name irrelevant cant wait 136 hey i know that voice whats that song called might have to call off work on the 15th so i can play the hell out of this game boy this game is gonna be so lit got the deluxe preorder doom bfg not game of the year because borderlands 3 but this this goes to history and de facto second place d hell yea so pumped for this game you have caught my interest release it already cant wait rewind time everybody on it i loved rage and now there a rage 2 this is going to be awesome there is a small chance this game wont be a flop so all of you are just going to rush to immediately preorder this shit just like with fo76 guillable idiots enjoy getting ripped off again you better make the protagonist have spiny hair if youre going with that voice its just a trailer guys wouldnt get ye hype hopes up until you get the game to know if its actually gonna be good by the way these games have been recent coming out unfinished microtransactions buggy sjw bs and such an if you are order this your part of the problem with games not being completed when they are released steam masterrace i swear i thought i saw guy fieri in this trailer i didnt think the ending was lame it gave the mechanic graphics card a rest and the biological one a challenge 013 yep thats me youre probably wondered how i ended up in this situation is going to have multiplayercoop is that a sam riegel i hear as the main character id is a master class dev studio for you younguns out there that dont know hope this game is not slept on because it will probably be pretty good that villain looks terrible id love the option to switch between first person and third perhaps a mod could fix this problem giant worm im sold check out my fan made music at httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhbixnqiwkqm this game just looks no words havent been more happy for a purchase since red dead and before that probably never lets hope its not be another rage 76 general cross looks exactly like general knoxx from borderlands this is better then borderlands 3 cant fucking wait ive got a new pc to christmas just for a case like this so i can experience such a masterpiece with mouse and keyboard instead of a controller im looking so forward to this game since the very first trailer and i didnt even like the first rage but man this looks and feels awesome as long as it feels how it looks she said its one of these rare cases where the deluxe edition is just a must buy for me since i know i will enjoy every piece of content this game has to offer not sure about the end of that trailer but hyped as fuck for the game they really said record scratch youre probably wondering how i got here trailers are soo full of shit itll need patching on day one dont preorder wait for reviews before purchasing then give it 6 months and buy it at more than 50 to which it should be stable by then been burnt too many times great trailer im still laughing xd ill wait for reviews as i dont trust bethesda anymore i couldnt bloody place it but i knew the voice of the narrator it was bugging me and suddenly like a flash it hit me sam riegel known for many roles but the one that clicked in my mind was peter parker in the amazing spiderman 2 video game i find myself weirdly okay with their choice of voice actors game looks solid cant wait to play it the gunplay looks like a mixture of doom and bulletstorm open world missionscampslocations look like far cryubisoft grind missions which is somewhat concerning as they can be quite grindy at times still looking forward to it though i wish i had the money to buy this very bad timing since borderlands 3 gets all the attention and generally looks a lot more promising its good you back to steam id much rather they just spend their resources making a good fallout game cant wait preordered going to fucking destroy this game did anyone else see the finger snap nobody give a shit about rage 2 and bethesda id software you just cant hate them it just feels so generic and cliche the bad guy is litterally called general cross and is a human giant ciborg guy that is just pure evil then you have the quircky protagonist who cracks jokes all the time but simultaniously kills everyone in a brutal manner and the over the top action just shooting shooting shooting and of course you have all the crazy abilities but it just doesnt feel very creative add some big monsters and throw a bright color pallette over it and you have a game at least rage 1 had a unique atmosphere you really felt that it was a lost world you had to survive in a dorren landscape with ridiculous characters and enemies but yet felt realistic when rage 2 was announced i got very exited but now that ive seen more of the game i am very unsure about the quality of it its like falloutbut a good game damn this is bad they say comedy sells preorder wife put on notice childnot right now ask your mother put in for 5 days off from work optional 1oz of that higrade remind self why life kicks ass psif i forgot something let me know the 500th and maybe final trailer 217 no one no a single soul dudes at the marketing department when making this trailer yeah fuck it add in a cat liking a lollipop okay if i get to play as sam riegel i am sold is this what borderlands looks like without cell shading i see it has some doom erental mechincs that was an amazing trailer unique trailer guys pretty sick man cant wait to get this awesome game next week are we watching now right now what was that 218 its a tardagrade or a water bear they call them microscopic insects thats about half as tough as doom guy and he aint real its rewind time why am i so excited to fight general cross he looks like a total badass if you been banned from fallout 76 call the home office 3019268300 and join the lawsuit migliaccio rathod llp 412 h st ne suite 302 washington dc 20002 office 202 4703520 fax 202 8002730 i have one word for this giggedy best thing ever i want to like this but the combat looks so boring every gameplay video ive seen looks generic with absolutely no imperative or challenge i love me some dirty postapocalyptic milieus but this one just doesnt look like its for me i need something to challenge me and the weak combat and listless openworld setting just seem like a bad combination to me sounds like someone just discovered cussing please im not 13 i dont like all this comedic shit the apocalypse should be dark and hard if there isnt some kind of no mans sky joke when we see the sandworm for the first time then i say that we all mutiny take my money one of the best trailers ive seen a long time recognizing your faults with rage 1s ending the first game too that takes balls loved the humor in that too also what the fuck was that giant worm thing at the end o cannot wait for this game to come out its id of course im gonna play it geez the humor and voice acting here are terrible but ill still give it a shot love id shooters what the hell can i rip off that guys ensemble too id get this on pc if it was exclusive to the epic store i cant wait to play this on my nvidia gtx 590 its a rpg or something like that if not meh i do not know how the game will play but the marketing has been great so they show the ending to this gane i uninstalled rage 1 after like 3 missions the game was so boring but this looks insane definitely grabbing this take my money is it tuesday yet 200 lol love the joke about rage 1 ending you are the best best trailer so far hopefully this time around they give the game something better than the previous garbage ending as thats unfortunately the thing i remember most from the first one not buying this right now anyways but it looks good otherwise for anyone who does edit lol i didnt watch the trailer before but after doing so i respect that they really had a throwback and acknowledged the shitty ending so they probably learned from that mistake at least this time around this is gonna be way better than boringlands 3 please be good could be the best launch trailer of all time this trailer is insane goty no doubt cat licking the lollipop starting all of life on earth lmao nice went will doom eternal release they fucking showed the ending such a long time that im not being so hyped to play a game thanks for this bethesda truly one of the better game trailers ive ever done seen we need more trailers with andrew wk music seriouslythat voice sounds like some douchebag youtube hipster with no life experiencehow does that fit in such a badass rough gamewas about to isnta buy but no thanks get wokego brokegg that was great nice and all but is there a chance you can fix a bug on doom 2016 steam version its about the latinamerican spanish voice pack it doesnt work at all i dont want to buy a game again so you just ignore a bug report for three straight years not buying this or doom eternal if this is what it means quality to you i didnt expect that ending at all well done id software avalanche studios that lame shaking though better pull of 60 on enhanced consoles like promised we need singleplayer quake game like doom or wolfenstein thats all i need in my life im more of quake 2 type of guy buy quake 1 setup would be great too wait is that sam riegel thank god its on steam that deserves some recognition cant wait so glad i dumbed bo4 for this insanity rules baby its not fallout 76 ill give it that sooo photorealistic borderlands fake trailer i know the neighborhood in the flashback and there are no game stores on that street this is trying so hard to be funny failing all over glad i pre ordered this scanlan shorthalt is that you 226 dune confirmed id3 and avalanche made a cross breed 1st person hybrid between bulletstorm jc3 quake and mad max and ooooo boooy nice job with the trailer im calling it now hes gonna end up losing his arms and getting robotic arms ifuckinglove this marketing cant wait to get my hands on the game in few days looking forward to play i hope its better than rage 1 is this having micro transactions too if so goodbye i will not play this sadly i think im in love 3 so doom with whimsy no demons and an upbeat protagonist im game lets make some art this trailer is straight fire something something insert fallout 76 meme at least this game is going to be dope bc id is the shit comes out just before my birthday excellent please dont be bad please dont be bad please dont be bad please dont be bad i cant wait to play the game and buy all the micro transactions why is guy fieri in this game general knoxx there looks shit this game bethesda youve let me down too many times lately ill wait for reviews before buying this one still excited though rage 2 marketing is the best are you telling me i get to play a fun game all while listening to sam motherfucking reigel damn i loved that review bit 025 i t s r e w i n d t i m e fuck off with the preorder exclusives that ending this is what being too smugly selfaware and insuferably wacky looks like ign reuploads this on their channel in 321 150 you can play as a female yes i hate the male voice actor i gotta be honest this actually looks really nice holy hell that was insane im so ready for this this actually the best lunch trailer i ever seen so edgy perfect game for edgy teenagers i preordered the game but i truly dont like this coolness dont know if the main character is a looser or he just tried to be funny fail 054 hurk or his brother uh dont fuck everything up general cross think you meant general knoxx this has a real sandworm not just the pretend one to sell ships aka star citizen have to admit this was a great trailer hopefully its better than the failed online multiplayer fallout please dont be woke please dont be woke please dont be woke hell yea what happens when bethesda gets high 059 am i mistaken or is that guy the spitting image of guy fieri sold take my money this cant be the same bethesda that made fallout 76 no way rage 2 looks awesome who really made this game already preordered the deluxe edition cant wait to use the bfg bethesdas name taintes the release passing on it for mainly that reason i never played rage 1 one of the best trailers ive ever seen when they dont have great serious story they use comedy in other words mediocre story telling how about a trailer with a female walker narration really you should do it im not going to buy an epic ex oh shit bethesda did something right ty bethesda 3 after i got fucked with f76 i am not giving more money to you guys i paid 600 kr for an alpha game give me rage 2 for free and i will play it buy it no no no please make this coop i still hope most of the fos combat is not in open spaces i hate this type of humor fuck borderlands i was hoping for some gameplay not a shit fest this is so already better than fallout 76 wait you mean i get to play as starlorddeadpoolspidermaniron mannathan drake the game looks bad ass but the whole goofy character with a tude thing is so played out i already want an option to mute the main character and i dont even own the game yet 226 xl will of the thousands yeah i love this game 3 this is sick already preordered my copy still better than youtube rewind this game just really reminds me off borderlands every time and that might be a good thing hope it will be good and ill buy it but im really sceptical looking appealing till i saw the bethesda logo too bad bethesda is locking an iconc gun bfg behind stupid deluxe edition paywall no shitty micro transactions either woo hoo i like this trailer well if the game is as good as the trailer you have me thanks walmart lol 217 a tardigrade if anyone cares this is a lesson about how to sell a game oh wow the main antagonist is general knoxx waaaaaht well i moved to thailand recently and very sad to find out i cant pre order the game here sucks love this trailer been waiting so damn long for a sequel bought it only because i like the first one from a long time ago most likely will not think much of this tod howard please die sooner than later thanks for ruining bathesda and what their games used to mean you fucking nerd everything you touch turns to ash game looks stupidly good shame i wont be buying it on launch just like any bethesda game from now onwards i will be waiting till i can get this pre owned the scumbags at bethesda wont be getting any of my money fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me is it coop im sold i really enjoyed rage and im glad you decided to continue with it since i wait till borderlands 3 comes on pc i will buy this and enjoy it till bl3 comes to steam deal thos game will help me get over my long wait for cyberpunk 2077 the first game had better tone sound was fantastic too generic soundtrack tone seems off doesnt look like they tried to bring more class stuff in for depth just shit everyone can use yikes the gameplay looks cool but the writing is so cringe im reconsidering picking it up the original borderlands art style looks weird in 2019 you seriously had to add a female character just because some feminists who dont play your games asked for it sorry i wont support your game now because of constant pandering to the wrong people but i will definitely pirate it fine ill buy it what a stupid trailer but nice game so this isnt on steam wtf is the bfg really only available as preorder bonus cant wait to kill some feminists fck yeah ill buing it if only more devs realised that making their games fun is what keeps people playing over time cant believe there are so few dev teams out there that seem to miss that vital component in their games remember dont pre order pls this is bethesda oh boy what a day what a lovely day what items can we craft in this game will there be a traditional numbered leveling up system for walker will there be any underwater areas that we can explore how do we earn upgrades for our vehicles nice trailer saw some new cool stuff especially the selfchastising over the ending of the first game was funny i dont like the voice of the protagonist but i guess he wont be talking that much amazing trailer but is it just me who thinks the face of the leader of authority is just horrible comparing to other faces of course it looks like a generic bulletstorm mix with boring open world farcry can monday just get here already so i can pick up my collectors edition at the gamestop early release im way too hype for this game this trailer rocks great trailer i liked the first rage but that ending was awful yet maybe because it was so bad is why i still remember it glad you mentioned that in the trailer probably as a joke but hopefully as a reminder that this time you are going to do it right steam it is gonna wait till its 15 is this borderlands with normal graphical style if this didnt come out so close to days gone and mk11 itd be a day one fuck this i need this game take my wallet bethesda they turned rage into some dubstep hipster shit ill buy a used copy when its 20 in a couple months this was creative make sure you buy the 100 dollar edition or you can have the bfg gun because reasons the guy that sold rage 1 reminds me of my drug dealer 1010 would preorder again when does the preload start wtf was that ending xd sam the last ranger riegel 057 thats a friggin yahg the working title for this game was mass effect days of punk should have shown some unloaded textures from first game if i was a main character that would leave me with some ptsd id software and avalanche studio really done a good job from what i can see wheres blake griffin sick trailer tho 1010 watch everyone expect a perfect game when this releases meanwhile ill be expecting complaints from the community of why the game isnt good enough little do people know updates are a thing cant wait youve had my attention but now you have my erection is liam obrien the one narrating the trailer this is gonna be a fun game wait did that buffalo just laugh at me better blow it up just to be safe does anyone know when the game will be available for pre download on psn put cel shaded graphics on this and it could be a borderlands spin off not saying thats a bad thing i am getting the deluxe edition and i cant fucking wait am preorder this game i like it very very much this game rage 2 at least there is some actual continuity here even after years they decided not to reboot i plan on playing this game but this marketing is awful thank you for releasing on steam you guys are heroes please dont make this bad like fallout 76 holy shit nice trailer this was so good such a cool concept i just hope id helped avalanche and optimized their engine and also implemented vulkan if it does use vulkan we have a very good game in our hands still wish that the wasteland wizard was called lamn gamn i know im not borderlands then stop pretending to be i preordered before this trailer was over wait deja vu did i preorder twice deeefinitely looks like something ill pick up in august on sale to tie me over till borderlands 3 defenitily purchasing this game this looks fun im so fuckin ready bring it on baby bring it on i cant believe they spoiled the creation of the universe in their launch trailer smh i was lucky enough to play this at e3 last year and it was awesome then looks even more insane now cant wait theres a fucking sandworm in this game too well im hyped even if i dont own a rig that can run this game cant wait to roam the wasteland by myself again and this game even has human npcs was that a copy of fallout 76 at the end im actually liking this one over bl3 just feeling more refreshing bl3 feels too familiar to bl2 nothing new fuck rage we want elder scrolls god damn it edit after watching the trailer i take that back dead island reversescant waitpre ordered instantly randy p preordered the signed ultimate collector edition watches trailer meh this looks okay gets to ending yep im getting this insanely fun but i rage 2 for not being able to play this right now okay time to play through the first one in 5 days if only fallout 4 was like this im curious can we get the bfg 9000 seperetly or do i have to get the deluxe edition as i really dont have the spare 60 to spend on a bfg 9000 what even is life what the hell just happened lol at the rage review voice actor sounds cool like the sense of humor spoiler alert the smug cliff that youve seen in the other trailer is behind all of this general cross sounds like a hospital well bethesda sure knows how to advertise their shit cant wait for all the tears crying and whining of all the people on board the hype train that will as usual realize at the release date that its not a train but a bugridden train wreck still its on top of my wishlist but like after a year once its out of beta version im trying to decide if the deluxe is worth the extra money now when i see the word expansion and after playing the witcher 3 i expect a good several hours of content and not some hour long mission havent been hearing much about this game so little that i cancelled my preorder and will wait to see what kind of feedback it recieves fingers crossed its good open world factions single player only niggas who played fallout 76 aww shit here we go again why people compere this to cartoonlands haha alright that self awarness about the first game sold me good to see the authority is actually going to be treated like an antogonist lol what a weird trailer but i love it what a weird trailer but i love it is there gonna be mtx i dont know why but the writing really reminds me of lego movie how can you have a 4k trailer but 1080p game general looks like sarge from quake id software the best 1080p 60fps thats what i need fuck 4k 30fps bleeee so this is where all the npcs are they just took it from fallout 76 and put it in this game get ready for a open world doom with same rage rage 2 what is the music used in this trailer 151 this game has character creation seems strange for a fps but still pretty cool looking like my personal game of the year so far finally this year we can play shooters without multiplayer i real tired from online fps last years great trailer great marketing in general from what ive seen i hope the game is just as great lets hope bethesda doesnt fuck this up too 128 thanos confirmed damn it i love bethesda one of the best trailers that i have seen for a video game i cannot wait for tuesday may 14th cant come soon enough becky let me rage things just got weird in this trailer thats for godamn sure yeah after fallout 76 i am going to wait for the fallout before i prepurchase another bethesda title is that yuri lowenthal providing voiceover im getting doom meets saints row and borderlands vibes from this i like it f crazy i love it that was amazing i need this in my life its like the first rage took a bunch of x just go away you fucking vultures ohh yes this looks hella intresting havent played rage before so im really curious is it worth it 3gb graphics card is required ive only 2gb my laptop wont run it mi mind save some money boi bethesda want some wolfenstein doom eternal and rage boi my wallet oh no is that guy fieri more hype for this then borderlands do you know what the definition of insanity i love that they mention the leaks from walmart canada holy shit our protagonis just time travel and went to a divren universe no buffalo will ever laugh at me again borderlands 3 will be epic but this is too i will buy them one of funniest trailers ive ever seen me nanii bethesda anta no wallet mouu emptyiru general cross reminds me of frank horrigan anyone else do they not know they just spoiled the final boss room uhh getting a little deadpool vibe in the middle borderlands 3 fiasco we have this amazing game i cant wait to play it thanks bethesda for follow support the games of one player with history best trailer of 2019 ill just wait for fallout 5 single player 023 its rewind time hahahahah i always love the bethesda trailers its always the shit bethesda why do you have such shitty marketing practices like confusing the hell out of preorder and deluxe bonuses until a week before your game launches bfg only available in 80 versions among a bunch of other excessive bonuses yet you release such a cool fuckin trailer literally just dont do all the extremely deceiving shit and youll make a way higher profit from more customers and redeem your reputation for this garbage that ending just gave me fucking ocdand it was worth it every trailer for this game has gotten progressively better and built the hype up just the same cant wait for next tuesday is that g from logitech i gotta know at this point what the fuck is this shit this is not a fallouts competitor was the first idea to make rage saga is an a crazy game for casual ratkid players delete your capitalism and return to the art love id is doing really good with the rage universe theyre building it a lot with rage 2 looks a bit homo bethesda sure loves releasing their games in may lol thanks walmart canada please bring keyboard and mouse supports on xbox one thanks for releasing the game on steam not like epic store exclusive bs d wait a minute11 is that a dune reference at the end hahaha amazing sold give the marketing team a bonus bethesda basically mad max 2015 rage loads of cocaine thank god its coming to steam what an awesome trailer so to make it quick and simplefallout with cars and space ships well this game very very interesting hmmmm think i may have to get it lol a cat licking a lollipop its not developed bethesda i am playing so anyone one knows when the reviews are coming out this gets me hyped up for doom fucking eternal sweet cant wait to play it if theres microtransactions that is me thats something i will never support ah the puking isnt in reverse fun trailer i got the whole week off to play and stream this game does this mean that we can finally have some more doom eternal news i have no idea what i just watched but this is the coolest thing i have ever seen i like how you guys rewind to 2011 to the first rage this right here is how you sell your game finally a customizable character who have personality of their own instead of being a mute though the whole game holy shit is that a fucking deathworm in the last second damn i cant wait for this game more like lunch trailer finna eat a ham sammich over here best fucking launch trailer ever sick trailer in ready to blow some stuff up got a day of vacation planned to play on release that guy is the deadpool of the rage universe yep thats general knoxx i am very exciting todd surprisingly appear in this year e3 yo lets make tes 76 before tes 6 releases itll work im hella mad at bethesda right nowand i loved the trailer lol what a trailer if trailer was the real thing this game would have 1010 lmao this is great definitely buying these guys know how to hype people really the big worm is my friend and if anyone hurts them ill be upset love the poke at the ending of the first game that was really my only problem with it but you making fun of it assures me that this one will have a good ending they actually did the record scratch meme the absolute madmen rewind oh god no why would you remind me this is going to messup borderlands 3 salesexcept for the borderlands diehards im wondering if bethesda has some secret tricks up their sleeves to step up this game after releasewhen borderlands eventually gets released to really put the heat on that fan base them acknowledging rage1 was kinda shit makes me wanna play rage 2 even more game of the year im so ready welp convinced me to buy it 42 on cdkeys please tell me you can rewind time in rage2 yep thats me youre probably wondering how i got into this situation that was a weird time travel that was easily the most meta trailer ive ever seen preordering now d couldnt resist it god damn this is gonna be beautiful on pc what about fix fallout 76 hehe that was awesome i cant wait to play this game and yahooooo we get the bfg this game has some of the best trailers ive seen in a loooooong time what the actual fuck bfg locked behind deluxe and collectors edition fuuuuck off really didnt think much of the first rage but this this looks like a huge improvement and i mean after id rebooted doom perfectly im well up for anything else they are involved with doom eternal wolfenstein youngblood rage 2 and i dont need any another fps anymore in this year such a shame this is having barely any coverage anywhere so close to release only in the epic games store i guess as long as its not a failure like f76 thats a good trailer an excellent one rage 2 official trailer starts sam its rewind time general cross reminds me of captain vor damn why no shockhammer from we2 new colossus bfg is ps made preoder deluxe version they really are selfaware about the first rages ending huh i hate you for the absolute absence of regional pricing in the game but i love you for this work i will buy it bethesda id avalanche and whoever wants to jump into that bandwagon as well dont let us down make it worthy of our wallets ill buy this as soon as the first reviews are out and somewhat positive so essentially its borderlands without the cell shading look i want to marry the editors now wish the game has more guns now focus on doom eternal please my favorite line from this trailer is is that a baby borderlands on cocaine whos hyped now thats a good trailer why does this have to look so good now im gonna blow more money on games give me a break its like doom eternal mad max and borderlands had a baby i love it already rage 2 looks like what boredomlands 3 should have been from the start really looking forward to this last game i bought from bethesda was fo76 so going forward im gonna need a demo before i buy or honest reviews from fellow gamers til then shove everything you make up your asses how to make a good launch video 101 ok great now plz show us more doom eternal my boy sam killing it makes me wonder who voices the female walker i dont understand all the hype for this i mean there is better games out there and better games will be released tes6 is only one of them 3 definitely gonna play this one oooo i see you lock away weapons for money time to pirate looks alright but so did fallout 76 well hello scanlan lets see what i have in may 14th senior presentation 2 finals essay due dentist appointment and now rage 2 nice fuckin sam riegel nothing against the guy but his nasal voice has been stuck in my head ever since i played those amazing spiderman games i wish he wouldnt do the same voice everywhere remember folks dont feed your cat a popsicle it might create a whole new universe is 76 f2p yet regional pricing for regions like india please otherwise well have to wait for a sale your call is it good nice to see you taking the piss out of those of us who were fed up about rage 1 being ended on such a shitty cliffhanger thats swell oh and i love that youre selling cheat codes and locking weapons behind paywalls stating those that dont buy the deluxe or collectors editions dont get the bfg youre a shitty company who i hope daily that you eventually go out of business rage2codex pass rage 1 was so bad at launch i will never play another now thats how you make a trailer the protag have a voice thanks walmart canada it looks

long time for this video 1sy and early so happy hearing dannys song as a soundtrack dud after dud bethesda huh please just pay obsidian to do your work again please that danny brown tho im so glad they chose danny brown for the trailer song he is criminally underrated its bulletstorm but open world whos ready for some neon colored chaos whos ready for some neon colored chaos oh uncle danny what is the song in trailer i love this trailer whoever created the trailer well done shows off multiple aspects of the game exciting good edits and perfect choice in song just a perfect fit to the vibe of the game even the shotgun blast not only is timed perfect with the beat but almost has same tone as the beat lol im a fan of the individuals who created this trailer game looks so fun as well loved first one issues and all but this is just on another level if this runs well with no real issues could be right up there with being one of this gens classics looks like bethesda is taking notes from the saints row franchise in making sequels lmao this music seriously i want it world domination what is the song thats playing in the background borderlands 3 finally game looks awesome but i dont like the special powers thats a shame it needed to be more like mad max but thats my opinion fix fallout 76 thx the song is danny brown aint it funny for anybody thats wondering btw looks very good cant wait to play this bulletstorm is that you no andrew wk music not a good rage 2 trailer p ps graphics downgrade anyone bruh danny brown made the trailer that horn goddamn trippy lovely uhm coop is that music going to be in the game i need this now imagine the hype if fallout 76 was actually good ayyyyy good song choice danny brown the goat so you guys just took the best parts of rage and made it even better im in better have a rat rod edition again tho gotta love danny brown i dont know who pegi is but i bet shes 18 no ones interested in yet more buggy games from bethesda i mean it looks good but bethesda and all think ill go with that new far cry game instead at least ubisoft has never released a buggy game before aint it funny how it happen prepare to downgrade edition xdd i loved the first rage even with all of its flaws but i think im gonna give this one the skip the tone of it all just doesnt sit right with me not appealing at all cant fuckin wait for this song goes perfect with the trailer as well loved the original rage and now with this sequel i think theyve unlocked its full potential what ok i will take this as borderlands 3 so doom with cars on lsd bethesda seems to have learned to use better songs like this the last two for the other trailers kinda sucked if it would have atleast a mad max level of customization it would be pretty sick as much as i wanna hate on this i gotta be honest this looks hella fun imma need the name of the song other developers lauching game trailer at 2 pm b e t h e s d a lauching game trailer at 2 a m hope this is good after that 76 crap i know id and avalanche are creators but now a these day anything related to bugthesda is a risk definitely doom but on drugs visually like the borderlands franchise i love it this game is looking to be better than doom what song is it first comment xd this will ceep me satisfied till cyberpunk 2077 comes out if this is how it runs on ps4 pro color me impressed you know this game would be epic if it had atleast a 2 player coop like far cry 5 4 player would be fun to besides that this looks promising still why do people keep saying this reminds them of borderlands and mad max rage 2 doesnt remind me of borderlands or mad max pre beta my 037 that dude went flyin like tinkerbell gave him the fairy dust only he didnt believe in fairies in the end rage 1 the best2 is fake crysis rage doom ok we know what you can do lol how bout the enemies should we be prepared for downgrading never played rage whats it about no players were hurt while making this video wow rage 1 was boring and uninspired but this looks super fun i think having avalanche collaborate with id on this was a fantastic idea an open world game with crazy fps arena combat sounds like endless hours of fun so is there really no coop im getting borderlands vibes and would love to play this with my wife wow very nice not going to lie that looks very impressive i hope im wrong but this looks incredibly generic and boring why call it rage 2 this looks like a totally different game looks great next level on guns tec but down side this ai not smart i hope they make hard smart ai to fight or game will be boring for us all the last game ai was good reminds me so much of borderlands 2 does this continue on from the first one move over doom guy now theres the rage guy could be a cool game although i wont pick it up until months after release when its cheap not fussed on getting it day one mad max 2 looks improved btw player playing on easy cause it seems too easy this is going to be a really good game why choose far cry new dawn over this i can not get tired of watching this game its awsome does enemies is too slow and easy to kill watching this after seeing crackdown 3 gameplay jesus lol looks pretty good might get this one after its been out a while too many other games to play also we have metro exodus incoming so sorry rage 2 but i will put a pin in you for now this is a free beta i want to play this game so bad is that nathan drake pre beta gameplay soooooo its an alpha mais interessante do que o anthem rage 2 anthem i prefer to get far cry new dawn instead of this i love playstation specially in graphics system first needs more shotgun please hehe first because aja apparently just including a trans person in your game is now considered transphobic it is this pearl clutching virtue signalling that is creating a stigma around trans people and is further dehumanizing them what is qualia to a solipsist damn this looks like awkward garbage shame because it also looks fing gorgeous the phrasing a game has a responsibility to its characters its story and its world only makes sense if the game actually has effort put into its characters its story and its world which rage 2 really didnt i feel like he continually obfuscates game feel with gameplay in this video he believes that there is too much of an emphasis placed on some abstract concept of game feel which i agree with but that fault is not with what the term game feel hopes to describe but with the term and how it is frequently used his examples of parts of the game other then game feel just end up being parts of the game that are not gameplay hence the obfuscation the idea that an over reliance in games criticism on some vague term like game feel is bad i certainly agree with but by the end of the video it sounds nearly exactly like he is saying there is an over focus on gameplay in games criticism which seems naturally absurd ive always thought of game feel as being the feeling of the game play mechanics being used without the feedback animations particle effects sounds effects and what not in development its easy to distinguish the two but while playing they cant really be separated since theyre so tightly connected hearing you use game feel in a broader sense than my own made me realize that fun is a bad descriptor for video games that sounds extremely pretentious the way you describe rage 2s gunplay honestly makes it seem like an fps take on a character action game where you have to juggle enemies and vary up your moves and abilities to feel stylish and take advantage of the enemies weaknesses good fps bad open world story sucks got it we can only hope for id software to one day create the ultimate game guun where gamefeel is the top priority and everyone speaks only with gunshots coming out of their mouths my issue here is you dont define what good means the metaphor with b movies you used at the start was helpful a game can be bad in one aspect problematic messaging and themes in this case but good in others in the same way that a book can have sexist overtones in a spot but still present a narrative you find compelling of course you should point out problematic issues with any game as a critic it just comes down to criticizing the work as a whole which id say you do a good job of overall in your work i just feel like the thesis here is using a single aspect of a game to give it an overall critical opinion is bad i dont get how thats a specific problem for game feel though game feel is a huge part of the medium and should be considered when critiquing a game it seemed like you enjoyed your time with rage 2 but sone aspects of the game left you feeling gross due to a meanspirited tone that sounds more interesting to explore than game feel is overrated within games c you are spot on regarding the shooting mechanics and gameplay loop it left me feeling a bit disappointed that they didnt just go whole hog by scrapping the open world and obnoxious post modern storyline and instead focusing on making the core gameplay a more consistent event so you are saying gameplay is pretty strategic how often do we see that in action games isnt it enough already for a game to be good i havent played rage 2 mind you how the fuck is the existence of that character transphobic i love your channel and most of your views man but youre so subtley subverting unjustified political opinion consistently the aesthetics of the game its just plain and simple awful at least for me and im tired of all the strong indepandant womah stuff too gotta admit as much fun as rage 2 is the fps combat is the only good part about it doesnt stop me from wanting to play it but yeah going through the story and all that is a bit of a drag why do you need to boil everything down to a single this is a goodbad game isnt this just the same thing as review scores which are meaningless games are composed of many elements and people vary on how interested they are in each one and their ability to ignore the bad parts surely it should be perfectly sufficient to examine what parts were enjoyable and which were not and why is there really a need to try to summarize with a single binary at the end the steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned the salad it came with was a soggy over dressed afterthought isnt it stating the obvious that whether this is a good meal or not entirely depends on whether someone is going to eat or ignore the salad also i think youre underestimating the importance of good game feel fun because that is the primary legacy of a game for future games a good story sticks in your heartmind and makes a game meaningful to you but once that space is taken that feelin give yourself some credit you brought up the same issue in far cry 2 the game is a joy to play but i shouldnt be able to say that about african civil war most peoples favorite thing nowadays is kinda trash and we should understand that liking trashing shouldnt be reflective of ourselves tldr liking thing doesnt make up who you are the rage 2 trailer featuring live actors is one of my favorite if not my favorite promotions for a video game ever it built a story about a world that had no rules with a dirty wacky sexual punk aesthetic that i really enjoyed its a deep shame that it doesnt feel like the game was built with that ideal in mind that it doesnt really go all in on that wild humanity 2111 which fire emblem is this from cos i dont remember a screen like this in blazing sword imho gamefeel is just one of the aspect of a game you have to analyze it as well as the other elements which compose it its not that gamefeel makes a good a game its just that the core loop of a game is what you do most if what you do most is clunky its going to be a bad game no matter the other elements bad gamefeel makes games bad but good gamefeel often guarantees pleasing core loop if i were to comment on the points you raised concerning rage 2 i would have personally say its a bad game despite the quality shooting the many things around it made it unplayable but i wouldnt ever dismiss it or ignore it in a game analysis if a game has the best scenario ever made but is a pain in the ass to play its just a bad game with a good scenario put the same scenario with a pleasing gamefeel and its going to be a good game its useful to see the analysis of a game that has good game feel but isnt a good game because otherwise it all melds together and its hard to tell what is a part of game feel and what isnt max payne 3 for me is another game with great game feel and tons of questionable design decisions but when describing it i always tried to be precise about what was exactly so excellent in the game good game feel makes a good game great good game feel makes a bad game tolerable you have a game here that has enjoyable combat but wrapped around a mess of a package not only that but the combat is only a portion of how youre going to be interacting with this world so whenever youre not engaging in it youll be back again in that halfbaked world play lisa it has them names ok but what about the mouth feel not sure how i feel about this i dont think i agree with this the way a game feels to play and the core logic of the gameplay are integral to what makes a game a game i think in the future other things can be too but just looking at this review i can see rage 2 being enjoyable to play and wanting to play it playing basketball with your elbows isnt a good game but 21 is flawed imo despite still using the basic good mechanics of basketball i guess id be interested to see a video on what you think makes a good game can one great component not carry it is there a way to caveat that in a rating scale i loathe fun campster i would watch an entire video that was just a supercut of errant signal reading the names of npcs in rage 2 wait so youre telling me that good gameplay in a game doesnt mean its a good game i take issue with your whole argument here when designing a game the first priority is to make a solid enjoyable primary loop of mechanics and if you succeed at that then that game is a success but if a game is not enjoyable or fails to provide an interesting primary loop then it has failed all other elements are secondary and tertiary i also find it kind of tasteless that the protagonist is a beefed up video game marine archetype yet so many enemies are small frame women in bikinis all for equal rights but i just dont feel like the big hero murdering my way through legions of under powered girls in skirts i dont remember the exact wording nor the timestamp but i shuddered when you said that doom isnt as much about tactical decisions as it is about dodging projectiles its just one of the most basic layers of the game like mastering the spray patterns in counterstrike the actual decision space of doom vastly surpasses that of many games that imply tactical gameplay through military themes or features like commandable squad members not sure how you detected any transphobia from that character we are all bobby tackle i honestly think that might be a little reductionist in its own right game feel is something no other artform has and with the title you look at you should know well enough how a game might suffer in some departments whether that be artwork sound design gameplay whatever and still come out interesting enough to at least talk about and often enough even recommend rage 2 is far and away not my kind of game but everything youve described here doesnt make it seem like a bad game to me so you dont use term kinesthetics anymore can you do a video on devotion its a taiwanese horror game i think youd like i cant tell you how many times ive met tension over the good vs enjoyable concept its okay to enjoy something that isnt necessarily objectively good and it is not a personal attack on your value as a human its just important to distinguish the concepts in your mind i appreciate seeing that being discussed especially when you yourself look back on how youve struggled to differentiate the two you should play va11 halla you put a content warning for brief transphobic content god this stuff is lame i liked killing things on that game this is resetera in video form is there a mod that removes the plot yet damn i hate the visual design of this game its in such aggressively bad taste not in an endearing way just tacky crap that is exactly what happens when big budgets and forced high concepts collide do not want can we get a list of all the npcs chainsaw heart is the best band name ever the part about the puke guy makes me laugh so hard this was a good video and a great insight into something i hadnt thought about thank you for making it big fan of your critiques but i disagree with your assertion that the gameplay of rage 2 can be compared to a clickforreward dopamine reaction in a mobile game rage 2 feels good because it is a wellcrated shooter with terrible writing and lackluster setting the feeling you seem to hesitate to label as fun is the game rewarding your skill and finesse with the controls with a positive result you know what other activity does this playing music gameplay or game feel as i guess they call it now is as much a part of the art of creating a good game as terrific event scripting writing or character design i dont know why anyone would want to deny that or downplay it does a game need smooth masterful controls to be great of course not monkey island is a classic game with terrific music and writing that you barely need a one finger to play however if youre telling me that bayonetta or dmc should be seen as a lesser game because it focuses on game feel more than wr but is it fun i think i fundamentally disagree on the point of this video especially on the assessment of good because being brilliant in one aspect can easily overshadow all else a good action movie can very well be a movie that in itself has little in terms of themes and a story a good drama can have no interesting shot composition visual story telling and whatever else aspect a film can have i consider abomination a good movie because it has something that is enjoyable and can be learned from not because all of its qualities contribute to a bigger whole much the same with games rage 2 can subjectively be said to be a good game on point of the feel alone a game is more than a sum of its parts is it not even when they dont serve the same purpose and contratict each other game feel is just fun with more steps very insightful examination but unlike mad max which was a serviceable if cookie cutter open world title intense screeching heard from penny arcade hq what a wierd thing to take away from all of this that one should ignore as much as one can gameplay feel as measure but thats why people play games in the first place remove gameplay feel from concideration and you are left with badly paced movies and at that point why even go for games i understand problems rewieverscritics face with gameplay feel as measure of games worth ultimately its subjective and cant realy be used as any universal measurment or recomendation to general public and i say its wrong aproach instead reviewer should embrace his personal tastes and analize what makes them like gameplay like was wonderfully done in the video for egzample and the comunicate those aspects to the viewer it can be but one section of the review but woithout it review becomes unusable to me cause all the technical aspects story beats and themes are in the end secondray to the gameplay case in point no mans sky why anyone even thought its gona be anything else th i think youre conflating game feel and just game design here what you describe is that combat in rage 2 is great letting you juggle enemies using various abilities making it all look like an e3 demo but happening naturally and then you talk about how you shouldnt be blinded by how good the gun sounds or how badass it is when the bad guy goes bam but as you yourself showed this isnt why the game is addictive encounter design is the appeal of rage 2 doesnt stop at production values such as animations or sound design it seems to be just a carefully and skillfully designed fpswithabilities letting you express yourself in the games combat language which is still pretty rare it also seems to be wellpaced with how it showers you with rewards and activities which is also a nice feat pacing in games is very often overlooked all of this i think is a totally valid argument why someone can justify calling this game actually good i mean you can you unironically used the word transphobic xp not sure i agree if its enjoyable to play that is at the very least a very large factor we only get to exist for a little bit of time why not have fun purely hedonistic enjoyment is an attribute i feel warrants significant weight in judging a games quality thank you for summing up my opinion on this game in a way that even my own brain wasnt able to i pretty much loathed most everything about rage 2 but i could play that meaty weapons n powers fps combat loop forever just so viscerally satisfying each and every time i really disliked the first rage despite trying to get into it several times it lacked one of the most important parts of ids games good level design if you took doom and put pointless driving sections in between its levels the game would be nowhere near as fun rage did just that and streamlined the levels to the size of linear shooters like cod possibly due to technical limitations coughmegatexturescough it didnt fit the old school gameplay style but also lacked the freedom in approach of other postapocalyptic shooters like fallout and metro i couldnt enjoy the shooting and i hated the driving a ronin reference yes eloquent as always its almost like you are breaking down your own behavior as it relates to the game questioning why you like what you like of course much of it is subjective but if enough people agree with your subjectivity on a feature it becomes something that game designers will of course try to capitalize on and profit from my concern is that many games are taking this too far into slotmachine territory cashing in on our predictable dopaminehit responses like a bunch of pavlovian dogs just from that clip mama jojo seems about the same level as that transphobic it crowd episode intended to mock us but so wrongheaded and halfbaked that it ends up kinda nice instead btw if youre cis you do not have my permission to defend these things because a trans person didnt hate them theyre still morally repugnant its just that sometimes were attacked based on such a wrong understanding of what were about that its hard to actually be offended psychonaughts is a great game with bad game feel this is the first video ive seen from you and it was very well stated and thorough you went well and beyond easy opinion based descriptors and gave way more usefully detailed analysis and objective metrics than i expected it was professional to the point and well structured i enjoy dunkey and nakey jakey style videos just as much as the next gamer girl but what youve got going here is something worth coming back for thank you kind sir i can see how putting a focus on game feel is problematic when analysing a text but honestly i think it can be a perfectly valid way to review a game game feel is a shorthand for an obtuse feeling something that we have very few words for in games at the moment as long as you put a few words in to describe the kind of game feel i see it as useful and perfectly ok but yes probably also insufficient for this kind of analysis that doesnt mean rage 2 is a good game mmmh i dont have any issue with you having fun with rage 2 thanks to his game feel despite all the rest being clunky you kept your wits up and analyzed how stupid the rest of the game was so it clearly didnt blind you you can enjoy a silly game and call it somehow good for what it has to offer i kinda disagree for me anyway especially for fps having good gamefeel is by far the most important thing a game can do and the biggest factor in whether or not i enjoy a lot of games does that mean its a good game well for me i think it does i really could care less about the story or the characters or the text as far as im concerned they might as well just not be there in fact i would go as far as to say that the game would probably be better for it like even the new doom really had more story moments than it needed and it was kinda just annoying i devs really need to rethink what is important in their game and what they do and do not include they should be less afraid to just toss out story if it just doesnt work and they should be willing to cut out gameplay if its just bad and holds the story back d44t feels like shit like a blind rat locked in tiny cage with more blind rats they hiss they claw they bite but half of the time the thing they attack is their own tail its incomparable to agency of doom1 even footage of rage makes me sick with how bad it looks and low fov youtube algorithms pick up on blips even more happily 1710 thats good but i hope you have the same approach to music architecture gardening etc because if you think things like its catchy so its good it looks cool so its good or it feels pleasant to walk through so its good youre still a lizard a very good critical look at this game and current trends during the game i felt exactly like you shooting gave me a rush but between him i felt a growing feeling of depression the further i was the more i searched for these individual momentary elements that gave immediate pleasure and the less i focused on everything else in my opinion it would be good in two cases 1 if the creators went all out with madness and such controlled chaos as in shooting they also introduced in a narrative and visual aspect if it was the games equivalent of the movie crank it would be a whole interesting consistent 2 or if there was any intelligent commentary why there is such a climate duality here if the game tried to say something wise about our addiction to fast dopamine unfortunately it is not as crazy as the promotional campaign suggests or is not intelligent at all rage its basically crack its shiet but makes you feel fuckin good but on the next morning you feel sad i put down rage 2 even tho i thought it felt good to play it was just so stupid and ugly i felt guilty after every play sesh ill take a game w shitty combat and gamefeel but good storycharactersatmosphere any day sometime i even feel like goodsolid gameplay ruins a game my favorite games have good mouthfeel love your work as always campster im desperate for the sauce on that jingle during the lets talk title card at 359 mins i think youtube even demonetizes beeps cause they indicate big nono words you know the whole binary notion of this is a good game or this is a bad game is flawed if youre looking at it from a critical perspective there are tons of games that i play solely for the game feel and there are tons of games that i play because of the critical thinking aspect sounds like you really enjoyed rage 2 despite yourself and i think thats ok as a student of game design i find a lot of your videos where you go in depth taking apart what makes a game feel good really fascinating videos like these provide a language to articulate something that feels super subjective so i appreciate them loads i am thorn about this the tone and elements from rage 2 kept me away from it i have yet to still play it this review you just did where you warn me that the game is bad but has actual interesting shooting mechanics and a good game fell it had the opposite effect this game went from this looks bad to this looks bad but has neat gameplay as someone who enjoys games for being well games and can just tolerate shit narratives as long the actual meats and potatoes of the experience are there you made me want to check rage 2 out meanwhile other games that you reviewed that had not so great gamefeel but good stories i just watched them on youtube and you were right those were pretty neat but i couldnt get into the swing of things is this super bunnyhop so does a fun game have to be a good game dmc5 has been a game for me that despite how satisfying it makes every input how stylish it is it failed to grab my attention after the first 2 playthroughs it felt amazing to play but i just didnt find compelling or exciting crazy combos on enemies that barely resist wasnt the same as sneaking in combos into fierce deadly enemies it was such a shame because sometimes i became what i wanted out of it rage 2 is different because its more about the pacing of its content but i hope i could convey the same idea that games are more than the some of its parts what happened to outer wilds part 2 rage 2 really did make me feel like i was an addict just looking for my next fix if game feel is the only thing that matters we should all just play slots at casinos bc all that tries to do is give you dopamine on a drip feed to keep you there wanna just make a comment briefly on the transphobic bit the character you showed us running the sweet water place is it a parody character or is it a postapocalyptic trans character meaning in various documentaries i have seen trans people in third world countries where everyones poor and there are no medical resources who look similar to that character model i bring this up only because in the first world right now people have access to resources for transitioning never before available and that we are subsidizing through insurance so that people can be exactly who they want to be rather then having to make due in a run down environment like rage 2 where everyone is wearing scraps worn down and broken things cobbled together is it so unbelievable that maybe someone doesnt pass though they have implemented some effort into visually communicating how they feel it just feels weird to me to label this example as transphobic based on their character design good video i agree rage 2 isnt really a good game it lacks many elements that make a game good however the gameplay is so much fun the shooting the abilities the leveling up mechanics of said abilities the weapon mods that it makes for a thoroughly enjoyable experience i play this game whenever i feel like running around like a badass idiot killing things im on my second playthrough on ultra nightmare difficulty first playthrough was on hard and im having a blast though it still cant compete on a whole with some other titles ive played in the past that had amazing storylines great characters living breathing worlds this is a useful bunch of words to distract people who want to talk about rage 2 for long enough to safely escape 958 wait so youre telling me that the writing and design of a trans character feel transphobic just because said character is not traditionally attractive andor doesnt pass im not trying to make any accusations im genuinely confused am i missing something here i dont see how thats transphobic she says the locals call her by her prefered pronoun great video as always swears in my christian youtube how dare you im actually inclined to disagree was rage 2 offensively stupid at times yes did the open world feel empty and ruin pacing yes however i still really enjoyed the gamefeel and i still think the game is great for it even if its hard to put into words what exactly gamefeel is i think maybe its okay to love a game for something as simple as fun shooty bits it doesnt mean we cant also try to hold games to higher standards outside of gamefeel that aside great video dude is your mouse broken it comes off a bit weird to hear lootboxes and exponential grinding for random drops being equated to entertaining gameplay so casually it almost reads as a defense of the former as much as a castigation of the latter i have an intriguing question for everyone maybe it can be the basis for a future video even why is it that in recent years different facets of games like rage 2 wolfenstein young blood fallout 76 mass effect andromeda destiny or anthem have been diverging further and further with game play becoming more enthralling shooting mechanics sound graphics visual design while the structural basis and narrative have become worse to put it into context i always wonder why it seems so hard for aaa developers to get decent story lines convincing characters and overall atmosphere to hold together their mechanics and design in order to create a coherent gaming experience i feel like this is more common with a or even indie titles then it seems to be with major releases over the last few years with some exceptions like wolfenstein new order maybe or am i the only one who sees this as a recurring theme the rage 2 npc names read like my xcom squads with lensflare ganymede contessa degenerate strawberry switchblade fix hecklestance and rib boom 1703 is that bouyed as a counterpoint surely a game developers primary responsibly is to justify the players dollar not necessarily to theme character or anything else 1036 i dont know you said the new colossus had tonal problems too so i think you hit on some good points here for me the real issue raised by all this is the fact that video games simultaneously exist both as cinematic and aesthetic works and as you know games rage 2 fails as a nongame work of art for all of the reasons you talk about but given that its primarily a shooter it succeeds at existing as a game if the shooty parts were good enough to sway you to the extent that they did you seem to a bit biased here in favor of considering video games as cinematic storytelling and aesthetic expressions of creativity before you consider the fact that they are meant to be a system of rules and inputs with perceivable consequences and to an extent i get why i think that video games have enormous untapped potential for creative expression and i understand the critics desire to nudge the medium in that direction by prioritizing a games greater aesthetic significance before considering their successes and failures as luddic systems ie consider i think a summary of this is that we need to look at games more holistically while there is an audience that doesnt care about the nongame feel stuff and like you did enjoy the game despite those things giving an overall analysis of a game cant be that simple the things you describe as being bad are bad because they dont serve the overall package where as individually those elements could work in other games this comes up a lot with games that have unnecessary stats or resource management or in this case open worlds that they do nothing of value with beyond padding out the game mark rosewater the head designer of magic the gathering did a gdc talk a few years ago called 20 years 20 lessons and despite it being about his lessons designing a card game he has many insights that apply to many games and are useful to those wanting to critique games i think the problem with game feel is that its a subjective aesthetic quality much like color choice or editing style in film a game like this that relies on fastpaced action and visceral violence has very different game feel from say a platformer or a turnbased rpg or even another wellregarded shooter like halflife 2 but whenever the subject comes up i only ever heard it said that a games game feel is good or bad or somewhere in between its become a handwavy way to quantify something that the criticanalyst lacks the language to actually describe i hate loot box opening animations so much it feels like a bright flag with the word manipulation is being waved in my face i never buy loot boxes so the only ones i get are the freebies and i know theres almost no chance ill get anything good so the overly long overly flashy animations just serve as a reminder of how desperately these companies want me to buy them and want me to enjoy buying them i think the most recent example i can think of where every aspect of a game worked toward its overall gamefeel is bloodstained ritual of the night the scenery is gorgeous and gothic enemy design is varied and satisfying to fight the music is downright legendary but what surprised me the most was the presentation of the story the story is very pulpy and very clearly a castlevania in all but name the broad strokes are just a demonic castle is killing people go stop it but the way the game plays with it is just so fun theres a lot of detail in the characters that have their own implications into the mindsets of the survivors of arvantville from lindsays anger issues being rightfully justified in near blinding yet impotent rage as she saw everyone around her die to suzies despair at the demonic invasion that causes her to latch on to memories of good food to get her through the day both imply something deeper that lindsay was a really interconnected perso i really hate that i love this game the way you described it rage 2 doesnt only have good gamefeel because that would just mean that it has a good hit feedback tight controls and the quality in visual and audio design that comes with those but you said that you actually had multiple options in gun fights to use and that it was fun to play around with them and mix them up thats something more than good gamefeel its well designed gameplay and that might be enough indeed to call a game good depending on the kind of experience a game wants to deliver and the player expects to get out of it all right even a game that focuses solely on its gameplay should have diverse and interesting levels and enemies in order to be considered good so i am not sure about whether this is the right example i find the thought of questioning gamefeel as an over dominant criteria for game evaluation very interesting i cant help but feel this is one of the changes need to have games criticism being taken as seriously as literarty criticism starting to treat game feel as separate from overall quality seems to me much like separating use of language from story this can only be a good thing from what i see even if it ends up with some people having to admit they like trashy games im not quite sure this is what you meant but it feels almost like youre dismissing the impact of good gamefeel if so i feel like this is taking it a little to far i know a lot of people who play games only for the mechanics for them gamefeel is probably the most important aspect of a game obviously im not here to tell you how to critique but consider that for some people the way a game feels is still very important to their enjoyment of a game and might even negate said games shortcomings that said i totally agree that rage 2 is a somewhat aweful game with fun shooty parts nathan grayson is toxic do not sully your work with his name i hated everyone in this game when i played rage 2 the cutscenes were so terrible i thought i might have accidentally activated some weird quirky anti piracy feature that replaced everything with terrible dialogue you say the game feels kinda mean why is that a bad thing to your mind ever i swear im one of the few people who liked the driving and enjoyed just driving around the world to see the sights i was too afraid to call you out on the dusk video but since you did it i didnt have to lol i think this is actually an interesting discussion on trash rage 2 is trash that doesnt mean that its bad just that it feels good and has no real substance did you play hyperlight drifter id be curious as to your thoughts there in terms of aesthetics and game feel its the closest thing to a perfect game ive played in years id also love to hear a list of your favorite games in recent memory i feel like your attitude towards game feel is a bit extreme with you going as far as calling it pavlovian its almost like you claiming having good game feel doesnt contribute to a good game because its a negative thing or something great video anyways really made me think tbh id take a short game with excellent gamefeel over an overbloated rpg with great writing that just plays like crap from what you describe rage 2 was fun not only because of the game feel but because the combat encounters are challenging in an interesting way the bit where youre talking about crowd control and target prioritisation has nothing to do with game feel and that would definitely be a valid reason to call the game good i feel like you might be overanalysing your own analysis here although i suppose thats your job you can just say the shooty bits of this game are well done but the rest of the game is poorly worked out and that kinda ruined the enjoyment after the fact thats perfectly valid criticism maybe bobby tackle is the symbolic homonculus of the players own self realisation that they live in a post apocalypse where the drive to aggressively pursue the next reward trumps all issues of human connection and identity all they can do thence is be disgusted perpetually but unable to stop smoking the moist lit cigarette of good game feel a long time ago yahtzee came up with the concept of the three cs or the threelegged stool of game design those being challenge context and catharsis or game feel i guess every game will have different levels of importance for the three cs but you cant ignore the other two altogether because a onelegged stool is kinda difficult to sit on ico is one of the best games ive played this year despite not having all that great game feel super mario 3d land has solid game feel but doesnt do anything interesting ive been saying this for age while most games should have good game feel that alone doesnt mean the game is good or interesting not by a long shot there are still examples like pathologic that have awful game feel but there are also valid arguments that can be made regarding the way that bad game feel enhances the game this one is particularly complex and i also dont have a clear personal answer about how i feel about it hahaha games that has good game feel but nothing else can make me hooked and get me wanting to come back and play more but leaves me feeling empty afterwards and i usually regret playing them wait good game combat mechanics good game is a new concept for you have you never played dark souls im sorry if i sound like some kind of elitist asshole but this videos main message seems pretty obvious like really really obvious you mentioned liz ryersons writing on game feel in your intro do you have a link to that i cant seem to find anything relevant last i heard beeps are detected and treated as swearing cant find the source now though so maybe i remember wrong on topic i dont agree with the assertion that gameplay is only good on its own for game feel this notion that game feel can make it fun to your lizard brain but the only way to make it more meaningful is narrative and thematic aspects i dont like this fetishizing of game feel that you describe but i still value gameplay over other parts of a game more often than not depth good feedback and the right level of challenge makes for a far less fleeting forgettable funonlyinthemoment game and means that a game doesnt have to focus on narrativethemes to legitimize itself something thats always been offputting about a lot of the gamesasart movement i also disagree with your definition of game feel i think which is why the main point of the video good game feel good game falls flat to me it means good animations hitstop hitboxes sound 120 you taught that guy sweeping the floor a lesson wait is this a transphobic jojo reference 1008 ayy u play with such high mouse sensitivity is 1002 a motherfucking tequila joseph reference do you worry as a reviewer you are not playing at a pace that makes it enjoyable take animation for instance when you freeze frame and look too hard at the between frames you can see the distortion tricks that animators use to trick you into a sense of motion they can look pretty bad but thats ok because your not meant to focus on them and most dont i think the same could be said for the vommiting guy or any of the other side charecters i think you are meant to be passing through rather quickly and taking to long to focus on any one detail might break apart on most games or art in general this game is worth it for the gunplay alone a game that comes to mind in watching this video is bulletstorm no other fps game has had that same gamefeel to me and yet the settingcharactersplot all really came together in a satisfying way too but what about the mouthfeel can we talk about how fucking cancer to all that is good storytelling these introductory monologues are its a trend in lazy aaa open world games and it needs to stop big time thats roughly how i feel about shadow of war tbh i want to watch this but the brief transphobic content warning has me worried can anyone tell me exactly what the context is ultimately it sounds like they could have taken out everything that isnt shooting the big open map that just functions as a huge stage selection screen the towns the disjointed story bits and the game would be so much better for it itd be a short but sweet bit of gun combat but they kept piling shit on top while arguing about why their nugget of shit is the best all great names but theyre second place to the legendary sleve mcdichael 210 hes like a wrestler trying to sell his opponents move by jumping hyperbolically conclusion ragdolls ftw hmmm i think this really puts forward the question of what do you want out of your game to me it feels like good game feel is like good action in a movie they dont guarantee that the whole work is good but they make it a lot easier and enjoyable to consume and sometimes people just play a game for its good game feel just like how people sometimes just go to a movie for its good action think like michael bay stuff fast and furious movies that are generally regarded to have poor plot but are carried into populairity by their action scenes so just a heads up on the bleeped out swear yt algos pick up those too they still count as bad stuff not sure by how much compared to actual swears but yeah it sucks either way i do feel like your point about the hollowness of game feel is accurately captured by the term itself though at least insofar as it recalls the sisterterm mouth feel a snickers bar has great mouth feel but that doesnt make it good food it took you a while to get there but i appreciated your point this dude is not psychologist talking about dopamines and shit acting like he know some shit it funny im not say this is a good game but this is just youre a opinion stop with the im smart shit just say i dont like this game actually doesnt that make it a good game segregating story and gameplay is essential sure the story can be vapid uninspired or even nonexistent why should that culminate into it not being a good game if the gameplay is great i dont watch many movies lately i find them too long and boring lately sure i could play a game that doesnt require much attention while half listening and half watching a movie but thats not how i am with movies theres too much visual story telling that if missed then i dont feel like i know whats going on anymore look at your comparison to mario as a platformer and how little story is involved with most of the games in the series or the complete lack of story in burnout does this make them not good games good gameplay always makes a good game as far as i am concerned doesnt make it a great game but at least a good one i wont deny that a vapid contrived uninspired or just plain stupid stories can devalue our experience playi great video i also share the battle against the constat abuse of the word fun i actually had a talk at the last knudepunkt conference about it the recording is on my channel the discourse around this should be more common thanks i think what really matters is whether or not you enjoyed the gamemovieshow or why i can only judge it from that singular brief clip you show but mama jojo doesnt seem remotely transphobic to me just queer i find your reading of that really bizarre good points made here i feel this way about dishonored games the story and the world is just uninteresting underutilized and they play everything too safe the characters are cookiecutter archetypes with no interesting qualities to them but the gameplay feels good and rewarding its fun but i wouldnt describe those games as good games despite probably most disagreeing with me here chainsaw heart would make a good band name somehow you always put into words very eloquently what i personally felt when playing a certain game also back at uni we had a term for what you generally describe as game feel virtual haptics i agree however that while it makes up most of the gameplay loop in rage it also wasnt enough to make up for the tonal issues and hollow characters and world i wonder why they didnt put more effort into molding everything together with a more convincing approach to worldcrafting even the first iteration was better in that regard altough it was over just when thing started to becone interesting this is wrong i feel i think i need to return to it when im better equipped to write it out but before i forget games are game feel its what makes them unique its good that they have that element making truly artistic storytelling is admirable but to ignore how a game feels is to fight its medium though game feel isnt the only unique form of storytelling to games interaction generally and environmental storytelling specifically so that mitigated there are better and worse versions of game feel game feel is not a mere skinner box but that reduction was frankly offensive speedrunning for example are not slot machine whales but the confusion of them is dispiriting and telling what was described in this video seemed appreciably different from watching a random number generator it would seem that good design should be able to engender those good feelings in more complex ways which reward engagement skill and thinking or nonthinking reflex we you can make a good game based exclusively on game feel but when you do it feels more like a fun sandboxy space to interact with instead of a slot machine with questionable morals and content and just because you can make a good game exclusively out of good game feel doesnt mean you cant make a bad game by thinking you only need game feel its maam not gonna lie this game was fun for a couple of hours and getting the powers and guns were great but i got tired of it since it felt like busy work after that i just stopped all together im thinking of uninstalling it note bobby tackle kinda reminds me of the onrails animatronic rides in disney world youre meant to walk past the robot pretending its a real character but not to linger any more than that pretty sure you meant to credit fire emblem heroes not fire emblem fates gamefeel means i press left mouse it shoots the gun and me looking at and hearing that feels good it doesnt mean combat design listen if youre crediting kotaku youve just lost all credibility it means its a good game if thats what you want though thats one of the important things to remember some people arent looking for any of that other stuff sure covered all your bases there the description of game feel sounds a lot like fun to me im not really sold on this one dude it just seems lazy to point at random npc and go this game hates people that character is transphobic without making any attempt to understand or research the devs intent or even explain why you feel that way about it yeah its a shitty game and uses cleft features for mutants which is also really shitty but i feel if youre going to criticise the game by applying real world politicsmorals in mind then you should also maybe approach the real world people who made the game about it too whos to say that the supposed portrayals of trans people in this game are transphobic whos to say the characters are cartoonish and not a celebration of queer expression like pointing at bobby tackle a random npc in this game which clearly but clumsily is attempting to be humorous who is perpetually smoking and puking and using this to support the idea that this game shows disdain for human kind is just weird i could totally be misin fun a descriptor i loathe so much thank you so much for that line good sir ive stopped having any conversations about videogames film or even cultural events with friends due to them not having anything more to say than that looks fun that was fun its a lot of fun eating a cheeseburger this cheeseburger is fun you state that gamefeel the core mechanical gameplay loop being immersivewellpolishedfeeling right doesnt make a good game i like the notion but i think its more complicated than that for example puzzle games are typically nothing but gamefeel and a coat of paint if rage 2 were reduced to nothing but its meaty core like puzzle games sort of like doom would it then be a good game are the shortcomings you see due to things they tried and failed or things you expected that they didnt deliver why did you expect those things genre conventions maybe were being too reductive with the idea of a good game this video was fun im gonna argue a niggle i have with your application of gamefeel here surely the bits between combat are still part of the gamefeel the main complaint ive seen about rage 2 is that it has this problem where its short bursts of very enjoyable combat with tediuous stretches of lootcollection and pointless driving between it has very poor pacing of gameplay that sounds like bad gamefeel to me unsettling physical deformities are fine to put on characters that are meant to be unsettling dont be ridiculous you really leaned into the mst3k reference at the end there dinchya i feel like there is some modernist argument about gamefeel being unique to games and so deserving a disproportionate space in the discord just to warn ya ive heard theyre going to teach the youtube algorithm to find swear bleeps too ya may need to switch to sound effects anyway thanks for the video w b if you think an obvious man masquerading as a woman is transphobic then i dont know what to tell you because thats what they are and thats what most of them look like i mean i thought they wanted representation well there it is in all its glory i disagree not everything needs all those other things you listed sometimes a dumb game is all you need and i dont even think thats worse than a game that can do both its just different sure it sucks that this game tries and fails at worldbuilding and narrative but if the core or the gameplay loop is cool then its good because thats what makes a game a game can you drop the dopamine line please its this weird medicalizing language that you use to discredit things its as if youre comparing it to heroin sure its a positive experience but its actually degrading bad for you bad for video games you would not say a story gave you a big hit of dopamine if you felt strong emotions toward one of the characters for example hmm definite signs of cancerous micro management and rushed development i wonder if it couldve have anything to do with it being published by bethesda softworks the reason game feel gets valued higher is because its really that one aspect of a game that doesnt depreciate as you keep going back to it many people see games like a book or movies but i always disagree with that and consider them more like sports if you look at games this way then game feel must play a bigger role in the quality of a game that isnt to say game feel is all that matters but game feel is certainly the main reasons people keep playing a game history has shown that good game feel triumphs over many things why is it that a game like a link to the past can get a remakesequel like a link between worlds but ffvii has to completely reinvent itself its because one can be played over and over again while the other gets harder to play every year old games still have a multiplayer scene because of their game feel people still play quake because of how good the movement feels interestingly brood war is a special case of a game that is still being played because makes me think of earth defense force 5 since that game is pretty much 100 game feel games have layers it sounds like you are trying to define game feel using the most superficial layer or deepest layer the stuff you do on a moment to moment basis and that sounds right to me you can totally enjoy a game that has one great gameplay layer and the rest is shit it just has to be really good on its own ive played games with shitty upper layer but engaging on other layers like management and interesting narrative starting with a trigger warning doesnt exactly excite i havent played rage 2 but between the shirtless men big bulges presumably chosen wacky names and trans shopkeepers it looks like theres a really good queer camp game buried in this mess somewhere rage 2 was the exact mess i feared it would be i totally called it months in advance this new one is garbage the first one was barely notgarbage they desperately wanted to say open world in the advertising but simply dont want to put in the workbudget i disagree i believe that if you enjoyed the experience game does deserve to be called good even if some aspects of the game are not that great otherwise we enter a weird territory where something like super meat boy might be considered a bad game because of a shallow story and poor graphics or in other word we approach a territory where you consider you favorite game to be bad thats and absurd situation but if you follow that logic that might happen my favorite game defiantly has shit ton on flaws and it doesnt even have a good game feel but despite all those flaws its an absurd to call my favorite game a bad game when it brought me 3k hours of joy its just doesnt make sense i kinda know the feeling destiny 2 is infuriating and i hate it and as soon as i have to open battlenet itll immediately pull me back in and ill learn two more chapters about that games inane worthless story killing bland wannabehalo enemies with nonsense usmarine in space guns but the guns feel so good to use movement feels so satisfying its such a great feedback loop in such an asinine slog so why dont you use these standards for lets say every other game out there do not get me wrong rage2 was dead since weve seen the weird woke boxart as it shown that commercialism was the ruler in the design if you cover a big game next astral chain good or bad thatll be something to dig into this embodies how i feel about star citizen with perhaps the biggest difference being awareness while you struggled to call rage 2 a bad game i struggled to identify why i keep going back to star citizen okay im just 15 minutes into the video but did rage feel great to play i thought the shooting was super akward and clunky great video i get pretty tired of these empty universal descriptors which become especially annoying from the immersive sim dilettantes and systemic design as a kind of empty catchall to sum up the experience of a game the simplest thing to keep in mind is that gamefeel is but one of the elements in a game a game with an excellent story and atmosphere that feels miserable to play isnt a good game either for the same reasons that rage 2 isnt those are the games that get tentative recommendations because theres good elements but not a good whole for rage 2 it sounds like the game would have been good if they had removed all the incongruous bits that werent any good if the pacing story and structure were more like doom 2016 where 90 of the game could stay in that core loop the game would overall be good i dont know why youd think this anyway ive played multiple games that have rather poor gamefeel specifically hackedtogether kongregate titles and were decent games in and of themselves anyhow to me any aspect of a game isnt that different from any aspect of a movie you wouldnt go into a movie and assume that just because its cinematography is gorgeous that automatically makes it a good movie do you well some critics seem to think thats the case anyhow so maybe this is a lack of imagination in my part the idea of satisfaction that keeps you glued to the game even though you know the experience is subpar and your time can be better spend elsewhere reminded me of my 50 hours time with destiny 2 i was genuinely impressed how fun it was to pop multiple headshots on enemies that move at you in a straight line in a 4x4 meter room or to take in alien worlds with amazing visual production reload your gun to see the animations and hear meaty sounds pleasantly surprised by ability to check inventory at loading screens and even cutscenes thanks for that every game should have that the story is borderline insulting in its simplicity these helped me make to the end forsaken dlc 10h felt like its genuinely the best part of the whole game but then i looked at my time played checked what endgame will consist of and just uninstalled the game was full of potential or more truthfully i desperately want it to be but at the end of the day i could have and should have dropped almost bought glad seeing this video before making my purchase i like the burnout 3 part waiting on outer wilds part 2 wait what im confused why did i learn in this that game feel is a notion poorly defined but finding a definition is for another day that having good game feel doesnt make the game good but having bad game feel will more likely make your game bad or just that you as a person were confused and decided to confuse me in the process its the first time i really dont get the point of an es video all this character names sound like they came from honest game trailer where the fuck is outerwilds part 2 i 100 understand why people dont like this game but i had so much fun with the combat i just wish it was linear it would allow for better level design that could take advantage of the players massive movement mechanics as well as better crafted driving levels which is actually really good remember what reggie said if its not fun why bother who cares that the story is empty or that the open world feels empty gameplay comes first story second dont be one of those game journos whose fine with shitty gameplay as long as the story says something or that characters do something gameplay is always king youre seemingly wrestling with the 2 sides of yourself the player who cares about what matters gameplay and the game jurno who wants a game to samething or do something if a game is fun and feels good to play say so and then if the story is shit in your eyes say so you can say the gameplay is just meaty doom 2016 inspired fun but the story and world was lack luster thats all that needs to be said the story being lack luster doesnt make the combat system worse it just sours it for you this video just seems to be saying absolutely nothing just like you say rage 2 does it seems to boil down to i wish gameplay being good didnt contribute to revie games regional pricing steered clear away from me the game initally was priced more than usd value in india where 60 games are priced around 21 in local conversion because purchasing power parity and after a lot of shouting they revert it back to around 57 which is still bad for us very tired of publishers manipulating regional prices like this just tony guess at what point they ran out of crazy names you gave a trigger warning for that that really i really enjoyed this video because honestly i needed to hear this 6 months later i still am processing my feelings on kingdom hearts 3 because honestly there is a lot i really really dislike about the game yet i cant bring myself to say it was bad and this really hit the nail on the head because yes the game managed to make my brain squeeze some dopamine via some fun flashy combat and pretty graphics and that does tend to overwrite the parts of my feelings that are driven by less powerful motivators that were bothered by stuff like narrative and characterization so i hope i can actually use this and maybe another playthrough to actually finally nail down what i think of it this is basically how i would describe destiny all gamefeel but no game the shooting and power ups feel amazing in rage 2 everything else doesnt what exactly is transphobic about this jojo character poor bobby tho i think youre overcorrecting a bit theres a wide gulf between gamefeel is everything and gamefeel isnt really important or worth talking about i think you were right about rage 1 part of the posture of this video seems to be that the first damning half is more important than the analysis of the gunplay but its not both are really important its not that analysis of the former is extremely rare valuable and holy and analysis of the latter is base i often see games that feel good to play called out for shallow narratives and characters in your videos and in others it sort of comes off as if youre disappointed in yourself for having fun that youre good at articulating even if you hate that word im not saying that all factors shouldnt be considered in evaluation but theres a lot of value in your approach to rage 1 you didnt say hey this game is actually great and everyone is wrong to say its not you said hey this not great game has he plays bad games and has a bad taste in games he didnt even get inside okay but heres the question would it make rage 2 a better or worse game if instead of fixing all the story open world and character issues they just cut that all out just turn the game into a more condensed openworld sandbox where you are free to just run from shooty action setpiece to shooty action setpiece does a game need context or world building to be a good game could a game not stand on good game feel alone after all thats the core of what makes a game if all a game was was a fantastic primary game loop is that not enough are there still people seriously arguing in 2019 that games dont have to be fun jfc did we fall through a warphole to 2012 havent played rage 2 nor read extensively on gamefeel but isnt the real issue here a lack of cohesion if the game was more focused had better a better script art direction tone etc it would be a good game right conversely if it nailed the stylevisualsstorysound but played terribly it would likely receive a similarly mixed review no i think the importance of gamefeel varies per title point click adventures or visual novels can skate by with unwieldy controls by making the results of those clunky inputs still feel meaningful but a game like tetris can skimp on graphics since it feels intrinsically interesting to play inputs happen fast and they gain ever escalating importance too thus perhaps the amount and feel of the interaction between medium and player is not static and should be judged on a casebycase basis ive been judging games by how much fun ive been having playing them what an awful critic i have a similar suspicion of the perception of fun world of warcraft unwittingly trained me to be very observant to my own reactions to game elements if a given activity in a game is enjoyable in itself i consider that activity fun context and extrinsic rewards can be multiplied by an activity to adjust its fun but not added to it so while i could happily spend a whole weekend slamming out 5man dungeons with randos no amount of rewards was ever going to make daily solo quests anything but busy work ive never heard of a debate over game feel games are venues for play play is the practice of a skill without the context of real life application its how this planets neurologically complex organisms learn to do things like socialize stalk prey and attract mates and since evolution has left an enormous amount of cruft in the human genome theres a lot of idle bits of brainware sitting around waiting for the right game to come around for instance our brains recogniz a thought if a game does seek to centralise the feel why add all the bells and whistles its like i feel like both the doom reboot and the new order had great feel and doom treated its story almost perfectly as a joke doomguy is there to slay demons new order turned bj into a person devil daggers also feels good and theres barely a frame far cry 3 and five feel like cases were they figured the fc feel would carry the rest 2 4 and even blood dragon and primal felt like the feel helped the open world feel like a world i feel like an anonymous scum bag a man pressed into being a trouble shooter for a country hes not quite part of an 80s action hero a prehistoric hunter feel focus can work but feels disingenuous when i can see your focus wasnt just on the feelor youre using it to prop up bad design elsewhere like the aftertaste rage 2 has given you its interesting to watch you explain gamefeel i always assumed over the years that it was just the way my synesthesia processed things before i knew i actually had synesthesia and ive been wondering what gamefeel is for people without it because for me game feel is the physical sensations a game gives me like if the motion in a game is good then i feel the same movement as the character i think i bought rage on your recommendation but i found it incredibly frustrating to play i got up to that giant monster who attacks you in the ruins and after finally killing it i was done i continued through to the end of that play session but never picked it up again the game was just one long boring slog after another and that battle with the giant monster was a really good example it took me like 5 seconds to figure out what i needed to do to kill it but it took ages to finally bring down i guess the game feel was bad for me because every aspect was just heres a new thing now die over and over and over and over and over and over again until you flook the time limit or the health attrition or whatever and do it all over again in the next section i felt like the game was just wasting my time something im feeling more and more in modern games you talk so enthusiastically about the gameplay here but i seem to recall you talking that way about rage 1 also and a wow a main stream game you are really going back 5 years ago i cant watch most of your excellent videos because they are crammed with spoilers i remember lamenting gamefeel issues in tom clancys the division 2016 and then later rebooting borderlands 2 and noticing all the gunplay problems of the division had been resolved in a game four years earlier when tom clancy was alive his games were required to have realistic feeling gun action less so once he died so yeah its a thing hardly the only thing but a thing still edit formatting i wish birderlands 3 had rage 2 combat calls of dutys the lets talk about rage 2 title card and the music that accompanies is so gorgeously flippant but how about that mouth feel am i right fellas its a conflicting game but overall its one i enjoyed but i absolutely agree the narrative could be improved and tightened so much weird in my experience in my media landscape sorry game feel is not a thing really by following you and other people like you conversations i see and sometimes participate in are about plots characters worldbuilding politics representation etc etc you know all that stuff that was hidden under one number on one category probably called story when scoring different parts of a game was a thing even discussion about something like tetris effect was less about how cool it is to pull some tricky spin or whatever and more about an emotional reaction to the overall experience well maybe not less but half and half obviously it is possible that i just focus on those things myself and ignore bits when people say stuff like driving is fun or shooting is visceral but i would still insist that it is not dominating so while i think you being critical about your criticism is always good i dont think you failed or anything like that its very interesting how aparently good gameplay does not translate to video at all while you couldnt stop talking about how good it feels the visuals where so boring generic and uninteresting that i went reading something while the video ran in the background tab very nice how you are openly questioning your bases on game critic about the specific subject yeah culture industry have you ever read theodor adorno still have a good share of alienating fun in it gamefeel and gameplay loop can be used as a tool for that aaaaand were back to politics in videogames criticizing the story of a video game is a lot like criticizing the design of the monopoly board sure giving names to all of the little people living in the houses on park avenue might raise the production value but its beside the point that doesnt mean you cant have a good story and characters and all that it just means that your game can be good without them in all seriousness the games inclusion of a trans character that it doesnt develop and is just a passing npc and you considering that to be transphobic is more indicative of your views than the developers why is it a problem if a game is mean soits fun its a fun game to play im sorry gamefeel is a madeup bullshit word to replace fun so that people who say it can feel more like a smartysmartypants the algorithm hears the censor beep and dislikes it as much as the swear it can also see gore by looking for shapes and colors which is why some youtubers will tint the screen blue or gray during mk11 fatalities shoulda just said shit the self criticism is very refresher too many reviewerscriticsperson with a video editor and mic never reflect on past criticism like their opinion doesnt change over time or failed to realized the game wasnt designed for them i found myself struggling to describe good feel to others in rl it is like abstract concept of fun i think game feel is a useful term for devs and end users but for critics idk its not very descriptive okay you talked about the game feel but what about the mouth feel it just wanted its own sander cohen scene and over shot i agree game feel is a bit broad as a term i am not sure i share your perspective about whether it should be valued or not based on a supposed tendency to mask faults i think modern bigbudget games have become much more than one type or instance of whatever game feel is one might argue that rage 2 has effective game feel in fps combat but poor game feel in driving or narrative segments its difficult to value a game with such disparate parts game reviewers struggle with titles like mass effect andromeda anthem rage 2 etc that have redeeming qualities but many impediments even in broad terms could game feel as a concept be better measured like how system performance benchmarks are measured you may have high peaks of game feel but also low valleys and inconsistency and those highs might be impeded by the lows lets talk min max avgmedian standard deviation and impedance of game feel in all its handwavy glory rage 1 2 would be much better as corridor crawls it honestly looks like they just tried to rip off the borderlands aesthetic and cross it with a mad max tonality the absurdistness of like the cancan shows and the mama jojo seems like their take on the tiny tinamad moxxi stuff from bl2 from this i guess two questions emerge can a good game have awful game feel and if the only good thing about the game is that it is funengaginghas good game feelwhatever doesnt mean its a good game what does i think a game that feels good to play but lacks in other aspects is a bit like 90s music it isnt great music but when the backstreet boys or britney spear are played in a club you still dance and sing along assassins creed is probably the best example of a game franchise that took its good and satisfying gameplay loop and beat it into the ground by putting it increasingly bad games yeah not sure how to feel about mama jojo cool names and idle animations would be a cool name for a screamo song ive rebuilt rage 2 in my head a half dozen times while playing it even only using the elements that are already in the game not blowing out the hypothetical budget theres a real diamond in the rough there its the biggest love hate relationship ive had with a game in a long time id has always been terrible at story doom 2016 is the only exception i can think of and thats just because the script actively rejects the need for story despite still having one to use a writing metaphor perhaps game feel is akin to the prose of a book its important that it be clear and satisfying to read in order for the reader to intake the story but that doesnt guarantee good plot or characters could mama jojo be a terrible reference to that one time in jojo part 2 where jojo dressed as a women from your description of why you kept playing it sounds like it was because you enjoyed the games strategy and mechanics i wouldnt call that an aspect of game feel at 4 minutes in we are invited to join him on the beginning of the video thesis lol its funny im quite the opposite i dont think we place nearly enough value on gameplay feel when evaluating games most people tend to ignore it entirely and we end up in situations where very popular games like path of exile in a genre where game feel is extremely important have terrible game feel for years and years before the developers finally announce theyre fixing it it does bring up another important point though that the genre of a game has a strong impact on how important different aspects of the design are game feel is certainly much more important in an fps or a dungeon crawler than it is in an rpg for instance but thats not to say that other aspects should be neglected as we see here in rage 2 so apparently games like just cause and destroy all humans cant exist in the modern era the story is meant to be placed in the back burner to amplify the gameplay this isnt anything new this was the case for the first and same could be said here not sure why its all of sudden an issue but i was right to not listen to reviews or so called critics if i listen to people like this i would have missed a ton of games that ive enjoyed clearly you shouldve included a trigger warning that you would be including a trigger warning its basey not bahsee bass is a sound bass is a fish great video i still feel like your not talking exclusively about game feel though seems to me that the bits you enjoyed in rage 2 have more to do with its combat design than game feel you dont talk only about shooting animations sounds and vfx its more about how those details enhance an already enjoyable combat with expresivity and creative weapons handy summary of the coop experience in ghost recon wildlands i never tried rage because of the reviews but at least its visual style seemed a lot more unique than the sequel the art direction for 2 just looks bland and generic by comparison i think this is a very valid approach just dont take it to the extreme of looking for specific politics or philosophies you like in every game personally speaking that kinda kills the enjoyment of most products because most products will not live up to that expectation my favourite anime cowboy bebop stand alone complex ergo proxy legend of the galactic heroes isnt full of typical anime tropes melodrama screaming retarded adults vapidity so enjoying regular anime is really hard i love it when postapoc not only builds an interesting premise but also manages to provide enjoyable and logical explanations which is why i keep getting burnt by most postapoc ultra combo attack on titan so yeah i think its completely fine to say you enjoy the shooting yet you wish the rest of the game had more to it things can always be better its tangential to review scores not every game that has fun gameplay mechanics should be an 810 interestingly enough peggle and its gameplay loop of hitting that game feel was cited by bethesdas todd howard as what he looks for in games might explain the changes made to skyrim from everything to character progression to combat to radiant quest generation always giving you an excuse to go out and always getting a level up in something i like that youre thinking about this stuff but by the end of the video im feeling really confused about what falls under the gamefeel umbrella for you it seems like you jump from the idea that good gamefeel can make you happy to things that make you happy are manipulating you with dopamine to lootbox animations release your dopamine and are thus part of the gamefeel conversation in my mind at least theres a clear difference between responsive and satisfying gameplay moving mario around in super mario 64 rage 2s fps mechanics and a package of sounds and animations used as a reward marios flourish when he gets a star lootbox opening sounds and animations might be a candy coating on the gameplay that makes it feel even better but how mario can move around obstacles creatively while retaining his momentum is the core of why sm64 feels good to play its still fun when you strip away the art and sound and any other source of emotional manipu between rage and the current wolfenstein series why is it so hard to generate actual humor in a bmoviegrindhouse aesthetic you say the momenttomoment gameplay feels good but does it does the momenttomoment gameplay of looting a place after youve cleared it feel good does the gameplay of traveling between points of interest feel good does talking to npcs feel good a different way of looking at it is that they polished the gunplay experience but theres a lot of game here and only a small part of it is gunplay with the rest not feeling that great this is as much a valid choice as polishing the npc interaction and looting while only having perfunctory gunplay and travel systems but the lack of polish in core gameplay elements is something that should be called out no matter which elements those are lol content warning transphobic slur ive spent 1500 hours into destiny and destiny 2 purely because the game feel and shootbang felt so good but in no way will i defend the earlier years of those games and will admit that they were bad games before they improved it sounds very michael bay transphobic actually grimaced reminds me of the opposite nier which has mediocre combat but excellent story and characters i think it depends on personal interest and how goodbad something is for example some people play bloodborne for the fun and never get into the story or characters and other people the opposite and some inbetween i suppose it is easier to make a dopamine loop game than a good story characters and fun game that does not depend on exploiting that loophole of the human brain made a mistake you listed fire emblem fates as a source when thats actually fire emblem heroes you used as a clip i think its important to remember that the emotional manipulation of art games like gone home are not any less artificial than the dopamine drip of action games like doom or rage maybe this is why ive been more interested in traditional games lately kinaesthetics is such a better term though rage 2 is completely generic it lost hardcore industrial feel of the first one and it has worse driving than mad max and also over designed upgrade system clearly taking some lessons from george lucas on character naming if theres a rage 3 the mutants should rise up and be a faction u can work for 3 and stop the barbaric practice of mutant kill tv wow this hit me right in the feels now i freaking love game feel i am literally writing my thesis about it so i might be slightly biased but to me the argument youre making here seems similar to the notion that just because music sounds good and makes you bop your head to it it doesnt mean that the music is well made however that has a slightly snobby aftertaste to it it seems to suggest that games have to have some deeper academic purpose to be good while its true that the catchiest earworm of the summer rarely displays the most technical mastery of musicproduction or instrumentplaying there is still some quality to it making something that sounds good or feels good to play is also a skill and that should be recognized even if a game just feels good to play and the rest is shit for a lot of people yourself included apparently that is enough id love to hear your thoughts on this to summarize the game sux but gun shoot good but just because gun do a good shoot doesnt mean the game is good funny how rage 2 lead you to examine your unexamined thoughts on game feel but not your absurd unexamined thoughts on story and theme in games gameplay is the most important story and setting are just marketing shame rage 2 looks and feels so unlike the first one just make a new thing instead of sequel if you want to do something different this just ruins the potential bobby tackle in i have no agency and i must puke i love how self reflexive you are about your own criticism really its an admirable trait good review looking forward to outer wilds part 2 a lot of devs struggle to make character deaths impactful some wellmeaning writer will stick in a blurb this is your stepbrother who adopted you from a pile of elephant dung he taught you everything you know and the depth of your emotional connection knows no bounds then an animator will show you some gruesome death sequence we go into slow motion and the voice actor gives it all theyve got nooooo the person i theoretically love more than anyone else nooooooooo furious sobbing and you just go kay then whats next its like a narrative uncanny valleythe words are wording the people are peopling the music is musicaland it resembles emotional storytelling just enough to ring incredibly hollow perhaps you have to get to know someone through gameplay before losing them feels like anything at all thats certainly how final fantasy does it losing a party member means losing a meaningful function as well as a bobblehead on the screen gamefeel can by itself be enough for a game itself to be fun but its only 1 of several game mechanics that can make up a game a game can be good with a good feeling game as long as there is nothing else to it tetris is a fun game and it has pretty good gamefeel but lacks anything else rage 2 has good gamefeel but also has a lot of other things which detracts from it if those things has been tossed aside for a barebone arena shooter with nothing else to it it would probably have been better less can be more but if youre going for more then you better make sure all aspects works anything that doesnt will actively detract from the game ive also played games with absolutely amazing stories that i would never recommend to anyone because the gameplay itself was absolute poop if the story had been a book or a visual novel id be much more inclined to call it good but the bits that didnt work ie everything else was so bad it detracted too much from what was game feel is the most important part of the game period just as the greatest story with poor pacing would be boring to watch a game with bad gamefeel is unsaveable which is why nier automata is a hit meanwhile nier gestalt and drakengard 3 are not its not cause they are janky cause janky games can still have great gamefeel dark souls is an example of that or think of every jrpg thats too slow for no damn reason lets go for other examples imagine an interesting symphony played in poor midi and a simple pop song but in professional sounds or a girl portrait by kuvshinov vs some deep idea by amateur who bothed anatomy if your executiongamefeel aint on point your gamepiece of media would just be called pretentious thats about it so basically id done great job with shooty bangbang part but avalanche fuck up driving open world and plot and of course bugthesda would not be itself if single player game have no bugs and a little microtransactions another wasted potential but not that wasted as wolfenstein youngblood ughhhh but still shows problem of lack of inspiration and integrity in bethesda projects oh nooo transphobia i forgot ure white knighting a game can have the best game feel but if thats all it has i dont care anymore the first destiny anthem division rage 2 all these games have great shooting but like nothing else aside from the numbers go up which is a waste of time 844 dag satan means hello satan in dutch this whole video is an utterly specious argument how would you even define a good game outside of a person enjoying their time playing said game as if theres some objective higher standard of artistic merit that must be met in order for something to be considered good dumb but fun isnt a good enough standard to meet i enjoy the moment to moment gameplay leading to i enjoy this game leading to this game is good is absolutely valid even if storylines and treatment of certain characters is under baked even if the potential is there for the developers to do something more i feel like you passed by the articles that made you think more critically about game feel real fast could you link to some of them in the description why is no one talking about the gamefeel im still bummed they just sort of gave up on megatextures after they couldnt get them working quite right for rage that games look still hasnt been matched for its thoroughly handpainted feel where you can discover unique visual details on every little crate and rock and pile of dirt rage 2 looks far more repetitive and plain closeup the technology wasnt the best choice for an fxheavy shooter where youd want fast movement lots of dynamic lighting and destructible geometry but itd be wonderful for say an adventure game that asks you to pay close attention to the world why is mama jojo transphobic i didnt play the game but scene campster shows looks fine to me some of the names remind me of mst3ks space mutiny episode dirk slabchest bruise armbar touch rustrod rage 2 to me feels like its game development and advertising were completely disconnected from one another and the games art direction was hastily changed in the postproduction phase suicide squadstyle to better reflect the hot pink tone of the andrew wk ads you loathe fun as a description id love to hear you talk more about this even though it is very subjective i still think than fun is one of the most important things for a game to make an impression on me not comedic fun but the type of fun that makes you feel that the author had fun making the game and poured a lot of heart into making it i watched a streamer play the first five minutes of the opening on mute and could tell it felt like dogshit the fact that it completely flips that later once the game actually started is a concise condemnation of the ubisoft method of starting a game 110 are those the same ghosts from the 1st rage that aint no rage 2 its a quake 5 i remember seeing this live when the stream got hacked keith flint looks fresh so this game is a waste of money then cause its boring whats the song in the first part first one was a huge let down less then 20hrs to complete an open world rpg rubbish i literally have never played rage or know anything about it but this entire trailer just looks like a borderlands 3 ripoff rage 2 might be good when they get around to actually finishing it because right now its a boring pile of half finished areas and lame driving segments this looks more like a ubisoft game well ok then not gonna complain then what happened to the nintendo music that was in the e3 presentation i heard wii shop channel isle delfino and megalovania this game was already fucking awesome and this is gonna make it like 10x better especially with that mech i am so hyped i dont get why ive seen people suggest that everyone hates rage 2 people love it 121 octane from apex legends what happen to the sans music no one really cares about this what the game is already out the things that cliff has seen sorry bethesda this was a sad excuse for a game and i guarantee that elder scrolls will suffer for ur continued support of a franchise that no one asked for all i needed was mechs and im sold was on the fence and the end note about doomfarcry vs fallout helped a lot thanks all if you have epilepsy or are prone to migraines you should probably lay off the video games dont blame rage 2 blame your compromised gene pool i love listening to these two review games you can tell they both really know and love videogames that made me fest quetch i got bored really quick and stopped playing it the graphics are nice and the ais are good rage 2 the game nobody asked for after playing rage 1 i had the same reaction at the leak why oh why bugthesda of all your possible brands why this one was releasing the first one not bad enough do you really need another kick in your balls well i buy it after its down to 5 bucks like i bought the first one well at least it wont turn the frogs gay find the dead ranger that gives you the icurus and it makes the game far easier to get around its almost like cheating i dont understand why people are not boycotting bethesda after ruining the fallout series congrats u managed to put 3 year jaded sjw propaganda in the outro and ruin it wow all they say about the weaposn sounds like oen thing for me sunset overdrive best game ever for how short it is so much fun editors could you please tone down the game sounds and music throughout the review so it doesnt drown out what the reviewers are saying if you want to showcase the games sound maybe add some breaks between alannah and law dogs sentences and have snippets of full volume game highlights otherwise great review guys this game looks real fun maybe level the audio a bit that was a really solid and entertaining review hell yea i tried backwards compatible rage on xbox one and had that same issue alanah mentioned alanah and lawrence inside gamings most beautiful ppl allanah looking fly as always so basically its better to buy bulletstorm a sequel that nobody asked for to a 9 year old game that nobody remembers i will buy every rage that comes out in the future it was dumb and fun and that has value to me i keep hearing the sequel no one asked for but fuck that noise rage 1 was an incredibly endearing game the whole thing just begged to be streamlined and improved in a sequel its really a shame it took so long and was set in such a farted out open world the combat is fantastic my personal biggest gripe is the writing at first i wasnt skipping dialogue but now about 12 way through i just skip all dialogue because of how annoyingly written the characters are the driving is a bit rigid as well which is weird considering how good rage 1s driving was sorry guys but you make the worst review this game is just fun plain and simple this is a grossly underrated masterpiece so much fun and greatly nuanced gameplay this game will only be not liked if you suck lawrence charalanazard i luff yew bouf kish meh babies driving was such a chore in this even the devs hated it and included a gyrocopter that lets you fly over the landscape and skip whole areas and pointless copy paste stuff also stop using the car the minute you get the icarus gyrocopter it makes getting around 100x times easier you can just basically take a b line directly to wherever you wanna go ngl this game is an absolute cake walk on hard if you have played fps games for any significant amount of you with be shocked by how easy the hard difficulty is in this game and as you play through the game and get more powers and upgrades it just gets easier and easier well thats a good review thanks can we get fest quetch on a shirt with alanahs face on it that was just super funny and i want it to be a thing lol love you guys lawrence please tell me where i can get you bat shirt lol she looks just like laurence his sister i loved the first rage and when i was playing and i heard no one liked it i was butt hurt that they wouldnt be a second one sooooooooo i pissed my pants when i saw the second one coming out good to see alanah back after the car crash love alanha hope i spelled that correctly but is it just me or does she look really tired hopefully she isnt working to long and hard it can really take a toll on you i know 6 days a week 10 14 hours a day i used to work for years then you kind of just crash im 35 5 kids busy job my game time is carefully considered and im telling you this game is fun as hell no story really but its fun i didnt get bored and i never experienced it feeling any more repetitive than every other open world game the game is fun as someone who gets all the games and moves on too quickly to the next rage 2 has my undivided attention when i first started it i didnt have enough time to get into it so i was just getting a feel for the game and it was an annoying ass tutorial finished that and got to drive around in the open world for a minute or 2 before i had to go my immediate thought was this is mad max and that it would be fun at first and get old by my first day playing like id see everything the game had to offer in 8 hours then i sat down to give it my full attention and i am let down but not as badly as i thought i would be my reaction to the game before it released was astonishment i thought it would be an amazing game its not it feels like mad max doom and fallout 4 all combined while being mentored by borderlands 2 im enjoying the game its keeping me interested but it feels like it could have been fucking amazing this looks like one of those gender swap apps i can hear everything man alanah attitude is shitty compared to lawrence he really seems exited to share his review these two choads i want to use that gun i need a migraine its fucking easy on hard after 2 hours and how do you fucking complete it in 20 hours and still not be done i have literally done everything in 11 the game is far too short everything you need to know is plainly on the cover a craaaaaaazy character is screaming and holding a large gun but if you look closely her finger isnt on the trigger or the handle and the butt of gun is tucked into her crotch the game only runs at 60 fps on the xbox one x and ps4 pro the other ones its at 30 fps ya domb review persona i didnt hear them mention that the icarus is an air vehicle that gets unlocked very early so you can basically avoid car combattravel altogether minus two separate times that it is relevant to the story it also automatically adjusts altitude so you dont crash or die in it unless you try to cross a chasm you still follow the map the icarus honestly helped me overlook the open world traversal via a car because it got me from a to b so fast that the adrenaline of moment to moment combat didnt dwindle too quick wish they would have experienced that or mentioned it at all i think the game is pretty outstanding in terms of open world yeah i will probably actually finish this one unlike red dead 2 or the recent assassins creeds going to put up a vid displaying how easy combat is on normal obviously it may be a mild challenge on max there is no requirement to use any powers alternate weapons or speed than walking with the pistol i literally walked through the first few missions and bosses and killed almost all enemies in a couple shots with the pistol maybe a couple clips for bosses if you really force yourself to use abilities i suppose it could be fun but it just feels so one sided and easy on default which is generally what devs expect most people to play on and tune accordingly great video i think the music is a little low i got to the open world part and stopped at the trade truck fell through the map and died then my car glitched and i couldnt get it back im enjoying the game i agree with most of the things said here i did however find a glitch right after i got into the car the first time where as soon as i got to a bridge where someone wanted to race i accepted and he drove right off the bridge and i won but the glitch came in when i could sit there and start the race over and over again and win every time and get the rewards of 50 and one auto part every time i stopped cuz i feel it would really ruin the game if i just had millions of dollars and thousands of auto parts but besides that im enjoying it for me any game i play after sekiro instantly seems better music not loud enough 57 046 the elevator panel stays behind while the rest of the lever moves up ill wait for doom ty im sad that alanah will always be tired for the rest of her life rage 2 sucks when i get the black screen and constant audio bug yea this game is what i wanted as a shooter but the story isnt there they introduce some cool characters that you will literally interact with twice throughout the game and there is no narrative for the side content its just clearing location after location without your character saying a word smoke a bunch of weed if you have migraines if i may ask as someone who doesnt know anything about rage why is the idea of rage 2 being specifically a sequel a strange thought i thought the audio was fine but rewatched for that sweet sweet ad money not worth 60 about 8 quests and empty world the rest will come with expansions milk the customer as much as possible wait for it to be 25 or less i love how you two review games its not like the rest of the market where you write a long flowing script to hit on all the points you liked and disliked which in of itself is fine rather this feels more like youre back in highschool again talking to your friends about all the awesome games you played over the summer break it feels more natural to me not to mention more personal and engaging without a narrator holding your hand throughout the video great job guys d i fucking love the reviews made by alanah and lawrence i mostly like the game but one thing driving me crazy is you have all these nano powers this high tech ranger suit and you dont have any sort of flashlight or anything some of the interior environments especially at night are just absolutely pitch black this review was so boring interesting glad you guys at least acknowledged the good parts of this game too many people just crapped on it which is not fair i feel you with the following sekiro is rough comment its been very difficult for me to appreciate other games after getting the sekiro platinum that game is ingrained in my senses i feel sorry for all the people that bought this for 60 bucks so heres a brief review the game gets really good once you start unlocking abilities from arks i was disappointed by how much shooting there is i know it is a shooter but i was hoping it woul favor the powers more i wanted what the game was marketed as i wanted to be a wasteland superhero so basically its a physics game disguised as a shooter yay alanah good to see out in the wild again idk looks boring to me i cant pinpoint it but i did not like how doom feltplayed and this looks exactly the same just not very fun it has everything in place to be fun and it should be but doesnt feel fun all these reviews seem to say the same thing really good gunplay and combat but a bunch of open world quirks whittle down what enjoyment there is or was mad max was exquisite rage 1 was awesome at the time different but fun rage 2 great gun play but boring story in 1 was interesting 2 is whatever did alanah play more than a quarter of the game this time freaking open worlds one of the best recent games is doom specifically because it was so well crafted one of the worst games me andromeda failed partly because it ditched the excellent environments of the other me games whose most annoying parts were having to run around maps and open worlds open world works a lot better for rpgs but man rage 2 its the first game but slightly better i always have problem to understand what u are saying the way u modulate the speed and a lot of words make me the work more harder english is not my leguage but i can uderstand very well when im listening so just saying may be if u use compression on ur sound all the thing turns more clear also thers to much reberv sound like u are very far awaty speak more close to ther mic turn the music up best part is being put in a box and being told how to left click internet people are annoying they always complain about something aww his leg is to large i didnt cry to the story i had to think to play the the girls hair is to short i agree to everything alanah said about the open world that was my exact interaction with the open world the music keeps bothering in the background who thought that it was a good idea in the first place i prefer the first game the combat is novel only if one hasnt played bulletstorm ill pick this up at 20 the game feels unfinished sites are repeated with a story that no one cares about weapons feel good along with controls frame rate issues on consoles locked at 30fps pc version fluctuates between 5060fps at times fest quetch i heard it too many lushious lips must hold back urges bethesda and their baffling high regional pricing on steam this time for all regions in india for same 5999 vampire bloodlines 2 rs 1299 rage 2 rs 3999 its more than three times dont buy it wasted my money hey what happened to the loud music that was the best part wut i thought alanah died from chronic fatigue this game reminds me a lot of red faction guerrilla although it admittedly has less in the way of destructible environments but the open world design and the driving definitely seem similar each other comparison is spot on too ie doom mad max etc though id also add that the game feels a little like destiny in the sense that youre wielding a few superpowers while juggling two guns of which you can swap to your others you only get to use 2 at a time one major criticism i have is that i hate the pause menu setup because of the stupid static splash effect they put in between the menu tabs it actively slows down the transition between each one so badly that ive legit thought my console crashed when swapping pages its a wholly unnecessary feature that really slows down the pace of play to a grinding halt considering you have to use the it for inventory skills the map and more i really hope they patch that out asap i should add that imho if you dig id shooters ig is so petty with their reviews rage2 is a good game and isnt supposed to be taken serious it is a kick ass fps similar to doom2016 but with a open world the game is fucking awesome open world doom with no microtransaction bullshit a very rare treat these days that 914 lawrence smile was perfect so you can go anywhere or is it open world in a sense like mgs5 really wide roads connected to each other i guess my eardrums are all fucked up because i watched the original video and didnt notice the loud music is alanah standing on a box or something the music is too low lol the background music still feels kinda loud and overpowering i really wish they added a little bit of strafe jumping or bunny hopping aspect of quake to fps mode alanah fits the team well an actual gamer and a good journalist i mean i hate to say it but it also doesnt hurt that shes gorgeous with a great accent too also where in the fuck is ashley did i miss something game is super fun really enjoying it 2 reviews it must be good all about the fest quetch i can always use more la and law in my life thanks guys thank you for pointing out how much there is to appreciate in this game great observations you two observations of reviews i was sitting on the fence about this one but i think ill do a rage 1 play through and by the end of that buy rage 2 also the open world observations reminds me of mass effect 1 andromeda journey of the open world and how it had come to be treated through each one and were reflections of development focus hopes realities theyve opened the field that could be the foundations for ow investments later either in this life cycle or most likely the 3rd if the returns warrant that risk makes it clear that as the teams pieced together their strengths that ids designs on shooting are some of the strongest provided by studios and by contrast the opensidestory development the lop side look forward to making my own observations of the game that dyslexic australian though ahhh much better thank you why did they reupload it but does it have a title card rage wanted to be bulletstorm full clip edition can you re upload with music a tad bit louder thank you alanah always seems bummed like she doesnt wanna be there ten years from now this game will be considered a hidden gem so as someone who actually liked rage one this is probably going to be enjoyable i take it still too loud wtf who is messing this up wasnt this up earlier its the poor mans doom wolfenstein good but not great i want to comb her hair didnt i watch this last night lol law dog with that reupload fun gameplay but boring story mediocre game great story but boring gameplay goty what has gaming become i put about 17 hours into rage 2 my emotional reaction is to give it a 4 out of 10 since the lows were so fucking low but the combat can be too good to ignore so for me that pushes it to a 510 at best honestly feels like an unfinished game and it just ends unceremoniously part of me wanted them to reupload the review with even louder music this game would have been better if it was linear i think does reuploading it make it a rereview i think its a pretty good game ive played for about 3 hours and i find it fun thank you for the audio fix d seems to me like the bright neon colors are so forced in doesnt seem like great world design i dont mind darker more drab worlds with less color last of us or super colorful worldssunset overdrive but those worlds give a certain feeling that seems so intended this game just looks like a poor doom recolor bit goofy i heard the game combat is the only fun thing i didnt care about rage 1 then i saw the colour run trailer for rage 2 and was likenooooope whos the old lady reuploaded and the music is still crazy loud haha why yhe reupload lacks story open world content but fun gunplay 6510 why was it reuploaded it was fine before now its too quiet i dont think this game deserve more attention music not loud enough please reupload as soon as i finished the video it got reuploaded hmmm wonder why it was reuploaded alanah pierce is a good host yeah thought that loud ass music was a mistake much more watchable now what is the new audio rage 2 is giving me so much rage im the first comment loved the game but hate it because of a glitch where i cannot finish the actual game when im at the authority head base my tank gets blown up to shreds by immortal turrets cant wait to play just saying tho should have had jesse playing it in el camino lol tvma v l for the game i think bethesda and id are my favorite and who else like there joice of music for this trailer here is a free bethesda game rage 2 key 2re73b9mn76h9mx7ug3e you can get the game on bethesda site not steam have a nice day bad game bad trailer but the editing or trailer directing team would make a half decent movie like lmao they were aware that the rage 1 end was bad so they made a dlc this trailer is so fucking amazing this is the game ive been waiting for since games went from 2d to 3d thank you sooooooo much avalanche and id i give rage 2 a full 150 score of 1310 from me cant wait for new dlc best game ever from the heart this is like the best trailer ever made anyone know the background soundtrack bio shock meets madmax borderlands wth more gory realistic graphics pretty much to be honest in the category of games not for me this looks not bad im usually not into killzone fallout monster alien goofy ass games but with the mad max racing in there and the halflife 2 looking abilities i dunno id get it someday if its on sale same company that made fallout 76 okayyyy that was pretty sick love it please tell me that the female va for walker is better because this one is not good oh its already out thats good for it they wont get obliterated by borderlands 3 does this story relate in any way to the first rage very creative trailer worth to watch even this humor i am getting tire of tho it looks like a parody of rage 1 bethesda lets put all the bad words in the trailer kids like edge roooight italian gameplay on my channel so it is doom with humor okay this likes it might kill 10 minutes of my timeim not hoding my breath though we may have finally found a way to have emmy award winning sam riegel play emmy award winning sam riegel within the context of a video game i would like to rage too general cross looks like darth vader without his mask thanks for 1080p 30fps trailer glad to feel like its 2009 again if the game is anything like the writing for this trailerim in anyone else not notice this game launched jesus they where quite about it and they expect to sell lots of copies lmao how many paid influencers are in this comment section right now bethesdas involved this is going to be a trainwreck calling it now i am really digging all of the cleft palates in this game that is the weirdest trailer ive ever seen haha bethesda is something else love the part about rage 1 ending bl3 is gonna kick this gamess ass lol turok is that you i cant see well without ma glasses lol ripping off bioshock now huh low man thats low for shame though i will still play it looks like a lovechild of bioshock and borderlands so whats the game about xd hahah what rage couldshould have been im excited rage or outer worlds hmmmmm both maybe so im taking a break from rage 2 deluxe edition to take a break to get some sleep before school and i was wondering if anyone knew how to getredeem the dlc stuff dlc season pass inc after they get enough pre order x woah woah woah woah hold up you can get the bfg 9000 in this game why then again why not i love it mad max doom fallout 4 colors from far cry new dawn rage 2 710 game informer unfortunately after just cause 4 i thought there was reason to be skeptical of codevelopment with avalanche studios still reserving judgment on this rage was utterly forgettable and im not so sure theyre not just riding on the coattails of games like borderlands and saints row and a couple of other franchises that went from serious to goofy with their sequels slow video down 218 before man there was cat and lollipop funny how ubisoft can sell the same recycled farcry assets yearly and calling it a new revolutionary game in the franchise 215 is that far cry primal bethesda what happened to the outerworld thing is bl3 is announced so yeh hype steal so bethesda liked borderlands a lot great launch trailer a game thats aware of itself ive pre ordered should arrive tomorrow definitely one of the best launch trailers ive seen really didnt expect how it turned out i demand to be a part of this community hope this game is not about only big bada bum and also there will be some interesting atmosphere and feel of postapocaliptic universe nice spoil the last level in 15 seconds now im even less excited for this game so what about doom eternal i dont know what to say just wow wtf i mean i watch game trailers up to this point only once no need to watch them again i already see what i wanted to see however this is literally the first time ever iv watched a game trailer more than once as of right now watched it 5x from start to end the trailer is so well made the mix of irony action and silliness is just amazing plus how it keept going back in time more and more it is just a great trailer i am sure some will watch it not knowing much about it and just buy it cause of the trailer i am for sure one of them i actually hated rage 1 played it for a few hrs but couldnt get into it and quiet so i should be one of the few who would be skeptical about a 2nd rage game and here i am watching the trailer and i am sold i will buy it when it is out on steam awesome trailer music hope we get new trailer soundtracks soon watched a whole rage 2 trailer just to realise at the end it was an ad for this rage 2 trailer i wonder if they have improved the vehicle mechanics yeeeah after all the bethesda drama about fallout76 etc im not touching this with a 10 foot pole the 1st month of twitch streaming and reviews will be the decider most likely a bait trailer and then the gameplay is pure zzzzz after 2 hrs it cant be worse then days gone carmack leaving and hiring tiago sousa to replace him was the best thing to happen to id software in over a decade suddenly all of their ips are better in large part thanks to id tech 6 which takes a steaming dump all over id tech 5 thanks mr sousa carmack leaving also helped bring about an attitude change within the studio regarding overall game experience since carmack mostly just viewed the games as tech demos for his engines that stopped being good after id tech 3 why this game looks like doom 023 its rewind time i cant wait to play this the player will probably die at the end sorry to spoil but the trailer shows it itself and interesting game trailer ever i had see hey i like cuss words a game to the fucking point that thanos snap tho buying it this is how you make a cool commercial mirage that you i dont often say this but what an awsome trailer seriously this is the best game launch trailers ive ever seen wherever i see bethesda i get worried i hope this game will be good this is how you do a trailer right i hope this is not like fallout 76 bethesda please dont mess this up i sure hope this game sells really well it feels like this would be more preferable than borderlands 3 considering how shit battleborne was and all randy and 2k going mad i mean 2k had always been shit but gearbox this reminds me of a game that voice is that sam riegel anyone thinking this looks like borderlands rebranded or is that just me not a bad thing though only game trailer i watched twice sam riegel is everything getting a real borderlands feel and i love it 2 borderlands games in 1 year if only rage 2 had coop wair for a sale 10 the beginning reminds me of welyn every game looks the same its sam the cube riegel hell yes a is for acid wow damn this is such an original idea lets just copy borderlands when doom and deadpool have a baby together where is the trailer i saw in an advertisement it was also like 2min long its saints row its not rage sorry carnack lol who even are these guys waiting this game it wouldve been so much better if at the start teenage wasteland baba oriley plays and walker says yup thats me youre probably wondering how i got here bro thats the voice of spiderman in the ps4 game i already have something similar esthetic to play while i wait for cyberpunk 2077 i hope the soundtrack kicks ass awesome trailer so good i dont even feel the need to play the game now tbh deliberate selfshaming take my money who even are you along with everyone else im really liking the tonal shift toward ballstothewall insanity and rule of cool there are enough apocalypse games that takes itself seriously already lets get some more games like sunset overdrive where the main focus isnt about gritty survival or the nature of man but being a futhermucking badass with some crazy weapons idk theyre trying too hard for this game to be memeable to the point that it become cringy one of the most insane trailers that i saw i wonder how bethesda might mess up rage 2 honestly this game cant take itself seriouslyi love it and a to the marketing team for the rage 1 ending callback grampa from spy kids 2 is back now that is how you make a game trailer i didnt see his parents having sex fail did no one see the cheat codes you get if you pre order wtf the humour is so cringey the gameplay looks sick but tone it back because i dont know if i could stand walker talking like that for the entire game this is how you make your launch trailer stand out great job excited about this that was the single best launch trailer for a game ever im so wanna buy this game but man plague taleinnocence looking good too now this is how you make a trailer looks bad and rushed will it have the same human defibrillator thing from the first one best trailer ive seen in a long time im counting the minutes already now this is a sick trailer in a long time i dont get it why do you make games most of the people absolutely hatedand sincerely it looks boring bethesda better not fuck this up but it still looks promising i play right now game is here awwww shit here we go again insert cj walking thanks walmart this game looks sick i love it cant wait man just a few more days that was some really cringey voiceover doom 2016 but with open world thats good bethesda recycling things dont throw them away sarcasm hopefully it wont bomb like fallout 76 did lol why is darth vader in the thumbnail caustic and mirage break the universe zenimax is my last hope in anything bethesda at the end make me laugh so hard wtf is with all the shooters trying to go fortnight with the color palets did we lose all sense of what is unique do i need to play the first one before this one cause i dont want to i want to jump straight into this one totally forgot about this is even coming lol d lol who even are you waiting for microtransactions to ruin this franchise too and pay 20 more if you want to play the bfg go to hell greedy bethesda reminds me of destiny what a great trailer who thinks up this stuff damn that was awesome proordered d in 3 days omg i need this deluxe edition lets go cross finally i too remember the first time i learned how to cuss pretty sure thats is darth vader without his mask from return of the jedi the sequel we never wanted but desperately deserve im so getting this im about to rage quit on this game honest to god i was going to ignore this game but this trailer that callback to the rage 1 ending has convinced me otherwise any company willing to make fun of their own shit is respect in my books im getting it still not preordering though when ign says its good you know they have been paid to say that kind of feel like rage 2 is going to flop like its predecessor itll try too hard to be funny and end up not funny at all sick trailer though wow the fourth wall breaking is hilarious and shoutout to that andrew wk performance from e3 that was sick im loving how aware the team is for rage 1s criticisms in fact that was the reason i decided to preorder well that and getting a wingstick in real life im playing days gone right now and as much as im surprisingly loving it despite thinking it looked generic in trailers i look forward to just being able to have some fun in rage 2 i mean i love storydriven games the most but damn is days gone draining my energy with how stressful it is my only problem with rage 2 is the second expansion its a shame to see that the game is only giving away one expansion with the deluxe edition that means that rise of the ghosts will have to really blow me away if they want me to pay for another expansion separately you got to love sam riegel yall mofos outdid ur self im really hoping the easy going comedy stuff is actually in the game and not just the trailer frickin awesome thats how you make a video game trailer finally a good looking game and amazing trailer but what did happen to the guy from the first game lets hope its good now this is called rage 2 because of doom 1 just ignore all logic when reading this most promising shooter of 2019 hang on now i love rage as much as the next person but wouldnt go as far as say most promising lets hope they dont fuck up like fallout 76 everything is gay pink cant wait to mod this and remove this shit away yetthe first rage is better i guess rage creator break the 4th wall didnt even know this was a bathesda game well looks like ill be skipping it so glad i decided to watch this trailer i never do but honestly stick around to the end if youre just scrolling the comments right now this will definitely be the next game i get the onething im worried about is tying in the original story i feel thats where im going to be let down so ready for this looks better than most triple a games now a days it rewind time everybody besides the ending i really enjoyed the first rage this should hold me over quite nicely til borderlands 3 general cross sort of looks like the dude from warframe anyone familiar with the rage serie can you tell me something about that game it looks like mad max mixed with borderlands on drugs look at all the sponsored commenters too bad most people arent giving bethesda any more rope to hang us out to dry with bye bye bethesda we are not borderlands the game now thats hot isis that sam riegal who is the voice actor he sounds so familiar take my money stop my penis can only get so erect this looks terrible one of the best fps of the year this and doom eternal will best fps cant wait id will show evryone again how to make a good fps cant wait to kill them all at max settings 1440p 30 fps my monster pc is ryzen 7 1700 gtx 970 g1 gaming 16 gb ddr4 3200mhzcl15 gs kill rip jaws dellp2416d 24 2560x1440 60hz ips why do launch trailers come out days before release i remember when launch trailers came out a day before release im one of few people that loved the first rage waited for a sequel ever since looked like it wasnt in the cardsthen it finally happened the first game i pre ordered this year cant wait looks badass i was hoping for ozzy man to show up was it just me im seeing tons of rage 1 players hyped for this but to my eyes this looks like a really sad attempt at stealing borderlands 3 thunder i dont know any of these injokes because rage 1 wasnt what i would call a hit and proudly displaying a gameinformer review doesnt help matters seeing as how that magazine was created by gamestop to give all its games a good score 137 reminds me voice of doc mitchell from fallout nv he thanos snaps at 128 still not preordering but nice try though now this is a game look like the main antagonist off of halo 4 not thats what we called a trailer im gonna hold my breath and blow up when i hear epic exclusive borderlands 3 and 4 relase in one year how its real i didnt see a jojo reference so heres mine kidda qween bites za dusto yeah after the shitstorm that was 76 and that being my first bethesda game im not stepping anywhere near this one screw bethesda i cant ignored this i cant rage 2 tuesday here we come my xbox one x rejoices boohoo was it only may 14 already promising shooter yes most and of 2019 diddid you guys forget about doom eternal so borderlands advanced warfare that is to be the most original trailer i have seen in a while its fallout 76 but good one i hope the game is as absurd as the trailer and while i agree the criticism the first game got it still was a fun game that had me waiting for a sequel every time i tried to get into rage 1 i would only get about a quarter of the way in before getting bored kinda want to give it another chance cuz this looks pretty fun ngl general cross is just general knoxx from borderlands 1 im on to you fuckers seriously though great trailer what if you actually liked rage 1 minus the ending of course the bold dude looks like michael ironsides character in the 80s scifi film spacehunter adventures in the forbidden zone this is a genuine film look it up it does look fun to play you cant lie so 20 for cheat codes hyping a average looking game up and defends the game as if they are video game geniuss no pvp no buy two weeks u play there is nothing else to do boring goty come on let go wtf i really loved rage 1 is is that sam riegel i hear lol this is how you hype your fan base and bring new ppl been proud of your product and knowing the mistakes of the past wish todd was watching this trailer and come from hide and admitted the travesty of fallout 76 is this going to be another anthem flop wait so we can choose what gender walker is nice sneak peak i dont even play shooters and i want this crazy ass game like what hell is happening well giant dunelike worm is totally worth waiting this is what i called a good quality trailer i will buy it play until borderlands 3 will be released on steam then we will see looks great cannot wait to try it cant wait for this game where are all the sexy girls the real borderlands 3 well since borderlands wont be on steam your road is kinda clear s class marketing team right there do i hear the mellifluous tones of sam riegel so you pull a thanos move on enemiesyou can throw them away and becomedust and more this mothafucka here needs to win the goty general cross is just walmart brand general knoxx the only problem is its bethesda again ill pass this one now i just hope they can redeem themselves with this title the first one was a buggy mess that crashed all the time i want it to be good need another good game to play after all the failure weve had lately not gonna lie i dont think anyone asked for this game but its looking pretty good all of you are going to be highly disappointed game already looks robotic no fluid motions no interesting gun play just very turn left turn right shoot youll ne disappointed also its bethesda a company that refuses to update themselves for the 7 years or more lol dont be hyped be weary and wait for reviews dont be impulsive everyone thought anthem looked great because of the trailers if you want proof bethesda is the same does anyone remember the game fallout 76 yeahsave your money and wait for reviews amazing trailer guys cant wait to play this love how you put this all together i will be pissed if i grapple a guy to a empty tank but it doesnt make that thud sound it better if this game had multiplayer online could be the most brutal game of this era this looks interesting but i never played the first one can i still jump in would love to play as a power ranger mutilating things lol is that sam riegals voice thats how you make a trailer hype watch ign give it a 65 its interesting how this game tries so hard at being funny and actually succeeds cool thing is they acknowledged their fails on the first 1 this game looks like is gonna be awesome dont think bethesda can be valued for the fallout 76 error they are the fathers of fps they are even the team id not only zenimax they know how to fps rage will be more close to doom or wolfenstein it will be different than the first rage just another failure game will be fun play it for an hour to become boring and repetitive af the team that put together this trailer deserves a gold star this better hold me occupied until bl3 its rewind time i hope avalanche studios doesnt downgrade the graphics like their othet games that smug cliff awaits us all when you do better far cry and borderlands than the actuals devs in 1 game lol hmmm looks promising but bethesda keeps me from hyping just yet i loved this trailer very unique just because of this trailer im going to buy the first game and preorder the second one they keep saying ranger so im expecting that im a power ranger in this game this game is gonna be awesome bfg9000 as an extra thx but no thx they do rewind time correctly take that youtube its so weird to recognize the voice of sam riegal like its easy to forget that in spite of being a very popular dnd podcaster he has a day job 232 really a bfg 9000 i dont know why but i here doomguy angry from far away bethesda should sit back and let id do the talking there track record of late has been terrible cant believe they put a twitter screenshot in a gameplay trailer xd this looks good so far but the fact this is bethesdas product made me uneasy after that whole 76s fiasco im gonna wait till more reviews coming out before considering to buy and definitely wont preorder that was actually kind of funny is that old darth vader in the beginning doom borderland and cyberpunk combined did pucci made this trailer for resetting the universe or what i wont be buying day 1 but i have to ha d it to them that was a badass launch trailer borderlandsis that you 218 god is a cat confirmed looks pretty sick rage 2 is more borderlands than borderlands and im fine with that i agree with the trailer the ending to the first rage game was lame af made me so mad i hope they dont troll the same way with the second one okay that rewinding bit is whats making me buy this game thank your fucking marketing team you better be slobbering all over their knobs is it the same voice from buck of space run so its doom and mad max with a more talkative character game looks fun but it looks like it would be even more fun coop to bad its not complete game walkthrough in 248 minutes 056 tony stark and johnny cage has a baby ohhh thats hot thats hot wellim gonna rewind it too cant stop watching it man these guys sure knows how to make a trailer like a mix of far cry 3 blood dragon and doom love it anyone notices the girl in selection character gender like the girl in outer worlds lol getting deadpool vibes here game looks amazing i was a big fan of the original rage too only think i didnt like was the ending dont blow my mind this trailer really went off the rails by 150 lmao i live for this shit cmon tuesday avalanche studios we are screwed i shit you notii preordered it wait is thyre character selection in here one of the best funny trailers i ever seen that character in the thumbnail looks like either rod ferguson or bill murray lol such a beautiful post apocalyptic world but i have the decent feeling that there is nothing interesting to find i hope for preapocalypse lore or maybe just something that lets us know what the world was like before the asteroid rage 1 was very boring in that part funny fancy shooting at colorfull bosses might be funny but hope there is more why using a postapocalyptic seeting if they dont wanna tell anything about what the worlt was before sick trailer since when you play as ryan reynolds im rage sorry borderlands rage is looking waaay fresher than you cringy conclusion to the trailer but the game seems great that self awareness though why you spoiling this game nice gamemust have it both 12 sam is that you ive never played rage but now im interested general crossdarth vader in return of the jedi john marston is that your voice thats a freaking awesome trailer i didnt know i play as deadpool i gonna buy this just because its not a epicrap exclusive d take my bumba clott money great trailer i cant wait to play this i thought this was gonna be a jojo shit post after hearing the detonator click ngl well that was confusing doom 2ish i cant believe im actually excited about a rage sequel so basically doom in a different world a screw it ill buy it please be good i need a new game whole game is spoiled with this trailer oo thats hot thats hot if only dead as easy as this game waited all these years hoping to get the rage ending i finally deserve so im guessing its not going to be a sequel to rage 1 now bethesda will demand battle royale mode from poor id software i guess this will hold me off until borderlands 3 lol look at rage 1 and then look at rage 2 lmfao has the tone changed and for the better high five for that marketing time to begin the great chaos wait is tht sam reigal i saw wingstick again i need the game now i hope we can visit dead city again yahhhno pre orders if this game is even half as good as it looks then its going to be one of the best in the last year or so and damn can they put together a good trailer this was funny as alright bethesda youve got a ways before you get my love back from fallout 76 disaster this is a good start wheres ozzyman is this the same guy who voiced mirage from apex legends i want stealthgamerbr to play this because it looks like you can be very creative in killing enemies and we all know he is the master of this art i want a idbethesda duke nukem shows mediocre andrew wk performance from e3 2018 thanks walmart canada i hope a 3 comes out most generic looking game ever this year a dull product made for dull consumers props to the game programmers though not so much for the game designers can we just wait for 1min and admire how badass and awesome this trailer isone of the best trailer i have seen so far when this was first announced at e3 it got shat on by everybody for being irrelevant but when i come across this trailer all i see is nice rage 1 reference now this is a trailer xd cant wait i loved rage 1 i like how it went back to 2011 and then time itself lol aaah i love how us gamers can change in a snap when the teaser for rage 2 came out the live action one i remember reading all the angry comments yet look at it now so many people hyped i reeeeally want this game to do well i want to stand and salute the marketing team i was into it for the first 13 seconds i suppose the man who is entirely a robot and his endless army of gunwielding bastards arent really a serious threat after all im not listening to some smug git making references for 3 minutes sandworm live event im so getting this like if you are as well rage 2 most promising shooter of 2019 borderlands 3 hold my rakk ale that trailer likes lol odyssey cinematic 013 general knoxx will remember that this game look so fucking awesome holy shit is that sam riegel 3 that was genuinely a great trailer couldnt take your own game seriously come on so bethesda nowmakes a farcry ripoff is he going to be like spiderman sarcastically remarking at everything amazing trailer and maybe an awesome game why does the thumbnail look like vader from rotj bethesda please do not disappoint us because has female option i will play it this game is not a sexist shit one like others is that emmy winning sam regal i hear 133 parry this you fung casul welp looks like borderlands about to be scared how about doom enternal metacritic kill this game red score 75 yellow 25 green 0 not buying until i get a refund for fallout 76 thumbs up if you agree and yes i know i was dumb enough to buy it maybe better vs rage 1 but little and nating special oh man this was so goooood then i saw bethesda and all my hopes died male and female walker at 151 pretty cool 129 is that a killer queen from jojo reference jude mathis omg what a launch trailer most promising shooter of the year lol i think borderlands 3 will get that sorry gameinformer what a crap trailer is it just me or would ryan reynolds have rocked the voice and just like that i am sold that was too cliche and corny grotesque monster with a mullet im sold also the giant worm from lost planet comes back to revenge on this game wow what a great trailer also the graphics in this game look top notch hope it sells well i still remember before the original rage launched you could see jessie pinkman on breaking bad playing the game with a light gun 055 aye whats guy fieri doin here after this game there a new doom game cant wait to play it what should i get days gone or rage 2 the setting looks like that terrible game called mad max and i pray its nothing like that at all please promise me a good game im not getting suckered into all the hype ill wait for legit after release reviews then decide holy crap thats anakin on steroids best trailer of the year im sold what song in the trailer well bethesda did make doom after all ok that joke was good real good cant wait for fitgirl repack the abilities remind me of the bioshock series i am just so hyped for this game seriously dont know about the actual game yet but the trailers are fking killing it so awesome xd i was fond of rage and after these trailers im sure i will love rage 2 i got a fortnite trailer before this wow buy the delux edition and you get cheat codes a giant sand worm hopefully they are in the open world this looks sick if i was in charge of rewind id want rage and mark ass brownley doom eternal thats all very fun how theyre studio is really self aware lol i cant wait until this game comes out its like if borderlands actually decided to use its m rating instead of just using made up curse words also props to bethesda and id for owning up to the first rage ending how is kvasir still alive i love this freaking trailer this was spice this looksincredible i sure hope this game works not every deadpoolganger is going to work but bethesda really needs a game that works now especially after that f thing 76 i wasnt too hyped for this game but how can someone not get hyped after somthing like this 0400 damn vader what happened to you literally everyone hey bethesda could you work on elder scrolls vi please bethesdatom howard skyrim reboot everyone no bethesdatom howard mobile game everyone no just please work on fucking elder scrolls vi bethesdatom howard rage 2 did they just spoil the ending and a huge dune snake this games gonna be fucking awesome but i think theyre showing wayyyyy too much bfg9000 only for deluxe nd collector edition c nice concept but rage insanity can be found without monsters lasers abilitys start wars crap things other unrealistic shit i wonder when a fucking company will think normally to create something fit in our days like mad max crossout as an open world like this see the result of how many players will play it nice concept but rage insanity can be found without monsters lasers abilitys start wars crap things other unrealistic shit i wonder when a fucking company will think normally to create something fit in our days like mad max crossout as an open world like this see the result of how many players will play it first time im actually excited to try this game out game for 100 gay and dumb humor like saint row the word is already there sick from final boss all the way back to the reveal of the game itself and more years best honest trailer ive never seen people so uninterested in a triple a shooter before i love these rage 2 trailers its confirmed a cat licking a lollipop precedes life on earth i completely forgot this franchise existed justo to be remembered by this trailer that its still just a more forced less visually interesting version of borderlands sooo are your reviewers going to copy and paste a shit review then go apeshit when people call em out lol youre trying to make borderlands just stop and really general knoxx no original ideas cmon bethesda the g in rage looks like logitech g font style wow man this game has had me on the hype train since day one what a trailer i for one really enjoyed the first game its really cool that they can take the constructive criticism and laugh off their past mistakes this game will be the sleeper hit of the year for sure this is going to be fun yo tim willits can you finish quake champions first so youre playing offline huh seems like a mistake if you ask us youre missing out on weekly dynamic events like fighting giant sand worms and piloting a mech your friends will all be talking about them and youll just be alone offline not having as much fun as everyone else listen here ya shitstains theres no reason why i couldnt be able to fight giant sand worms or pilot mechs alone offline i dont appreciate you bullying us introverted singleplayer guys like that fuck you now im just gonna buy the game and play the entire thing offline out of spite just fuck my shit up fam was that a gender select plz give me never actually played rage now i think i might play this first game was boring i preordered it after watching this video well shit just go weird here thats for godamn sure amazing trailer holy shit i loved how they pointed out rage 1s shit ending hahaha good trailer ill buy the game this is probably one of the best trailers ive seen in a while good job to the marketing team legit think thats one of the best game trailers released hype is up play better in xbox this marketing team is awesome that rage 1 ending though lol hurry up and take my money rage aka the defintion of fortnite players i mean its cool and all still kinda lame without coop major call of juarez commentary vibes i watched the trailer till bethesda presents and stoped the trailer immediately to write this comment down when i am finished commenting this i will close all applications on my phone and never ever watch this trailer again everyone is sleeping on this game since its announcement and im thinking why everytime i see footage of it this looks way better than borderlands or whatever you guys are hyped for and yall laughed at my cat licking lollipop started the universe theory shaking my smh sam regal is hilarious finally a good game trailer any good looking characters is that darth vader so its doom but funny rage 2 is sunset overdrives and mad maxs child dam they even got guy fieri in here shit im sold this game is going places this shit look like borderlands and doom mixed together this makes me want to do drugs so off i go to become an addict thanks bethesda lmao this is the best trailer i hope that the game is best too the callback to the awful ending in the first game i loved the first so i know im gonna go balls deep in this game hahahaha the fact that they acknowledged that the first rage had a shit ending is fantastic smh no blake griffin reference a giant sand worm thanks for not being an egs exclusive oh fuck yeah that big worm thing and cross is back damn borderlands 3 on epic store gotchu down try rage 2 im getting bulletstorm vibes and that is a good thing ps loved the original rage so im totally psyched for this whats the song so rage wants to compete with borderlands good luck this is new warfame been interested since walmart announced the game i keep thinking its the doom guys behind this it cant be bad right well count me in this looks like good fun im still stoked for this and i know a lot of other people are but if this was multiplayer coop i really think it would be even better and bigger and more exciting and have a wider fanbase i like when developers can laugh at their past mistakes and try to improve what was criticized now id software just have to help the fallout team to improve their combat as well if they can do across another engine for another developer they should be able to do a collaboration within the company as well gonna be a shitty game and a political game they put guy fieri in this game 057 yeah this shouldnt even be called rage at this point its nothing like the original just a knock off borderlands i just played the whole game every trailer i see it makes me want the game more mans did the thanos snap this looks incredibly boring shouldve have a third person mode made by bethesda well fuck no then better spend my money on something better than one of the worst companies of the world solidus snake got resurrected lets do it to it i got my new rtx 2080 rig for this and doom eternal cant waaaaaaaaait d i this looks amazing no battle royal mode i love it i will wait to buy the game when it cost around 10 currently the deluxe edition costs around 95 just for the bfg no way and i dont like the boss on this game looks like the strogg in quake 4 with a mounted rail gun that trailer must have been one of the most unique and well made trailers ive ever seen gonna pick this up with ease im sorry but this just looks too good to pass up looks so crazy i hear some daft punk vibe in that ost trailer better than the whole fallout 76 look like a post apocalyptic wolfenstein we are going a bit too far backwards xd been waiting for so long for the sequel game looks pretty cool this trailer is offensively stupid how many drugs did they take to make this game yeah it sure looks very promising i thought maybe i would try that game in the future after seeing bethesda i said fuck no after fallout 76 i said fuck it im done and i will never buy game from them again those were the arks i see now lost it when they picked on rage i like the insinuation that cats came before all of time and are essentially god i still have my copy of rage anarchy edition lol the fact that they made fun of themselves about the ending has secured a day 1 purchase for me this trailer actually made me want the game i thought this game came out last year track name any1 i loved this first game ending sucked though and felt it was very underrated glad to see it getting the attention it deserves walker is about to go badass on mofos i cant wait to get my bfg deluxe edition baby just preorder this from the microsoft store on my xbox one i hope i wont regret it well im a bit hyped for this rage was a visual stunner in its day with some good gameplay just not long enough hope thats fixed with this one wowww that trailer was insane bfg 9000 so this is in doom universe i take it thought it was a updated warframe when i seen that mech dude at the start and dont you dare think i didnt catch that ride of the valkyries excerpt its like doom and serious sam had an open world baby on steroids rage 2 only the end of your life general cross is robo darth vader i almost forgot this game even exist this is how you make a trailer this has to be the most sickest game trailer ive ever seen up until this point doom in the desert bethesda may redeem itself id like to see nico from devil may cry 5 in this game so you guys pretty much just shit on the first games feel and do a blatant borderlands ripoff see ya in the bargain bin when im going into the store to pick up borderlands 3 in a few months i cant stop watching this is this the game bethesda guys play for relieving the stress they got from fallout 76 lex luther is that a new voice for walker why everything has to be goofy nowadays where are the games that fucked us emotionally oh no the game is self aware very bad trailer oh shit character creation yeah im coping it i cant believe we are getting 2 borderlands game in the same year now this is how you do a trailer to make people wanna buy it as well as how borderlands 3 did it too general cross bootleg darth vader i may play this but im reallyyyy needing a doom eternal release date right about now man the story better be good most anticipate shooter of 2019 nah homie borderlands is i love guys so much for this scanlain another dumb open world game i really hope this is a great game cyberpunk before its was cool pay for cheat codes lmao why do they call it a launch trailer when game isnt out till next week it makes no sense omg i have no idea wtf is this game but goddamn wanna play it looks like borderlands 2019 the more i see of this game the more i think if how awesome it would have been if it was 3rdperson lol hey look its fallout but with more guns thanks walmart lol everything looks great until bethesda logo luckily the devs on this have great histories lets hope it doesnt disappoint hope the story is gonna be good too sounds like if dean venture got to live the life hank wanted i fucking lost it when the did the whole record scratch freeze frame bit lol is that sam reigel ragegeneral cross borderlandsgeneral knoxx interesting right thats it ive caved im getting this on release day i never get games on release anymore but hot damn this looks incredible and i actually really enjoyed the first one everyone excited for e3 soon i have completely ignored this game so far to this day not anymore tbh im kinda bummed out they turned a decent story into a borderlands look a like i love how bethesda encourages the devs to do acid to create this game i need this now man thats just general knoxx in hd will the giant worm actually be in the game or is this a nms scenario the tonal shift reminds me of the seriousness of borderlands one turning into the less serious borderlands 2 hopefully it pays off in the same way i actually liked the first rage a cross over with borderlands 3 im very excited for this game but when is doom eternal coming out this is so stupid i love it what im considering this to be borderlands 3 in the meantime that the game isnt on steam 128 thanos reference looks cool woll scatch that itch i have for borderlands 3 these trailers are so awesome that it would be cool for them to be included in the game as an extra idk i dont see myself getting tired of them it would be great if they dont lock a weapon behind a big giant pay wall this is soooo meta i love it what since fallout 76 im kinda worried bethesda might screw this one up but this looks dope so ill give it a pass and when i see gameplay so you made boderlands and no one liked rage good luck ima give mad max 2 a try looks pretty good sorry bethesda you dont have any of my money after fallout 76 the narrator its that guy from critical role general cross looks like a more mechanical darth vadar still not as intimidating though when bethesdas producers pump out games that puts their development team to shame fowllout seventyshit will forever stain bethesdas rep for eternity this game seems so much different than the first it feels like it went from post apocalyptic to more scifi now this is a release trailer great call back to the rage 1 ending embracing constructive criticism and then having fun with it is always a good move cant wait to play this one of the best launch trailers ever no thanks looks like shit i wait for borderlands 3 d best game goty borderlands 3 is the king ima be real witchu chief its dope plus can we have a special doomguy outfit or something for those mad fuckers behind rage 2 trailers u fokking rocks wellthats definitely the most creative launch trailer ive ever seen consider me hype came in early this games a sleeper hit lol and that joke about rage 1 these guys have a great marketing team update welp didnt end up being the sleeper hit i was hoping for fun game great marketing but i expected more im gonna preorder the collectors edition right now bro edit and by the way that was a funny ass trailer cant believe they made a callback to how everyone hated rage 1s ending lol hears sam riegel at the start me right how much do you need what a lovely day microtransaction city definitely getting this cant wait to get my hand on this i hope its better than flopped anthem what a day what a lovely day the first game was dont you ever just stop and admire the carnage inflicted on the corpses why there are big stutters while driving all this and no aircraft instead of driving everywhere does anyone get the image that this game is the mix of farcry 3 blood dragon and the base game rage with the color scheme of farcry new dawn or not really his predecessor died so easily tho is it good downloading now it looks so boring mkiceandfire plays every game i like that is there multiplayer i had no idea rage 2 was out already awesome video mkiceandfire it looks pretty good but borderlands 3 will be better i think i am first hahah rage 1 was an open world half life therefore it was one of the most underrated games imo rage 2 is just serious sam doom i mean there isnt even a sniper rifle or the crossbow in this game now thanks for letting the initial idea die i like to call the fire storm revolver thanos gun i really want the nicholas raine armor its a terrible day for rain its ashame they dont have a summon ability but ethier way im sold this game looks retarded do we only have 4 abilities or theres more sorry but no way this footage is captured on console unfortunately buy a xbox and play in 4k pre order to receive the hes on fire cheat code can we not just get the game later and find the cheat code on the internet crysis farcry just cause rage 2 microtransactions in a single player game no buy if you have brains youd feel the same doom mixed with bulletstorm big fing guns shows pistol this is the new game of the year looks like just cause slept with far cry 5 new dawn and produced this why no coop though doom the weapons of resistance 3 a fk ton of drugs rage 2 looking forward to stealthgamerbrs videos of this game bulletstorm is that you you can feel id software in that gunplay so much which isnt bad if the game will bring solid story and interesting world why arent they making battle royale mode based on rage 2 it would be awasome for the hes on fire dlc code can i get the code from a regular pre order or a deluxe pre order you can call me hater but this is not rage this is bulletstorm with this superman as a main hero there will be no place for such atmospheric missions like dead city from original rage this clownish style completely ruins the game this is looking better than bl3 hope they dont do something stupid with microtransactions 145 shut up and take my money it looks like crysis at times thank you now i know which game im buying instead of borderlands 3 was the last move necessary this looks extremely over the toptake my money now 2018 who asked for this 2019 give it to mee i love the captions for this explosions and fight on the water and no waves no multiplayer no buy its simple as that 056 is the point of this secondary shot for fun only is it really worth to remove the ads to some guns so they can have a cool effects this would b an awesome battle royale game im sorry to say this and i know im the minority but i miss the old rages style of things you can grav star jump with the vortex i mean do we really need another reason to want this the game look goresome looks dope and superbly fun gameplay will definitely promote this game to indogamer community cancel collectors edition quick before you get rip off again the game just looks plain plain by all you do is shoot and from the looks of it fetch quests this shoulve been fallout 4 this combat looks so creative and satisfying 510 doom clone and nothing special uhhh wow lol beast word games this game is dead when borderlands 3 comes out i dont like how its an rpg ish where enemies have hp bars instead of making it more like rdr or something where headshots are kills or explosions are one shot and stuff like that rage 1 weird game with a tribe of weirdos and a little thriller to it rage 2 psychedelic doom seriously what happened change the title to doom but not really 2 kind of reminds me of borderlands but doom style i wish it was free because i dont have any money the music reminds me a bit of some old doom quite so remixed yes but the theme seems familiar game comes out 2 days after my birthdayso awesome and cannot wait that finger snap bioshock reference destroy all im sold stop spoiling us release it already looks like call of duty the powers the dodging the weapons oh my im in love all ready this is what mass effect combat could have been like sure this game is exciting but if doom eternal gets cancelled im gonna rage vr and aim version please buy this and doom eternal instead of call of duty this year people the game is great solid selection of skills maybe it lacks challenge a little but we will see btw there is also some info and car combat in other video im really excited for this and borderlands 3 the apocalypse is always more fun when it is colorful and crazy country roads this looks like pc footage to me unless its running at 60fps on console the movement with the gun no have fisics games are not about just on explosions and physics game without soul and scenario is garbage as like as crysis luxury homes that moment when you start playing the game and cant remember half the combos so you keep doing the same thing it looks like a another apex to me the weapons tho im so hyped up for this game big f guns shows 2 regularsized pistols is there a multiplayer mode in this game consider this game bought nice game dont remember rage being crysis on drugs man this game looks so generic lol bulletstorm is that you old rage is amazing fun shooting game looks fun cant wait for black friday this looks like doom but with 1000 mods this is one of those games youll be showing people in twenty years time and say i spent alot of time on this back then this is like if just cause doom and mad max had a baby i love it sssadistic if it has a great story and surpasses 30 hours gametime its a yes from me u run around n sh00t things 1010 ign most creative gunplay seen 051 is that a moderfucking reference to jojos looks awesome and a lot of fun to play so what is this game about looks like a advanced warfare borderlands apex legends doom cluster lol showoff interesting but too bad not on my buylist currently on budget to be honest this looks like goty material and im not even big into shooters rage 2 actually looks amazing wow im getting this crysis bulletstorm rage 2 thats all cool but just like dishonored imma be too lazy to do them imma just kill the normal way 90 they already was dead i wonder how many pp will buy this infamous doom rage 2 they fixed mass effect andromeda lol have coop looks really cool this on pc ill be amazing it looks pretty amazing ngl i hope this gameplay lives up to the actual gameplay give us endless enemies in the hub ad i will buy did i ever tell ya what the definition of insanity is i hope these arent all the available abilities a much better doom is that you its like a mix of borderlands and doom wish i could believe that this is the game well get but as the past few years have shown dont trust anything till reviews are out game of the year im not particularly interested in this but to say the powers are very generic they seem well done atleast the guns and movement look awful though i want buy and playing can i just have a gun that when i shoot it at a target it kills them lol far cry new dawn v2 looks awesome it would be cool if the player is rewarded for doing this combos by a style meter like in devil may cry that would push the player to use all the abilities and all the weapons in different ways instead of the most efficient any free ps4 for me amazing doom bulletstorm rage 2 get my money big fighting guns why would the blur it ps its a joke game run 60fps on ps4 its crazy if you think about this what is this crysis mixed with just cause with that pistol i can be roy mustang hey apex legendlook it thismaybe you can got new idea about new ability for new hero this looks f amazing especially without the huds big annoying obtrusive red hit markers this looks fun were is insurgnce soooooborderlands plus just cause plus mass effect did i miss anything and its not going to have a multiplayer big fng gunsthe bfg on rage 2 only four abilities and 67 gunsdissapointing the 12 year old inside me is excited for this power fantasy hope they didnt show all the abilities and guns this trailer looks like the dev team had a lot of fun making the game they went full roy mustang with the pistol alternate would like to mention 60fps on ps4 pro 30fps on standard ps4 mix with destiny and borderlands when doom slayer arrives on earth and needs target practice before killing demons rage 2 borderlands goty edition borderlands 3 just take my money and let me die in a dark room with le gamez also now ill be able to feel like roy mustang having a trip in australia neat is this doomguy on meth this might bem awesome you laugh you lose this is for the gamers this looks like doom but open world and i love it if only that snap ability turned the enemies to dust very cool rage 2 but you aint angry who needs doom eternalrage 2 is the one this actually looks so dope hahaha that thanos finger snap definitely hyped all of these gun combos feel a little unnecessary i love it liked purely for the use of a garth marenghi reference xd days gone is so long to play wanna finish that to get to this gamw love thumb wars glad cardy got to do this one keep em coming this guy isnt any better than the sheep lover stop with this sheeree the enemies the uk lads putting out some of the best content on this channel who hired this guy oh wait ign did thank you sir i salute you

release yall gave it an 8 and now yall release a video tearing it up ign wtf are you doing ign please dont stop doing these theyre hilarious i cant believe people think thumb war was started because the days gone review got backlash smh i liked doom and mad max having a great time with this game judging everything but the game huh isnt that what you guys do already another banger thumb war is great thumbs up from me just for joes haunting smile some of the names would make great gamer tags nbs bet this reviewer wasnt even a casual gamer just another entitled game journalist smh is there some sort of arena in rage 2 ammo crates that uses actual ammo to open it hahah lol this guy is brilliant please ign we want to see him more damn theyre gonna do this for all controversial reviews or what this will trigger days gone fanboys days gone is a mediocre game and you know it 20 secs showing all name kwality kontent what is this a good video on the ign channel didnt think id ever get to witness this im having so much fun playing this game love the smiling segment why is trump in the thumbnail i dont know why but i like it when there is a gun viewing animation in video games a vast but empty world they still salty about the pushback from their days gone review wow cool post ign thanks for sharing umm best ign videos to date keep thumb wars around pl0x they give it 8 out of 10 i wouldnt give it even 0 thats how bad it looks how do you get lost with pink arrows on the ground lol the hell are the point of these videos the crates dont break because you are too tall just crouch and they will break thumb smilyest disagree of minority guff shoot em up cyber doc overdrive majority dia log in do him madnifisens rage 2 much it just looks like mad max and doom made a baby that there like k lets just drop it off at the fire station and never talk again bronco koronco be scratching his nuts at 407shouldve named him scratchy mcscratcher me watching another ign thumb war video ah sht here we go again best thing on ign at the moment great work slugs love it well thanx bethesda i can not even finish the game cause the last mission doesnt trigger and i see more people having that issue i read in some comments i have to remove the game and reinstall it and here is the problem it has a huge update with it that takes like a hour so no thanks if i bought it at full price i would be ffing mad btw we are now many months after release its december now and still didnt fixed that bug shame on you to bethesda id and avalanche can we please please please remove the hold to exit vehicle pop message everytime the car comes to the stop we dont need it and it really wrecks the stunning beauty of the game i would play with the hud off but then in the heat of battle i dont know if i have my wingsticks ready or not i beg you please remove it from forever faithful fan of rage 2 rage 2 is on sale for 25 on the playstation storeshould i finally buy this game mine keeps crashing but it works offline anyone know what the fuck is going on well after the new update for some reason random chests refuse to open maybe you should work on making your games work properly and less time adding new shit to them yeah doesnt anybody remember the ghosts bandits from the frist game like anyone august is almost done when are we getting the expansion really thinking now that skull motorcycle will come with the rise of the ghosts expansion they forgot to censor one swear i wish the game would have the same quality then the trailers had sadly its not this is a really good place to put mutant animals it has a borderlands feel to it hugely underappreciated game this is this trailer was better fallout 76 couldnt get into the first hour of rage probably wont give this a second glance anyone else get a far cry primal vibe and look how well that turned out what music is this what happened just with rage post apocalyptic game play rage 2 is probably a good game but it looks more like something like crysis and it disappointes me a lot how can a studio like bethesda still have such garbage controlls and gameplay in 2019 the ghosts are fodder though the only good thing they have going for them is agility but nanotrite bois can dash now theyll get spanked like a subway town whore tempted to return this movements are not smooth ive tried changing the x and y sensitivity but it appears moving the analog sticks at angles seems slower and separate from the x and y axis its almost like playing it on a dpad makes it unplayable for me because how uncomfortable is it for not being even and smooth i try to turn to pick up an item and flings past the item im trying to pick up or its too slow goes for the aiming too if the analog is moved perfectly left right up or down its the speed i set the sensitivity at at an angle it moves around a 3rd slower of that speed it needs to fix it playing on console would play pc but i need to upgrade my card though ive heard others having simular issues on pc too regarding the movement hopefully they read this and enough people mention it so they can tell id and avalanche to fix it but i doubt it doesnt hurt to try i finished it now its just boring but i still keep coming back so the mechanics are fine its just empty the game plays nothing like that do you people even test your games or do you just make fake trailers with fake gameplay because i play your games all day and theyre buggy as fuck fix the games before release its getting really annoying im scared to buy your games and i think youre the best dev out there up your game bethesda wtf httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfkd43mmsef4 fix the games before release love the song thank goodness i ran out of stuff to do in this game is a few days there needs to be far more quests to keep it interesting and more enemy to clear out the gameplay is so fun just nothing to do love it love this game i like this game so can i ask can be more races in the game is this made for 13 year olds will the new stuff be sticking around or is it still limited time like the wasteland challenges 014 switch sfx 016 switch sound wow that was cringe fuck u and your game fuck your sse protocols and other new bullshit put this game game into your ass make a mobile version like the one on iphone except have a android version 020 goons all like hey im on a video i feel like joining the good side now but realizes hes about to die or is it a she only 8 missions rage2 is really bad i finished the game really quick and theres so many things to do but i dont feel motivated to do so do you have so little content for your game that you have to show the same stuff twice rage 2 good thing they didnt add a release date or this would have just been shadow edited to say coming soon this looks like they tried really hard to make a cool game but shit the bed doing so i hope we will be able to upgrade and customize the new vehicles does not seem anything like the first one hope this is better rage was ordinary fix this ing game cant believe there hasnt been a patch since it was released you know if i could find this in any store to buy it i would but nobody is carrying it and im not giving out my email to some company just so i can get this damn game hmm it dont say when dlc comeing out wish rage and borderlands mixed together would be awesome to have walker as a vault hunter oh this i look forward to now i miss the taste of flesh i love this game but i want this stuff now why the hell didnt they released the first sitcom openinglike song its fire i know its not a witcher title but the expansion should give some content to this fckin empty game i was so hyped and after a few ours i realised there is no real story no interesting universe characters conversations monologes nothing the shooting is funk sure but how long no multi i dont mind if there is a godd single game but there isnt no coop too bad but honestly that would be just as boring boring anyway its a shame it could be a good game one of the best game trailer i ever saw when is the giant worm coming i wanna be there to greet it fuck you guys i just bought this fucking game and i just cant start it can someone help me pls the storm tech from just cause 4 mad max should be in this game there is literally no reason to exclude it since it runs on the same engine you advertised every vehicle as interactive what about the boats campaign dlc for such a short and repetitive game is pretty shitty and showing the sandworms in the original trailers then withholding them till later seems like a dick move i mean 2 new vehicles i mean i expected at least 3 and werent thee supposed to be new nanotrite powers just nitpicking but still you guys will always be my favorite game company you bring so many games that i love and still play all of the game youve guys created just awesome thank you bethesda for everything dead low effort generic game dont buy all new great stuff that you can do by yourself because we didnt include any kind of multiplayer because fuck you im sorry but i fucking love that trailer yo worst game i have ever played weekly updates looks to fallout 76 i dont like where this is going on gameslice channel you will find the wii mii plaza theme version of the e3 rage 2 trailer i hope it has more story than the main game fuck you bethesda after finishing the game i can say this you make great games but you suck way too hard at endings like it was too quick and too predictable i was hoping for something more complicated storyline than go in and kill the bad guy whoever thought that title and description were cool needs to be fired can you guys please fix the dual4k display bug where the game tries to play in both displays when i go fullscreen or borderless fullscreen its been like for a month the only way to play is windowed which is problematic because the mouse goes off the screen in the middle of combat or driving which is you know like 95 of the game ive posted a detailed message about it on steam posted a video even included a link to my most current dxdiag info please help wheres that smug cliff they better meet their maker after this trailer its always that smug cliff how about multiplayer coop or a team death match mode with leader boards and respawns it would be nice with the way that the gunplay is wait didnt the game just come out why have this as a dlc and not part of a 80 game this is why we say no to preordering and microtransactions stop with the ridiculous business practices this game is so boring man this is pretty close to the launch of the original rage 2 middling reviews probably put the spurs to development too many micro transactions no thanks bethesda is it wrong for me to be more excited for this than anything else from bethesda seriously there showcase was a little lacking still way too hard for borderlands though just was playing the new expansion thats free i am garcia the gregarious bethesda just loves their curse words dont they this is so cringey and is trying way too hard i get it its like an old 80s sitcom intro how ironihip so this is free dlc right if this is so then ok now the game is worth the 60 dollars too many cooks was out like 4 years ago keeping it current i see too bad the graphics on console dont look this good the first rage game looked better than this and that came out in 2011 i just hope they can deliver because i dont want to return my copy i beat the game way too quickly this adds some nice things but is it enough to come back nice trailer too bad the game aint that good i dont even have the game yet i like this trailer is the game even good for anyone feeling crazy that the memes were not in this version i got ya covered httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnn84bhhdace its basically borderlands but made by bethesda and id softworks they removed the memes now no one will believe me that i heard mii channel and megalovania and i think something else prior so glad the comments here can vouch for that i want to get this but im way too scared of predatory monetization that said this is better than bl3 imo it takes a lot to make a stew a pinch of salt and laughter too a scoop of kids to add the spice a dash of love to make it nice and youve got too many cooks 136 nice donald trump satire but already finished rage in the same day it came out and was shit why would i want to go back no thanks cant wait great game all the shit it got was undeserved it really proves that people will nitpick anything to make a game look bad ill pass still not forgetting that damage that todd and bethesda had created with fallout 76 last i hear the lawsuits against them for fallout 76 were still active 015 you should have gone for the head i liked the game but theres not enough to keep me around especially since there is no date for any of this stuff cant believe i paid 80 for this game i am surprised this video got so many likes thought everyone but me hated this game now with 100 less nintendo music and midi undertale my preorder stuff still doesnt work so tod where is tes6 klegg ive got a tremendous surprise for you all also klegg oh wait im dead why are all these bethesda games starting to look the same didnt dig this trailer very much just seemed too long and repeating the same information that new expansion with the ghosts we need more info regarding the story a dedicated story trailer for that would have been better 022 i cant it just to funny to look at who makes that face 024 also nnnnnoooo they do not even hide that it is shit game still as bland as a glass of warm tap water too bad rage 2 was like a brain damaged leper with adhd oh mighty shai hulud keeper of balance bless the maker and his water bless the coming and the going of him may his passing cleanse the world hey fuck you cliff initial release date may 14 2019 announcement of a dlc june 10 2019 seriously fucking bastards of shareholders initial release date may 14 2019 announcement of a dlc june 10 2019 seriously fucking bastards of shareholders yes new weapons and skills bullshit company first person driving cheat code when is this game coming out please i whant both songs in full versions please please please great combat but shame the rest of the game is a shallow mess more is definitely good a hell of a lot more is better hopefully any new regions have interesting road terrain this time like days gone dg has jumps road debris detours tiny bridges etc rage 2 has the same flat wide road though the landscape is amazing i would love more dynamic events creatures headhunters imagine a badass showing up randomly to take you out a shit ton more weapons i dont think any of that is happening i like rage 2 quite a bit but it needs more variety ok next time put the full game in release date i finish rage 2 sooo fuckin fast i tried to take long to finish it wack ass service for gamers wauwwww they are very good in trailers trash trailer for trash game what song it is if only this game was so funny and lighthearted as the marketing materials unfortunately its not the main story is as serious as cancer i was very disappointed with this so happy to finally finish my rage 2 series with a lot of leftovers yet to be done only to realize theirs an update coming soon man am i really slowdope trailer though first half had me dying 2 trailers in 1 wtf this shit is too cringy wtf wtf is wrong with that tittle wtf i think ppl are taking way too many question on a game that is as dumb and fun as setting your fart on fire embrace the cringiness reminds me of the bojack horseman theme song lol this content is age restricted im fucking signed in what the fuck not bad what this game needs is a ton more stuff to kill cause that is the best if not the only good part about the game please let us repopulated calened outposts so we can keep killing and new fun and exciting ways hi if you watched this video and liked it i recomend you from watch this video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvylf0xk9trn8 i bought rage 2 kind of randomly in a store for xbox thinking it was just like doom well it was not so i got a bit dissapointed at first especially by the controls and motion blur and the weapons where meh but after i played it some more it is pretty fun actually it has a good shotgun the controls still have this unprecise acceleration but i have become used to it and it is a pretty fun game where you become an unstoppable killing machine after some upgrades so maybe it is a bit like doom after all i find new ways to love this game every day in light of the music can we get a wasteland steve urkel voiced by jaleel white 138 they added trump what family matterstgif hell yes cant wait to get rage 2 goty edition for 10 bucks in 18 months time and not have to pay up front for all this addon shit keep up the good work guys this game is pure fun with the exception of chest hunting wow so generic rage 2 couldve been amazing if it was for the great combat and shooting i wouldve sold me copy a game that ensures we play game just game finally will only to enjoy and not save the world so people are getting free shit and still downvotes my answer to this clickbait please yes n thankyou game needed another year or two of development feel like i got screwed out of my money for an unfinished game i have heavy tony hawk american wasteland vibes in here please add new game plus to make even better 016 walker looks so happy he was like this i love my job killing people is fun rage 2 is so good and si underrated what a masterpiece i cant wait for the story dlcs 121 been playing too much apex recently so i thought of octanes voice line lol i keep watching this trailer and i just keep forgetting what im looking at really enjoyed rage 2 was worth playing but damn this trailer was lame hello fellow kids remember too many cooks haha so cool and random what about flashlight fun video unlike the actual fucking game such an empty base game not sure i want to keep spending money on dlcs in the hope it stops the boredom 014 rage 2 for nintendo switch confirmed will it be free though rage rage

radar but this makes me want to check it out now still waiting for the option to turn off aim smoothing i have the og e3 trailer reminds me of too many cooks love the game but i hope the dlc will be story focused base game story was short and abysmal oh and having more than literally one race track would be cool as well clickbait theres no wii shop channel music and megalovania i feel like not playing this game so far has been a disservice still cant drive the hover boats soo thisll add 25 minutes of gameplay to a game you can beat in 8 hours without even trying the trailer is better than the game the cliff nothing will save this boring crap have i gone insane or was there megalovania playing on the stream smug cliff 2 the smug cliffening reloaded xtreme mike from marketing reheated some fucking as in the microwave and called it a day katy t3h pengu1n of d00m dlc gonna be lit fam 1111 42069 yall removed that mii channel music in this version i bet you are gonna have to buy everything individually they advertised in this trailer even the cheat codes nintendo switch snap 015 how how did they know about that damn cliff this game is trying so hard 124 lmao why would they show off the animation of the mech turning like that if hes just gonna slide in a circle so odd i want this song where is the wii music hold up instead of everything else being awsome asf can we plz get a new game plus 4 dis bad ass game my freind watching on youtube was laughing confusedly about out about all this weird music playing and i couldnt hear it on twitch so thought he was imagining it why do i feel like i just watched 2 different trailers for the same updates hopefully the story dlcs will have more story than the main game i honestly want to know what happend for the guy in the first rage ive never been so bored by such a kickass game which song at begin anyone hear the sans and wii theme in the livestream chris pratt sound alike sing along looks to much like fallout 4 tbh the mech looks like a fallout 4 thing and the voices to sync with the animations well co op co op literally coop is all i want this game would be much better if it had normal colors not this pink glow everywhere this shit better be free with how short the game was 111 winter is coming oh my fucking god it sounds like the family matters intro fucking amazing rage 2 is my favorite game out rn this is

the series especially when you make the videos we dont want to watch no one else play it so please play some more u brad a real addictive game yay finally brother brad thank you for all the time you dedicate for us here thumbs up to the best youtuber like this so brad can see our love subscribe to me good job keep it up i like rage 2 tho i dont have rage 2 but it look awesome you should do arcs more because there are some really cool weapons you can get and especially in overdrive they get much much better all i can say is six rockets launched at the same time which turns the enemies into atoms now tell me that is not overkill ive been avoiding this series for the sole purpose of spoilers nearly beating the game theres nothing to spoil anymore very short story fun open world with a lot to do shame the story is lacking imo time to binge watch this series reloading when most of the ammo is the clip during a fight and randomly tweaking out spam switching between main and side arm is the type of cod nonsense that gets scrubs killed awsome game and nice gameplay brad how does cross have walkers hand print in the hand print scanner interface love you doing filming this i think this is a good question how does cross have your hand print in the hand print scanner interface can you use more weapons than the assault rifle ye yeeet love the vids and the content hello love from indonesia brad i dont know why but i liked video games when i couldnt play but in 2016 ur videos especially far cry primal made me buy a console and now i play games regularly thank you brad huge fan of the far cry series ie me played almost all far cry except 2 and new dawn do you play this on normal cause i played it on hard and it was not easy on certain mission just play plague man the person in the thumbnail looks like ben from classicfirearms you game to the extreme thumbs up for you theradbrad i thought the thumbnail was guy fieri guy fieri in the thumbnail very small car how can walker

anything else to do other than wait for the roadmap update this game is trash really dont care if i see somebody dislike it idc rage 2 vicious as fuck how repetitive is this game very nice game massive respect for u will come here when gta6 comes please give a heartthank you i love first person games heart me radgod nice gameplay thanks for the uploads bradkeep them cominggonna make my evening with this where is plague tale olz shout out my channel name to suppoort me mr khan official brad is rad to the 1 of people that see this i hope you have a good day and grow on your channel i am your new sibscriber we need a plague tale video man cmon spam the series love u brad im from india and im your biggest fan if this is blue youre an g radbrad ubsriber you can be a g of mine today whos excited for watch dogs 3 10 like brad you totally forgot sekiro shadows die twice is the game worth getting the open world looks kinda bland wait part six already ima go back and watch part 1 stay rad brad that guy fieri in the thumbnail i think was ne free to play more and more i see of this game the more i become interested the only bummer is no coop how cool would this world be exploring with a buddy still looks like a must buy though maybe they will add coop later on omg what a game i didnt know thanos snap was an ability why does thanos have a gun in this trailer when he can just keep snapping his fingers destiny 2 before all the fucked up updates xd this reminds me of ratchet and clank if it was a fps these guns are creative like bulletstorm and doom had a baby anyone else hate the whole revolver thing i there something you dont have to kill d if this had xp or some type of robust progression system this game would do better than the best far cry ok ill buy it ps man if rage 2 had an pvp br redifined a little bit it would be amazing this definitely looks like something from avalanche limitless combinations of abilities based on the physics systems the ai seems to be dumb af i mean they literally just wait to get killed i dont know about this one titan fall 2 doom 4 mad max apex legends black ops 34 rage 2 and dunkey will say this is a ripp of from doom so before falling down from a higher place to his death give him a missiles kiss goodbye those graphics a downgrade is coming i can feel it in my bones is it free i still feel like this game aint for me and that it would get boring after the story and missions like far cry this is epic smas7ormbreaker if you see this please play ps3 again ive been waiting to play with you for a while read your messages when you get on ps3 youll know who i am this looks dope solid selection of skills maybe it lacks challenge a little but we will see btw there is also some info and car combat in other video if you dont mind pre ordered and will be live streaming on release day xanderpark on twitch sorry if im sincere but this is a copy of the borderlands ubisoft updated please bring vib ribbon to ps4 wonder if this game is going to be any challenge youre practically a god with all your powers can we have a difficulty mode like dishonored 2 were you can refuse the abilities i see this getting very boring very fast i can already imagine so many creative ways to obliterate enemies reminds me of saints row and borderlands way better rhan far cry new dawn can t wait to play it amazing graphics the game is a god in actionsits a game for non stop action i dont really understand why the score is low but compared to other games that released this year its pretty good fuck these guys i watched an hour of early gameplay between the sleepinducing interactions with characters and forced tutorials i about fell asleep i went from thinking about buying to passing on even a rental expecially enough said do these guys even know what fun is in a game i loved rage 1 this guy being interviewed is a whiner 148im suprised he didnt say everything the fact that they partnered with avalanche means they really know what they are doingi really respect them on not having pride and caring about delivering a good game bro thats sanctuary from borderlands 2 yisus this two drag every phrase they speak my god i couldnt finish the video this is one of the most halfassed reviews ive ever seen their majority bashing the game and didnt even play a fraction of the content i guess i cant be surprised seeing as how its gamespot after all looks like a cartoon i dont like it not for me but it might be a good game but i wont play it no one going listen to you 2 scrubs wait this vid has over 1k likes and only 800 dislikes for giving a nit picky review of a well done game these two jackasses probably got hired to review because there was literally no one else stop whining i dont like the drivingi dont like the openingi dont like video games stfu you would think the city would be more crowdedas he walks in it looks oddly barren is there any in cockpit views wow that pimp woman owning the guy slaves and all looks fucking awesome and this guys really complaining that the characters are bland and boring these guys didnt play the first one cause it sucked and nobody gonna play this one fuck bethesda and anything they put their name on pretty much every gun has a primary fire oh great and wise sage what forbidden secrets shall you impart on us next this liberal ass gaming channel is the thing wrong with gaming journalism ign is one thing but gamespot just shits on any game that doesnt cater to their leftist agenda such a joke of a channel just make political videos of all of your gaming videos are just going to have liberal undertones first youtube comment ever these guys are terrible at this i just needed to say that terrible journalists terrible preview this is giving the channel a bad name you can be negative but you have to make sense and stop reaching and assuming so much gameplay is loud impossible to think with i mean lack of coop pretty much ruined this game for me i have zero interest now dudegame looks great but you sound like such a downer plus this game is looking badass wellspring is looking alot larger in rage 2 thats awesome why do they sound like theyre dying can i get a job at gamespot i have no experience with journalism and have no idea what im talking about half the time but that seems to be the type of person gamespot are hiring terrible presentation really my old it teacher really dull boring guy had more enthusiasm and drive than these morons the moment i hear exspecially is the moment you lose all credibility these sound like people who only play 2d indie adventures all day and got put to describe a frenzy shooty first person shooter for the first time in their entire lives they sound like theyre about to jump off a building together or something fucking depressing rage 1 wasnt a full game it was a test for different systems that flopped i just unsubscribed from this channel because of this video talk about the biggest game company in the world hiring every dushbag in silicon valley and then pay them a little extra to push all their ideas the guy describing sounds like a f f and i dont mean someone that enjoys gay sex i mean a f f south park reference i mean give me a break are you trying to explain this game to us are you just giving us your hateful opinion i mean at least use some intelligence when youre explaining a video game that you have tried bouncy was the word he used to describe the fucking car this guy sounds like he could easily be a politician in the world of idiocracy this was so hard to listen too im glad i have got a hold of my depression as theses guys especially the guy whom has played the demo sounds like hes not long for this planet wow worst demo cover video ever please stop game critics complain about everything what a sad lifr game spot the game is so loud thats its almost impossible to hear yourself think words of wisdom that make no sense gamespot at its finest those npcs look shite btw good review its honest thats just hype for cyberpunk 2077 they need to write a script and articulate the points summarily with more clarity take note gamestop i feel like these guys are massively misunderstanding this game and giving a really shit review im off elsewhere dude said ekspeciallyand they dont even know the release date do these guys even um know what their job is i think id have lost it its like they are clueless how to evolve the 1st person genre and significantly their own formula this will be ok but no better than that im looking and im thinking meh been there done that why are you all so angry that they dont like what the played of a game that you all havent played it just looks like a less original borderlands clone incredible game and the graphics no words first rage was one of the worst fucking over hyped games ive ever played at the time than they put john goodmans voice on a buff black guy lol its a fucking fail cant trust a gamespot review it would appear that the protagonist is ambidextrous he signs his name with his left hand yet he holds his firearms like a right handed player i hope this was intentional since savvy gamers are going to continue to notice otherwise this sequel has me intrigued bla bla bla shut up and let listen to the game fuck you guys honestly the same publication that gave rdr2 a 9 tries to shit all over this game because theyd rather nitpick and focus on minuscule flaws than focus on anything good about the game now remember this is by bethesda i think we all need to do a reality check in the fact that they have fucked us before in very recent times i am excited to see this game take off but at the same time i know it could just be another fallout 76 or i would ran into bandit camps and i would be the one invading themthis dude has a really weird and stupid perception of killing bandits in a game wtf this gaming journalist are like a really bad joke for saying the least the best preview of this game is on rock paper shotgun not because its positive but because its actually honest and not at all derivative with all the effects and gravity grenades weapons it reminds me a little bit of the prey 2 we never had wahtching the video without audio no headphones and it looks really promising ok is still a prealpha but the open world scenes with hovercraft look amazing and i am always very skeptical about videogames personally i am not a fan of the art style of neon lights and fancy colors but that is just personal it looks and feels very good also the combat part i was surprised by the unlike of the video then i went to the comments and understood ahahah gamespot ea butt boys this is the most boring preview ive watchedand its not the games fault im looking forward to this immensely bethesda being behind the game makes me approach this with extreme caution their games are known to be riddled with bugs and after the debacle that is fallout 76 theres not a chance in hell im considering buying one of their games at launch wait for reviews people do not preorder combat looks awesome driving physics look promising from what i can tell watching the video visuals look fucking amazing what the fuck are you guys smoking man the graphics looks so weird or is it the style of the game feel like bethesda always have weird looking games in rage2 the graphic is not bad just weird you lot are ign 2 you gave genesis alpha one a 4 and it was great so from now on im not listening to your bullshit its all about the advertising money with you lot its like doom mechanics but in an open world it looks amazing co op its 2019 jesus you guys are shit at your jobs edit go watch easy allies review much better sounds like 2 people who have never played a game talking about a game they havent played awful journalism your character is left handed thats got to count for something this looks fantastic so know what these people are talking about the driving looks like it did in mad maxthat game was fun as hellthe fighting of doom with the driving of mad maxhow is that ehi dont think your going to get a great idea for the story in the pre beta seems more reminiscent of bulletstorm or borderlands or doom obviously somewhere between them rather than the original it doesnt really seem to have much of the original rages identity which is a little disappointing these guys are just doing such a terrible job of explaining it though boss make sure you take loads of notes after you play the game we want a detailed review journalists ummmmummmmmummmmummmm the guns are good ummmm seriously no care at all smh i prefer metro exodus over this game ill sum up the review doom was better uuuhhmmm kinda complaints about the demo not having a the full game even more uhms they still cant fix the camera angles fuckers from bethesda always promisse heaven when delivering complete shit dont buy this shit guys lets bethesda suffer for fo 76 i feel like the guy who played the game out of these two pisses sitting down yeah fuck you guys it you cant get in to it you no gaming depressing people making a depressing review wait game critics being critical of a videogame madness what is next people valuing their credibility over a good relationship with videogame companies i think the problem its not the game is that this commentaries are just boring go see the easy allies preview its much better and really makes you excited for the game unlike this two bored guys the gyrocopters look great a buy for me flying is fun and the mobility is important please dont take peter brown seriously the only thing he is remotely interested is mario or zelda related reviewer sounds like hes suffering from chronic depression eckspecially nice one i understand you guys are critics its what you do do you really need to bash a game thats not even out yet numerous critics are really enjoying this game im sure your seeing some positives but your shitting all over it this is the problem with you critics you talk about developers destroying the industry you critics hurt the industry a lot more then you realize just by shitting all over a game thats not even out yet you potentially discourage many customers from buying the game so think about what your saying before you cause unnecessary harm to the gaming industry i hate to pile on but every time i hear peter brown talk about any game he comes across very condescending and negative dont get me wrong i love when people are real and critical and maybe thats just his personalitythe tone just doesnt sit well with me looks like a game id buy for 5 bucks some day i want cod with this engine you have big dumb game good not bad i rarely give thumbs down but those two deserve it upsetting and embarrassing at same time the combat and combinations of abilities looks fun as shit these guys are terrible at describing the game i cringed throughout the entire video no steam no buy rage 1 sucked ass this game looks way too much like borderlands this video kinda backfired huh this guys commentary is fucking awful how do game developers have a chance with such negative press even before its out we are supposed to be helping each other as industries thats the only way we rise up 237 you guys sound like fuckn morons either get someone else to voice over or read lines from properly put together material dislike amount helped me to avoid these morons obviously the publishers did not pay the jurnalists for a good review that is exactly how they sound this was terrible the dude being interview clearly hates the game he didnt say anything positive at all this game looks incredible i dont get his negative points maybe they should of sent someone else to play it monster trump haha lol very very poor commentary looks like borderlands if they kept their original realistic graphics what is the name of the song and artist in this video let me sum this up nicely doom borderlands rage 2 yes its really that simple that moment when you get inexperienced games to complain about something other gamers might like the person who is explaining the game is a big dummybag jesus christ these characters are as original as it gets of course they fit into archetypes its a post apocalyptic game theyve all been made nit pick some more shit for the sake of reviewing this looks super dope man you 2 are such asshats unsubd and i highly suggest any avid gamer do the same what a load of crap i kinda feel like there was a little lack of preparation or something with the narration of this video it just seemed off im quite certain that id didnt pay the fee for a positive preview this is clearly some biased horse and i think everyone sees right thru it i think its time that your funding for these projects was audited im starting to think that the previewreview circuit acts much as the political arena with devs acting as lobbyists these days its like every game had a baby wow the graphics look horrid somebody fire this guy reviewing the game fuckin negative bastard with no valid points and rambles nonsense this is not 2077 cyberpunk its rage who the hell should be expecting a deep and immersing story from this game this is the problem when you dont fully play the 1st game and you dont know what the hell youre talking about put real gamers to check out the game instead of these dumbasses well all the real gamers here just know thisll be worth a buy if these lispy socal douchenozzles sound bored we as gamers know what they actually experienced was know to the normal folk as fun doorbell rings guy1 pizza delivery guy2 thanks hey do you play video games guy1 no not really guy2 never mind ill give you 10 if you let me interview you guy1 but i havent played the game guy2 you want the 10 or not the guys voice is really whiny always finding something to criticize how did these people get this job i really cant stand it when people talk super negative about a game because the story wasnt some oscar level material its a fucking video game did it feel awesome to play was it fun great im in dont get me wrong i love a good story but that stuff is gravy for me its everything else that matters not about trump i dont like it the amount of bad reviewers nowadays is too damn high like wtf the guy didnt event play rage 1 he played it like homework in preparation for the demo and then afterwards i really liked the first rage please have hdr support these guys know nothing and talk shit nearly as bad as ign this game looks sick the driving didnt even look bad really think you guys are nitpicking damn these guys are nitpicking like fucki think they should change the title to the jaded gamer preview very original gameit looks differentexcellent art chracters game looks gooddont know what they are talking about can i play the story with a friend is it coop like i said add a first person mode to drive and keep nice immersion plus first person driving would hide some bugs you might see in third person ok so its a mad max type game where everyone is batshit crazy but you rage 2 we got some far cry blood dragon we got some saints row we got some 2016 doom we got some mad max we got some borderlands we got some bulletstorm me sign me the eff up ign i was hoping for a point and click narrative based adventure with deep emotional resonance about the nature of madness and the inevitability of climate change and i didnt see that me wtf ign gamespot managed to make such an adrenaline pumped game look boring whats wrong with that draw distance omg youre so critical of the characters far cry will get a 10 though finally thats not what i heard when these two dumbasses reviewed this but were still here anyways so let me get this straight from the first 20 seconds of this hands on demo you played you knew exactly what the game was going to be like this is a small demo of a game not the whole thing shitting on the entire game within the first 20 seconds saying there isnt enough combat now i remember why i never watch your videos oh my can we get this footage without the whiny complaining narration can tell these guys never played the first one get paid to review games that you dont play and give opinions on games you dont know how to play no wonder 13 the video is dislikes gamespot is the worst this game looks fun dont know what the problem is journalism at it finest folks wow what was hard to listen too rage one was awesome ive been looking forward to this for ages cant wait wow this game looks incredibly mediocre what a shame in the reveal trailer the game looked interesting that thumbnail gave me nightmares heres a tip gamespot let someone who actually gives a damn do the previews from now on this channel has lost its way you guys bag on games in such a pompous and university student rants games are fun this looks funstop being so neggie this preview was uuuuuhkinda ehhhhincompetent really how is rage 2 hitscan combat comparable to dooms full projectile and melee gameplay just downloaded farcry2 on the xbox one store for free i remember it being hardish but after being spoiled with mini maps and precision quest markers spotting and not to mention smooth controls of modern titles this game challenged me from the get go if you want the difficulty upped then you legit need to go back in time to older titles the graphics in this game look last gen to be honest iwe dont gplay ngames wow you guys are actually the worst wow this guy really sounds bored of his job not on steam the cadence of that guy speaking is nauseating cant wait for these two clowns to develop a game didnt reviewers say that about rdr2 before it came out lol the combat is fairly goodit feels like doom its a id software game all their games feel like dooms combat in wolfenstein feels like doom just with dual welding and quake is just faster but it still has that backbone of an id game and its no different to rage these narrators have no idea what the hell they are talking about what youre tryin to say is that the characters are wasteland sterotypesand lack innovation and substance also the animations are mediocre at best i believe he said rage 2 sequel borderlands without the comic book art style so no borderlands 3 im sorry for asking ill how did you get the job of game journalists your not very good at it are you anywayi dont like the image effects interfierances when you do special moves dont need to have that in my opinion its spoils the visuals the rest looks good just watch the easy allies preview people this is like two people who watched a twitch stream trying to microanalyse the minutiae of a game while simultaneously not being able to give a clear cut impression of what they saw do these guys even play games also im not a game developer so i dont know how game development works id say you should make it your business because youre a so called game journalist hahah what a horrible preview just bcus the devs didnt bash trump they pick on it and give it bad press hahaha wow may be the first time i am listening to nothing but luke warm reception and scratching my head as everything on the screen looks flipping awesome came away from this super hyped despite all the negative opinions the ai looks stupid asf not on steam means no ratings and no refund policy so i wont buy the game you guys sound like youre trying too hard to find things to complain about and didnt give enough credit to the things that the game actually does well please improve the history make a good end game im gonna pass on this game it looks very generic to me the lazy driving system and the over use of ads of all things in a doom like single player game meant for action just doesnt work and the guns are just boring for the world they seem to have created same for the vehicles why are the vehicles so normal and generic the guns looks like they were taken straight out of a call of duty game youre a game journalist but you know how game development works what so rage 2 decided to be inherently non political and after journalists hear this they release these hit pieces didnt think gamespot would stoop this low but i guess you cant trust anyone these days check igns review aswell its the same shit with all the mainstream ones theyre all trashing the game for no apparent reason and were all hyping it up before the devs tweeted about the game not being political easy allies did a good review unlike these political hack shills these two are buffoons the guy describing the demo played sounds like one of my pessimistic friends that hates everything looks fun to me the reviewers just dont like video games you cant please these people with anything you guys at gamespot annoy me so often with your previews reviews get over yourselves rage is gonna be great is wellspring called sanctuary a couple years ago please make it like borderlands another mediocre avalanche game nothing new here wow the gameplay i am watching does not match with what they are saying at all the game looks very intriguing honestly the graphics arent that much better than than the first game eric foreman is narrating this video you this looks good did look real good kinda reminds me of when they featured the hub from borderlands 2 years back 320 i hope and hear that the over bike is somewhat hard to get and is endgame also they said there is car upgrades and customisation 908 im guessing thats an upgrade cause i dont think it normaly has the shockwave which looks fun the bit from 914 to934 is very fun to watch im really hoping and think that the fps combat will be mostly indoors since thats what id does best also im looking foward to seeing more boss battle type stuff and its nice seeing old things return but better largely negative preview im going with my own instincts on this one because it looks awesome wow this video like damn these guys be like yeah doom is looking pretty alright the story is really lackluster so we would have liked to see more than the sort of stereotypical demon archetypes and more of a personal look into the antagonists motivation stuff like that the protagonist has a backstory but at the end of the day his hole shtick is that hes mad you know the levels are pretty neat kind of typical for an arena shooter not too bad though it would have been nice to introduce an openworld aspect to sort of look for unique story details and sideplots in hell they sort of missed the boat on that overall its pretty alright though the combat is fairly decent ffs rage 2 looks like doom in an openworld just its bandits and mutants instead of demons for a lot of people that is what we want lastly the driving in rage is supposed to be rudimentary so that even people who hate racing games can easily pick it up the last thing many fps players want i stop sending negative nancy to do this events off the cuff style impression previews have merit and purpose but this was not a shining example easy allies off the cuff with huber and dulcet tone jones is a much better watch its using apex engine not gonna buy this game since i very disappointed to just cause 4 ugly graphics bad performance guy like sounds eric foreman from that 70s show im more into rage 2 than new dawn guys more powers should be in the game more xspeciallyi cant take this guy seriously everybody unsubscribe and subscribe to easy allies you will not be disappointed did you guys wake up 12 seconds before recording the vo for this nothing is thought out ums and uhs everywhere and the one guy barely can form sentences to describe the game what an uninspired preview the only reason why i still fuck around with ign and gameshit is because i just like to see gameplay of anything i can get my hands on i dont care for the dumb fucks who narrate the videos im here for 1 reason only gameplay why does this sound like a gay guy trying to explain a straight guys game its nice to see those two were well prepared to talk about the gameoh wait also did he really say expecially tt im still buying it dont really care what other people say about it one man shit is another mans treasure gamespot gives call of duty games consistently high ratings yet trashes a game like this taking this video with a grain of salt white hillbilly dude do you really have to mention that he is white it sounded like youve wanted to kill him geez i doubt if he was a thief and black you would mention his skin colour just saying who reviewed this game this guy and the way he sounds in reviews could make e3 with a new console release sound like they fucked up his meal at chickfila meal and forgot the drink i mean geezus this game looks amazing i loved the first game i loved doom how could i not love this expecially call yourselves journalists yikesalso as a content developer myself ive never seen prebeta is this the nomans land between alpha and beta oo remember gamespot gave rdr 2 a 9 borderlands 2 characters all had shticks talking to people good story yeah thats exactly what we all love about rage enjoy the game for what it is its rage 2 stop being so pompous about everything you twits this is why i dont watch gamespot or ign videos ever lol they are all complete morons umm yeah so like uhhhh the game um its not sigh um its sorta like doom um and there uh ah are cars so um ya know yeah i love post opocolyptic games love the misery and lootingbut no looting here though its strange that the vehicular combat is mediocre seeing mad maxs vehicle combat was amazing my understanding is this is avalanches baby with id helping here and there right this game looks like its for me i just want a really solid over the top shooter with lots of gore and fun enemies to shoot at im not really in it for the story in this case its a video game mang nobody will buy this game lol click bait title all they did was shit on the game the first half of the video and this guy sounds like he just get offended by everything need this nowd this dude is a gaming prude why you guys laugh at middle of explaining things its such off putting comon be a pro casuals stop here game looks too easy just my opinion doesnt mean its true not sure why he seems to want to not like this game but go see easy allies video for more info it doesnt look as bad as this guy makes it sound this preview claims to be conflicted but it comes off much more like a desire to find things wrong god the game looks interesting and fun to play stop picking at tiny bones you pathetic ign wannabes unsubbed how this guys cover games for a living see rock paper shotgun for a more concise overview of this game this sounded like peter brown was using new guy as a puppet to express his own cynicism these guys are bitchn about everything graphics are cool though damn so much of the game looks shockingly shit wouldnt be surprised to see it join the evil within 2 prey wolfenstein 2 death of the outsider fallout 76 and dishonored 2 on the flop pile who the fk got this low energy grumpy ass on too bad they removed it from steam no one would be buying it this guy sounds like a pretentious jerk that courtyard is uncomfortably similar to sanctuary in borderlands 2 id is doing nothing in this game btw what a shit preview i played the first but it was not released in 2001 as far as i remember beautiful game just say like it is rage 2 looks phenomenal and plays phenomenal stop nitpicking guys you know nothing about making games talking about how much depth gameplay mechanics there is smh there are shit ton bad games out there this isnt one of them anyone who compares the combat of this game to dooms has no idea what defines dooms combat and really doesnt know what heshe is talking about enemies in this game have hitscan weapons which means you must use cover to prevent damage the game is fastpaced sure but this is still a fundamental design decision that completely changes weapon enemy and level design enemies in doom only have projectile weapons or are melee and weapons and levels are designed accordigly its two fundamentally different ways to create a fps if id software wasnt involved in the development of this game no one would compare it to doom no loot no buy looks mediocre at best i will wait a couple of days after its release date and buy it from the bargain bin for a couple bucks despite the neon attraction it looks very generic to me doesnt mean its bad per say but its nto setting itself apart from whats come before very well then again its doing a much better job of trying than the cash grab imitation of far cry new dawn you guys played 2 hours of the game but make it seem like you are doing a proper review of the game a really negative one at that considering you played 2 hours thats like saying skyrim is generic after 2 hours bc u basically run around in an open world some games you just gotta take your time are journalist paid to say bad stuff about games watch there gona glorify anthem ea and say microtransactions are way to go jesus no i havnt seen an recent apocalypse game last one was infamous 2nd son what 5years ago only thing you can do dang really fortnitepubg shooting is literally the only thing to do in those games whats the deal yo in other words flawed but fun im already sold on this game so pretty much the game aint all that that aircraft looks like a placeholder surely id can do better than that yea it feels like they dont like talking about games let alone play them from the game play on screen the main character is using and chaining powers in both open and closed spaces do these guys know what theyre on about are they even game journalists one of these guys sound just like eric from that 70s show much better watching mute its a day one purchase for me im not a big fan of avalanches world design i feel like the balance between quantity and quality is not ideal im interested to see if they will change that up in this one i dont mind the vehicle controls in bl2 and rage you get used to them very quickly feels like the guy played the demo tried his best not to say borderlands 2 and doom are superior games preview of a tiny portion of the game and youre already bitching the vehicles are supposed to feel loose and arcadey at least until you customise them likewise with the story and characters its an ott open world fps not a role player like fallout rage had great characters the light cars went over the ramps easier and the monster truck was harder to control thanks for that lads these guys dont know what they are talking about sad to see looks awesome cant wait hopefully they fix the driving and were good then how to kill my enthusiasm in under 20 mins the graphics are terrible why are you treating the game harshly theres another game about to launch that deserves this treatment its not fair whats this glitteringshiny stuff coming out of the enemies oo it looks way out of place and just flies into your camera position blocking line of sight whats that is this an ability i hope so would not use that if thats the normal ammohealthcredits drop from the start of the game idk if i want to play that anymore oo looks sooo out of place for me sooo wtf is this sht the two morons narrating this are giving this channel a bad name these two seem like theyve both already checked out and couldnt care about giving us some real insight into the game both of their views are monotone and distant making this one of the worst preview videos i have ever seen why does it feel like it is still running on that same fallout 4 engine wont lie would have hoped the atmosphere to be a little more dark still really loved mad maxrage one i trust avalanche studios to deliver a jewel cant wait to see an openworld game how original at least it looks better than wolfenstein 2 and the characters in that game where also caricatures this is a far different preview compared to the detailed and articulate game informer previews makes me wonder gamespot played the same game these guys remind me of that kid in school who slapped together his book report at the last minute right after skimming over the wiki version of the book before presenting it before the class disjointed and lacking comprehensive thought just here to see the gameplay nothing else this game is going to be awesome they sound like they dont know or maybe dont care about what they are saying is that trump narrator tells about how all powers are kinda worthless and guns are better in gameplay shown the character constantly uses powers to traverse the ground or cc enemies gaming journalism not even once he has a drumstick in his hand at all times instantly sets down drumstick another failing bethesda game title okay sounds negative 8 seconds in yeah theyre these type of dudes just watch the easy allies preview so the driving experience is kinda crappy justcausey from the same team who would have tought the game hasnt came out yet so i cant speak personally on its quality but i can feel the apathetic spite lingering on every sentence of this preview i dont need you both to sing its praises all day but you guys sound like you came at it ready to nit pick and downplay everything the character development in this demo for an over the top action shooter was somewhat lacking gee that sure sounds like a valid and important critique and i bet the melee combat in life is strange was lacking too watch these hacks will still give it an 810 or higher while calling it boring and undercooked do these dudes even enjoy playing video games you guys are horrible at previewing upcoming games please just stop the thumb nail is what trump looks like if there was a mutation whats with the low quality textures they seem 8 years old i swear these guys just look for the simplest shit to complain about im callin these people out if it turns out the driving isnt shit gah how are the game textures still so bad it looks as bad as rage 1 did great character models bad everything else lets hope this is better than fallout 76 ps4 or xbox one no audio here thinks the game is heavy on talking and building story and so builds a expectation on that just because people are talking he literally admits to not playing rage 1 and only played it after or before he saw this hmmmmmm sounds like a fairly typical id game very satisfying gunplay somehow chunky yet smooth and a very boring very safe world characters story mechanics just like doom 3 quake 4 wolfenstein i ii rage and almost everything theyve done the shooting and the graphics look amazing but the enemies are barely attacking the player is it even possible to make completely original characters anymore everything has been done the guy is bugging heavy awesome clipping id rather play this than that far cry game i said finally as soon as rage 2 was announced damn this game would benefit alot if it has bordelines rpg elements that first area kinda reminded me of borderlands a lot looks better than anthem man these 2 guys are so lame like get to the point being videogame journalists or whatever you would think theyd get their opinions across somewhat better its like ehmmmmm kinda fairly good not really you guys talk to much bethesda awesome combat well thats a first why the hell are yall reaching so hard to be negative idk why im even subbed to this channel anymore cant tell me a preview or review with being snarky or without adding a meh or trying to break down something good into how its actually not good gamespot is the twitter of games media i havent even played rage nor do i care abt the series but this guy pisses me off for some reason i like gamespot sometimes but wow the gunplay is ok id is developing the gunplay i havent played but i cant see the gunplay just being ok like he is implying i can see that u really sound optimistic about this game gj bethesda pls sell us more skins in fallout 76 until a game journalists calls your game too hard to play is it really a game looks like doom with colors the guy asking the questions seems like he knows what hes talking abt at least thisll probably be one i wait for reviews for i love id but the first rage was pretty mediocre and i dont see this as being a gigantic improvement thus far this is a horrible video these guys dont know how to describe games i winced when they were talking abt the vehicle physics you can tell open world game burnout has set in because theyre struggling to find something unique about the game at various points they point out games that have done specific things better which doesnt mean rage 2 will be a bad game just an average game sometimes par is good enough to win i suppose 410 not enough gender politics crackdown 3 is looking amazing now this looks bloody amazing i wasnt sure at first loved the first game its like borderlandsdoom on acidmdma lol crazy i hope the story really good shame about the driving hopefully they can improve it with patches or can upgrade better cars il get it when it comes to steam might have to wait a couple of years for that to happen though i think it will be like ghost recon wildlands and borderlands combined is sam riegel that voice actor release date is may 14th 2019 sounds like you two have too high of an expectation why do everyone at gamespot and ign have valley girl accent so its doom with a borderlands skin meh help me get 100 subs peace and love always gamer nationhave a blessed day is it just me or is the depth of field effect a little too strong during gameplay idk judging based on how you speak i dont feel like i should trust this review never played rage but from what ive seen this looks good and from what ive heard of you guys i dont think youd review any game positively unless its mainstream triple a title watch the easy allies preview they explain the game much better now this isnt ign so im happy the combat is fairly goodit feels like doom since when does doom only has a fairly good combat avalanche is known for bad driving just cause anyone this is te kind of game were i dont need morons telling me if its good or bad and i can just buy it knowing that im gonna enjoy it this game reminds me a lot of bulletstorm looking forward to it just for the laughs holy shit wellspring got some clout avalanche isnt very good at driving mechanics in general so to hear that its underwhelming doesent suprise me is this doom lol only a moron will pick far cry new dawn over rage 2 or metro exodus please play gta san andreas or gta 5 sure its a prebeta but sheesh that draw distance and pop in they said kinda too much it makes me worried damn they were struggling with this one lol game seems bland just explosions and ooo were wacky thats the selling point i see it and im like hey wheres borderlands 3 funny how i heard a lot say finally does the main character have a voice klegg should a knew how to get to flavor town i used to play the hell out of the first one was excited for this until they decided that its going to be an exclusive on their shtty bethesda launcher no steam no buy the game looks good but i cant pay a ton to have it on bethesda launcher may be have to wait for ever ill get it when the game is free damn wellspring changed radically man they are pretty harsh great vid btw the best game ever wayy better than borderlands all this content is too late ive already beat the game without it now im over it beat the game and ive never seen any cheat codes put donald trump in this because i want to enjoy the satisfaction of seeing bad stuff happen to him in game can we blend him where can i fight this giant worm rage has good shooting mechanics but i feel the graphics are a bit unforgettable i dont know what it is about the graphics but they dont make me go wow i recently bought bio shock infinity that is almost 7 years old and it made me go wow i hope i get the bfg this time because before it would not give it to me even when i link my email think i just encountered one of these worms today south from lagoon if rage 1 saw rage 2 now it would cry and roll in its grave why the massive campy tone shift loved rage 2 but need a new game 4k 30fps option or at least hdr support this game was a disappointment where did the delfino plaza mii channel and megalovania samples go you guys heard that right im not crazy right were the music cameos in the live e3 trailer a hack or maybe the just the person streaming wha t is the name of the misic please playing on game pass and is literally the funnest shooting since ever will buy the dlc after id are the best in fps games period i cant buy this dlc ps store love this game love all the sick stuff in it i hope the next dlc has sarah from rage 1 its so weird how you can only buy the dlc thru those rage coin things guess ill pass how do take a concept like open world doom and churn out this level of mediocrity whats the name of the music in this trailer huge lifeless area to explore hype for it who else is gonna wait for the rage 2 complete edition before they buy it i fckn wish rage2 had a arena style mutiplayer pvp mode ooh man would be nasty will there be an actual story this time or are we showing off more game mechanics i have wanted to play with new nanotrite ability is there any news for avalanche studios to make new mad max gameare they waiting for new movie or nothing is planned pleasemake it freeee when i saw this dlc i was happy but when i understood that it is paid i am so angry because of youuuuuu it is the third cool dlc in this game but it is paiiiiiid stop it make it free what are you doing with us who hasnt got any money about time this came with my preorder and now i can finally play it after having nothing left to do makes the game useful again 120 we all know what that weapon is this makes me realize i need to buy the game already hold up people purchased this game platted r2 in 6 days for an open world game thats pretty bad lol should be free game was empty short trash rage 2 as a linear shooter similar to doom would have been much better the action is totally lost in the open world nah bethesda already fooled me once by buying the base game not doing this anymore ps pete hienz grow some ball hair you bald well i guess ill play this nowand wait to get borderlands 3 black friday i would totally play this but my entire save file was deleted thanks to a glitch so how do i activate this i cleared the whole map previously i logged on today and there is a new piece of map but no new missions or locations finally im back playing this game borderlands 3 alternative with higher graphics i could not get into this game this better be free to make up for the poor base game i dont know why this game didnt get the popularity it deserves but i just love this game the shooting and the gameplay is so so fun time to have some more i cant stop hero you awesome games id finally dead city is back this game died so fast and is the sandworm thing in it also my two fav parts about the original tease and i dont see them advertised here whats this song wat about that giant mech you could pilot cool a huge new map area filled with nothing not a living world msica song music please waiting for the 10dollars prize for the whole game man i hope they fix the aiming in this game i hope they have already who does the 8direction aiming anymore seriously try it out the character can only look at 8directions in this game at other games you can look 360 directions as your analog stick points but here you can only move it to 8 really odd i wont lie female villains with a masculine presence are not all that intimidating did they fix the in game menu my game froze 10x whenever i switched between tabs 120 bfg skin confirmed havent played since launch time to hop back in so has the gore been fixed yet picked this game up on sale and its fn fun how do you get to the new region is this free or isit paid expansion man is that yuri lowenthals voice such a beautiful game wish it supported hdr wheres the expansion looks like the exact same content this was on sale for 2999 and i got blands 3 instead almost instant regret so cool i got rage 2 delux for 20 a few weeks back now i get this expansion as well all for 20 quid an effing bargain i dont care what the haters say inspite of a few flaws here and there i think this game is really fun this game couldve been great i was super hyped for the release only to be an empty world bad story and missions one thing i can say is that the gameplay is fantastic it just needed more content all this dlc shouldve been in the game at launch too alot of penetration the void abbility looks fun to use is it me or something going on i dont see it on my map where to go there is no main missions or anything anyone having this problem really hope this dlc fixes at least most of the flaws the main game has this game does have potential how do i get to the city game was empty so they could sell us dlc the gunplay is like doom and now 120 we have bfg gun i guess i can buy rage 2 now unfortunately this game was rushed the map is way to big and leaves you with extended periods of time just driving a vehicle that handles like a tin can the combat is fantastic the graphics are outstanding but the weak story and short campaign make it a 20 game at best this plays like an indie game with high ambitions from a small studio when you realize that id avalanche and bethesda are involved all you can do is scratch your head and wonder how thats possible i have never played rage 2 but someone tell me is there only one assault rifle if yes then thats lame and lazy i literally just platinum the game okay time to go back to the killing purchase the dlc through the ingame store tbh left the dlc too late for my liking to the point of me getting rid of the game as its lifeless not much to do new story was there an old but is it free its so buggy and unfinished this game nah youll have to do better than that sorry but i uninstalled your game after i finished your 4 hour campaign new batman game nice i dont have something similar to play after my lovely far cry series everything is turning into a multiplayer loop nowadays this better be a free dlc cool subpar content for a subpar game made by a use to be legendary but now subpar developers with trailers that try to be borderlands gtfo avalanche please give us mod support i beg you people still play this borderlands out with the early dlc sold my copy of rage 2 to gamestop for 11 bucks and it was worth it unfortunately im sure the 300 people who still play this are very excited i really really hope its not the girl you helped in the original rages dlc she even mentions leaving eventually to another island wait this game released this year lol lol this game failed so hard and fast must be best bros with anthem okay do i beat the the main bad guy to unlock it im asking because i dont see it strong female boss but i already have bl3 lol ghost of tsushima i totally forgot about this game did they fix the empty open world problem this should be free the main game is just short and empty the game looks nothing like this on console just so you knowthats on xbox x and ps4 pro it just looks blurry and smooth is this a dlc cant wai to play it is this a free dlc o right rage 2 finally ive been wanting to get back to rage 2 for a while now hype indonesia ready for ps5 it literally starts with well you may be wondering how i got here the meme is so real remember when cheat codes were free and not used as a preorder bonus at 137 that might be nicholas raine the protagonist in rage 1 fallout 76 on day one with online problems i bet yall hmmm borderland some duke nukem and doom vibes gona check out for sure 0200 so they acknowledge it so it must be better now right i laughed so hard seeing that tho i do like bethesda for making fun of themselves i just hope that this game will be just as successful as fallout and borderlands dear bethesda this might be your only chance at redemption and ik you guys wont disappoint 3 at 14 may i i i will buy more games they make some of the most exciting trailers for this game very cool trailer love the back in time effect lol is sam riegel voicing the protagonist this game will suffice until i can get my hands on borderlands 3 for sure lol rage 1 was fun but i dont remember the ending must have been lame i swear this game has that borderlands vibe with the humor and gameplay its basically a more realistic looking borderlands graphically great trailer more games should take this kind of approach 055 its paul phoenix wow this is what i call a great trailer general cross is just a downgrade of mr electric from sharkboy and lavagirl every single trailer for this game is epic sidenote if the male character is voiced by scanlan shorthalt the female better be voiced by pike trickfoot i love the implication that cat videos are as old as the planet xd alright bethesda youre on the right track keep this up and we might just forgive you for 76 at the dawn of creation there were cats xd doom fallout lsd rage 2 finally a peek at the female ranger next week cant come soon enough a videogame being just a videogame i love my cinematic story telling but this looks great will definetly be picking it up after reviews weigh in man if it looks anywhere near as this 4k video i am down cmon looks awesome this game looks so fun borderlands meets bulletstorm i didnt know i wanted rage 2 until i saw that trailer last shot looked like that big snake thing from dunethats awesome the secret armory of general knoxx flashbacks i want it paid off community managers are here saying the same things so to the community managers tell your bethesda overlords to keep stealth price gouging f2p microtransaction models away from full priced model products pick one model or the other not both no handouts like ea work and produce results like the rest of us in the real world to earn our money all microtransactions are a scam keep them out this trailer is so cool please please please include rage 1 awesome trailer hahaha i have played the original game rage 1 still have the game rage 2 here i come this is even better than i thought sums up the entire video lets rage dammit another dumb shooter but hey it feels great playing these every once in a while looks faaar better than the original which i skipped so yup im sold once the complete edition arrives that is clever trailer well done its rewind time the trailer feels like everything was jsut spoiled but ok far cry new dawn rage editon where is doom eternal thats outstanding to be honest the end of this trailer really made my day i love it this will be in the bargain bin within a few month just like all bethesda games 152 ah dang it who let kronika take over for the rest of the trailer here bethesda with graphics like that shut up and take my wife i mean money games come out so fast when you are not waiting for them now thats a trailer this is how a real videogame looks like not chore simulator that red dead redemption 2 was finally it happened awesome totally rewinding i hope the game doesnt rewind lol this trailer is so self aware sam riegel as the main character cannot wait to play this game 204 its disgusting how he took the disc out definitely getting this game would be super amazing to play co op til borderlands 3 comes out we need more co op games on the market they even include the walmart leak hahahha now you may be wondering how i got here well why didnt they lead with the sandworm i am officially sold 218 laughed so fricking hard when that cat came up such a dirty mouth youd think the game was made by yankee millenials aiming towards their peers but its actually yankee loving sweedish people aiming at northamerican market ive yet to experience sweedish culture in videogames because all the sweedish companies making games are too engrossed being part of the pandermachine how underwhelmingly crass story that doesnt take itself to seriously and a awesome gameplay take my money they deleted my previous comment censorship at its finest hype is real gameplay looks legit and i dont care for storylines in fps very coooool insane trailer hope this is not a final boss spoiler thats the definition of awesome hmm our last game wasnt very well received because it was boring and had a terrible ending what can we do i know lets just copy borderlands oh but not too much we need to make it look different i know lets just put the gameplay from crysis in there waitrage 2 actually has sandwormstake notes sean murray lol that was cool wow life was even worse before the asteroid that last part really messed with my mind xd this new doom eternal trailer is great another boring generic fps shooter nicely done i only watched this cause ozzy man reviews but where is he this makes borderlands look like cell shaded better than bl3 in every way i just hope bethesda doesnt go full moron with microtransactions if they do ill wait for a complete version finally a game that doesnt try to act like a cinematic masterpiece and goes all in on the fun make this blue if you love playstation im gifting subscribers 156 thats a dreadnaught 5 or 10 score this look like a cheap ripoff of borderlands this game looks cool but it has the bethesda name on it so i will not buy it i like to pretend this is what the outskirts of night city would look like from cyberpunk 2077 i hope this game isnt disappointing like just cause 4 i hope this game isnt a power fantasy according to preorder bonuses theres going to be a ghost faction as dlc free i think other dlc will be transactional though no smug looking cliff faction who else is more interested in the new doom coming out co op thatd be cool none of these comments make sense borderlands will shred this game im guessing fallout 4 is gonna get creation club content related to rage 2 hopefully wolfenstein as well where is the barrel faction we break everything down on my channel is there a solo campaign because i actually want to have continuation to the story in rage 1 so cool to be on here to make new friends how much people are nice this was great now give us rage 3 this aint the everything vs me trailer daguq ign why is this video at 5 fps 8 hours in and hasnt found gyro copter yet brutal these shotgun interactions remind me of soldier of fortune 1 god that fov platying this on nightmare and this looks so so so much easier def up the difficulty if you want to have fun on this quick look 54mins this looks so incredible casual and mediocre it almost hurts quick look almost an hour long wat ive never played rage 2 one minute later i think this is the level i played at e3 looks fine on the pro maybe the base consoles arent doing it here lately all it seems like is jeff wants to bash everything and ben has no clue about anything im all in for downgraded graphics when you deliver a openworld game with 1080p and flawless 60fps on console he better have the exact same complaints about borderlands 3 because you would kill for something as short as a 15 second cooldown on an ability in borderlands much less having more than one ability at a time half borderlands yes i am vindicated i got so much shit for saying thats what it would be during the e3 preview instead of a screaming mohawked postcyberpunkapocalyptic person with a gun on the cover they should have just had a very average looking person in the midst of a deep yawn fucking wild that a game named rage 2 can fail to elicit emotions i dont know if id say that breath of the wild took any risks or made any advancements in the open world genre it was still just the usual here are like four or five things to do in the open world and then some story should you wish ill just say this it looks more fun than borderlands ill probably pick this up later on for 25 or something i thoroughly enjoyed mad max despite its many flaws so id probably enjoy this similarly but with much better on foot gameplay the mad max game was not bad jeff mad max is so underrated one of my favorite games of this gen honestly i still go back and play it just the feel of tearing around the desert in the car is so unique are there like supposed to be shadows or lighting effects or something i didnt realise this was such a generic busywork open world game been enjoying this game in some videos im doing about 2 hours in so far if youve played mad max or far cry the bandit camps are very similar clear out the area kill dudes open chest at end best part of the game is definitely the parts parts id worked on the shooting feels on par with doom minus the glory kills the shotgun is very much the doom shotgun with a fun slug alt fire when you aim down sights weapon wheels are a plus and the driving is silly enough looks like its another case of these weapons and abilities are cool n all but i juuusss shoot guys nhead wi mgun squicker is this running in the same engine as doom between how it runs and the weapon design it really just looks like an open world mod for doom or something the pink and purple and neon in this game is just so strange i normally agree with what jeff thinks about most games but i have gotta say he seems like he is going out of his way to make the systems in the game sound bad i have played the game for about 8 hours as well and the combat and abilities are tons of fun and absolutely necessary you are meant to juggle between your weapons and abilities in this game and yeah its boring if you just shoot everything with the assault rifle any game would be but when you combine your skills and some of the weapon mods you can do really impressive and fun things in combat that feel really good to pull off i think jeff has prejudged this game a little too soon or hasnt gotten the flow of the mechanics down yet its way better than he makes it sound in this quick look is it just me or does the game looks blurry lowresolution textures looking forward to jeff and bens dr ksavirs cosplay not sure which one will be riding the other but im stoked for it regardless also when i hear jeff say mad max was bad it reminds me that i hardly ever agree with jeff on anything and its a shame that he spends quite a bit of time trying to rally the rest of the staff into thinking his way during the convoy ben this seems kind of fun is this what the mad max game was like jeff no the convoys are directly taken from mad max and they were the absolute best part of that game i get jeff didnt exactly enjoy mad max for whatever reason but give credit where its due eh been there done thatbut if i was still a young goober about to go on summer break this would be entertaining for sure bens point about how the game seems different to how it was promoted seems a little odd to me i mean i guess its true they did try to push this as this big wacky chaotic thrill ride and a lot of people seem to be saying they got a similar impression but for me as soon as they showed the first bit of the actual game it seemed like it would be exactly this not really particularly outrageous in any way just theres some pink here and there the collectathon genre really went in a strange direction someone will make a better rage 2 in dreams this definitely looks like a video game ass video game generic arcadey boring refunded this after 57 minutes thanks to steam the game is just so generic i couldnt continue graphics are awesome but i think ill just wait until borderlands they summed this game up perfectly at 3100 the attitude of the trailers has been reduced to pink ui elements 2714 ben you look just like this thing this looks like a washout bulletstorm especially the enemy designs oh its one of these seems like the assassins creed of fps the ai looks like trash they can dress up the gameplay all they want but it will not have any depth without enemies that make your brain actually pump some brain cells out of all the open world shooters this year so far i am buying metro exodus instead first impression it looks like mad max but with neon quest markers on the road guess they needed more andrew wk just four more hours come on pure mayhem is brad dead or something havent seen him in anything recently people have a weird soft spot for that game yea cause mad max was a pretty cool game i had a lot of fun with it how about you try pointing out things you do like instead of everything you dont for some reason i thought people can fly of bulletstorm fame was making this now that i know it is avalanchethe mad max team im not so disappointed this is actually impressive compared to that 54 minutes isnt a quick anything id recognize that voice anywhere its sam riegel from critical role looks like a game ive played many times before but with a fresh coat of paint i think the fact that hes playing with a controller make the game look much more cheesy not crazy about the pink arrows on the road to guide you the color looks too much like the youre going the wrong way arrows in other openworld games dad and great grandma eating raisins there seems to be no focal point to any of game play guess bethesdas gonna add giant bomb to their blacklist now this basically just looks like mad max you know what this game is barts dinosaur toy he bought 1137 because why just shoot something when you can force power it what a baffling thing to ask game look fun pick up tomorow morning looks fun rage style with fallout 4 sandbox style glad i preordered what happened to the tight corridors man this looks boring damn this is a bummer i really wanted an open world doom but it seems like all the enemies are too dumb to make the combat fun and all the level design is very generic cool another fps that looks like every other fps kinda id prefer id did their own thing havent watched the entire ql yet but i dont get why they felt the need to insert bulletstorm esque colors and humor into the tone of this series some of the original rages most appealing aspects were its visceral violence and somewhat bleak setting also whats up with the blurry ass focusing distance on this one cant say i was intrigued to check this out after the initial trailers despite enjoying the original and seeing it in motion now does little to inspire much interest either what you havent met kvasir yet cant wait to see how the pros play on ultra nightmare with all these tools at their dispersal still the action looks like it should be denser a little more doom level design and less farcry imo playing the pc version with a controller seems odd it takes away the smoothness of the aiming is 54 minutes a quick look for you perfect example of how trailers can hype a game up to be super exciting when its not nearly that cool pretty disappointing this looks as bad as the first and from what jeff is saying they oversold it like the first also mad max was much better than this massive turd in all respects especially vehicle combat far cry is a single player game far cry 5 and new dawn if you dont play those 2 player you are playing them wrong jeff that being said running around with a dinosaur head is funny gun skins no one can see anyway i look forward to buying this on steam summer sale on the cheap in a few months this looks a lot like mad max swapping melee for gunplay is it going to be multiplayer like fallout 76 doesnt have to be bad to not be worth playing i loved mad max when that game came out put like 60 hours into it if this is close to that but with better gunplay and combat then thats great to me im still exited to pick this up this week refunded my preorder because of this video thanks rage 1 is awesome visuals if you put close range texture loading aside are great weapon feeling is superb idtier story is pretty good for that genre coop mode is finely crafted when ive played it first time cinsidering outrage about tectures it was 710 for me after completing it 3 times now id say solid 910 damn it doesnt look like how it was advertised im going to still get it tho kinda underwhelmed by this by the trailers and stuff it looked like an over the top wasteland adventure like it was trying to be borderlands but crazier instead it looks more like a far cry game meh am hopeful for b3 though well this is definitely a software product quick look almost an hour lol mad max convoys were actually pretty good meh that muddy blurry pinkish look is not doing it for me that convoy segment was 100 mad max this looks way more similar in tone to rage 1 than i expected damn this looks really boring is there a way to disable those gaddamn hit and death markers the commbox eh 2030 rage is set in a postapocalyptic near future following the impact of the asteroid 99942 apophis on earth this video is making me wish this was a linear game look like a decent enough time gunplay looks fun 2356 i get that playing games while talking and trying to be entertaining is hard buuuut why did you not take out your gun and kill that thing as soon as it appeared on screen like what is this scrub level play im not expecting pro level play but at least pay attention to whats happenig on the screen i think ill just stick to days gone for now and wait until this goes on sale it does look pretty good but it doesnt look full price good that doesnt look or feel anything like i thought it would just too many video games coming out and now games need to try harder to get peoples attention 1499 is the price ill pay for this looks like it could be fun for a few minutes but it looks like the above ground pool of video games i think ben was thinking of rob riggle as far as i know rob huebel was not a marine people seem underwhelmed but im very much in the mood for this sort of thing right now if they somehow decide to implement a br mode then all that fractured lands i was somewhat interested in would establish a nice little niche in this br gaming phase we are still in games with multiple gameplay option in one package should never me looked down upon this game doesnt look bad but nothing stands out except the colors definition of a sale game this is a video game ass video game looking at this gps colored road would be neat to see in the future two directions design the fastest route to destination as a color design and then another one using roads and safety with a different color design maybe console players should invest in a graphics card i dont believe for a moment that a gamer doesnt own a pc in 2019 not a fan of multiple ads in the videos especially when theyre advertising the game im trying to watch the rob huebell or rob cordy mental image is a weirdly frequent problem so doom 2016 mixed with mad max open world wolfenstein 2 crazy story telling the mad max game was not bad one of the better designed games in recent times i get that tastes are a thing but i think its unfair how much that game gets criminally over looked theres so much more aaa games that are supposedly amazing that do less than that game the game industry right now is not doing anything so incredible that games like mad max can be relegated to being labelled as bad find a different word man why do i want a vr mode for every fps now all i can think of when i look at this is how much more fun it would be for me in vr it looks like everything it was supposed to be maybe a bit less i could see myself enjoying it once it goes on sale this seems like a just ok video game ass video game but thats kind of what i want right now so ill probably still get it at some point in a couple months when its on sale guess ill just rent it then this seems okay tone seems completely different than what was advertised i absolutely forgot this was coming out i wonder if that in itself says a lot about this game unless its a later game thing the lack of a quick stylish bigweiner enterexit vehicle action feels like a disservice to the game saints row did that damn well and im struggling to recall many games afterwards that have adopted that style of vehicle controls looks like just another brown drab open world game shouts to the marketing team for giving the impression its not this looks remarkably tame man that thing is just full on wearing a giant full diaper huh just choogle pantsing it this looks like nothing i feel the void looking at it am i blind or is that some serious graphical downgrade from when the game was first shown too much to play right now for me this will be a potential buy a few months from now on sale actually a few months from now ill be getting borderlands 3 hrmm looks like ill probably never play rage 2 bummer that is the limpest shotgun reload animation ive ever seen ive been really looking forward to this quick look not much detail of its actual quality out so far and this is the best shot at me seeing if its worth my money considering this game lists gtx 970 as a minimun system requirements card i dread the visual fidelity of base consoles versions my poor xbox one s edit my bad the minimum is 780 but its still way more powerful than the base consoles jebus jeffs mic is hot screeching a bigass open world map with dots on it i cant i wont i hear this games all the rage i like the old one better 632 is that general death head from wolfenstine this game is like a mixture of borderlands 2 doom and just cause 3 i had no idea that zack cursed this is how much he said oh shi v hol up the bfg is from the doom franchise right unless this is doom or a spinoff am so lucky i didnt have this video on my tv couse of shit this is actually my first time hearing him curse one time i said to my dad i am vary good at driving and than i fell of a cliff and then my dad saidperfect first time ive hear him cause however you spell it 610 thats what she said this is boring dear zack i was watching you in 2014 when you were playing plants vs zombies garden warfare 1 now im 12 yrs old but thanks for showing me what is gaming in childhood without you today i werent play games thank you my angel 100 family friendly your voice hasnt changed after 5 years granny broke the game lol the one in the dress xd zack is it possible u can play as bayonetta super smash bros ultimate thx zack there is a new charater in super mario tennis aces please check it out ok next save the world vid the luigis mansion series is what made me subscribe bro is it just me or is his channel dying he has 3m subs but get under

the main reason i click to see the videos 1010 zack hello first love the song cant wait to have a mech to mech battle loved the game rage 2 but tbh this isnt much love the mech though but this is too little maybe like 5 new guns maybe 5 new bosses new edition for rage 2 but ghost is back same smug cliff well theres not enough content for the price fun gameplay though i preoredrd this game best choice think what you will of the game itself no one can deny they are the best at making trailers for it still looks boring the open world really ruined this game is this game from the company that used to make saints row great game this is paid dlc love this game 015 nintendo switch play station didnt go to the e3 stop the clickbait when they fix the 8direction aiming ill get interested no modern game should limit its aiming to mere 8 directions i was expecting ffaf all the rage it was fun for a bit the gunplay is nice then you just get op and the challenge is gone and then you clear the map and theres nothing to do which is a problem with a live service game this doesnt seem like itll keep me coming back for more than a week clickbait using e3 every day improves your toxicity as company i regret of buy my ps4 i will not buy ps5 because of ps classic ps plus price etc i was sonyer but not anymore waiting on that price drop e3 sony something is wrong 1120 octane from apex the game is ight looks like a failed attempt at a doom type game rage 2 hurry up and go on sale for 10 bucks so i can play this sony you decided to skip e3 this year stop it bit late to the party sony pc was asssssszzzzzzzzz now bring in the heatsony and ps4 and whoever else wish more games would add cheat codes like in the old days cool cool trash great game how long to beat rise of the ghosts expansion gurl has a boomerang soldlol got a platnum in rage 2 time to redownload the game and get all the trophies again lol person opinion the game is a solid 710 just to play for fun but the traversing gets annoying rage 2 is since march still on my harddrive and will now be for even longer i love it 33 i dont know which kind od filters theyre implenting in their trailers but the final game on console x or pro does absolutely not look like this trailer worst game i soent money on in this generation this is an absolute no go how the hell do i reach the island using my old saves now this is a dlc if this shitfest of a sequel actually improved upon the original rage instead of trying to be a boderlands clone maybe i would even consider buying it sarah kerrigan and the first male voice was jim raynor from starcraft are you serious this game is horrible no one is talking about this game it never even shows up on my youtube feed thats how you know that no one is interested in trash competely horrible shoutout to the bfg 9000 as long as there are respawning im in soundtrack was awesome underrated game one of the best gunplay of this generation this game still exists is this a dlc this game has always struck me as worth waiting for a game of the year edition now i know i was right rage 2 electric boogaloo the first rage was boring so is this with the main game being as shallow as it is this should be free i remember being so hyped for the first game sadly i never played it but that game looks better than this one imo this game looks like its trying so hard to be borderlands they should make a goty edition of this and include a remstered version of the first game cool a way shitier borderlands sign me up why play rage when you can play borderlands 3 im sure both of the people that enjoyed this game are excited weak storyline execution can already tell jesus i havent even completed the campaign yet why is the bfg red unfortunate to say but rage 2 is a dead game already this is way better than getting quake quake 2 or quake 4 remasterwed so rather have this than doom 64 remaster for xb1thanks for nothing i guess great shooting weak enemybossencounter design the false advertising used for this game was enough for me to trade it in everything is drivable yet hover boats and king squasha are not okay i hope the island is small yet cool to explore or have more stuff in it like friendly npcs or some cool sites because the originals problem was that its open world was so goshdarn boring and its driving so goshdarn clunky its a chore to maneuver but oh my gosh the weapons feel great looks more and more like a heavily featured womens borderlands that wants to be woke ill still wait till it goes dirt cheap i hope it has a decent story this will probably be longer than the campaign in the main game 044 one if the best shooters ever yeah right id software its ok to let go of this failure of a game i only give a slap to the wrist for making doom fun as hell but rage 2 is dead rage 1 was ok the post apocalyptic setting was ok with a horror vibe sprinkles on it theres no need to drag it more further than 6 feet below the ground anymore may you rest in pieces rage2 wow great trailer maybe fix your base game so i can ya know beat it no thanks already did 100 no moar okay commandant steele i bought this game and immediately regretted it definitely a let down without the open world and more horror atmosphere like in rage 1 would be much better i hope they do so in rage 3 if they ever bringt it forgot this game came out definitely going ghostbusting later today i didnt even know rage 2 existed lol almost forgot about this game one years work after release and all theyve got to show for it is a laser pointer yeah hard pass ill stick to borderlands 3 love this game cool time to hunt some ghosts is that sam riegels voice 040 why is every villain female now so does bethesda need my credit card info and social security number again for this i never finished the base game story was sooo boring so basically more of the same but now everyone is covered in glowing blue lines wraiths mom this looks like a proper dlc not some 20 minute mission or useless cosmetic also this isnt out yet i forgot about rage 2 id buy the dlc for this gameif i was able to get half way through just the core game without it becoming a almost completely unplayable peice or laggy garbagebarley played it only for about 2 hours and it became almost unplayable with how many ais that are spawned in a single location waiting for goty edition so its a ragdoll sim now why they cant make cod ghosts 2 batter also why does that boomerang thing fly behind her head when she throws it forward lmfao fuckin trash dlc for a dead game nice yes i enjoyed rage 2 and looking forward to this dlc i forgot rage 2 came out we need bullet storm 2 recently picked this up on steam for less than 15 this dlc looks like its worth picking up as well i have a feeling noob saibot is on contract for this i dunno why but the aiming in this game felt rigid i tried adjusting the settings but it felt to stiff to turn and shoot and im comparing this to the fluid shooting styles of halo or overwatch is there a certain setting to make the shooting smooth cause i really like the game but that aspect made me put it down and go back to halo and titanfall this game need coop mode underrated game of the year very few games give you so many tools to kill enemies such cool visuals interesting world i been waiting for something like this cuz the main game is way too small cool i enjoyed the man game early squad im shouting out my next 10 lyl sbsribers dont miss out peeps its legit rage 2 was a real disappointment i was really hyped and then after i got it it was something else the world is boring the characters are boring theres nothing catchy after playing for a while the only thing i enjoyed ankit the game would probably be the fighting system guns and the others if your reading this iv stolen your wallet i rented rage 2 about 3 hours in an audio glitch ruined the game and i refused to restarti tried reloading old saves and it was broken this is a game trailer does it matter if youre first basically rage trynna make more money is it free first first what is wrong with his accent where is this guy from and what is he saying it looks like it has spartan ability this seems fun but it also seems like the combat might get boring after a while if youre too op seems like there is a big risk of that the fights will be too easy be stationary in the air srsly who wants that only means everyone can get an angle on you at the same time looks like someone had been playing bulletstorm and decided to borrow a bunch of those abilities for this game i enjoyed rage altho the ending was a massive disappointmentthis isnt really looking anything like the first game more like mad max with powers so im not immediately drawn in guess ill wait and see i guess hercules is directing rage 2 so prophet from the crysis games is all hopped up on goofballs and lsd and wandered into borderlandsfalloutdoom sold cant wait to double yampp the first rage was a huge disappointment but ill wait and see how this one pans outs overpowered abilities play warframe im sad to learn that this game wont be available to most of us on pc they are not going to be selling it on steam and are using their bethesda launcher to sell it instead you know the same thing they sold fallout 76 through and then refused to refund people on the platform they switched to in order to provide their customers the best possible experience there is no way i would ever purchase a game from their website after what they did with fallout76 over powered dont you mean fun they gave him aard im with it looks kinda repetitive i got bored of the fist slam just by watching the video is there any hope for some variation the map looks small the vehicle parts are just a road to the next area looks limited open world movement and it basically move to each area kill everything not seen any rpg elements wait for sale game looks empty whats the end game any ng will there be coop in this game i cant understand him whats a double yump reminds me of bulletstorm looks fun wasnt really sure about this game for watching the trailer but now im excited the pink and purple colors of the hud and the game in general is killing the mood of the game for me at every turn pink and purple colors are repeatedly splashed all over the screen i keep thinking am i watching a barbie or my little pony video while watching rage 2 media i have to remind myself several times that this is a post apocalyptic game the persistent splash of pink and purple prevents the game from feeling like a post apocalyptic world at all to me i loved the first rage played through it three times after seeing the gameplay and trailers of rage 2 i think i will have to pass this franchise is ruined now imo well back to metro redux fallout 4 and the original rage for that great post apocalyptic experience wow destiny 3 is looking good none of em powers are very creative a ground slam ability a force wave power a shield ok happy to see magnus just cause series went down without him after just cause 2 mad max was still a great game because it was developed vom avalanche stockholm i wouldve never guessed thom yorke would be the game director for this game rage 2 will be underrated too and will have low sales if you release it only at bethesda launcher you should sell it through steam dont be dumbs im buying it just because he wears an entombed shirt avalanches open worlds are as lively as a morgue this not only looks like a major step up from the first rage but also one of the most promising shooters of 2019 rage 2 doom eternal metro exodus far cry new dawn and most likely last of us part 2 in 2019this year is going to be amazing i notice in all rage 2 videos that the ai is terrible my only concern is the one i read about the enemys artificial intelligence weve really only seen combat of the goon squad who seem intentionally stupid by design as well as some mutants controlled by authority gear which might also be stupid by design its possible that different enemies will be much smarter in combat its just a shame they have not shown any real smart enemies if they exist in the game so we dont know if they exist they might they might not yes lets call them op and get yet another single player game nerfed except this time do it before it even releases gore yes hmm if this is coming may 14th then doom eternal must be after that have to wait so long can we rip out enemies intestines and strangle them with it or jump rope with it i look forward to the game but if there is one thing id change is the way bodies explode it makes i look like a blood balloon popping if there could be more guts and body parts in the explosion i think it would increase immersion a game full of fun that ik i will enjoy playing ok this game has very obviously taken inspiration from halo 5 with that hover in air aim and the ground slam shatter is pretty much furoda i hope this game will have the feeling of dread that the first game gave i must say that this is shaping up to be a very good shooter second best after doom eternal d bring this on steam 256 holy sht they literally just crushed an enemy with a car i already wanted this but nowday one purchase crysis reboot this game is insane literally still got 1 question do i get this on xbox or playstation what exactly is the point in having health packs or a regenerating health system if your overpowered ass is just going to steamroll everything in existence the ai in this game doesnt even look smart enough to handle your godlike stature nor do they seem to be able to adapt to any of the players movements or attacks they all just stand there out in the open wilfully allowing themselves to get killed while peppering the player with bullets where the exactly is the challenge here its like bulletstorm far cry and doom conceived a baby together which was rage 2 i dont really care about the open world stuff of this game which i know would disappoint the gunplay fucking fantastic thats why i am excited for this game so do they consume some sort of energy or are they just on a cooldown this dudes pretty metal nope boycote bethesda please stop malee powerup and insert again 1 the craftableportable turret sentry turret 2 radiocontrolled toy car with explosive 3 sentry bot mechanical spider rtherwise it is not rage no fucking way is that a dismember t shirt im concerned this game is going to have a steep difficulty drop once you reach a certain skill level given the player seems to get access to near goidlike powers and im only hoping at this point that the enemy combat ai for various enemies is competent and challenging enough to negate a difficulty drop it seems they have thrown in many overpowered abilities but without science fiction logic behind them and gradual development they make the experience cheap his tshirt is a fake band right oh good so this is their answer to destiny thats nice but is there a good story and missions im hyped for rage2 and outer worlds no steam no buy bethesde saver just cause 3 has the mouse offset bug and terrible vehicle control just cause 4 has terrible graphics and poor mkb control and also a bug where you can zipline to a wall and be stuck in ragdoll state cant move or untether at all so the only way to fix it is to restart the game rage 2 will have some stupid bugs as well im sure of it double yumping looks fun i need this game rn coop would be nice too fingers crossed they need to put these powers into a halo type shooter no multiplayer coop pass borderlands x mad max x me andromeda fuck yes sign me up this looks dope cannot wait to double yump in may i cant wait to play this wow the gameplay looks so fun looks nice but a coop option would have been perfect for this cant wait to double yump the hell out of a bunch of enemies 042 did that fucking guy just say double yump those crazy swedes avalanches open world with ids gunplay sign me up he looks like hercules from the 90 tvs show does every game need to be a large open world sandbox i feel like a massive burnout is imminent if devs keep trying to push this empty envelope frankly i am a bit worried that this might end up being an issue with cdprs cyberpunk game there is such a thing as too much is this rage or bulletstorm never played rage but i love the shit out of bulletstorm rage 1 was boring these power abilitys r gonna kick ass cant wait for this game in 2019 doom and crysis vibes are real this is the only issue im happy to live with rage 1 you never had super powers so why have them in rage 2 and we get destiny guardian abilities this game is gonna be awesome im sorry but all of these abilities are rip offs of ones from other games any original ones bethesda should just use this engine to create fallout starfield and elderscrolls gameplay always comes first but imagine fallout looking like this what the fuck are they thinking copying mass effect biotic powers ic so doom got destiny abilities that are explained by nanites awesome i love it gameplay looks like warlock and titan hybrid look i played the 1st 2530 minof the 1st rage and figured it wasnt for me just didnt click but these few glimpses that ive been seeing have truly got me hyped for its sequel i mean cmon the dude ejected from his car like batman then ground slammed on a bunch that shit looks awesome i was super excited for this game until bethesda decided to make it exclusive to their bethesdanet launcher and miss steam fuck that shit my most anticipated game so basically destiny i wish my name was magnus the first game was so underrated glad they came back with this i hope theres a couple more that are left unknown for now as surprises in the game in rage 1 after i saw the resurrect nano trite ability i was hoping thered be more but no now there is and theyre even upgradable its magnus thanks for the info im excited for this game well the game is going to be fun but is bethesda launcher only so i am going to pirate it if this game is exclusive to bethesdanet on pc i will not buy it gtfo with that console foolishness this game reminds me of twisted metal but i hope there isnt exo movement like in cod advanced warfare cuz this is just bad i broke 4 controllers cause of that this is bad ass but is anyone else thinkingdestiny lol umm is this bullet storm i dont know what to get anthem or rage 2 dishonored vibes can i turn theses abilities off rage 1 didnt have or need them and rage 2 doesnt need them i prefer grounded game play and i really enjoyed rage 1 its destiny with story like ive said since the first trailer wingsticks are like destinys grenades they even have the titan shield and the warlock fusrodah this wouldve been top of the list if it had coop or multiplayer this game looks fucking incredible looks like itll be more fun than doom was i the only one that thought the hand in thumbnail was a halo spartan rip im hyped for this game id gunplay in a massive gorgeous open world made with love for pc single player sign me up while the gameplay looks fun avalanche nearly 100 of the time makes massive open worlds that are even emptier than ubisofts so im excited but worried mr magnus thats a awesome indecent and obscene t shirt solid game and shirt what about showing the middle finger and making enemies explode lol it would fit the game really well the game looks like a lot of fun but the ai is what bothers me everytime i see game footage the enemies are just standing out in the open by themselves shooting aimlessly i feel rage 2 is going to be another massive open world with alot of nothing to do a somewhat coherent story with horrible ai 029 what okay one thing to know abot games made with id they never make sense cuz they dont really like realism much and want to add to the gameplay we just gotta stick with id being id but i do have to admit monster bash tv was really frecken weird the awful driving lol besides that great game i love the powers also if i hear another mutant say pizza time he better bring me pizza how many guns can use looks great but im worried about your mention of horrid driving i was hoping itd be as fun as avalanches mad max game played the first game and really enjoyed it but rage 2 looks way better cannot wait its a must buy for me is this going to be on steam looks cool maybe itll be my next game after far cry new dawn which im loving no matter what critics are saying whos lucin hagah loon i got a rage 2 ad before the vid avalanche and their notoriously bad driving programming skills i hope they dont completely ignore the story from the first game of course its a woman who questions everything was going to buy fc new dawn just changed my mind after watching this plays better than anthem the game isnt out yet and im already in love with it xd rage 1 was funny and coop mode was sooo nice thequartering is claiming that this game has antitrump propaganda hes so hypocrite complaining about game journalists are glorified biased political activists when he is acting like one too so entitled about his project of his own gaming website without politics when hes putting his own political viewpoint on gaming too i found the driving in rage extremely easy actually im sure this will be just as easy its not realistic physics they feel more like little rc cars than actual cars this game looks fun i wish more games would just let you have fun and not always try and be cinematic most of the time looks freaking great but why is the only kind of humor gamedevelopers know is lulsorandomxd humor i love the dry delivery of the woman in the video though splits guy in two lovely yes yes yes he moves almost as fast as doom slayer and with the dash and supermode hes even faster thats a keeper in my book game looks mental love it this looks badass this and metro are must buys for me okay i have a very different definition of what the hell i guess this game looks awesome i keep reinstalling rage on my xbo and deleting it after months of not finishing the damned thing this may be the kick i need to get it done this looks like what gearbox were going to do with the original borderlands before that went cell shaded i always loved the animations and movements of the npcs in rage but the pc moves like hes a very portly man on ice skates wow it actually looks like fun looks amazing cant wait loved the first game so doom hell mad max got it 308 so the voice actor from ra series returned there is not much seriousness in this game ya it has good graphics and gameplay will have a weak story probably aimbot was on dear bethesda could you perhaps remaster daggerfall please wait eden as in the eden cooperation ever wanted to be the most badass mary sue in fps gaming this is it why am i still banned looks really good well done to the devs i really hope to add it to my steam library please bring it across some time soon idk why rage had such bad reception i loved it and its expansion pack rage 2 looks like its gonna be amazing i hope that this openworld concept dont feel an empty lifevoid scenario like some open world bethesda games or far cry itself i hope too that i will have a rig to handle this but this is even less probable xd prepare to be hard fucked far cry new shit the boomerang throw animation looks really weak i know the guy from mad max game gonna have another project with id software yeah so no matter how cool they make it look many of us will never preorder it based on experience with fall out 76 bethesdas credibility 0 right now this shit was fucking awesome which is an understatement cool having 2 different borderlands 3 is better than one but can i pay 20 dollars for blue armor im gonna buy this game so fucking hard doom mad max motorstorm pacific rage 2 very naic will there be companions this is one open world i can do without companions but would still like to have one did they added auto save this time after doom i can trust id software to make another cool fps and thus far this shit looks fucking rad rage 1 rage 2 i will try to buy it p doom pnk style is mick gordon doing the soundtrack how many of this is a lie like you fuckin lied about fallout 76 lesson learned dont trust bethesda avoid their crap i know this isnt id tech 6 or 7 but does it use id techs render rage is right i have a raging boner right now thank you bethesda id and avalanche three of my favorite companies all together cant wait for doom eternal happy to play this one while i wait lots of people will be getting this game bethesda were is my game its now the 16th and i have yet you guys have not even shipped my order its still unfulfilled what the hell its going on if i wanted to buy my game in thanksgiving i would had wait to buy it on black friday and way cheaper at walmart if i wanted to have it as a christmas present i would had ask it as a fucking christmas present in december what the hell is going on bethesda i just want my game now bethesda or give me a full refund my money back to buy my game at walmart because this is outrageous bethesda i pre order fallout 76 tricentennial for xbox one x and my pipboy 2000 because i was going to get it on the 13th before reclamation day like that i would be part of the celebration of launch day and have fun with my friends and you took that away from me and now im fucking angry fucking upset and fucking frustrated beyond your wildest dreams at you guys as a company that dont give a shit rats ass of your fans or even customers because its seems underwhelming and minimally better then the original i gotta question is there gonna be any sort of multiplayer like how rage 1 had wasteland legends and that racing stuff idtech shouldnt have outsource this game it doesnt even look like rage weapon designs and animations are dull characters look fugly and lifeless i dont see anything to be excited about there are thousands of generic shooters like this id rather play boderlands again borderlands2009 has better view model animation than this cant wait any way to play in 3rd person or is it strictly fps honestly looks a bit boring she has a great voice but it doesnt at all fit this manner of gametrailer rage 2 graphics vs fallout 76 graphicslol are this weed plants at 115 doomweaponsfalloutcreaturesmad maxdo i even have to sayrage 2 announcer completely free of load screens me take all of my money now thanks i just replayed the first one and i hope we get to see wellspring and subwaytown again but i dont know yet i planning to buy this game influence pretty good i did not think a fast paced open world game could exist doom 5 is kool as fuck tho openworlddoom6 take a shot every time she says wehpins rage was killard way it was with punch shoot drive over no looks amazing so far borderlands crossout rage 2 this game looks so averge like tones of other franchise available in this industry i would expect more from this title the voice we hear i recognize her from resident evil movies i think this game looks amazing but the guy playing it is garbo needs to be fast pased like doom is instead of standing and shooting cant wait to buy it hopefully there wont be a tearing issue like rage has with amd cards otherwise ive been playing rage getting my chops down for this beauty i preordered the collectors edition instead of buying groceries finally rage 2 doom fallout 4 mad max hey a destiny atmosphere without pay to progress bullshits looks like borderlands finely has some competition jumping without cover directly into a massive group of enemies while eating rockets with minimum damage this game is shit rage is giving me some serious mad max vibes and looks to be more promising than its prequel 007 so noone i care about said anything this will be a sleeper hit same topic different graphics with fallout 76 210 if theyre anything like the scorchers theyll be no problem its the authority that worries me somehow this still feels very generic she sounds like that one girl from burnout revenge this is the best scifisteampunk game around when it comes to aaa budget and open worlds okay so lets see here we got walker from rage 2 doom guy from doom eternal and bj blazkowicz from wolfenstein can anything stop these guys calling it now this game will have a mostly empty feeling world with highly repetitive quests 410 while the mad max game inspiration would be consider a positive but there also seems to be lot of bulletstorm inspiration in rage 2 for some it could be good or it could be bad as of july 25 2011 epic games declared that they had failed to turn a profit on the game with just under a million copies sold while rage 2011 had a very uniquebrutalintense gameplay and combat mechanics why copy a gamebulletstorm with mediocre gunplay and combat mechanics instead of building up on strong points of the original rage only buying so i can get some sick dank wingstick trickshots for my montage charlise theron 735 bulletstorm meets doom made by the guys behind mad max i really hate these sanitized voice overs in trailers lately the one for red dead 2 was the worst this is a bad trend great mad max road warrior sequel the combat is similar to destiny 2 and doom holy fuck i want this asap with this fallout 76 and doom eternal seems like bethesda is getting my money this year d gameplay looks the same as the first one worse even itll be a boring walk in the park even on hard mode lets hope it has the same glitch as the first one where it doesnt even let you progress past a certain point on wasteland legends for no good reason avalanche studios eden corporation does this game share a universe with just cause 3 this kind of explanation with a static battle makes me a negative image no more no less i just want the explosion of ready to die music in the battle who would play rage 2 when you can play doom if you havent played the first rage do so youll need it for the second one theres so many returning characters 425 lol his head got stuck in the wall and at 457 the wingstick went through the container love your work looks great cant wait wow looks like an intense actionpacked rollercoaster ride yawn great mad max had plenty of boring and repetetive side activities love the feel so far hope we get to see some old locations and characters besides the doctor and mutant bash tv and please for the love of godlet this have an epic ending who is the womans voice from 60fps on console easy 4k on pc i hope this game has character customization or creation basically mad max fps with futuristic shit looks boring and repetitive im sure you will be running around doing pointless missions in the same areas pretty much your average open world fps i for one liked the original rage sure it wasnt as good as it could of been but they could have made rage 2 be that but better now its a generic fps and honestly looks like a reskinned doom not impressed and i can almost assure you it will flop 720 lets play hot potato with agrenade 722 the result please dont fuck up the pc version like the first one was so fucking shitty is their any more guns she keeps saying you have a giant arsenal but i only ever see three guns oh crap it will not use idtech 6 this game just go and make mad max obsolete in 1 min is this crysis or rage i really hope rage 2 features enemies that respawn in mad max and rage once you cleared an area the enemies are gone forever making it very boring i really hope rage 2 features enemies that respawn in mad max and rage once you cleared an area the enemies are gone forever making it very boring reminds me of bulletstorm is there pvp nothing like the post apocalypse vibe of the first game and trying to survive with original thought of enemies now its just gonna be what all other shooters already did great fuck this is just gonna be piece of crap and what is with all these happy colours if these madman were actually using festival things i would have better time playing it haha this is gonna be max 2 hours brainless shooting and after that imma stop playing the game and im just gonna forget that i even got the game expected way more of this title mad max doom sign me up i look forward to this game im glad its going to be more open world this time looks great so far but i kinda wish the game had some gore why the f do they put such crazy amount of motion blur and tight fov that makes me motion sick lets hope it is fully adjustable everything else seems very good so far and hopefuly not too easy this time and with a real ending funny we can activate a quad damage at any time doom wolfenstien quake fallout elder scrolls madmax rage 2 at this point bethesda might as well give back the fallout series to brian fargo can we get one of these for 76 please p missed opportunity not calling overdrive rage attacking convoys was one of the best parts of mad max i saw two glitches lol awesome looking game though nobody does it like bethesda these days multiplayer mad max is one of my favs i am glad they have made a sequel with a different name my xbox one x is fucking ready game looks like rage doom coupled with bulletstorm if it was on steroids instant buy is it just me or does the player character sound like hes voiced by johnny yong bosch looks good i will buy it if there are realistic tracks in the sand this looks fantastic i wonder how close the ps4 pro can get to this at 30fps i doubt my rx 580 would do much better anyone else want that mini card game in rage 2 i really hope they bring it back call me lame but i played that for hours in rage 1 well pretty disappointing looks great but the gameplay bloody hell i will fall asleep thx to being sooooo slow no speed energy or tempo all hell breaks loose and the player goes well i am just gonna move over here extremely slow heck looking at the movement i walk faster in real life whf is up with that was looking forward to the game but after this extremely disappointed this looks like the child of doom mad max and bulletstorm sign me up would be soo much better if they were using pc based gameplay not the staged console crap replaying first rage atm cheers buying this bethesda have their fingers in a lot of pies fanfreakingtastic i had a smile on my face the whole time ive been hoping for a sequel to rage since the end credits rolled on the first one i loved the first one although like most players the ending was lacking it does look pretty fun but i remember enemies being extreme bullet sponges in the first game now it looks like its still only somewhat like that 150 is the most generic fake accent that sjw logo subscribe me guys annoying accent of the character why they did it rage 2 fallout 76 dont me wrong i love it but is it really rage genuinely im more excited for this than doom eternal and i am pretty darn excited for doom eternal i cannot be the only one who noticed that gunbarrel was mentioned in passing in rage 1 too 455 that and it comebacks through the wall wow this game looks so generic its probably fun enough butit looks like the game theyd have playing in the background of law and order this is not id tech6 i liked the grittiness of the first rage this looks like theyre trying to mash borderlands quirkiness with some force powers hell the ground pound looks like it got taken from halo 5 im definitely not impressed they should just focus on doom eternal wish list rage doom and dyinglight 2 so hyped for these couldnt give a fk about anything else i really liked the first rage apart from the ending and this looks so much better this this is exactly what an extended gameplay should be and i love it great work guys it honestly looks incredible and i am that keen to get my hands on it keep it up ok you got me with this trailer that scream your character makes when he goes into overdrive the same one in the beginning of the video sounds so fucking amazing it fits perfectly with the style of the game and the overdrive mode holy fuck literally that one little sound effect got me so much more hype destroy convoy stuff is definitely from mad max which was made by the same studio bethesda is the reason i switch to pc gaming im so excited i beat the first game like 20 times and loved it everytime im so happy rage 2 is coming out im gonna have to get a new game system since mine broke but its no problem cant wait xd makes me want to play the first game its just been sitting on my self barely played much when i got it this is what happens when you take too long to make borderlands 3 someone does it for you with better graphics so the overdrive ability is the literal part of rage may contain content inappropriate for children it sure the hell better also clergy and mothers and civilized people everywhere this looks fun this is a cult video game so if you didnt like the first one you wont like the second one the first one was labeled open world but it was linear open at best this one seems truly open world so im very impressed so far i cant wait to add this amd doom to my library really pumped for this one and openworld tboot awesome definitely gotta give rage a replay now avalanche studios are the ones who made mad max correct if so this is going to be epic so awesome i cant wait rage 2 day one for me alright now studios are collaborating can we get id and bgs to team up and make the real prey 2 that looks way better than the original i really hope the jackals or jackal group make a return kind of looks like its sort of full of multi coloured sjws that survived the apocalypse and you get to kill them all why does the video have a link to the ducktales theme this is even slower than doom 2016stop dumbing down our shooters yeah that wingstick looks stupid the rest is fine 045 dude look at the mountain very ugly unholy rage welcome to the all new wasteland rage hype ps sadly they again used a fing controller to play or i am wrong id should be played with a razor sharp mouse and keyboard setup the only way to play and enjoy the full spectrum of a fps play it hard or go home is tank girl lori petty narrating this from what i see all those abilities are way too slow it takes so much less time to just shoot them all espetially the windstick which is way too slow you can just run to the corner and shoot the ennemy thats faster and what makes them even more useless is that enemies die instantly from from a single bullet maybe two well shatter is a good ability actually takes less time than shooting looks like it was marketed for brofags or normieslets try it outguy gets flown back 2 feet player character goes wooo like really but heywe already know its going to be at the very least decent so i guess its better to use marketing on the inbreds are convoy races dynamic or resetable unlike in mad max you can only do it ones i just hope this wont be online only unlike fallout 76 fake gameplay is fake check your hype edit even faker after watching whole thing shit is getting ridiculous these days definitely fake as fuck is this excellent video voiced by santanico pandemonium from from dusk to dawn tv show the super hot and incredibly sexy as fk eiza gonzalez beware the mutant crusher walks right towards it linear story specifics and blunt bots the character animation quality in rage 2 looks worse than what was displayed in the first game its like a lofi high tech mad maxcount me in if yer not into 76 then just play this basically fallout it seems but diff names and paint getting this one for sure around corners also yayyyy looks easy as fuck the gun its doom run and fire titanfall 2 it looks exactly like doom just different skins might as well not even make both games animations look weird this game will suck that commentator is almost as cringey as the one in the destiny trailer this game is rock the driving reminds me of the mad max game by avalanche not much is shown is there multiplayer how do the menusui look is there character customization is it an rpg will there be dungeons is there romance etc also what happened to the ark guy from rage1 alright im in d 1st person mass effect fury road we gotta support this like doom if its good my bros n sisters dishonered 2 new colossus and prey must be vindicated n championed story focused single player will not go silently in the night pretty disappointed bethesda barely resembles the first game does not continue the story and youve gone all punk with it thats just stupid the first game was not like this shit the new doom and wolfenstein look great now why couldnt you do the same with rage 2 and continue the story like the others have very disappointed yo did you see that wing stick go through the wall at 458 lol this and the new doom look pretty similar in aspects im definitely not complaining because if this fluid movement is the future of fps games im ok with it the vehicles seem a bit slow is composed of mad maxenvironment just cause red faction driving bulletstormcore game play christ the narrator is annoying as fuck damn this looks promising 458 the wingstick flying back through the container xd we will have legs of first person i want to be more excited for this game than i am im really excited about doom eternal though one of the best and most surprising announcements this year cant wait the game of adrenaline a rolling rube goldberg of pain what does it fry an egg and light a match to fire the guns id seems to have found their footing once again it might be a bit early to say that but right now i think they stand proud on solid ground only time will tell if they slip and fumble heres hoping these games are great bet your candy ass i will be playing this game asap my pre order has been already locked and loaded since the 1st reveal rage2 024 is that a pro genji flop the same guys who made mad max are making this game avalanche studios i loved mad max but thought it lacked depth hoepfuly these guys use those mechanics too if doom and borderlands had a baby trying not to get hyped but damn theyre making it hard not too i really really wan to play this it looks like a ton of fun o im hype for this more than fallout 76 man this looks good why is there a link to the ducktales intro at the end they made the first one look good in the trailers too just take ma money already 457 after kill boomerang fly through the container very nice video but i would prefere to disable audio description part my kind of game looks sick fov seems a bit low totalbiscuit would be so disappointed yo at 345 the uv map on the road doesnt line up properly looks so boring with that tunnel vision fov and enemies seem so weak and uninspiring you can do so much better beth hot potato ending hilarious didnt know michael bay makes video games nowadays looks like alot of fun cant wait it needs coop the first rage has one but for separated short missions specialy for coop gameplay if this thing going to have all time dropin coop it be the best shooter out there just hours and hours with your friends discovering stuff trade group attacks on camps dont show any more ur giving away to much will take this over doom eternal anyday amazing job guys just polish the game before release with no slowdown on consoles god damn i could feel the rage in my body as im watching this gameplay its too over the top and looks more like doom than rage have to pass avalanche studios mastery of open world emptiness the music reminds me of doom in 2019 i get doom 2 and rage 2 which is just mad max doom hell yea were a great big convoy rocking through the night mmmmmmlooks good but not for me properly tired of the same points of reference being done over and over and over and over again its doomquake bulletstorm rage mad max all over again games being regurgitated now too come on humans can no one think of any new design concepts people will like it though im sure seems cooler than everything else game looks amazing but is the ai retarted they seem like they could join storm troopers because they cant hit anything another open world game which will likely have tedious side quests as filler and will overall just get old quick and lose its novelty a few hours in how about a more focused nonlinear game with more quality put into it instead of a giant open world with as much meaningless quantity put in as possible ok now i need to reinstall rage 1 because of this hype hype all aboard that looks really good is just me or is this framerate all over the place doom eternal and this in development at the same time and both look amazing super excited this narrator is retarded oh boy fps singleplayer paradisedoom eternal rage 2 wolfenstein youngbloodwhats more of it doommad maxanimal crossing will i be able to buy it on steam i remember when games were about the story and the experience this just screams shortterm product as it goes through a checklist fps 30 fps bye i love everything about this 255 goon squad deftones fans rejoice youve completely misjudged why most people liked the original rage we dont want cartoony punk rocker bad guys we want the simple finding purpose in the world gameplay that the original had looks good but doom eternal landscapes and interiors look more detailed holy cow the narration is awful it feels like shes reading directly from a script for the first time without knowing anything about the game or narrating trailers for that matter i am getting a serious mad max vibe from that convoy chase and i like it looks great but i feel that its missing that grittiness from the original need to see some raw gameplay no cuts shut up and take my money couldnt play rage 1 because of 100000 graphic bugs after buying it for 60 euro and now i should trust that rage 2 is playable hhhhhh looks fucking amazing and single playernever can get enough of it far cry 5 fallout too bad that bethesda does not have good human emulation technology like eg sony has this is the only major drawback in its games that otherwise are fantastic skyrim with guns and cars and drugs hmmmm see a problem here the enemies are just standing around in the open and are much less dynamic than in rage 1 is it just me or mad max on steroids 426 i like how the enemies head clips into the wall and sticks there looks great you cut to a different scene before the body started to flail around while stuck in the wall though the ai animations and hit reactions are a major downgrade from the first game well done i feel bad for the devs but this game is really not doing anything for me this coming from someone who bought and enjoyed the first rage i guess they are aiming at the call of duty crowd hope it works out for them also those guys 200 looked completely ridiculous killed any mood the trailer tried to set when do the game is gonna come out a little bit serious version of borderlands wild i love bethesda is not launching a good fallout this year but is launching a good rage mad max fallout thanks please put korean subtitles in the game korean gamers also want to buy it what are the pc requirements 455 solid clipping doesnt look like rage at all it looks more like colorful mad max sequel that got fckd by the doom guy and btw the wingstick going back to you straight through objects that you cannot shoot through you can see it when that guy gets wasted in the crate wtf are we back at 2000 or what we already saw this at e3 according to this article on ign httpcaigncomarticles20180811rage2isprimarilybeingdevelopedbyavalanchestudiosidworkingwiththemonacreativelevel rage 2 is being primarily developed by avalanche studios with said dev doing all of the actual legwork and id lending creative support how did avalanche find the time resources and people to work simultaneously on both rage 2 and just cause 4 both games feature massive worlds and are huge undertakings will these games suffer in quality because of the division of resources that avalanche will have to make between the 2 games is the studio large and capable enough to handle 2 projects of this scope and magnitude at the same time please discuss will this support vulkan this game looks a lot better than the first one but maybe i was too dumb when i played the first one i waited damn near a decade for this its time why the fuck does there have to be exposition happening in a gameplay trailer i want to actually learn the plot when i play it dont know why but this cringy and cliched commentary irrationally pisses me off the shooting looks like garbage this is mad max with gunsmeh whats that genji bullshit doing in rage 024 honestly that part looked super clunky and a bit cheap hulk the game is coming since when anna faris joins gameplay narrater what mad max should have been yes please cant wait looks good this will be a future hidden gem because the first one didnt get enough attention i like it very much i only would change one detail that isnt very easy to change while there many explosions only less environment is physical moving that is maybe because of the backed textures that improve the performance but it looks for me a bit irritating mad max 2 looks good although the bad uv coordinates at 345 are worrisome the voiceover is terrible does rage hold up should i go back and play it this is the most mad max game ever ill get this for sure this looks positively insane woot wooo just cause plus mad max and im not even complaining im glad avalanche took a lot of stuff from the mad max game this doom eternal metro exodus and dying light 22019 looks like a fantastic year for single player fps like borderlands but with deffrient graphics the interceptor would be wonderful for this game thanks for the trailer bethesda i was having trouble sleeping they should also remake the first game for this gen of consoles crushy crushy cruuush crush p this is going to be only on bdn isnt it so hyped for this game it doesnt look bad at all but i still dont know if it looks good to put it simply it looks amazing huge improvement from the last its kinda missing that dusty texas feeling of the first game yep this certainly looks like a game ill wait an year to get and buy at like 70 off this and doom eternal were about to be spoiled with incredible modern classic shooters i cant fucking wait why in 1st person mode so there is no gear to collect and wear if yes how can we see it while in 1st person mode never thought id say this im choosing rage over fallout no need to incentivize the gameplay with an endless loot grind cause the gameplay dont need a pimp to sell this delicious masterpiece quaddamageevolved i see they have completely copied over the mad max2015 driving like side slams and boost slams and the same convoy system what is this crap its time to party why is every id software video is rendered at below 30 fps please make this a rage to remember a wing stick crotch weapon imagine having both hands full with shootin and mutant dismemberment and being able to call on your trusty crotchpopupmuthasonofadidntseethatcommin wing stick launcher takemymoney this game better capitalize on the massive wasted potential of the first one and now remember how much unexplainable hate the trailer of this game had i still dont get why its awesome looks good but not a day 1 buy ill wait for reviews on this one mad max does someone remember the vehicle carnage i think it looks great it looks pretty but eh aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah this is insaaaaaaaaane so basically youre rude batman reminds me of the madmax game vehicular mechanics looks slightly reminiscent of motorstorm looks dope these rage 2 updates keep catching me offguard this seems quality af doom with lsd this feels more like fallout to me than fallout 76 with a heaping helping of doom and mad max thrown in for good measure incredibly excited honestly never thought i would say that about a rage sequel well looks pretty silly game punching the ground power up bs is turn off was the narrator the same woman from the need for speed game this game looks amazing more excited about this than fallout 76 may contain content inappropriate for children yeah that fov is not for the fainthearted that voice sounds like the same chick from the rdr2 gameplay trailer lol i dont like wingsticks whenever i used them my game would crash this bitch and her larping voice is pure cringe simply brilliant hope they mage a beta for all to play its weird this is the first time in a long time that ive seen a game and wished for coop just the idea of bullet juggling an enemy with friends seems too amazing badass like every shooter of bethesda a100 complete copy and paste of mad max still looks fun ill get it on sale hyped still hard to believe one of my favorite games is finally getting a sequel looks great does this game have companions i know im in the minority and probably not the target demographic but im really interested in the story of rage mainly other arks main protagonist from rage 1 locations from 1 etc is it really rage 2 or just rage reboot those powerupsabilities didnt look too interesting and its kinsa same old same old 152 eden just cause 3 ps omg rage 2 great game goddammit thats awesome preorder incoming i dont need more impressions why is gaming so corny today the way the voice over is presented and worded is very cringe no load screens that says a lot for a bethesda game i want to exchange every minute i spent on destiny and invest them in this masterpiece i dont think i like the world style that much raiders that are colored like clowns and they are all crazy how do they survive where they get water and food why do they even sit at the space center just to be canon fodder for the player other aspects of the game look great though oh god this looks amazing i hope your able to join one of the factions cant wait to play this great i was pretty hyped from the trailer with e3 im not like out of my mind hyped or anything but this game looks damn awesome if its multiplayer pc ill grab it atm playing crossout this game will be amazing those photo realistic graphics oh my god which engine is it running on damn havent really payed this any mind but it looks really good mad max and doom nice avalanche studios apex open world engine is amazing oh hell yeah brother kkona why is the ducktales theme song shown at the end of the video thats hilarious placeholder now that we all know the truth about ign reviews they should not use igns quotes on their game on the other hand super excited loved the first game it looks like fun but it doesnt seem like something i can sink a ton of hours into bethesda is doing awesome imo first fallout 76 and now rage 2 coming up people are pessimistic this game looks good so far powerful weapons ive seen 3 so far basically mad max borderlands 2 mixed in blender looks like an empty worldwill this get boring and repetitive fast very possible this game is gonna be like doom meets ubisoft open world repetitiveness i just looks like doom 2016 but with a twist of mad max i love it damn this looks lit wow looks awesome now im at the point where i just want to play it i liked the 1st one but this looks too silly and overthetop thanks but no thanks this looks cool feels more like a borderlands game than rage rage felt more like a wild west post apocalypse this seems too green people are excited for this this shit looks boring as hell as well as looking generic as shit 30 years after the first timeline explains why shit looks so mainstream and different too bad it isnt a dark beautiful and realistic post apocalyptic game like the first the driving reminds me a lot about mad max its very similar did anyone notice the fps drops in certain scenes i can already imagine what will be the minimum requirements will this have coop 730 anyone else see the duck tales theme song im not tripping am i i want this but at the same time im kind of sad cause i cant preorder this on psn that voice over is annoying fury road asf cant wait for it this is perfect the id knows how to do the the best shotguns shoots this could be my game of the year 2019 exactly what i want mad max style with mass effect andromeda powers original weapons and actionpack missions its not coming soon enough should i get fallout 76 or rage 2 i think it looks fun but you just mow through the trash mob enemies with no challenge at all and i wonder if their unique fighting styles are anything more than standing in the open with poor aim this was a nice showcase to the fun that can be had but if theres little challenge 99 of the time ill pass not sure if thats the case or this vid is merely a demo to give us a taste of the cool shit to do will there be multiplayer on this game or coop why do the people who play these games always aim like theyre not practiced at playing any shooters at all this cant come out soon enough is it coming to steam tho games like this and red dead 2 are making this the best generation for games ever its like fallout but with guns the open world shooter is everything the first should have been third person view rage was fun but it lacked a lot of freedom it was pretty linear and the world wasnt as vast as it looked it looks like rage 2 will fill all those holes the hype is real i like this rockstarstyle trailers with commentary weapons feel underwhelming looks meh bargain bin for me doom and fallout had a mean baby three words red dead redemption ii so no driving offroad its clear that rage and doom games are just a ripoff of 4tnite btw im 12 2 player coop mode at least some of that gameplay was pc there was definitely 60fps at points destiny isnt the eden spaceport the same mission as the e3 demo its weird that theyre showing the same thing that said the game looks really fun this video has a misleading title i want them to make a trailer for the pre oder stuff and deluxe edition stuff whats going on with the glitchy wobbley rockets from the enemy rocket launchers like at 206 every gamer done play fist person and good graphics theres nothing special about this add third person multiplayer and camps and online where other players make there camps and raid others please make a longer campaign duration than the first version is it wrong for me to say this is one of the games im looking forward to the most any chance well have weapon upgrades just looks purely fun played the first game for 1 hour this looks just as disappointing third person plz tired of first person borderlands 3 rip gearbox have fun with happy few lol hello rage 2 and fuck you bordershit 3 bitch any photo mode planned for this game i really hope that the races are completely optional in this game if there was something i disliked in the original rage was the bs of being forced to compete in races to acquire new and better cars please release this on steam bethesda i mean im pretty sure at the ending of rage you just killed some ghouls so the authority being resurgent sounds kind of stupid since you didnt really stop anything 022 holly shit did you see the guy block the bullet with a sword he like a ninja cant wait to play this on my xbox one x day 1 purchase a mixture fallout madmax and of course weapons of bo3 this might be my fallout if fallout 76 turns out to be a bust after seeing doom eternal gameplay this is very tame compared loved the first game and i cant wait for this one 024 genji is that you odd watching skinnyboned female enemy characters acting all machopsychotic lol its so off looks nice but when will they show fallout 76 the fallout 76 we should have of got pretty good aiming for a controller still a million times better then fallout 76 get a grip bethesda looks amazing bethesda masters of saveplayer1 ty if the convoy are as a fun as in mad max borderlands and madmax had a baby rage you are not the father maury povich seriously looking forward to this one i loved mad max and this is from partly the same team so yes please honestly rage 2 is the biggest most promising surprise from bethesda arguably might be better than fallout 76 where is the nanotrite rocknroll racing reborn lol bullshit completely different game and graphics style no buy this looks stupendously amazingly awesome if this is not the no1 game of games of the year top seller with the highest player choice votes i will buy and play vault 76wow i hope im not wrong d soo mad maxbioshockbulletstormthe original rage this game nice looks amazing but the controlling was clunky because of a goddamn controller also i hope theres coop if mad max wassnt aussie enough for you they literally gave this guy a boomerang is torbjorn from overwatch in this game interesting whenever they mentioned the authority they never showed any of the people from the first game humans they only showed some type of mutant its like mad maxdestinyborderlandsquake this looks so good hows the customization is the world an empty ocean does our protagonist speak can we upgrade weapons can we upgrade our vehicles is there branching dialogue can we join factions can we customize our character i just want some information so i can determine if i want to make a purchase because there are so many game coming out and i want the ones with the most content and content that appeals most to me this looks raw yet man the new cod look like freemium compare to this i felt like mad max was super underrated when it launched i loved it so much i enjoyed the first rage game but i have a feeling this one will be incredible it doesnt look like anything special to me honestly kinda disappointed i just bought the first rage with the sale going on so ill be ready for this game as long as you dont show that cringy live action trailer ever againeverything is good i can smell the microtransactions cosmetic only already the game just looks plain so its fallout without vaults this fov hurts my eyes and head i did like the first just needed alot more story looks ok the graphics are amazing but not my kind of game waiting for the elder scrolls 6 mad max and sunset overdrive had a baby damn she looks good to be honest this looks better than fallout 76 and before people say its not out yet just keep in mind that its my opinion and i have reasons why i think its better rage 1 was boring i didnt finish it but it definitely wasnt terrible i liked the combat it was really fun but the world was way too big and i felt like i needed to micromanage and i wasnt able to do much in between shooting and going around im hoping they changes that with this but the combat definitely looks better then 76 many of the games like dishonored wolfenstein and stuff have varried movement and ways to do combat which makes it more enjoyable of course you can drive vehicles and its definitely not something seen in fallout i guess you dont play as the main character from the 1st game looks even more gonzo that the first just dont give it a lame ending too rage was announced before borderlands it was better too for people saying its lost seriousness in rage there were bandits with uk flags on their faces jokes and puns sprayed on walls loads of easter eggs explosive rc cars an over sexualised and over the top dlc character and a mutant killing game show this one already has curled up people crying public exercutions the protagonists family being killed and a city being massacred so think of mad max but with a bit more syfy okay im down all the factions look very similar to ones in rage 1 when you look close or are ones from rage 1 but a bit different the cars also look similar and its cool to see returning factions and new types of enemies in them rate looks amazing but i have to ask is there going to be any weapon customization and vehicle customization like a central vehicle we will customize 507 that 180 turn so more rage 2 stuff but please give us more 76 info looks like theres around 12 different guns so far 4 the player uses which all have a similar style and its cool that the setteler pistol original shotgun and original rocket launcher are in it ok cool but didnt we see all this already im still holding out for the gun and car customisation and mods different armours other guns ammo types more gadgets and npc town areas i played the the first game and it was rentalyet i didnt know wtf i was doing but now that i understand it better i think i will do good if this game has a lot of loot weapons im in i cant explain how fuckin hyped i am for this game it is gonna be so sick i dont think borderlands can compete please have an ending please have an ending d thats very nice but whens the livestream for doom eternal coming this is amazing we need photo mode for this game the graphics and spacial ability this is just stunning what if fallout 5 graphic look like this man that narrator is that the new fab female duchebag it reminds me of that narrator from deus ex mankind divided promoting dlc and such it sucks these narrators sucks non stop erection this game looks fucking awful and the song is even worse i have to be honest i love the language in the video the creative names for enemies is also nice the graphics look great too i cant wait to buy this i wish this had multiplayer or at least 4player co op i am in love with bestheda did anybody even ask for this game yes and getting a computer who can play this thing smoothly will cost me a kidney wish just cause 4 looked this good yes fuck rage 2 fallout 76 fuck this looks fun i cant wait to see more prey content too singleplayer is back baby this feels like doom with driving and open world mechanics didnt get to play rage 1 but this looks great might give rage 1 ago then get this i look forward to driving the vehicles thanks todd rage 2 doesnt have as much hype as it needs to have but i gotta say it sure does look cool why my pp erect wow want this im hyped for it f u c k y e s lol first fallout 76 best game cool and good i pity the fools i used to think gamespot was better than ignnot anymore theyve turned to shit unsubscribing short and simple sounds good to me guy in hat is lame miss this format get your faces offscreen i want a game review not your egos off to watch other vids rather than this they better fix the freezing first of all and then the no sound bullshit this is weird i didnt hear him say fools not even once started playing the game and its amazing and im cool with it 12 hours on easy maybe and very few side quests if you enjoy the game it takes a long time and you get your moneys worth basically just enjoy it and dont not by it because the internet guy said he didnt like it this guys got no idea this game is amazingly fun love it to each their own though 8 story missions bethesda didnt care much for 2 which is why they filled it with skills leveling barely a story at all hope they dont bother with 3 as it might as well be online only since rage 2 could of been a great sequel rage 2 truly shows bethesda lazy cheap ass game making also inspired by doom maybe wolfenstein too but bethesda really needs to stop making every game like doom gameplay rage 1 was original no skills no upgrades just old school shooter now every fucking game has to have skills to upgrade its very annoying that game makers are making skills a requirement for every game everybody in the comment section is hating on the reviewers how about you tell us why their points are wrong instead the following is a brief of issues they mentioned 1 missions too short and repetitive and are not using or taking advantage of the open world 2characters development is bad and the story events dont really have a satisfying conclusion tbh now i like short games rather than endless open world games with infinite things to do short games provide best bang for time ratio if this fool says fool one more time this game is tough old school tough i was gonna ask why they said nothing about the co op or mp experience head over the store to see there is no such function wtf what a miss opportunity right there one of the main reasons i was looking forward to this game was to play it with a friend who i played it rage 1 co op modes so sad reason 1 to play this game lots of fools the game feels empty great world but they could have done more with it thats the feeling i get when playing the game comments section 10 discussing their own opinions of rage 2 90 reviewing the review gamespot should shut down stop saying fool its stupid and makes you sound like a jackwang this is piss poor review shame hate this format i just skipped to the end the worst game review ever i just finished this game i had a blast youre only a bunch of fools 6 is not fair for this game i remember saying i wasnt a fan of the new review format the first time they tried it but most of the comments were like i love this new style of review lol i blame those people if youre going use the word fool this much could you please hire mr t to handle the reviews i agree with the reviewer but yeah presentation of this review is boring at best gamespot review of rag 2 is a sick joke this review is just a shitty as the game itself the driving is fucking horrible in this game it has potential but falls way short of the glory this game should have been called rage fools 2 l cannot unsee those incisors i agree with everyone else in that the review format needs to be reverted aside from that i will have to disagree with the score given i have played about the same amount of hours the reviewer had and i give it more of a 75 the gunplay is really what saves it for me there are a ton of bugsglitches that can be fixed and bump the score to another point or more for me i have enjoyed the time i have spent with it and im glad i rented it vs buying because i am not too far from doing everything i want to do in it if you mainline this game you wont like it im not worried about doing a review 30 seconds after it releases sure it has problems but im 15 hrs in and have only done a couple main missions and am enjoying it solid game dont let reviews scare you away i find this game very dumb and flaved at times but very addictive too i like the review format whats this bullshit someone get acg on the phone sort this shit out granted ive only played maybe 5 hours so far but this game feels closer to a 9 than a 6 gunplay is amazing fun powers and progression a fun open world with much to do very nice graphics with good performance and few bugs i dont know what these reviewers want from a game but my suspicion is that they dont care as much about the gameplay as the story and characters which may be lacking in rage 2 review discussion ok hitting unsubscribe right now i finished rage 2 and ive almost found and completed every location maybe 67 left i can honestly say this game is a solid 810 it gives you the combat of doom and abilities like crysis mixed with the open world activities of something like far cry but less boring absolutely huge amount of upgrade options for weapons and abilities and the fact that you can carry all the weapons you acquire makes it pure fun what is with journalists being so critical lately the game is fun in terms of length its around the same play time as doom or the last of us both of which got great scores as far as the combat scenarios being short maybe you should up the difficulty then because ive died maybe 20 times throughout my play through and i never felt cheated just felt very challenging which made it feel rewarding when i finished feel bad for people who cant recognize a great game rage 2 is an awesome game its combat is on a unseen level that tramples the nowadays generic shooters and although its open world feels just a bit empty it is easily the most beautifull ever most importantly rage 2 is one of the most fun games i have played in a long long time and it constantly rewards you for playing by giving even more tools and perks to make your ballet of destruction even more mesmerising 810 as a game reviewer 1010 if i let my heart speak enjoy miss those days when gamespot was about quality game journalism now the only good thing about gamespot is gamefaqs bring back alex navarro to save this humourless boring and biased mess this review format is dreadful boring this channel is a joke what a shitty way to review 100 agree with gamespot what a let down rage 2 is such a boring soulless shooter it tries to be doom but fails hard you fanbois may dislike the score 610 but you all know it to be true just came here for the dislike ratio and comments have a great day this game is amazing everyone bitching about a low score of 610 consider this if they handed out 10s for goodgreat games and 7 or 8 for averagegood good games what score is there for those exceptional games that come along once every few years the ones that really stand out also being tough on scores is a good thing it keeps developers motivated to make excellent not just average games and stop taking it personally as some attack on you just because your opinion is that you love it everyone loved rdr2 but i found tedious as all fuck and borderline torture to play to be honest it was far to slow for me days gone was fucking awesome 8 great while this conversational style is not a format i like for reviews your reasons to dislike it are pretty solid its too bad people are here to obviously dislike you if your opinion differs from theirs but as long your opinions are well communicated thats great foolsto be honestsuper effective this is actually a fair score i dont get why people are defending its boring and dull open world design raise your standards people whatever he says bad about this game is wrong quit being puppets pulling your strings arent they i think all the real reviewers are retired instead of talking about the game u need to actually review it this is a discussion not a review gamespot needs help gave rage 2 a 6 but you gave blackops 4 an 8 something is wrong with yall i am not saying rage 2 is a 10 but it deserves more than a 6 it should be at least an 8 yes yall should go back to the old review format here just for the comments im very surprised at this score i purposely stayed away from all reviews until i played it a few days and i love it i was sure it was going to be a sleeper hit ign gave it an 8 i think thats more realistic go back to usual way of reviewing this is a discussion not a review is his gamertag swagbeasthypebroyosickdawg420 or something gamespot you have your point but rage 2 is acutally the most fun i had with a shooter in years i think rage 2 never means to become a real openworld game like all the standard openworld games the world and driving is there to give a change of pace for id its all about combat and its fantastic for each combat being short i think its just about right i think they dont want to stretch each combat to make you feel drained you have your focus to see positions of enemies before you enter a fight this is when you make your plan and when you execute it its fast and satisfying like an organsm you didnt understand rage 2 a 6 for score hell no crap game dogy character movement makes u feel sick like vr dogy vehichle control and crap frame rate to boot i got an advert when he was talking about the pop ups haha not a fan of this video review style but nothing about his review sounds really triggering the way that dislike ration suggests imo this is a fun game seriously are you kidding me with this review get a different journalist hows that for dope 60 mixed on steam and 73 on metacritic this review seems spot on im sorry you wasted 60 on this yeah idk i saw this guy streaming the game and from what i saw id have a hard time imagining this guy getting excited for many things i really have a hard time believing hes open minded when it comes to reviews but then again for some weird reason i see alot of gamers on gamespot that always look uninterested in games idk i just know theres no way in hell rage 2 is a 6 out of 10 come on this interview is definitely making me rage 2 they could have at least gave it a 8 not a 6 love the new format very refreshing compared to the same old review styles i think a 6 or 7 is a fair review you can fun but feels lackluster in places cannot take serious reviewed on pc but used a control pad i spit on you never listen to someone who has car logos tattooed on his forearm this game is dope lol wow instantly lost me i wanna unsub so badly it hurts facepalm also can these guys sit anymore closer to each other clearly see how weird they act because of it content now is so freaking awkward to watch its crazy how much they have fallen off its laughable at this point these guys going to hold hands and kiss after this review 610 for buddy on buddy eye contact this review was so boring i had better spend the time watching paint dry the fake news of games this guy has such an extensive vocabulary last comment why dont you have 2 or 3 people give a quick review or synopsis games are too subjective and the things that annoy this guy are things i like like the popups and the bad guy clayton this is just so one sided of a review hi reasons for a 6 are very shallow and im playing it and the story is goofy but ok not like doom had an amazing story but everyone loves that the missions are short but thats because the action is additive and fun and you dont want it to end spidermans missions ended pretty quick too and pushed you out into the world acg gave valid reasons for his score and always does to be honest i trust dan stapleton and acgs opinion way more than this guy who has been in the industry for what 2 maybe 3 years i havent bought rage 2 but what im hearing and seeing about the game in your own low rated review looks hella crazy good im buying to be honest and fool are the only things i got out of this game reviews have become complicated for no reason please stop doing this cliched table discussion format this is unwatchable every time im trying to look at the game i go back to two dudes within seconds its terrible what difficulty did he play on 8hrs theyll call this story underwhelming but then in the fall give borderlands 3 a near carbon copy of borderlands 2 which is good a 9 or 85 when it is relatively the same game with an underwhelming story these fuckers had alot od audio glitches too only knew cause of subtitles this guy gave fair rewire game is 610 for real and feels empty i used to prefer your reviews over others but not anymore because of this new review format most people are disappointment please fix it its awkward and insightful how do guys like the asian get hired to do these reviews bring back normal reviews this video format is boring you know what is underwhelming this review gaming journalist review in a nutshell just check the like and dislike ratio its a fun gameplay it enjoy it have fun if youre someone who enjoys the fps games of old and the new doom wolfenstein etc you will enjoy this game fun game hate the driving though every vehicle handles like a bus and driving anywhere was a chore whats up guys just 610 why i have not played it yet but definitely looks lots of fun whoa this new review platform is awful what do i want to see gameplay what do i get to see instead two dudes talking to each other great this is a bad review he has not played many games is there an enemy type called fool in this game rage 2 is a good game i am enjoying it what pisses me the fuck off is that they pick random reporters to be gaming journalists would be better if they had actual gamers instead howgames been for 20 yrs why would we wat to see the reviewer and why is this an interview game is much better then 6 imho and this guys opinions seems like he run through main story missions on easy game is not to easy side quest dont take two minutes mayby few first does and his argument about too few opportunities to flex your superpowers is just not true shootingfightingkilling is a lot of fun there are like 6 different bioms ton of different abillities and character upgrades quite creative weapons dont get mistaken by gs review its bullit try the game the game is about combat and not story you moron i enjoy the new format its what i feared the only thing thing really to do in farcry thats fun is clear out outposts that game needs to be played on hard or ultra with weaker weapons this looks far too easy like cleaning out afar cry outpost on normal with a grenade launcher also to make your weaker weaponshigh difficulty playstyle survivable you had a cover mechanic in fc the mix of no coverno way to play tactically with superpowers will make this predictably too easy or possibly too hard if you choose to ignore all the super hero shit also theres only two kinds of warfare attrition and manoeuvre shooters without cover are all attrition based ie look at his health bar hes just dealing slightly more damage than hes taking and thats so 1994 the game lacks depth then is too easy andeverything fun is over within a minute or two its delusional expecting this game to be a 9 looks lot more fun than far cry 5 ever was ubi should take notes before releasing yet another boring shooter oh wait too late they already released the dull ghost recon didnt they you guys need to sort this out unsubscribe i love this game its super fun and satisfying why are l so many people hating on it i recommend playing the game by yourself and judging the game off your own experience to be honest this fool couldnt stop saying to be honest or fools i dont even care about the review opinion what the heck is this terrible review format go back when you give a game its lowest score by a really wide margin you know you were either the wrong person for the review or you really dont know what youre talking about giving this game a 6 is ludicrous damn another review with dislikes more than likes these two fools fool count do they get paid per the fool mention i hate these new reviews the story isnt great but imo serviceable the combat and progression more than make up for it titanfall 2 had a ridiculous stupid plot and had one of the best campaigns of any fps ive ever played you wanna complain about lazy writing and then give a professional games journalist review by saying shit like killing fools shoot a fool a bunch lots of fools mowing fools down modern millennial media critics are so goddamn lazy these days hipster douche bags review games 6 reallly thats wayy too low brother 7 or 8 at best game doesnt look good and the new format of the review doesnt save it i really dont get people saying the world is empty shits happening everywhere certainly more going on then say rdr 2 not dissing rdr 2 just saying the world wasnt super dense with content plus the gunplay is on par with doom i am genuinely flabbergasted at this games reception the only thing i would consider average is the story mission variety and even then its got more variety than doom 2016 fools tbh lol gamespot just always has the worst reviews 105 my favourite is the slam hahaha liquidated sure im going to buy it soon not bothered side bits are short i spend many time in assassins creed clearing points of interest and never got bored of it who is this fool his reviewers opinion is awful i dont like these types of reviews where you sit and talk awful cross referencing all the steam user reviews with this gamespot review and it all adds up for me there is nothing wrong with the score gamespot dropped on this one a 6 seems about right whats with the dislikes having played about 10 hours into the game i have come to like it had trouble figuring the menu out game play is sort of like doom with quest breaks there are no intown mini maps to find anything you can also just take off and clean out areas if you want to keep on fighting the bad was the car race the car steers terrible all in all i like it i agree with the score rage2 is extremely bland and forgettable i dont know what these fools were playing but im having a blast with rage 2 finally something that doesnt have a battleroyale a single player experience if you want a challenge how about raising your difficulty a bit not much of a bad ass when you play it on easy good job gamespot you screwed up again do us all a favor and stop doing game reviews kids these days here is a review of your review 010 this new review format is dogshit i have to skip all the way to the end of the video say fools one more time at the end of the day only you can be the decider of that if you want to buy the game or not and hey if you dont like the game you can always return it for a refund 510 too many white people sending fools flying never felt so effective that dont make sense you gave days gone a 5 and rage 2 with literally no appealing story and narrative a 6 aint journalist supposed to be non bias and dont review a game on their own personal views youre supposed to reviewing the game for us not yourselves it which seems like i do prefer the gameplay footage than the two people at a desk setup why tf is this game like borderlands its so lame how these reviews dont even cover the game they play plus the review is not about what you as a reviewer want but more so what the game is about nothing in this reviews explains the stuff that you get from the game its all about i wanted it to be this or i wanted to hate this character blah blah blah these reviewers on ign and gamespot seem like they dont play the games to give actually feedback but play them to give their opinion of what the game should have been stop listening to these reviewers because if you dont you will eventually not play any game that comes out its best to try it yourself instead of listening to this lame review this guy is awful combat is dope sending fools flying what is 5 years old speak like an adult used to only trust ign and gamespot reviews but you can now reduce that amount to one wtf has happened to this channel they obviously dont listen to their subscribers yet again we have to be constantly taken away from the gameplay to look at two people we dont give a shit about having a really awkward chat please go back to the original review format how many of your subscribers have to say the same thing for you to act on it when you pound on the table we can hear that through the mike just givin feedback if you want me to take your reviews seriously dont have the opening thought be the infantile combat is dope okay dropped the review when he bitched about story i am hear for id software awesome combat fuck story starting off with the games dope gave it a 60 me unsubscribe really bad review this is one of the most creative shooters to come out in the last 3 years but since its not fortnight it gets a 6 hire new people who actually understand games please common guys whats this format of review not hating for the hate itself but i really dont like it show the game while reviewing it not the ugly face of reviewers i dont want to look at them 10 for ten minutes straight am i going crazy they keep talking like the guy has already reviewed the game but i cant find a video im only about 6 hours in the game but i feel like this review is utter bullshit with the exception of the pop ups my biggest problem with the game is the menu and the pop ups this reviewer is a member of the authority people have not even finished the game and are already criticising the review he explains pretty clear why the combat its satisfalling and the worldhistory falls short people think that if a game does not receive at least an 8 it is not worth while because most shitty reriewers give al least an 8 to almost all the games no matter their quality like ign gave 92 to ac odyssey 01 leas than the witcher 3 smh jesus christ this format is horrible 9 or 85 out of 10 what the hell i cant take this guys review for shit lol i think this game is a love it or like it game if you enjoy games where it is just a bullet hell insanity where you just go around killing people then you may love it if you are looking for a captivating story with interesting characters then you might enjoy it but not as much as the people that are playing it for mindless fun this review is so off the mark i feel like hes not understanding the point of the game its a crazy open world fps that does exactly what it says its gonna do now the music i agree could use some work but everything else was crazy dope short missionsreally its a huge open world theres so much shit to do who cares if situations are short and if u didnt feel like you u got enough then go find another activity i could go on forever about this video but then ppl will start to lose interest in what im saying so i will end it here bottom line game does exactly what it says its supposed to do you guys are seriously some certified dumb fucks this is why i only listen to gamespots reviews no bullshit they call out a mediocre game when its a mediocre game its journalism like this that will benefit the industry more than any other cough cough ign 910 for everything cough cough unsub and move on leave the hipsters alone with their selfgratification sounds like the open world aspect is tacked on for padding this guy is fooling no one its a fun game whats up with this god awful new review format this easily makes gamespot the worst reviewers sorry im unsubscribing and its not about the score i used to like gamespot much more than ign but now i really dislike the content they put out specially the format of their reviews support smaller reviewers ive already unsubed ign also worst explanation of a review ever gs has lost all respect so funny 1st anthem every1 liked this new format alot but now the reviewer has to give the score person x wants to see in order to get a like these days xd but i did never like this format at all it just is way to easy to do i just want a simple video review and an honest review this is what happens when you put bunch of 30 year old hipsters trying to review something they discuss it bunch of losers angry joe aog give way better reviews than this just go back to the old format of how you guys review games be honestsee how you feel about the game and who cares if people get mad thats what journalist is for not you guys sitting on the table sipping little frappys discussing your feelings whats wrong with this generation you guys are insane its a fun ass game ill admit i havent put 18 hrs in the game but a 6 gtforage 2 has been awesome so far no one wants to see your faces neeeerds another example of games journalists being ridiculously critical rage 2 days gone the ghost recon reveal the list goes on idk if this is the post rdr2 reviewer mindset but its a bit ridiculous spoilers horrible review for once ign did a better job sad whats become of you gamespot nobody likes this review style i dont want to see a podcast of a 2 people talking about a game for 1122 minutes 6 fools out of 10 not enough fools it is a good review and i have really big problems when the game is not paced wellthat is why i gave up on open world games in generaleither have well structured missions because gameplay will not save the day not enough fun did understand it correctly game spot has official become much much worse than ign so in a videogame the gameplay is very good and fun gives it a 6 ok mate this guy is a clown couldnt agree more about the rhythm im killing a bunch of fools changing weapons smashing skills and coming in and out of overdrive then just when im shouting is that all youve got all the enemies are dead and yes thats all theyve got i really wanted to be pushed i wanted a relentless onslaught not a quick fix im starting to think gamespot is doing shitty reviews on good games just to be edgy its fine having a difference of opinion but most negatives i hear from their reviews now are nitpicks or are pushing a personal agenda days gone ive said it once and ill say it again bethesda and their games are overrated you can only ride of the success of past glories like skyrim and fallout for soo long before you actually have to produce a decent game again lol have to wait for gmanlives review then basically he enjoyed the game so much he wanted more and was put off that it all ended too soon im sorry but thats not a 6 bruh combat is dope its the main attraction in this game review 6 once my favorite channel is becoming dumb and i hate these review discussions stuff when you are reviewing a game you should focus if it is fun and loyal to its proposal not personal taste not bugs that we know will be fixed you guys are absolutely lost think about if u had this gameplay polish with a bethesda fallout story omg you can get doom for like 10 just saying guess you can say this review is super effective gamespot just likes giving games lower scores than ign they gave red dead redemption 2 10 we should not trust them this game does not deserve a 6 at least an 8 im loving it so far with days gone and now this these shitclowns lost all credibility in my book omg say fools again ass wipe the game look like far cry new dawn doom gamespot ass we dont want to see ya ll face so all gameplay please my only concern is that i heard its a very short game is that true the old review format was much better shorter is better sounds like youre too used to the end boss game trope real life missions arent always ended with some super battle at the end you finish and its just over so it sounds like the missions are realistic as opposed to having every series of missions end in some earthshattering boss fight im not sure thats a reason to judge a game poorly would you recommend anthem just as much as rage 2 this game does so much right that i dont think its wrongs or pop up notifications warrant a 40 drop for fuck sake gamespot we dont want a podcast wannabe review gamespot got this right rage 2 is extremely repetitive and boring im not a fan of your new review format please fix gamespot you used to have insightful videos game looks like shit but how did this inarticulate motherfucker get a job writing wtf with this review 80 time im seeing 2 guys i dont want to see i want to see the game im now unsubscribing from this channel acg i hope you have room for one more cause i need real reviews hipster teens who have been into gaming for all of two years reviewing games its insane how many of the knowledgeable and respected journalists have jumped ship from gamespot and ign i guess all these interns will take the minimum wage and social media cred ill agree it isnt the greatest game ever but its certainly better than a 6 id give it a 78 its no far cry new dawn but its aight fam terrible review foolish format acg and gmanlives are much better at explaining what makes this and other games great or not so great this sounds like a slow burner for a few hours then we get to the good stuff wait how come i subs to this channel again when i already unsub for years now honestly id unsubscribe to you guys but its just too much fun watching you make these horrible decisions that turn all your subscribers against you its very cathartic heard the main story is about 20 hours from the ign review so has he even completed the game fuck you gamespot i am going to unsubscribe to this channel just because of this fucking video every time ign and gs give a game a low score thumbs down are much higher than thumbs up this started since days gonewhen you make a gamer madyour done 6 minutes into the review and these fools have said nothing relevant about the game itself please get rid of the interview format its terrible sad review didnt finish that guy is just kid shame i hate conversational reviews so fucking much made it 22 seconds into the video thats all im watching this shitshow deserves dislikes just gamefly it people when i heard avalanche was involved this was my biggest fear that the open world will have mediocre generic side content i see gamespot getting a lot of flack for giving low scores i think the reviewers are just being honest about how they felt and not automatically giving a game 910 based on the hype that surrounds it there was a time when every single game being released was getting a 9 even when it wasnt necessarily deserved at least now theyre redressing the balance a little as far as game scores go people getting angry need to chill just because one reviewer didnt enjoy it that much doesnt mean you wont its all subjective in the end thank fuck they went back to 10min reviews they both dont get laid how can they do reviews you guys gave 6 to everything 1 sub ty i usually love the feel layout of gamespot review videos this was not great in comparison to how you guys usually do things from what ive seen of the game i am fine with this score but this review format isnt very effective this should be a video that accompanies the entire review this video shouldnt be the review lets get a clear concise rundown so that we can see how the reviewer gets his score then show this the only thing that i can think of is that gamespot doesnt trust him enough to write andor edit a review so they did things in this format or maybe theyre just trying to switch things up lol 610 its so fun that i want more to be honest i think 6 is fair the gunplay is realy good but the missions are shit and you have to travel 5 mins for a 3 minute fight all the time then you go to cities which take away your powers and you have to sit in elevators for 10 minutes straight realy disappointed another shit fps if it was 3rd person wouldve been great i pity the fools i think this game is going to rock being a game critic makes u overly critical of the smaller things and the smaller things is what breaks the score fool rage 2 review interview cant you just have a normal review instead of a friggin qa ffs why is this a podcast boooo im never watching another review from here igngamespot journalist wannabe gamers or fake gamers hold up what a 610 ive been loving the shit outta this game just pure violent unadulterated fun idk what else to ask for 6 that is just too low i dont get these reviewers anymore they are the reason why a lot of shitty games get released because the value the completely different things i am having a blast with the game the 8 ign gave it fits much better and why does it always seem that they choose people that dont really like the kind of game they review gameplay solid thats all that matters to me u want story go watch a movie they are 99 of the time better unless ur watching a bad movie 610 too much shoot acg puts gamespot to absolute shame his reviews are constructive wellpresented deeply informative and highly detailed they are also formatted properly and done incredibly professionally all by one person gamespots discussion format is beyond pathetic its not a review its a convoluted mess wow is gamespot trying to dethrone ign check out review by acg this is low quality content and mostly opinion fucking hell at least ign gave it a great score the combat looks amazing and thats the only thing that matters for this type of game also just beat days gone dont know why the hell they gave it a five stop calling these reviews its rage 2 that means people are twice as angry as the last game gamespot and ign are the worst but gamespot is really trying to be number 1 in most hated reviewers on youtube this review style really is bullshit what happened to gamespot bring back the old review style the guy says tone of fun so many time its to wonder why he gave it a 6 why are they interviewing this guy about rage 2 instead of running a traditional game review do i care wut this fool is saying oh ffs again this format youre telling me this guy is the right person to do a review dope what are you 15 cretin what a joke im talking about the review i gave lamespot a 6 out of 10 shit review another shit review from gamespot i think theyll expand the single player story content through the year long dlc releasesat least they have to make 23 dlcs 10 hours long to justify that 60 price tag89 hours of single player story content is just pathetic and unacceptable in 2019 when nowadays games are as long as 3040 hours seriously it is a shooter fuck stories the gameplay is lit cmon dont call you a gamer if you dont know the importance of gameplay short or not play on a harder dificulty i knew enough after 1 minute of commentary this game is great i give it six orange man bads out of ten i dont trust his pov because he played with a game pad ergo aim assist filthy casual the game wasnt advertised as a citizenkane like the last of us or god of war 2018 are so harping on the story or world building is stupid are there any main missions that make use of the vehicle combat in this game because thats one of the unique features and the hook that got me interested in this but by the way they talked about it it sounds like theres just nothing id give it a 6 also its so empty and lifeless this page died the moment danny left the company this is why you should get rid of scores its ridiculous 610 just say buy it instead i bet you this reviewer loves playing anthem and fallout 76 woke word of the day fool this review style is so bad easy allies is the best review channel their reviews are unbiased gamespot has gone down hill hey everyone check out acg gameranx angry joe and tons of other independent game reviews if you like honest opinion backed up by well thought out analysis check out this shit if you dont go back to old reviews and review the game properly yo the game is fun you get to blast on fools but they dont utilize the open world like this other game and there are popup notifications ugh just do your reviews like you did before this format is annoying no one likes it what the hell is wrong with them first days gone and now this people make sure to turn on a voice over that narrates the action its hilarious u dont do a game review showing ur funny faces the game looks ok not great sup fool its not cod bam give it sixxxx more dislikes than likes well then fck there is an unlimited horde mode not mutant bash tv in the hidden underground city it doesnt show up on your map look for a cave entrance ill leave you at that there is some hidden stuff apart from easter eggs including missions guess the reviewer doesnt know how to review openworld games and gives a 6 because of popups and this game is based on exploration go and get into trouble there is also elon musk secret mission in a bunker in the side of the mountain you really have to find these places they are not marked and nobody will tell you about them gamespot have completely lost it what a bunch of fools i feel like this is gonna be another game kind of like days gone where players who just want to have fun and dick around will get a totally different experience than a reviewer who is looking at it with a more critical eye i really hate this discussion format gamespot please make the reviews objective say like how once gametrailers gave review scores based on average of all sub categories gameplay story presentation performance graphics and sound the review score can be objective and individual users can see the subcategory score of what they want in the game you can justify your score in a reasonable way and not this way of discussing the reviewers opinions if the reviewers want to give an individual subjective opinion please start a youtube channel or something and post it there gamespot name means something if you dont improve now there wont be a reason for gamespot to exist he makes it sound more like an 8 you only play for 18 hours and you think youre eligible to review this game also go back to the old format problem is everything is short main mission side mission but its a great game 65 this game has the best graphics shooting is on point and so many upgrades to cars powers and guns i despise this review dont care about your score just really dont like your new way to review games plus he played 18 hours on easy mode and then you think he is fine to review a game gamespot have become shit just read ign gave it an 8 after not even being sure about it and gave days gone a 6 i think theyve lost the plot but each to their own stop this kind of review ffs the games looks fun af tho gamespot i used to take out a bunch of fools but then i took an arrow to the knee i hope angry joe reviews the game i trust him leaving aside ign and gamespot the game is a solid 8 its tons of fun days gone was also a ton of fun to play my advice is u should just play the game and form your own opinion i didnt know all the enemies were called fools get some more vocab my man ehh im only interested in plague tale right now why do you guys even make reviews anymore no one cares about you polygon kotaku or ign just stop listen to my song guys reviewer is chipmunk 10 why would i give a fuck what this guy thinks acg already told me the truth jaded much bethesda is never getting my support for their absurdly high regional pricing for the same usd5999 vampire bloodlines 2 rs1299 rage 2 rs 3999 good review and valid points lol an open world 12 hr campaign or less acg did a better review than gamespot or ign so i recommend people check his video out not because he had a more positive outlook for the game but because he is way more thorough touching on most if not all aspects of the game for example this reviewer never touches on what difficulty level he played on or whether or not he tried the game on multiple difficulty levels there was no mention of sound designmusic nothing about the games technical performance not one word about vehicle controls theres a lot that seems omitted and its just a damn shame alien isolation got a 6 too which means this is a really good game they have become worse than ign is mixed right now on steam so this score is spot on 8 hours is short wtf i pity the fool with this logic doom would have got a 5 just go watch igns review its much better looks like these days ign and gamespot have switched places and now ign writes good reviews and gamespot not i do like this video format tho a 6 the fuck and you give black ops 4 an eight who the fuck is giving these people the right to review games on your website lmfao this game is a ton of fun game is fun af dont know whyy yall gave it such a low rating lmaoo are fools the name of the enemies or something or do we have a real g reviewing this game if they give the game a 10 they are a sellout but if they give it a 5 they are haters despite all my rage against the machine in a cage it looks terrible on ps4 it looks like its had a massive visual downgrade been playing it a bit today and cant help but thing wtf happened to the visuals i pity the fool who go by this review and dont buy the game or dont try the game out themselves really average fps id give it a 65 why do you guys get so butt hurt over an opinion wait you only played 18hr did you do everything in it a six really f off the way he describes this game almost sounds like its unfinished this makes me really sad i thought this game was gonna be amazing this guys nit pickingonly thing i agree with is the loud notification after opening a container and typically there are around six or so in each area you find them this new review platform is really bad imo a review from a veteran fps player after a while we demand more and it feels like they hold back for dlc sounds like a game for noobs and vets ale who crank up the difficulty if this reviewer cant formulate a sentence without the word fool being used i dont know how much i would trust his score but of course its his opinion just not one i will choose to stick with cant trust a guy with such a gay tattoo i dislike this review because you gave it a higher score than days gone and actually its even much worse bioware and bethesda have been making flops lately jorel was right youre a pack of fools every last one of you gamespot didnt get their pay off to promote and give this game a high score like the others sounds like the open world is unnecessary im here to see if gamespot reviewed a game with honesty and integrity after this im going to read a well researched and intelligent kotaku article this fool has has no clue what to do with these fools because that would be foolish rent the game or buy it form your own opinions interesting while i do love me some story if the shooting part of a first person shooter is as satisfying as so many others have said it is it should be rated way higher 2016s doom was some of the most fun ive ever had with a shooter just like black back on the original xbox neither had a good story but the actual gameplay was tight and refined to near perfection its a ton of fun gives it a 610 this game is fucking great and this review is awful but i will say theres simply not enough cleft palates in rage 2 makes sense there still working on doom which looks a lot better than this so im guessing they overextended themselves or the people working rage 2 were like why dont save this good stuff for doom none of there points where valid all they did was complain about what the game did not have the devs specifically stated that this game was going to be a fun shoot em up type of game like doom they also stated that they were not going to put too much emphasis on story or immersion the devs delivered the reviewers just complain about what was not going to be delivered in the first place im curious what difficulty the reviewer played it on since he talks about missions being too short go back to the old review format not a review discussion secondly what the hell is going on at gamespot days gone and now this the accuracy is off and sounds like your trying to justify your score instead of review the games on both videos i think this reviewer dood got picked off from da streets just for that tatooo to be honest like you couldnt find a duud whos tad bit more articulate to be honest heeeey did gamestop finally get rid of that awful fake oh were just having a natural conversation at our desk thats structured like a youtube video and holy shit someone with a camera happened to stumble by and record it good review i finished the game and i can say i like it less then rage 1 this rage feels like a doom dlc so if you like doom youll love this this review is bullshit bought this game without looking at reviews and yeah enjoying it quite a bit im pretty early in the game so i havent seen the big chunk of this game but im liking it so far so far my main gripes are that the enemies can be really annoying there are some shielded enemies that are just annoying to kill more than anything not challenging just a waste of time unless there are skills that i acquire later that makes them significantly less annoying this is spot in review ignore the ppl hating on gamespot it doesnt take long for you to agree with what he says about combat this is all marketing and no meat this is not the doom type combat youre looking for its just feels so bland no challenge such a waste of opportunity go buy doom if you havent play that its soooooo much better and feels more badass without the powers check my credentials crazimax btw i also critize ganespot and ign for not putting disclaimer for promotional videos so no im not their defender or anything yall the new ign lol the salty people in the comments anyways valid points in the video im going to wait for the game to drop in price a bit lets review the gamespot game review department 010 not enough oxygen for the braindead employees yall need to take a long vacation consider labeling these things as a review discussion and go back to do doing regular scripted reviews that way you dont have to worry about people with short attention spans or lack the time to watch longer videos his face is so punchable ill try it out on the gamepass on xbox this video feels like they are trying to justify the rating watch game play and form your own opinion if you wanna hear someone elses opinion before you buy then go ahead imo its great and a fun open world to explore youre trying to make me not play a game that the mass majority of people are saying is a solid game what the fuck is wrong with you games spot fucking ridiculous people are saying this 12 hour thing to beat which is complete bullshit cause reviewers are so focused on being the first people to go through a game as fast as possible never truly immersing themselves in the game cause they are on a time crunch to beat other reviewers or within a week me who has no time crunch im on hard 11 hours in and only have completed 2 story missions the game is meant to make you get lost in its world as you travel from mission to mission sorry gamespot but this review is lame as you said 50 times in this video na everything avalanche studios touch nowadays seems so meh just cause 3 wasis a bad console port with lots of bugs number 4 is a cash grab why didnt they fix numer 3 first rage 2s world seems meh generation zero is bad etc etc shoot fools 610 thanks for being game worse company than ign now gj another overly hyped disappointment 610 not enough andrew wk rage 2 is great i really am having fun the combat is a bit tough but its very underappreciated like bulletstorm sure the story didnt make sense but the gameplay was creative and super fun i wished they had made a second part but still it was one of those fun silly shooters with a linear story this is a really fun flashy game id give it a 8 damn since days gone is a 510 and i love it this must be a masterpiece ign and gamespot released their review at the same timehmmmm i wont take anything seriously from a dude with a shitty persona tattoo i just go to reviews to hear about performance i can look at gameplay and know if its for me or not i dont look at a score to inform my opinion meanwhile carry on i think he said fools around 700 times this reviewer says fun a shit ton of times but gives it a 6 fool i think ill wait for borderlandsthank you take a drink everytime this guy says fools rage 2 just a game thatsjust there should be a solid 710 its a damn good game highly recommended especially in a world where fps games focus on multiplayer damn near perfect 710 after days gone youve lost all credibility gamespot is definitely trying to one up against ign to become the most hated gaming journalism lol i feel like every critics now days is just saying they own opinions like why we follow what this people say like we could play the game for ourself like days gone too they put that game down bc they didnt like it like theres 7 to 8 billions people in this planet and we follow this guys opinions like sheeps bc they say this is bad this is good and this is alright let me give it a 5 getting it on pc regardless gamespot reviews arent trustworthy anymore why did this take so long oh well it got cracked day 1 so i didnt have to waste money woot idc what anyone says this looks fun as hell im definitely getting it 610 too much twitter edge how 6 75 at least its a really good game 6 is really a bad score gamespot is hard as hell on games youre better off playing rage 2 yourself and form your own opinion like days gone both games are significantly better than what these journalists are making it out to be prefer old review mad fun playing it right now im digging the gun play holy shit is it satisfying better than fortnites 6 is not really goodign gave an 8 cant wait for terrormania does anyone else feel like this is what the whole game supposed to be like and its an apology fuckin awsumtrailer looks kool love the new laser weapon looks pretty cool i might check it out honestly this iris chick seems like a better antagonist than cross just from this trailer cool think ill stick to bl3 dead city ftw im glad i grabbed the game when i did im gonna grab this after i finish the main story so far i dont understand any of the complaints aside from the fact that the game has some issues with bugs other than that it feels plays and looks amazing it did everything with the original games formula that i hoped it would well i preordered the game so this should be interesting when tho wonder if this fixes all the problems love the voice and the humour id probably listen to that guy even if he was reviewing toilet paper joke aside great work pleasure to listen to such a great reviewer i want rage 3 as soon as posible anyone underneath is going home in a bucket 402 dude you are so funny i love your humor i love how rage 2 is a game where it is sort of like mad max in the wasteland aspect but also is good with all the high tech stuff great video got it on deal for 25 it looks boring with the open world but the actual combat in the game looks so fun and i think itll be one of those games where i can just turn my brain off and just have fun with it i dont know why they picked control first thing i did was bind focus to a spare mouse key and i found it fine afterwards great review i picked it up over the weekend and im absolutely loving it even convinced my mate to go out and buy a copy of because of how much i talked it up i love the colour pallete the sound effects and brooding music and of course the combat the controls i found a little sticky at first but im slowly adjusting this game gets compared to many others and its like theyve chucked crysis force awakens borderlands doom destiny and just cause all in together to make a splendid title id highly recommend it if you havent tried it yet yeah i didnt hear anything to deter me from buying it an open world gory mad max doom is just what i expect and want from id and avalanche having to deal with 2key combos for nanotrites is my only complaint having to use arrow keys for direction ties up my left hand as right is handling the trackball so being forced to use 3 fingers at the same time aint practical to say the least i cant see the map at all neither no other option my console is xbox one s what should i do help plz i was hopeing for a game similar to fallout probably not gonna buy even though its on sale for 40 hmm rage and doom are both made by bethesda i been playing it on and off for a month now this review is rather accurate i did custom map my kb and mouse setup and once i mastered it wow this game sucks out loud i agree with this review after playing i can tell quite a few people will find it boring and wont like it if you could stand mad maxs repetitiveness youll probably like rage 2 as well it feels a bit like a sandbox where you make your own fun out of the weapons and abilities you are given like matt said theres really not much out there on the road as you drive from place to place using mkb is a bit of a pain as every ability is tied to ctrlsomething i still enjoyed it overall its not revolutionary like doom but a fun mindless shooter i had more trouble in the mustpassinordertoprogress buggy race than matt apparently losing over and over because of rubberbanding and teleporting enemies was rage inducing since the i think they fixed the teleporting enemies and as entity447b mentioned avalanches explosions of fire and fuel always look incredible i dont know what it is about this game i didnt really like it too much only played it for a day and i was just like smh i was hoping it to be like mad max or fallout it was just too i dont know cant explain it and most of the achievements are wasted on weapon kills agreed 100 with this review except for your opinion of rambo 08 currently hanging on the last mission because i dont want to feel unmotivated when i do the postcredits map clearing so instead i just said fuck it to the story and started making up my own story and visiting everywhere before triggering the last mission i swear it only took me maybe 6 hours to get to the last mission just cause 4 had the same problem beat that crap in less than a day sad hating on rambo 1 minute into the video no need to watch the rest im not taking advice from someone who thinks the 4th rambo was terrible rage 2 looks cool something to hold me over until doom eternal comes out whats the song that plays at 705 why am i even watching i doubt my toaster will jig to this tune maybe with potato settings but not gonna buy when i dont know lol p 2008 rambo is great i want ask about respawn enemie and convoy and want keep game alive after clear all camps and all mission and story or world will be completely empty and game no longerplayable because nothing to shoot and do its too emptyand i dont wanna drive 5 friggin minutes to shoot 5 to if im lucky 20 people most of the time the drive time is longer than the shooting time feels a bit stalkerish but i was so disappointed i wrote tim willits on fb we expect open world doom and get a wasteland gta cowardice is forgiven and encouraged loved that line after 14h i can say its boring for me a mixture of 25 doom 25 borderlands and 50 mad max without success great visualsgunplay yet dull and empty open world dull characters dull and very short story without any interesting quests expect go there find xyz come back and just arks and bandit camps to liberateloot i was super hype about it after my 500h at borderlands12 but there was an entire town albeit a small one in the desert that i didnt even find until after completing the main story i would like to make a confession i adore this freaking game never ever i had so much fun with a combat mechanic like in this one i already clocked the game twice with every single nook and cranny found as a whole i dont really like open world games and im burning out on them pretty fast this onejust clicked with me in so many ways every con said here is true however incredible combat and meh world i wished there would be more combat more action exploration is kind of dumb outside the needed arks for the powers on a several occasions i was like yeah more gimmeand my gf was like wtf is wrong with you as i cackled manically while making the poor goons into a pool of giblets fines at its finest i hope this game sells reasonably well i need something like this in my life lol wants i hate how you cant watch mutant bash tv and bet on other players i also wish they added settlers to bandit camps i know it sounds mainstream but it would really make it much better to find another living being that isnt in a car and isnt trying to kill you rocket booster flamethrower reverse engineered authority sword mind melter cons world is empty nothing happens to bandit camps after mutant bash doesnt have a bigger colosseum barely any other friendly npcs pros pheonix sounds like a blonde person in a tank top glasses army pants and sweaty mixed with nightrider and the paternal friend from dr who shotgun is shotfun grav darts fun combat etc lets face it this is really just a nice appetiser for doom eternal good review the main thing i got from watching it is it looks monotonous the enemy ai looks pathetic and as mentioned very like doom and even serious sam in a way ill pass on rage 2 i think avalanche did a fantastic job with this game yeah theres basically no story at all but the combat is just so damn fun it really makes up for the lack of story footage seems to be played with a controller why you can rebind keys on pc great review rage 2 is a very good game i am enjoying it but i constantly get the feeling that it is not quite the firstperson mad max i hoped it would be max overshadows it easily with a darker visual sense of dystopia and abandonment brutal fight choreography eyecandy significantly better road combat and much much more interesting characters for all the hype rage2makers couldve just as well named the cardboard hero player 1 and the story quest get to point b in a car since we are too lazy to make the next level load quite often i found myself wondering could i join the mutant faction or the lead bad guys faction and blow those poorly crafted wannabe saviors to smithereensalas not this time so ill keep on playing and comparing this one to max wow great review earned a sub love how you give pros and cons it really feels like you leave it up to the listener to decide whether or not the game is it worth it to them like you saidits enjoyable if you are into id shooters and if so that great gunplay will make up for the games downfalls to me the game play in rage 2 feels like quite a step up from doom 2016 i personally love how there are no glory kills which was my main problem with doom 2016 they are fun at first but become tedious while rage 2 allows for a more creative way of destroying your enemies my only gripe with the game really is it was a bit short and like you said probably would have benefited from a linear design as i see no direct benefits from it being open world i stopped watching when you insulted 2008s rambo minimal dialogue no love story no fluff that movie is perfect how dare you best review ive seen of this game hands down loved playing through this game but the reviews dont really capture the essence of the game very well this review is the review of rage2 im only about 4 hours in but super excited for the grav gun after that video i really wonder often what the hell qa is doing before launch of so many games when so many people agree after launch about what needs to be improved regularly coming up with big issues that should have been addressed much earlier it looks beautiful you earned a sub for this type of review we need more reviews like this instead of 75 too many explosions a lot of rage 2 feels more like mad max than the original rage yes rage had vehicle mayhem but it also had corridor levels like the hospital that i havent come across in the sequal yet mind you im not that far in 6 hrs in to be exact so things may change just say what it really isa great blast from start to finish for all shooter fans non stop action and done well a rare thing 910thank goodness for doom best feature by far was the uninstaller nice review but rambo 2008 was good 8 worst and worster things about rage 2 i bet they got that vortex ability idea from apocalypse mod in skyrim i found there wasnt enough guns and just using same weapon for 7 hours just got boring for me traded it within 24 hours i figured thats what was gonna happen i cant be the only one who didnt mind rambo 2008 great overview highlighting the games strengths and flaws i was hoping its more doom than just cause and it certainly looks like it thanks you had me at shotgun i play a very similar game right now that i cant stop laughing very similar the name is bear with me episode 2 the difference is that it is linear true what i said but for real now rage 2 is awesome borderlands will have more to do ill get that this just doesnt seem to have any sort of plot or point this game is surprisingly fun if one takes it for what it is namely a really good shooter with some traveling between shootouts the dart gun is so cool lol big fan of the first one you use your car do drive to the missions on the way some cool car battles in rage 2 you spend 70 of the time driving straightnot much action just to kill 10 or even less people after getting out of your car is just me or does it really suck somehow i expected more doom less driving the free stuff without fights is even worse so much stuff up your arse it hurts i wanna fight for stuff no multiplayertoday is a sin rage 1 dishonored prey scrapped prey 2 mad max doom bioshock fallout just cause rage 2 i feel its like 12 years old game good review i really wish this game went coop but at least the road map should be done by the time i find it in the bargain bin when i pick it up shotgun and shatter savage combo my lord is that nocturne i havent played much but so far im liking it its nice to see an engine that actually works so fed up with the over used frostbite broke ass engine the pile of intense crap used for assassins games whatever that engine is so i have to give id tier props for at leased releasing their games complete with a decent engine great review really like the style on your channel awesome work really good review damn this was a pristine fine and well expressed review no blind bashing nor blind praise you mentioned the games strengths and what is appealing to certain types of players aswell as its weaknesses and why they might hinder the expirience i liked the relations made to other games they give multiple perspectives and gives you an idea of what you can find in rage 2 that you likeddisliked in other games again very well done review and i am thankful for the youtube recommandation that led me here im sure ill check this channel out more often sooobasically its as they marketed it exactly great review this review unfortunately confirmed my initial feeling for the game and i wont be picking it up anytime soon maybe after some dlc and price dropspity excellent use of erik satie probably the best use of his composition ive ever seenheard edit also a really good review as usual very good review man wellwriten wellmade and actually fun to watch ive been playing rage 2 and omg i love it its a good example of for one how the oldfashioned run n gun is still a fun as hell genre when done right and two how easy it is to appreciate good weapon design i simply love this shotgun just when you think id or anyone for that matter cant make a shotgun more satisfying other than by dint of being a shotgun this shotgun pushes the standard of a what it means to be a good shotgun cranking the satisfyeeness to 11 this game looks great looks really boring its all the same the worst thing are the vehicles the driving physics are absolute garbage vehicles either over or understeer they all are ponderous af and if you drive them of a cliff you go up in flames driving in this game just isnt fun its mostly a necessary evil and if my destination is only 34km away i run there apart from that i enjoy the game very much love the combat and it also looks pretty decent this seems like an incredibly cookie cutter game if they made it a more linear shooter then they may as well have called it doom 2019 i dunno doesnt seem worth 60 this game looks so easy everybody is slow and you just oneshot everything i think its silly to suggest that the open world environment offers little to the game i appreciate that the best moments are in these more linear areas that are close quartered but the open world design offers the freedom to take your own path i appreciate that this is a different game to doom because of its open world setting great review this echoed my joys and my concerns i wasnt expecting it to be as filled as a recent assassins creed game but the world needed at least a bit more honestly i just picked this up because im so hyped for borderlands 3 that i needed something to get my fix besides the 50th playthrough of b2 i like it great shooting mechanics gonzo battles and a colorful world to flydrive around in i ended up binding ctrl to a mouse button made life a bit easier it seems that game developers do not have any sense of what promotes player praise and what does not sure the game is a lot of fun however it can be described as a mindless shooter with no real story and some pretty bad choices of dialogue the game can be quite long if you take off on foot and explore every building and talk to every ncp that will talk and by exploring and doing side missions and exploring arks you do become quite powerful and all this exploring grants you the items you need to upgrade all your gear and abilities however many like myself i am sure are pissedif you did a pre order of the deluxe edition like myself you get supposedly some bonus stuffwell the great and wonderful doom shotgun sucksyep it doeswhy because you get 6 rounds of ammo and ammo for the shotgun costs 1000 bucks per round now i do explore everything and poke my nose into anything i can and money is hard to come by especially as weapon mod upgrades a i would have bought it now if it had online coop like in rage 1 and also a pvp mode maybe they will add it as dlc i very much agree with this review i personally have been loving the gamebut i came to it for some mindless shooting after playing rdr 2 and it does its shooting very well but if you want plot or a good worldit would be a very underwhelming game indeed nice review im loving rage 2 cuz its fun fun fun in the sun sun sun and its a much needed break from grinding for merciless and waiting for nemesis how do you feel it compares to the mad max game i enjoyed that game a lot and getting similar vibes from this one so a quick mediocre game i should rent from redbox to save 60 awesome thanks what an actual review that shows it was made by a journalist not bought by the game hes reviewing impossible for real tho great review was excited for the game but it looks like ill wait for when the free dlcs are done played a half hour of it i got bored i like strategy and good story i grew up a hug fan of id and love mad maxbut this game just seemed a chore to play i even liked rage 1 its too bad you cant really get refunds in the video game industry anymore very telling on the direction its headed the deadzones on controller are horrid feels terrible other than that its a great game i think the older more experienced pc players will have no problem using a keyboard and its the young lings will be using a xbox pad ill pass this for borderlands 3 its been a long time since ive seen a review print or video from a gaming organisation thats really resonated with me i have a select few review channels i follow who i feel ive got a rapport with and whose experiences i know i can relate to how ill personally feel about a game this review is just excellent though i feel like it shows and tells me all the things i need to know to form my own opinion of whether ill like the game or not it doesnt tell me whether i should like the game or not thats for me to decide it just highlights the things i should consider i appreciate the mention of other games as frames of reference too i havent played every game meniioned in the review but being able to relate things back to the games i have played is very useful while games should be reviewed on their own merits to some degree they dont exist in a vacuum and it only makes sense to bring up comparisons to other games as reference points anyway than should have made races death race style pick up offense defense nodes kill and try to survive while racing seems right for this game if mad max was any judge of story its bad obviously not what its about but imo all single player games need good replayability and when the cars are slow and clunky and you have to go out of your way to collect skills to make the playtime faster by 5x is sloppy for what i expected since i probably would never have known i could fly still made under zenimax i guess that said avalanche is probably gonna have to take a money cut for bad reviews and its not their fault the really underwhelming thing is just imagine if it did have a great story game of the year and 100100 scores i think people are disappointed because of the potential it could have do you have to play it in that doom style what if you like stealth or are used to military shooters gah this 1080p video looks better than what im natively getting on my pc thanks to the aggressive resolution scaling the games uses to keep the framerate up i might actually be time to consider upgrading the rig ive been using the same one for damn almost 6 years now threw some extra ram in it and a second video card but the core i7 4790k and sli 980tis arent quite cutting it anymore the games super playable just not with everything cranked up honestly it looks exciting and actual packed but not really challenging or difficult is there a hard enough difficulty setting to actually make it a real challenge an engine from god solid review i dont watch a ton of them but thanks for pointing out the cons of mkb vs using a gamepad in this game also minimizing the bias amazing you were able to play no matter what settings 4k or 1080p i only get 15 minutes before crash my computer specs are good and up to date makes no sense and thermals were good so no overheating ima wait till goes on sale this game not worth 60 meh ill wait for discount it looks ultra repetitive ill wait for cyber punk 2077 blood gore fire explosions and foul languagewhats not to like better than running around downtown dc trying to get a clan together asking for help or changing your hair style clothes and dance moves guys what pc specs do i need to run this at 1080p 60fps on all settings to max this game flopped hard hope they mod this sad initial version thanks for your work good job seeing critics giving this miediocre reviews really angers me how can we get real games when real games get destroyed by casual sub par clueeless players like these dont listen to the morons theyve said the same for mad max just play it it rocks looks like another hypedup liveservice forgettable openworld game that lacks any real substance this goes in the bucket of games to wait for when they become 20 to buy turn off that hud man so much better it looks so generic like a bland stew made from scraps from other games another doom clone sign im buying this anyway but the world feels a bit emptyis there enough to do collect loot i disagree with too many of your points so im forced to dislikebut i guess thats what opinions are for you shouldve played on a harder difficulty the upgrades feel more meaningful i am having an absolute blast with this one it feels like old school fun you know what games used to be about ohh i can thanks man after 5 hours of gameplay i like the game 810 rps still putting out the best games coverage out there i think ill pass for a wild until gets very cheap what is the song playing at 720 i just hope i dont get bored in 2 days seriously the best game review i have seen in ages honest to the key points about the game wether positive or negative cheers for saving me a quite ridiculous asking price9995au or 12995 for deluxe for such a short play time game it does look like a rinse and repeat game which is a bit meh for an open world again thanks for saving me money d love rps yt reviews this is the oddest version of bordelands yet i miss the humour ambience and original characters have you had a chance to play the console versions and compare their performance to pc the videos ive watched so far this and giant bombs quick look have focused on the pc version but ill probably be playing it on ps4 and id like to know how it measures up on that platform really well written review i might have to get this i love the super powers mechanic gives the combat much more variety than just shooting the rest of the game seems solid too played the first game and loved it the only thing that bothered me about it was the texture pop in very much sounds like a fun game that i will just wait and buy down the road once its discounted a bit either in a complete bundle or at least at a price when i can more reasonably get it and the upcoming dlc matthews a national treasure that zen bit is very well done probably held back loads of content for later release scumbags looks to much like meaanthem to me so big empty world with mobs of enemies to shoot got it everyone and everything seem to explode in pieces boring real fast nah ill pass looking at this im reminded of bulletstorm which is a good thing the thing im taking away here is just shoot shit everything else is just make up i liked doom 2016 hope this will feel the same fantastic review format once all the free dlcs been released ill probably give this a bash it wasnt amazing but i enjoyed the first one just always thought it took itself a little too seriously this looks like dumb explodey fun and sometimes thats all i want from a game to do flashy bullshit and turn my brain off refreshing review ign gamespot could learn a thing or two by watching this review thanks so wait for the steam sale then haha the collision gods dude should i just rent this for a week 1 first blood 2 rambo 2008 3 first blood part 2 4 rambo 3 good review i think ill skip this one for now maybe see what looks like in 6 months another fun game that i dont have money to buy excellent indepth review thanks the reviewer man this game really makes you feel like rage wait wrong channel i believe far cry new dawn was shorter music at 700 anyone know going home in a bucket lol how is the enemy ai compared to the first game the first game was mostly fun because of the different enemy behaviours but here it just seems like theyre cannon fodder if the enemies had tough ai then the use of the abilities and powers would be more important rather than resorting to headshot galleries so two regions are not touched properly i guess we know where expansions and post launch updates will be will someone fart in my mouth please car can dodge really and they say handling in rage1 was bad the graphics arent as goood as i was hoping forgameplay is decent though new to the channel so i dropped by a sub and a like amazing video and review keep up the good work yeai think ill just wait for doom eternal ive played about 2 hours so i cant really judge the game but it seems kinda repetitive like it was spewed out by ubisoft and arks are like this games radio towers from far cry is there a new game plus or respawn bases option or random encounter challenges for replayability wow you made me like and subscribe oddly calming review about blasting enemies with a shotgun wow you can finish rage 2 campaign quickly than a plague tale innocence ahh its only 10 hours long i dont get to buy many games when i do i would like them to last for a little longer ill probably have to give this one a miss the reason the map feels empty is because it will be filled in with the road map content over time this isnt the preferable way to do things but there it is it sounds like its a good enough game to keep you interested as the road map unfolds but i just wish companies would go back to making complete games you said keyboard action was cumbersome i use an xbox 360 controller on my pc did you try out any controllers for this game im hoping that by tonight midnight when the game drops the devs will have changedtweaked a bit more of the gameplay to improve those elements that you said were lacking definitely enjoyed your review i went ahead and pre ordered the delux edition of the game from what ive seen this game has some serious potential and already looks like a blast a review that doesnt proclaim the game as generally good or bad but highlights its strengths and weakness and who might like it dont see those very often well done best review yet straight to the point and informative new subscriber it is refreshing for a reviewer to hit on all points quickly and not have 100 stupid ass analogies along the way like you know who thank you and keep it up 1503 i definitely get this feeling with a lot of open world games and the only one that i can think of that motivated me to keep playing is borderlands 2s endgame system i think rage 2 could really get some good ideas from that by including new harder enemies once u beat the main story anyways i loved the review 223 copyright violation right there ea will jump on this shit in half a minute ill say this for avalanche their explosions always look great why so many women so its an id shooter with an empty map great review still interested in the game but definitely going to wait for a sale or maybe when the game gets more meat in it omg a rage 2 review from a game journalist that isnt biased and that doesnt want a good story thank you a lot of people just say story bad thank you imagine this game with a shadow of war style faction system would have been something special still gonna buy it tho amazing well written and edited review gg rps that gravity shot is so satisfying i need a postshot smoke decent review but i dont think id or avalanche is known for doing interesting open worlds or rpgs when he says hes baffled that they didnt make more of an effort with world building and that it might only take 10 12 hours thats good news for me because i can only find 30 mins per day to play a game if that can you customise the character like skin colour i bought my deluxe edition i am going to enjoy it at 1201am i will do everything and cant wait for the more weapons and abilities come expansion time walker seems like a character fitted for a marvel ultimate alliance game ids gunplay is top tier its unreal how satisfying it is evil youtube or live youtube illuminati confirmed really good review you covered every aspect game look fun but im not sure how replayabilty this is and the ending sum it up perfectly for me i have to cancel my pre order because at first i thought this would be kinda like fallout but it seem more like doommad max yeah definitely going to wait and pick this up in a sale down the line the whole world never sparks to life thats what i thoughtblank space between outposts all that huge world filled with nothing sad and more importantly rather short this is nothing but a filler from id till new doom comes out meh sounds decent but 10 hours for main story is a bit much of an ask for a fullprice 80 cad i think ill wait until i build my new rig in the winter by then a complete edition should be available for a more reasonable price for the first few seconds i thought i was watching gameplay from mad max d can you change that ugly ass white armor i really dont like to be forced to play with a certain character all the way is there any visual customization for the mc thanks for the review man seems to me that i should keep doing what i have been doing the last couple of years wait for a sale of all the content rage was always about open world but it would be interesting if id worked alone to make a linear spinoff since thats what they do best i was hoping that there would be more linear sections in rage 2 than it sounds like there is this game looks profoundly boring and uninspired rather like the first rage i guess it cant be as dull as the first game i mean it looks nearly as dull but nothing can be duller than rage 1 are there random encounters and enemies patrols nice review tackling the good with the bad i still love its over the top gameplay even if the story is short 131 that was a nice explosion im a huge fan of id software since the days of quake 2 and so on i can say im extremely excited for this game i love bethesda id software games and this game looks amazing ah yes the zen of catapulting people i know it well i entered a similar zen being a level 99 in assassins creed odyssey and fully powered spartan kick so mad max with a bigger budget great video luckily im approaching this game as a huge fan of doom 2016 and all old fashion shooters so i think ill be pleased 13 hours for an open world game thats way too short definitely wait for a sale type game i like this review it reminds me of the printed reviews i used to read on magazines and i like that the author will casually drop references to lots of other games sometimes it seems like reviewers dont want to mention other games presumably because they arent sure if the readerviewer has played them boy you really like the shotgun ill keep coming back to id shooters for that special brand of shotgun crunch glad the shooting still looks meaty the environments look terribly dull yeah im downloading it now thinking it was multiplayer seems it isnt if i knew that i wouldnt have bought that way overpriced for a single player shooter killzone 2 was multiplayer wtf im glad the combat looks satisfying as heck way more satisfying than far crys does it require bethesda launcher on steam that zen bit 3 i dont know what it says about me as a human being but i find ragdolling dudes very funny and its one of my favorite thing to do in game bazooka them into the air or kick them into the air i got a hard bulletstorm vibe from this video what draws me in is that this game looks fun isnt that what games are for to relax and have fun hello theres a bit in the video where i talk about the troublesome key bindings for the powers ive just found an option that lets you instant cast them without holding down ctrl which makes it much more keyboardfriendly so worry not rip mrbuffalobut he got too close to that cliff check out instagram for the latest vids httpswwwinstagramcomrage its viral from gurren lagann i love your game a lot of fun well done your 3d engine is a beast wow the way he calls them makes me cringe no buffalo were harmed in the making of this video you should never learn a voiceactors face on false step from oblivion todd your a genius this is just hilariously funnyand im having a blast with itlots of fun and epic action apparently buffalo are the only creatures that can survive a post apocalyptic wasteland not cockroaches hmm i need to redo my research mumbles off screen why am i still fucking conscious totally accurate reflection of the tone of the game lmfao what a joke oh the explosive barrels how long has it been in our lives how many games cant imagine what it would be without it i was all excited for this after how much i loved the original then denuvo thought you were over that nonsense bethesda it looks greatbut am i the only one who wants some halfway decent customization i have a feeling its just going to be lazy vesttype armor and no raider garbsspikesmasksplatingtubesetclet alone actual crazy mad max style helmets let me dress up as those cloaking raiders for fucks sake okay this actually looks fun is it just me or does the narrator sound like sam riegel i can never take him seriously after cr lol on second thought forget the buffalo its about time me and that shit talkin asteroid had a chat when im done with the buffalos family im coming back for that smug ass cliff did that buffalo just laugh at me me better blow it up just to be safe that smug cliff whos the voice rage 2 the sequel we never expected in a million years oh the people behind fallout 76 made nahh im good i dont like all the sily irreverance but im sure the gameplay will be good gotta blow it up just to be safe loved this trailer than any other game trailer one buffalo was harmed during the making of this video but the smug cliffs oh they were fucking harmed age restrictions make me sad you had my curiosity but now you have my attention i just bought the deluxe edition the ultimate question will there be a solid axle in any vehicle oh joy another borderlands rip off yawn very excited for this new game this is no game this is life damn barrels sounds like my life definitely getting this game along with doom eternal take my money already there was a time when i had little to no interest for this game welcome to a new era super mutants with fricking lasers on their heads rip bethesda studios everything vs the player like every bethesda game ever this game looks great i just wanna kill everything including that smug cliff look at it judging me im gonna pick up rage 2 on may 13th 900 pm at gamestop its a monday im gonna be tired on tuesday can you see the legs of the ranger if you look down wow i am so excited for rage 2 the first rage was one of my all time favorites thank you for making my dream come true bethesda time to see how bethesda fucks this man i love bethesda yeah sounds like youre just wanting people to pay for patches for fallout 76 sounds like in game purchases are important rather than making it realistic and not kicking people off like im hearing i think im gonna get all this for free somehow from now onjust like my kid and i dont give fortnite any money and they let us run around crazy without people complaining boohoo someone is not being nice on this game wah german version is more badass because the voice is this too going to become pay2win like all of your new games please add doom slayer as a charracter in game please samurais are cool in my opinion bethesda please make things not drop in bags because i cant customize my house and even know there are decorations in the camp junk can also be a decoration anyways enemy players wont be able to take the junk on things because i put tons of defenses around my house and this would also make players want to build more defenses around there base or house and let people pick things up like from fallout 4 and im a true fallout fan im not making or yelling at bethesda to add this its just a thing that i wanted to ask bethesda to add looks amazing but i know theres gonna be alot of unneeded hate for this game because its popular to shit on any new games right now did that buffalo just laugh at me better blow it up just to be safe aaaaaaaand preordered stop my penis can only get so erect i get the impression this was fallout as it should have been great game except for that smug cliff looks like it is way too op to beat please nerf thanks i think this game looks great but this trailer is just cringe in a bad way ah yes ofc while 76 is being retrofitted w almost every bugfix u can come up with we get this monty pythonkafkaesque fallout with more cybernetic enhancements grander canyons ily beth lets get married peta hates u now so is this what was going on when minoru went to get water from mt fuji for akira yall about to bank 120 from me going to buy both doom eternal and rage 2 ok now i need this game ill be honest i was a bit on the fence but now its on said i wasnt gonna preorder it and wait for reviews fuck fuck dont do it 3999 shit 115 the wingstick is back this dude needs a cough drop this batmanduke nukem voice sounds painful im just here because of roblox this game looks amazing too bad it wont have coop or multiplayer at all that damn cliff looks like a different version of fallout still looks good though never played the 1st one you know regardless of how the game turns out it nice to see a aaa game trailer not taking itself so damn seriously nooooooooo they changed aaron paul as the protagonist damn it he sounded much more badass the newest game from bugthesda game studios looking at fallout 76 2 here now that cliff was very smug in the german version of this trailer a voice actor named marko krger sponge all this lines fun fact he was also the voice actor of patrick from spongebob in germany love you sam perfect man for the job dlc 1 the cliffs return iam fucking sold why am i still fucking conscience i cant wait for this game to just work so i can get a sense of pride and accomplishment because i dont have a phone this is dam hilarious wow i was really excited and hyped for this game until i seen some new recent gameplay footage it looks like you have removed alot of details that made this game look fun and enjoyable like where is all the blood and gore for example there is no blood on the ground or walls after you shoot an enemy you shoot an enemy and all they do is explode and vanish or turn into little giblets there is no evidence of where you shot them or how if this does not change by may 14 then i wont be getting this game i dont support devs that half ass their games and lie to their players seems like devs forgot how to make good games i didnt expect that it seems really nice more rubbish coming out from bethesda oblivion staff ultra violent gangs huh that doomguy scream when he falls too very id software of you love it is this another battle royale his voice sounds familiar good to see alex jones is getting a game so it looks like this is an accurate representation of what the world will be like if the far left wins out post apocalyptic wasteland with pink and purple colors everywhere fighting the he shes to bring things back to normal the rainbow parade is on the loose and you are the worlds only hope lmfao i know its not pc to say it but i will say it it feels like me vs the far left all over again that smug cliff changing my gamertag to that smug cliff imagine if this game was made by ea alright im buying plz be good better then wolf 2 cant wait for this i think ill be playing mk11 more than days gone getting bothpaid for and if i dont beat days gone before this is out also paid for this takes the drivers seat hell yes this game looks cool but it has the bethesda name on it so i will not buy it i genuinely have no interest in this game and yet cant stop watching the trailers ciaobuffalo in all seriousness you should have called the game brexit hello borderlands 3 i thought you were only going to be on epic store but here you are and youre looking a lot better too now lets make love with barrels im so glad wing sticks are going to be in this game xd me gets shot also meits that fucking smug cliff look at this looks like a really good game is gonna come out ps loved playing the first rage game on ps3 this game will be either legendary or utter shit how many trailer does this game have this will be a nice snack before borderlands 3 comes out i hope the end boss fight is the smug cliff the theme of rage 2 is so different from rage 1 lmao i was having a shit day until i saw that buffalo no one me did that fucking buffalo just laugh at me why does this have so few views its kind of depressing the game looks great so far is this game coop like borderlands did i make this trailer i really do hope this game open world with lots of content unlockables not dlc the most insane trailer of 2019 not impressed to be honest ive seen faster gameplay in call of duty advanced warfare ive seen much better graphics in tom clancys ghost recon wildlands and for sure ive seen better jokes in borderlands series the real thoughts of our daily lifes is into this game nothing has been lied to id software develops releases on steam me buys i need a smuff cliff tshirt xd i know that i am certainly not the only or first person to say this but i am so hyped for this game i just wish i could put myself into an ark for the next month that smug cliff lol this game will make my pc bleed looks so damn fine lmao a video game trailers thats actually funny cant wait there are more guns that you havent shown right sounds like the actor who played peter parkerspiderman in the amazing spiderman 1 2 games this actually looks like a really fun game bethesda please dont fk this one up like fallout i want it to be good because i want it this looks awesome i already pre ordered it so exited eh you should have kept with the andrew wk vibe from the start this just trailer is just dumb there had better be an achievement for killing a cliff about roblox filing lawsuit you might shut it down and its my favourite game and never ment to copy itnand didnt deserve this the ending takes everything i had a straight face through the whole video but the moment the buffalo came up i couldnt help but laugh who is the voice actor this game is better than fucking porn hub looks so much better than borderlands 3 seriously those that say this game sucks need to jump off that smug cliff i stand alone id have it no other way that forced lol makes me cringe is that sam reigal refund fallout 76 buffalo dies peta wants to know your location one of the best trailers ive ever seen was that sam riegel narrating they sure know how to make a good trailer xd whatd mrbuffalo do to deserve this 017 howld on fellas my girlfriends callin hey sis hows mom

especially like the vehicular combat huge explosions and fun physics like their mad max game my boi sam really bringing something special to this trailer i will wear that buffalos coat on my back and call him horace ps i cant wait for this one 011 did i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is fuck you cliff im looking at you too barrel dont start with me may 14th is too far away that damn cliff peta enters the room invisible samurai fear and wolfenstein 2009 references this gets best trailer for me it was so funny when the buffalo falls from the cliff this games looking good liking the sense of humor it has be awesome if they remastered the 1st game as a preorder bonus would love to have both to add to my collection poor buffalo let me join the samurai and im in im all in lets go something to play until april 2020 when bl3 releases i took 2 weeks vacation for this game cant wait my god its its beautiful i like these trailers tbh xd ah great video bethesda who needs a multiplayer when rage 2 has a single player only experiencethis is a open world arena style game no multiplayer no thanks that smug cliff this looks like a great game is the humor for the trailer or is walker really like that in game 6 hours into game why the worst enemy of all the fps games ive played i have died more times than the super bosses of most games why why this nameless fear the unending danger if i had to give it a title it would be platforming in a fps no matter what i will always be defeated by the cliff but i will rise above it i will stay on top i will not panic midjump and stop pressing the leftstick forward too long or i could just stay away from cliffs yeah yeah thats a better plan well blood hell why didnt i think of that bloody heck just gotta stay away from the gosh darn things thats a foolproof plan nobody has ever fallen down a pit when there is no pit 6 12 hours into game quad jump boots oh bloody hell p rage 2 gonna be awesome its has borderlands cyberpunk feels might get into this after release that smug cliff is the ultimate enemy cause its almosteverywhere rip fallout this is the first trailer that actually got me interested in the game a bit so is there character customization or can you at least get youre character their own outfit man fuck that cliff we want doom eternal trailer this looks so good been waiting for this since the first rage what fallout 76 should have been brilliant loved the cliff fall guy gosh this trailer was probably to fun to make just imagine the guy who voices walker in the sound booth laughing his head off also stupid cliff that cliff will be the ending this is one of the best and funniest video game trailers ive ever seen im assuming this guy talking is the mc if he is i think im gonna enjoy playing as him a lot xd this game is fucking insane xd good gamehave fun when you come outonce your father is coming back and regardless of anyone h8ting in anyway on itborderlands 3 consoles only i give my f and rip to you pc bois is coming to clap your cheeks into oblivion as the real shit is coming back destiny gtfo still love you bungie borderlands stilll is the game im actually hyped about this game so i take it this game wont be tackling the subtle nuances of the moden political landscape wasteland samurais oh gawd the weeaboos have escaped that fucking cliff man so in about a month my life will be complete nice man between this and bl3 which one will be the true mad max successor some games dont need reviews just watch the trailer and go buy em gotta admit that trailer was pretty good humor is cringeworthy but the game itself looks fucking fun as hell instant buy for me looks way better then far cry new dawn im so fucking hyped cant wait to kill that cliff this was a pretty fucking good ass mother chucking cliff trailer hahaha now this is how you make a trailer wasteland samurai the fuck also yeah that buffalo was too smug is rage 2 a looting rpg that fucking barrel man welp i see what im going to be playing while i wait for metro and bl3 to hit steam goddammit add coop or maybe some pvp and it could outshine borderlands 3 is this gonna be open world how is this funny i swear dude ever since borderlands all these companies put this awful comedy in their rpgs it looks like outer worlds is doing the same dumb shit dear santa i want the nailgun pop rockets and wingsticks play better in xbox screwsmugcliffs screwbuffalos you had me at redneck mech motion blur settings fov slider these are necessary for console i sure wish i could justify buying this i cant though not after everything that happened maybe in a couple years when its dirt cheap and reveiws have made clear any and all anticonsumer design choices but not now now if only you guys brought the same expertise to fallout 76 im so hot right now did that buffalo just laugh at me blow it up just to be safe lmao smug cliff is to op plis nerf bruh that voice acting though its very dramatic this game actually looks good todd howard could learn something here rage ragerage against the dying of the light kinda looks like far cry mixed with borderlands 2 i didnt like the first rage but im open to being pleasantly surprised by rage 2 aint tryna hate on something before i play it poor buffalo that cliff seemed a little too smug i was always interested in this game but this was the trailer that just sold me take my money this buffalo totally fucked with the wrong guy it kinda makes me happy how great single player games are coming back ty for putting this on steam preciate it collector editions are still available on amazon nice to see they seem to have enough for everyone this time inb4 egs exclusive i dont know man i was expecting some 80s vibe initially and we got max mad borderlands style rage 1 had better art direction i already know that smug cliff is op and will require balancing i want a bunch of freaking sharks with lasers on their head edit cyber crusher with a freaking laser on its freaking head get some early youtube reviews out and if its good then ill get it early too you can do it bethesda sounds like the jewy chriso worldview bunch of beefeating untouchables i hope this game is better than 76 if it is not going to give me rage bethesda vs me espero que sea mejor que f76 si no me va dar rabia smug cliff best enemy in a while such charisma honestly if they had introduced loot and 4 person coop to this game it couldve crushed borderlands 3 soo fucking badly i did not expect this trailers tone man i loved rage but this is straying faaaar from it i literally hate being overpowered in a game or having too fancy stuff i want a desert i want a wasteland i want factions and survival without the necessity for the fancy stuff such as this but people are loving it guess i am just going to ignore this too bad for me fact bethesda could make a better mad max game then what we got 1010 thank you for the steam version how many more official trailers do we need to get hyped borderlands 3 looks like a bad joke compared to this when youre so desperate to be borderlands looks like a game a lot of developers and artists poured their heart and soul into thats going to be totally eclipsed by borderlands 3 this game has more trailers than potential buyers hope game will be as good as these trailers sweet just like real life thank you bethesda for the understanding trailer better than borderland 3 029 one false step from oblivion i totally agree on your opinion about skyrim im afraid of the cliff new doom eternal videos when is 76 f2p yet one of the best cant wait for the start of this show doom mad max and just cause having sex togetherd will this be pay to win ign 510 cons too much sand and smug cliffs thank you bethesda and the studios over there for keeping first person games alive local man destroys the world cause it was out to get him well fuck you too you smug ass cliff awesome trailer and not a single bit of sjwpc or identity politics bullshit in sight this is how game trailers should be done and this is the reason why im buying the deluxe version over the standard hmm might become a underrated game some of the best trailers that i ever see congratulation on that bethesda softworks i prefer this than borderlands 3 and use a epic store 3 toty 2019 confirmed trailer of the year better blow it up just to be safe oh i like this guy this is going to be fun borderlands who get rekt randy prickford is is the commentator fucking viral from gurren lagann if theres no buffalo to shoot rocketguns at i will rage behtesda shure does know how to make impressive vilians alduin the ceaser enclave benny molag ball dagon todd howard but the best one is that smug cliff this is gonna be so good 3 fuck you cliff im sorry to anyone who is named cliff is sam from critical role the narrator to this trailer fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered fallout3remastered smug cliff is the hardest boss in sekiro the voice actor sounds like sam riegel it official rage 2 is gonna be my favorite kick back and relax game where i can duck anything i want with a rocket launcher and not worr6 for consequence and just fuck around did that buffalo just laughs at megotta blow it up just to be safe i love the look of this game cant wait smug cliff dancing the game looks amazing but this trailer is a disgrace is nothing safe from marvel jokes these days hmm seems fun hopefully the reviews are good tbh this trailer is actually funny cant wait to play this crazy shit xd why am i still conscious too much lands not enough border ign i love the sense of humour for this gameits just so randomly awesome this and doom eternal are putting the fps back in first person shooter i really want this game any chance we can preview the wasteland wizard cheat codes actually made me chuckle for a second on the buffalo part not bad not bad graphics gun play smug cliff and the bafflu i can smell a masterpiece cant wait to show smug cliff whos boss rage 2 marketing what the hell is that just do stupid shit love it all d damn you cliff shakes hand at the edge i m just loving this game more and more after every trailer this is the best trailer ive seen in a while to be fair this game genuinely looks fucking amazing from all the trailers you can play as female walker right where is female trailer then so to speak i dont give a crap if it bethesda launcher exclusive anything beat the chinese spyware shit epic store never had you or any other shop ignore my call for help epic store last year let some ass hat hack into my account gift himself or some guy he knew 365 worth of games directly from my account not once did they answer me or my credit card agent inquiry i keep on bugging just to receive an automatic reply luckily thank to my lovely agent i got all of that money back this is even before i aware of the chinese communist regime spyware fuck epic store i may sound arrogant but every single employees work for epic is a slut and their mother is a big whore this looks way more fun than all the fortnites and multiplayer clones that come out every week wow so hyped my pc xbox one x are going to love this fucking love it every trailer and gameplay footage they show makes me even more amped up to play this with rage 2 and then borderlands 3 and doom eternal coming later this year this is the year of the awesome first person shooter genre its a great time to be a gamer should look amazing on my ps4 pro in hdr and for those who have the xbox one x even better the weakest point of rage 1 was its story the world although limited was awesome and immersive and the gameplay was superb now it seems more like they dont take the story too seriously and i honestly think thats a good improvement if they manage to have the same kind of amazing gameplay and world then its sure to be a great game thats how you make a game trailer funny shit who cares about borderlands 3 now that progress booster in the collectors edition bothers me microtransactions finally a game about detroit d you can call me hater but this is not rage this is bulletstorm with this superman as a main hero there will be no place for such atmospheric missions like dead city from original rage this clownish style completely ruins the game what a trailer i hope this game is as good as it looks the more i see the more i like im starting to get hyped about this game where is the epic exclusive logo plot twist laughing buffalo on a smug cliff is the final boss so this is how terra looks like before the wars of unification it is a fun game keen to get a full play through the doom game i always wanted but never knew it looked like this so video are unavailable till an hour later likely other stuff needs to happen this looks great oh no its the smug cliff you know what i had my doubts at first but this is kinda growin on me like a tumor ive kinda had to deal with it but then i realized you know what this might as well happen but im glad i didnt just out right say nah this game sucks because it looks kinda fun gonna be honest here this is already one of the most unoriginal and try hard shooters of this year why is the video unavailable this motherfucker got a joke i cant wait 2 play dis and doom eternal and cyberpunk 2077 like if u agree is it not working for anyone else now this is how you do a trailer 210 too many cliff not enough buffalo the two only things that dont like it are the exclusive mission with the preorder bonus and the progress booster with the collectors edition wtf the trailers are always so fun but its interesting that journalists that have played it dont usually think the advertising tone reflects the tone of the game 010 this game doesnt feature a hexagosexual black russian muslim budist and is too hard video unavailable wait what im really split on this game because the gameplay looks sick but i hate the whole over the top randem xd aesthetic ehh 310 from ign where are my fisticuffs i wanna punch things love this trailer cant wait to play lots of trailers i need the game no one likes a smug cliff we want a happy one i knew it all along those barrels where always out to get me barrel good stuff thanks for steam version 3 this trailer solidified my purchase this is like a mad max fans wet dream come true that was a good fucking trailer we need coop and id software hey the g is of logitech lol these trailers are the greatest thing since sliced bread im not intrested the new fallout is better than 76 i hope that smug cliff is the final boss i want whatever they were taking when making this the buffalo part made me piss myself i truly support this level of violence and mayhem bring on the destruction only 5 weeks left to go i want this game so bad ill do whatever it takes to wait make rage franchise great again if in doubt blow it up okay this sold it for me i just want to know if you play as someone or can make your own character actually looks good florida the game not gonna lie this looks pretty good please have a better storyline unlike the first one 006 war never changes yeah fuck that red barrel that smug cliff is this the new borderlands this looks great still going to wait for reviews before i consider spending money but yeah looks like a ton of fun not serious 210 ign this trailer is me versus my responsibility when this game comes out blows buffalo peta disliked this video this game looks really polished and fun reminds me of cyberpunks trailer thing lol video unavailable bethesda are you feeling okay when doom eternal comes out this is like open world doom with lots of content oh man i cant watch it for some reason first of all ima find this smug cliff and jump on it second please dont make multiplayer steam achievements that is if there is some sort of multiplayer or coop like in first rage i was hoping to get 100 achievements on rage 1 but since there are 3 or so coop achievements i dumped the idea c yo fuck that smug cliff one false step from oblivion proceeds to the show a smug cliff edit never thought my highest likedupvoted comment will be due to a smug cliff thanks bethesda i guess it looks great cant wait to lesso bandits and drive the car around the whole town that cliff is gonna die why am i still fucking conscious thank you kanye very cool holy shit this looks amazing does this count as fallout 5 cliff too op pls nerf fuck off bethesda i cant freaking wait for this game looks promising maybe ill give it a shot wow cool i buy the game and the grafic is not the same you show here a other better grafic is this ps4 gameplay or pc its too bad they couldnt have approached the sequel to prey with the same vigor as rage 2 701 is that a steambot please take my money looks like a mix of mad max and doom awesome i will pick the ps5 version for 60fps lockhuge backlog to play this is gna be awesome ive never played rage and thought it didnt do well but this is cool so i dont know this game looks so awesome it will look so amazing on ps4 pro in 4k you had me at hello half life 2 was better rage 1 was one of the most underrated last generation games fps gamers are not able to see beyond cod or bf this is definitely a must have for this generation 30 fps on base ps4 60 fps on pro a bit disappointing considering doom eternal is 60fps all around but as long as its a smooth locked 30 it may be okish i never heard of rage one but this game looks awesome 513 so in this game you can get possessed by the doom slayernice xd playstation fans are so nice this is the future of the usa what fallout should have evolved to way much more than cod bo4 still does not have dynamic weather in the game this game looks like what i always wanted rage to be borderlands titanfall rage 2 obviously sjw trash not a big fan of doom combat find it boring repetitive i think im gonna pick this up instead of fallout 76 im glad they posted this now i know for certain i dont need to play this this one looks fun i played this on ps3i loved it cant wait for this to come out pls tell me this is coop campaign mad max doom rage 2 awesomeness mani like the 1the second i will buy sick powerswhats that like the flu can anyone explain rage to me i heard alot of people say its an amazing game just with a terrible ending i hope they still have the giant mutants i remember when i used to play rage and i would be strolling through a deserted city when a mutant as big as a sky scraper would just come around the corner rage 2fallout 76 and look at cod bops 4 i need a ps4 im pc gamer rip this is basicly fallout 5 if the devs are reading please add at least coop to enjoy with a buddy so its basically mad max with doom combined together in a single game the punching thing is corny doom mad max twisted metal rage 2 ill just stick to watching movies like mad max and toxic avenger for my mutant wasteland apocalypse world or ill play border lands which is a lot more funny and has cartoonish style that just makes it fun also doom looks better looks fun and all but i will take rrd2 and spiderman over this anyday will it have online coop the same girls from the gta trailer 60fps on ps4 the vehicle combat reminds me of avalnches mad max graphics are next level why do so manny games have to have this almost robotic like female voice for there trailers just use a character from the game its so annoying sorry ive never played this before but are there loot drops at all ah spartan rage but with guns i dig it this is prob how borderlands was meant to be 242you forgot lubed up thanks but i did not appreciate the voiceover i want it now fallouton crack excited doesnt even begin to describe how im feeling this game looks really fun cant wait to get it in 4 years when its free on psn this thing with vehicles i hate it i hate it all i hope that i can skip it if not i wont buy it the new mad max looks amazing cant wait for this one lol watch this game be like 30 minutes long again way better then cyberpunk 2077 hit mad rage road of doom i wish i can explore this with my friend very impressive 707 have i ever told you the definition of insanity why show pc footage on the ps4 channel we know were getting 30 fps for base ps4 id be surprised if the pro runs this at a solid 60 the only thing i need from this game is a place for settlement then im in another hit fot bethesda who needs bo4 looks promising for me 457 that boomerang is so op that he cuts even the container much better than the last showing mad max on steroids this looks like a ps5 game definitely buying its funny that the video offers a faster frame rate than the ps4 especially with a cpu intensive game like this get ready for 13 frame drops every other second at a locked 30fps please bring this game to asia who want to play rage2 like my comment oh please no another dull shooter by bethesda static sky part 2 goddahmmm so many awesome games this year not enough space better upgrade to 4tb lol this game looks bad crossplay in fortnite mad maxxxx meet rage 1 heck yesss i hope they dont go too futuristic with the gunsweapons i liked the old fashioned weapons this looks even better i loved rage 1 and this looks great cant wait to see doom eternal too any way to play this at 3rd person otherwise i may choose to pass this one with cyberpunk otw do we need this im seriously asking do we this is how u show a game bioware f anthem this game looks awesome but how is it the owners of the mad max license arent sueing the pants off this game some doom mechanics in there my poor wallet not holding my breath on this oh what a lovely day man this looks fantastic wheres the pre order button rdr game of year relax rage calling it now this game is gonna be trash its generic does nothing new doesnt look that great and the story will be a copy and paste movie script thats been done a hundred times already 2019 will be epic game looks way better than i thought didnt know that we needed rage 2 day 1 for sure only on ps4 the platform of choice that is this is giving me a brink bulletstorm mad max feel too it women wrestling games free t ps4 60 fps i dont think so the graphics i was hyped but now it looks so generic i dont know what think about this game oh this isnt mad max wrong trailer i am sorry but ign naming it the best shooter of e3 2018 doesnt do a thing for me flashy but seems underwhelming needs to be blood on the walls drops into wasteland i am here did they use the same narrator as rdr2 gameplay trailer i like game trailers like this very informational im really looking forward to this now this is impressive xbox is better ops that voice over needs to go not one bad thing to say about this when mad max and far cry get a baby 30 fps in ps4 no party what borderlands wishes it was looks cool gameplay looks smooth af edit thanks for 5 likes i hope you have a lot of ammo to over waste it like that rage 2 is a mixture of doomgun playand mad max driving part and fallout enemies and enviroment im going broke this year and next year mutant crusher needs a bigger diaper its looks awesome i will have so much fun that car combat looks sick day one is this game is in play store ps4 this week as long as mad max is related somehow it make me more excited to get this game i havent seen a game this fun since bullet storm ill be happy if my laptop can run this at 1080p 60fps on high settings i dont even care how loud it screams in pain its gotta stay pretty future playstation plus free game of the monthcoming soon any chance this gonna run 60fps i wish it does that 60 fps on consoles as well wait is it a sony exclusive xbox and ps4 crossplay plz let it happen definitely a game my collection needs convoys were awesome in mad max glad theyre bringing them to this normalbut the last of us the best looks easy af lets hope there is an actual challenge im in too its lit as f i might get this this is even better than doom eternal this doom eternal and metro exodus i cannot wait definitely getting this when it releases 234 yep if i can choose gender im totally making a tank girl character looks like a empty open world with nothing to do auto aim for your car weapons i see right through this flashy trailer looks fun but also a bit pointless this game looks like so much fun really excited for this one i never wouldve thought that a sequel to rage would be an anticipated game of mine but rage 2 is more than just that it is easily one of my most anticipated games it looks amazing why is there a narrator shes annoying looks like it could be one of the best games ever made what console should i buy the female announcer is great i need a release date theres gonna be a lot of cut content rage2 loot hunting and classes like borderlands would make it perfect mad max ripoff i like it this looks all kind of insane fun ill check it out when it launches this is the sequel all fans of rage and bulletstorm were waiting for bulletrage or ragestorm is coming lol happy 420 everybody super hyped for this game punk doom with car this is like bulletstorm and mad max merged together with the gameplay of doom im excited to see more rage one was so fun especially with multiplayer definitely an underrated game rage 2 looks amazing one of my most anticipated games and probably my most anticipated fps so when will i be able to preorder this on psn all it needed was a futuristic comeoverhere electric whip and it would have easily been branded bulletstorm 2 that reminds me i need to pre order this one right here and now more id shooters pls cant wait we want the forest madmaxdoom and fallout4 outstanding game i cant wait to get it this is pc footage from quakecon is it just me or does the computer lady at 546 sound like shes from doom 038 completely free of load screens well see looks cool i wish playstation would bring back 2 player coop games like guardian heroes hercs adventures or gun star heroes this game looks ridiculously fun i cant wait for this it looks fun get your feet up on the table grab the drinks and junk food next year were all going missing becuae of this game and all the others coming out sir playstation can u make minecraft with online servers shut up and take my money cant wait for this game is this destiny doom bulletstorm mad max this game reminds me of prey 2 when that was in the works same sort of gameplay and abilitys playstation is the best sold my playstation buying it for the pc now the comment 13 this looks fun af ill be singing this trash hello playstation 026 is the word yall got any beans too bad about all the neon pink bought this for ps4 pro near release great gamebut downloaded on game pass over the holidays to see if it looked any different and it definitely looks cleaner on the x it looks way too soft on xbox one x the guns look blurry and the environment just doesnt look good xbox one x did it better then blurry ps4 pro the system is so tax drops 1 or 2 frames in one scene lol 224 them breakin skills though i feel like the ps5 should go for 4k 60 fps and 8k 30 fps personal preference i have all next gen console and a gtx 1660 pc and i think im the only one who thinks 30 fps is great for console but it has to be stable unlike last gen consoles im not a fan of the overuse of pink lol what the hell on base consoles it ass why pay for this when you can get another game with 60fps with good frame pasting please reply your opinion detest that cover art and that stupid face of his played the game a bit too a bit crap nothing wrong with 1080p especially on a monitor thankfully the xbox1x has freesync and i have a samsung 4k tv which has freesync too 30fps sucks on first person shooters ahh sweet 60fpsiam so buying this game am i the only one whos facing dips and problems with loading the menu screen tearing on the ps4 pro will be picking this up on the pc to play at 1080p with ultra settings the xbox one x and ps4 pro screens look the same to me god bless the x will deliver uncompromising 4k 60fps rage 2 really the one and only reason microsoft fans had for the system over the ps4 pro and it fails why get the x when the pro has tangible exclusives and good performance at 1080p betting we see this with the next gen too both will say 8k 60fps but in the end it will come down to exclusives microsoft fans will defend the system even without a large catalog of exclusives as usual while sony will pop them out left and right as if it were a chinese sweatshop factory paying kids with candy in my opinion rage was the looking game on 360 great engine 1080 60 on 360s specs game was meh thou i play it on the original xbox one white system looks and plays great why not just give the option of a 4k 30fps 1080p60 is fine but a choice of running it in 4k30 would have been a nice addition or even an enhanced visuals mode which seems odd not to be included especially on xbox one x as that only has 4k textures available i dont understand why farcry 5 have same 30fps on ps4 like this game but i feel fc5 smoother than rage 2 does anyone know why rage 2 looks blurry and jagged edges in ps4 pro my 1080p 60 ps4 pro has pretty bad quality on my 1080p monitor 60hz anyone got an idea for making it look bette at the mome t it is berry blurry and jagged edges 60fps is always better i played forza horizon 3 on xbox one s at 30 fps it was fantastic but then i played it on my friends pc and realized i totally wasted the experience of the game how rude thanks for not allowing us to enjoy motion blur off why couldnt the devs just lower the resolution on the base consoles and maybe lower the graphics a bit and the game would run 60 fps if rage 2 was designed to be played 60 fps then whats the point playing on the base consoles its so lame that you are forced to buy a completely new console just to unlock 60 fps this is why i prefer playing on pc rage 1 still looks better than all switch games going to buy the game when i have time to play because of 60fps despite the reviews well done devs err id rather have higher resolution and 30fps just my opinion wait wait wait wait wait 1080p is a low resolution oof i didnt know i thought that 720p was low and 1080p was the standard for newer consoles really like this game but it uses 45 gigs of vram and i only have 2 so i run into some issues i run on windows10 1080p50 fps ish but im turning it down a little bit maybe ill try 900p im not surprised this game was forced to run at 1080p on this graphic level for consoles lol so much for true 4k lol expect the same on the next gen as welllol i loved rage 1 a lot and its story i think a minority would agree with that idk i havent touched rage 2 because it looks like they went for something else completely different the overused glitchy effects and the theme of the commercials just completely took my interest away 60 fps is good and all but its shitty practice to just ignore the enhanced consoles or at least give a toggle option is there any graphical between pc and xbox one x if playing at 1080 on pc i gave up on this video when he said from what i am hearing on thr pc side i love seeing games like this being a decently consistent framerate with all this great effects and crazy looking stuff going on and then there is dead on daylight on console why i love pc i can adjust settings and upgrade hardware to get 60fps do have 144hz 1440p monitor with freesync or turn off certain effects motion blur im talking about you and other settings i dont like to get the look i want and experience console i am limited to the options of the developers and limits of the hardware personally spending 400 on a xbox one x and i got a ps4 pro to play games at higher resolution then playing this at 1080p is stupid they should of been a option to favour performance or resolution like alot of games do i always go for resolution as that is why i bought the higher end consoles for 1220 if youre just here for the perfomance stuff and dont want to waste too much time 19201080 at 60 fps is and will always be the best way to play my god look at your screen its very crisp at 1080p we dont need 4k when they only can run it at 30 fps i perfer 108060 over 4k30 but seriously shouldnt they have just given us the option to pick like other games have wish it was optimized to run in 4k on the x its like a watered down version of a next gen game or a game developed for high end pcs id rather play on 4k 30fps on campaign and enjoy the beautiful crisp textures than that blurry 1080p 60fps is amazing in online but not campaign this game even makes my 2080ti sweat at 4k overclocking gets me over 60fps though i like the smoothness but in terms of graphics it looks like a game from 2015 looks like they disabled the enhanced rgbcoloring on ps4pro for this presentation not buying this game until theres a 4k patch i think 1440p and 60fps is possible i want m k support watching this at 075 playback speed is pointless but a blessing looks great on all platforms my game looks like shit hey add me on xbox my gamertag is lost overlord as an owner of a samsung 4k qled i much prefer 1080p 60fps this generation avalanche made a great choice other developers should do the same and give better performance other than just a little crisper image rage 2 on my ps4 pro is a blast smooth fun time time to go play some more how does changing the fov impact the framerate turning off motion blur is always the best choice digital foundry do you think the new generation consoles ps5 and xbox will be able to run games in 4k at 60fps cant they just give the pc experience to all console gamers so they can deside whether they want effects and resolution or framerate 60fps is the way i hope next generation all the games reach this target on console now there are to much game that runs crap for more resolution or graphics i prefer good performance its an id software game if it runs anything less than 60 fps the world might end take note devs this is how games should be made with performance optimized all versions are the best that they can be who can ask for anything more not everyone has a 4k tv but everyone has a 60hz one so i have the pro xbox s and the standard ps4 i was looking to get this on the si will get a x or next gen console if there is a halo edition ps if im still playing gta 4 on the 360 im not really that picky of course of course mind you of course mind you of course looks like a ps3 game one ps4 pro and only 1080p omg because i want 4k i have switch from the xbox one x version to the pc version for rage 2 i would prefer that there is an option in the x version of rage 2 to allow me to choose either 4k 30fps or 2k 60fps graphic mode or performance mode all games should includ a choice like this it is not to the the developpers to impose their choice but to the final consumercustomer to have the choice in the options menu we have not the same ideaswhises and they must be equally traited there is no good or bad a simple question of what is important for you no 4k option on this makes me a bit sad people should have the option of which theyd rather personally i think 1080 games on a 4k set looks awful anyone who takes 4k 30 fps over 1080p 60 fps with antialiasing is an idiot and i have a 65 nu8000 4k tv so dont try that lame excuse that i cant afford 4k whats the point of 4k in 30 fps you cant even see anything during motion its a blurry mess 1080p 60 looks so much more realistic thankfully my tv has a low input lag motion interpolation gaming feature but not everyone does and it works well on most but not all 30 fps games and it can upscale 1080p well as long at his the temporal antialiasing also why does pro look so different in two scenes at 958 and one other even while base ps4 looks the same and even xbox one s i love the newest tech but im not super picky i dont see a huge difference between the old and new one i mean i obv see a big difference just not like huge the old one already looked great for its time this is one of those games that brings as to why is this was continued could you please analyze it on pc xbox wins for ever i have a regular ps4 knowing ill be playing the worse version makes me not want to buy this game i can guess commenters here 60 4k for console users samsung 2018 nu8000 and qleds and 2019 ru8000 and qleds have game motion plus which is a low input lag motion interpolation which works fantastically to make 30 fps games look like 60 only issue is a bit of ghosting around the characters head i dont notice it personally it works amazingly on spiderman and games like the division worked decently on ac origins but still pretty good if the 30fps is very stable it works extremely well it can also make 60 fps games 120 fps they also have freesync for xbox one x and gaming pcs i have an nu8000 i love it great tv any difference in pro and x and does turning up sharpness on tv help taa 1623 look guys its overcooked 3 footage because they really overcooked the gamma and saturation on that one i bet you guys are crying that theres no shitty switch port for you to praise endlessly 4k 90fps here pc masterrace 4k 30fps should be an option tho i enjoyed the look of the original rage one thing that really bothers me now is popin couldnt stand it in just cause 3 and 4 maybe the avalanche engine is just prone to popin on these systems this game is so blurry on my xbox x and 4k tv i would rather have a 30 frame option with clearer graphics i dont know how others can even see what their doing in this game it so bad looking patch it please this looks like itll be a really nice pick up when it gets discounted in the future nice analysis havent picked this up yet but ive been considering it im waiting for alex to do a pc analysis first heard it had some issues right now you paid 400 for a ps4 400 for a ps4 pro and probably over a 1000 for a 4ktv with hdr you pay to play online plus 60 on almost every game to get 4k 30fps or 1080p mdium settings 60fps and pc is expensive my pc is 5 years old and i max out everything in 1440p with over 100 fps dont pay to play online and almost never pay 60 for a game i7 4820k 16gb ddr3 ram gtx 1080ti and 9tb hdd with 1tb ssd oh and my 1440p looks way better than whatever consoles are using to do 4k 30 and i own a xbox one x ps4 pro and sold my switch a month ago that is all folks i play 1440p at 144 fps on my high refresh monitor you get a better resolution and high frame rate win win in my book john you have to explain how r managed to deliver gta5 on xbox 360 and ps3 i just cannot find an explanation of how they did managed it xbox one x looks much better look at 1050 the fog is heavy on sony pro machine 1080p is for the people who dont wanna upgrade their tvs or consoles yo digitalfoundry is pc rgb a gimmick on xbox one or nah option for higher resolution and 30fps wouldve better still no mk11 performance review for pc thanks for the coverage i miss the times when we had something fancy like a choice performanceresolution on the midgen consoles i even heard that some developers were able to implement dynamic resolution or something odd called hdr but hey we have some nice and super agressive taa without a sharpening filter yay game is boring shit are you going to do a rdr2 hdr patch follow up video fov impact over performance this is a nice looking game no doubt shame above 1080p isnt supported on the pro consoles but at least they managed to hit a stable 60fps i personally prefer higher framerates as opposed to resolutions higher than 1080p oh god im getting motion sickness from watching this video did the sidekick with the terrible haircut escape from mass effect andromeda when no one was looking ill wait for the pc version if you use photomode to force a time of day change does it stick once you exit photo mode when a mission has a prescripted time of day applied or does the change the time of day trick only work in nonmission areas game sucks why not give players the choice between framerate and resolution games looks shit on a 55oled 4k hdr they should of had 4k301080p60 option no hdr ps4 and xbox are dead consoles unable to handle any recent games at full quality and frames plz could you make pc version analysis instead of wasting ppls time yeah buy 4k tv and then play blurry 1080p popin is a gamebreaker for me developers should prioritise eliminating popin over all other performance issues a tad better 03 frames per second well if there is older gamer than 14 years old i am 28 years old back in the day i preffered higher resolution and higher graphics over the performance we tuned games just to able to play it most of them worked on 15 fps 1024x768 while 1280x1024 was top notch on crt screens years after years dual core processors became mainstream same as dx 10 and dx 11 gpus with 1080p screen and now there is not a such a big difference between 1080p and 2k and 4k like back in the day between 640x480 800x600 1024x768 and 1280x1024 most common monitor size is 21524 inch and for tv is 3042 but viewing distance is longer than for pc gaming so it is highly preffered performance 60 or more fps at 1080p over than resolution 4k 30 or even less fps most improtant is graphics and textures inside the game engine though when graphics textures are crap even at highest settings even 8k resolution is useless 4k resolution will become relevant since we will have 4k 60fps high still a typical shitty open world game with minimal new ideas 832 on the left of lily arm you can see raised slab the flooringrubble has alot more detail df why is this you havent seen nothing till your gaming on a gtx 970 wheres the switch version no rtx enabled pc version i feel like the only person that liked rage 1 i liked its mad max vibes since there have been so many performance related patches since the ps4 pros boost mode initial release can we get a revisit of the earlier pro enhanced titles with unlocked frame rates to see if there have been any major improvments obviously evilboris hdr took a look at it and did a video on it on hdtvtest but i was curious what your guys take was on the newly implemented red dead redemption 2 hdr mode rage 2 and far cry new dawn both have this stomachchurning love for the color pink why both games also share a postapocalyptic theme with loosely scattered settlements struggling to survive against a growing horde of pinkhaired marauders for those who are saying get a pc to play 4k 60fps or more bla bla as a grown man who has been playing videogames for 20 years now i can say that every platform and every version of every console got its own thing and for the price of an xbox one x for example tell me if you can run any game at 4k 30 fps or any modern triple a game at 1080p 60 frames with high settings come on lets grow i guess a lot of that people that say that are kids literally but come on you aint winning a shit commenting pc over everything im done with it at least now i released my anger against this topic have a great day will we ever gonna get an open world game that doesnt make everything in the distance extremely blue i cant see 4k i get about 6075 fps depending on how demanding an area is at 3440 x 1440 ultra with a ryzen 5 1600 and a 2080 i found this an intresting option i never got the refreshed consoles because a little resolution boost dont do it for me if more games took advantage of the hardware and were 60fps i would of bought them both as it is i am staying with the xbox 1 and playstation 4 just 60 what is this 2009 it looks choppy 120 or gtfo framerates over resolution any day anyone finding the vehicles difficult to maneuver with mouse and keyboard or am i just bad at driving heh this game still looks good plus the 60fps is much needed remembers the horrible nightmarish experience dealing with the technical issues with rage 1 shoutout to the creators and directors for making it an even playing field across all consoles you can only imagine how many sales get lost because people feel like they are going to play the worst looking version props more stable on xbox one x df you need to be honest hear because im seeing better visuals on x and your not mentioning them even tho you can clearly see it on your video as it changes from x to pro its a little sharper on the x background details and yeh just over all sharpness bet youd mention it if the shoe was on the other foot and sony had the upper hand crisper as well as higher frames on onex the game runs and plays fantastic on my xbox one x its smooth and impressive screw 30fps i always go for performance mode over resolution on my pro feels so much better playing a fps in 60fps they did a great job on the visuals for sure conclusion to all this is you can play however you want on pc 4k 1440 1080 720 or custom resolutions to get the most out your card 30602490120fps but on console you dont have those options the only console worth playing is ps4 pro for exclusives thats it and thats not worth 400 bucks fake 4k and barely 1080p 60 with so much sacrifice and still get charged 60 bucks for a half ass product if i were given the choice of 1080p 60fps or 4k 30fps i would choose 1080p 60 every time rinse repeat again rinse repeat again rinse repeat same old games gaming has become boring feels good to have little to no limitations when gaming on pc i have ps4 exclusive titles still in the plastic i cant pay 400 for a ps4 pro 200 and it a deal lol man avalanche seems to love this hard lock aim trash there is literally no excuse for this shit on this game unlike on just cause and they still used it was wondering why my eyes werent tired after 4 hours on the x 60 fps 4k df please test a plague tale innocence for pcps4xo next that would be nice thank you the most common reason hdr support is left by the wayside is because hardware support for it is not really that high at all most tv sets that come with hdr use a hack faking the effect for movies and television only its not true hdr and cannot be utilized by developers for their games computer monitors are in a bit of a better state than that but hdr support is still an expensive proposition for most id much rather get 1440p at 144hz and focus my funding there rather than hdr my friends high end gaming laptop with a 144hz panel has hdr but only for movie playback so pc panels arent immune to the worthless gimmicks so from a developers perspective why bother people will start flooding support requests asking why their fake hdr tv doesnt support hdr with the game for the most part its not worth the bother 1080p60 4k30 change my mind image quality on pc how does that differ heathensmotion blur is awful ive never seen one good example of it in gaming 4k is straight hype ill take 1080p 60fps anyday why cant we just have it at 60fps on base systems i played nioh at 720p60 and loved it ill happily take 720p60 here too it runs better on the colecovision they still couldve made this game with better graphics and hdr really disappointed in how this game look wasnt worth the 60prices tag ill wait for 4k60fps on ps5 this is the apex engine i they strained it too hard with jc4 it looks great in these parameters but on a jc scale it just doesnt handle it game of the year we are in need of new consols i hope ps5 and xbox 2 coming soon great vid john game looks great im having so much fun with it i almost felt offended when you said about people that dont use motion blur i wish they would of done what they did with toombraider a 30 fps but higher resolution option as a pc gamer that plays true 1440p at 144 fps true 1080p 60 fps on the enhanced consoles is insanely impressive i personally will always take higher framerates than higher resolution pc or console and would stick by that choice even if the enhanced consoles were native 4k high fps over graphics tired of seeing great graphics on games but cant sustain 60fps why can there not be a 60fps 2k mode so you are at least getting a step above 1080p aswell wouldnt the ps4 pro be better offering games up this way they could have easily done 1440p60 on the xbox one x but maybe they were just lazy this is why pc is the better version 4k60 fps would have been nice to have been given the option for 4k on the enhanced consoles it seems like the current trend in gaming is developers delivering on their original vision on my x in the eden center at night i notice frame drops xbox one x is honestly the dumbest decision microsoft ever made build such a powerful console without exclusives to make use of it how did the sales even go for the console lol egoshooters on a console so whack jesus christ console faggots are saying give me 1080p60 over 4k30 any time but at the same time they still buy shit on console instead of just switching to pc and choosing their own settings stop buying consoles if you want a proper experience next gen is gonna be the same shit with 30fps walking sims xbs is not the original xbo i play on pc so am used to 60 fps and then some with good graphics but seriously it is 2019 all console games should be 60 fps at the very least i loved the fact that this is a 60fps game in an open world game the game does have some pop in issues incomplete textures and some models do not look good at all the game is a bit glitchy at times and the ai is not that good the world most powerful console is running a game in 1080p resolution in 2019 this wont sit well with the fanboys i always playing 1080p games on my 4k tv because of this and this is just what i need thankyou df i use a pc running rtx2080ti and as with every other recent title rage 2 runs at an average of 80 fps in 4k on ultra settings the benefit of having that fps overhead is in the smoothness of the animations making the ai look and feel real obviously its more important to have eye melting textures and beautiful effects out to max draw distance but the fluidity of 3d models adds significantly to the immersion of the game 910 for rage 2 would have been 1010 if it was multiplayer this game is an absolute joy to play and to watch its beautiful and fun please do an analysis of sniper elite v2 remastered on all platforms behold he this guy from the 1400s lol rage 2 the pinkening doom and wolfenstein 2 look much better in my opinion oddly enough imo the taa makes it remind me of a film brightness and gamma level in display options should be added in updates or flashlight because in interiors i see shit especially in dark corners hdr option should be added too did we play the same game ps4 pro version for me did dip below 50 a lot in chaotic battles it once dipped to about 30 one gunfight also it felt like the game had a dynamic resolution as some times the game looked blurry as hell wellspring is a good example and other times it all looks fine the game is so inconsistent with its graphics the engine they used is terrible for optimisation i wonder how rage 2 would run if they used the id tech 6 or tech 7 engine like in doom eternalbut something tells me they would achieve better frame rates in this game with id tech rather than their own apex engine when horizons zero dawn and other games look 10x better at 30 fpslol people celebrating a game that looks looks rage 2 read ass running at 108060fps how standards have fallen holy fuck 60fps over 4k every time they should do a patch to add hdr and a option for 4k 30fps performance first all day i think this is the only open world 60fps game on consoles to date how is the hdr implementation i have a feeling this will pop big time on my oled 1325 ps4 pro i like 60 fps only give me framerate over resolution any day im really enjoying the buttery smoothness on my xbox one x this is what the enhanced consoles should of done in the first place screw 1440p 4k and any minor visual enhancements if they cant give you 60fps id rather want crispy images than the eye hurting blurs every where man i was playing this game on hard and it doesnt really feel hard small lightweight enemies are bullet sponge and deal more damage on the hard setting just a health and damage boost that forces you to watch your distance which is important but doesnt really offer a challenge cant believe this is the same engine as just cause 4 i had fun in just cause 4 but the graphics were pretty bad nope because parity on a 30 more powerful machine is an absolute disgrace i couldnt imagine playing through rage 2 at only 30fps man thats rough what is the price for the 60fps good will very smart move instead of 4k 30 for this game i believe they should have tried for an adaptive 1440p 60fps though but im quite sure they probably tried this and decided to go with 1080p for less drops and way more stability it makes so much fun in this game to skil your character i have all mainskills now and i go super rage mode with over drive its so nice to see every body blows up with my shot gun yeah my pc loves this one video quality is terrible maybe the video is still being processed no reason why it wasnt 60fps on the base platforms doom was dont give me that but its openwoooooorld that was their choice not mine i would be ready to except dialed back graphics in almost any game if would mean no lod popping i am so distracted by lods you can have great gfx but what is the point if pieces of the world are popping in and out killing the immersion on pc with my vega 64 and the vulkan support that it has i get 20 more fps then even the 2080ti vega 56 is 15 more fps then the 2080ti playing at max settings and triple screen resolution of 5760 x 1080 i get a very stable 60 to 70 fps 99 of the timeflickers of 58 low and 75 high fps were seen i am confident the radeon vii will stay above 60fps at 4k always using max settings ps4 could do 60fps at 900p maybe x1 would do 5060 at 720p i mean with that antialiasing it could have run seamlessly from their current resolution i am sure they will eventually come up with a 1440p30fps mode for the other machines yes stop giving me pretty games that look like a slideshow frame rate is the singular reason i switched to pc this generation the original rage on pc still looks half decent i bought it dirt cheap years ago but couldnt get into it unfortunately maybe ill check this one out the heathens that want motion blur disabled yeah i mean who doesnt want all of the detail ruined by blur i mean who wants to see things clearly all the time we could do without the dragged out lame intros for these videos i gotta say the native 1080p resolution on the one x is rather disappointing to be honest i dont care about 60fps at all and would rather 4k30fps this game seems rather disappointing the pc version must be confusing as shit if its taken them this long its much better at 144 fps cmon console makers get with the times 60 should be the low end of the spectrum almost every lcd panel in the last 10 years has been capable of 60hz john buttery smooth linneman this game looks beautiful maybe this will tide me over till borderlands 3 best part is on pc im playing 144 fps at max at 1440p not on this game you guys gotta check performance with fov slider maxed in the games you can adjust the fov im getting this on pc but would love to see how the upgraded consoles handle the higher fov dear df crew can we have an update about red dead redemption 2 performance on ps4pro and xboxonex and about the new hdr implementation it would be great exuse me for my spaghetti english it still has pacing issues with its stupid status updates so lone starr now you see that framerate will always triumph because resolution is dumb better textures and hdr10 would have been nice dude if your playing on base consoles i can 100 guarantee youll be used to 30 fps 7 minutes into the video and im already sold i need this game on pc the game is fun but to be honest the open world is not that fun and some textures look kind of 360ps3 game era if you look close your taxing situation is not very taxing with the speed of kbm gameplay i have been able to create much more explosive things and foliage at once and sowise managed to get my 1080 ti below 60 fps for a fraction of a second at 1440p it was still amazing it held up so well i cant wait for native 4k 120 frames per second with no pop in enter the ps5 i wonder how the game graphics will be in the future the thumbstick deadzones on console are horrible it feels so bad to aim ive never played the rage games but maybe i should pirate this and play it at 144 fps people always argue 60fps feels better but rarely mention that it looks better too everything pops and looks more lifelike regardless of resolution 4k alone doesnt do that ill always choose 60fps even at 720p 4k targets have been a huge waste of the hardware in these midgen consoles 60fps is always my preference where available 60fps all the way this game gave pc users the right options to optimize our experience cant say the same about generation zero which is prettier than rage 2 but doesnt give all needed graphics options to optimize for the best edit the fps drops are not really a problem there are so many 60fps games on console that doesnt deliver anything near this game was surprised to learn this is running on avalanches apex engine so again what the hell happened to just cause 4 lmao i feel like the only one who prefers 216030 over 108060 608 the heathens shots fired by john im on the side of no motion blur i am playing after days gonemy first thought rage 2 graphics is shitit feels i am playing ps3 game always liked rage 1s skybox thought it looked like a real sky when i first played it solid 30fps paired with solid frame pacing is not distracting to say the least whens the pc break down coming i dont see any hdr options and changing the settings i havent seen much change in my fps at all god im so tired of this game such a completely unnecessary sequel and so incredibly phoned in and generically edgy 722 doom was 4k 60 on the one x why would you be happy with 1080p 60 like people are stating in the comments here you cant even get a good 1080p tv anymore the argument for 1080p is just stupidity i guess its the ps pro owners making excuses for thier console again stupidity breeds further stupidity oh dear bumping up the resolution is not the solution to next gen gaming ill take improved graphics and stable framerate all day even a high end pc in some games cant run some games at 4k 60fps then why is like 4k 60 is the standard 60fps 1440p or 1080p as long as it is stable imagine if duniafar cry had this kind of interactivity i refuse to buy any game that bethesda is associated with for quiet sometime fallout 76 was terrible and i want that point to made clear to bethesda mediocrity isnt acceptable and releasing a shitty title like that means the next ten games arent worth my time requesting a df look at idtech over time even on pc the game looks bland i personally think relative to their generations rage 1 was a much more impressive looking game of course 2 looks better as it should with much more power and 8 years of advanced technology but if it was relatively equal to what rage 1 did it would be much more impressive 1 was one of the best looking games of last gen even in spite if not having dynamic lighting and some of the other little flaws the 1st rage had a great atmosphere that rage 2 doesnt seem to achieve everything looks too much pink damn heathens motion blur is a gift that distinguishes games today from the ps2gcnxb era i prefer 60fps but i think that x1x should always have an option for native 4k and 30fps im sure the x can handle 60fps at a variable 4k resolution but the developers have to work with four different consoles and time plus money would of been to great to justify it its a shame but hopefully we see an update also i changed my resolution to 1080p on my x and it does appear to look a little clearer less need to upscale i wish you could turn off the awful aa id rather see jaggies and shimmering than a vaseline lens have both the ps4 pro and xbox one x and the x is my console of choice every time digital foundry love throwing out suggestions about what games can do to lookrun better as if its easy to do go work on a game lads ffs the best use for ps4 pro and xbox one x are to hold my monitors up 30 fps is absolute peasantry im rather disappointed that rage 2 doesnt have hdr just imagine how vibrant its colors would be btw there are loading screens when you fast travel i swear this channel is full of videophiles if you take the graphs off the screen you cant even decipher frame drops at all with the human eye i didnt buy a 4k tv to play 1080p games but my vizio p series does a decent job of upscaling the difference between this avalanche studio and the b team that made just cause 3 and 4 in terms of optimization is painful why does ps4 pro have this dark greyish look its like the entire color pallet is off compared to other versions on base ps4 30fps is really not bad the game to me still feels fast i really enjoy the 60fps and the option to turn motion blur on the ps4 pro i dislike that depth of feild effects screen shaking and screen splatter hope to see these basic settings in future console games ps i do have a pc and i always turn off those particular settings if possible thanks for the in depth breakdown on the apex engine good information for any gamer to pick up on side note that xboxonex is very consistent with performance in most of these platform test very impressive system this seems like a great game to be enhanced on ps5 and the next xbox 4k at 60fps with hdr implementation would be rad and help sell the upcoming dlc ive been playing this decided to stop brilliant is a mega stretch i think no terrible softblurry texture on objects in the distance but amazingly fun game there wont be any screen tearing on my xbox1x with my 55 samsung 8 series on game mode with freesync 2 enabled i gave up my 24 benq rl monitor for the samsung 8 series since it has low input lag and low response time too plus the freesync which the monitor didnt have they need to give an option for 1080p60fps or 4k30fps on xbox1x since its not a multiplayer 1st person shooter 60fps is not that big of a deal i just want to see what this game looks like on my samsung nu8000 with 4k hdr the answer to the question posted in the headline is yes absolutely yes fps over 4k any day of the week the difference between 30 and 60 is far more noticeable than higher resolutions 1080p60 was a good choice by the devs shame more devs didnt offer this option nice ill get it when it goes on sale it would be nice if there would still be a 60fps mode for the base consoles id be happy with 720p to get there even if it wouldnt be quite as stable as the enhanced consoles it seems possible as well considering the game seems more fillrate limited rather than cpu limited great looking game though been waiting for this video keep it up cant wait for the pc coverage of this game thats good they did 60fps i dont know how people stand 30 fps on console thats the biggest reason i play pc also i think all games should choose framerate over resolution but i feel like they always go for higher resolution did they test the one x without motion blur i did not have a slow down at all with that stuff turned off everything felt locked i tested it legitimately and it locked this is why i get upset when people expect new consoles to be 499 that just means 30fps and lower resolutions in the future stop being cheap and pay more for a better console i want ps5 to be powerful 1080p60 should have been the target for the enhanced consoles all along you always forget how much this generation really jumped in visuals when you look at the previous game great work as always are you planing to give us an update on the saints row 3 performance patch for switch 4k 30 1080 60 it just looks so much better i also dont really play fps games but mmos and huge open world singleplayer games like ac odyssey 60 fps on the high end consoles is a better enhancement than resolution only going back and forth between the consoles here the 30 fps looks so sluggish in comparison so much nicer with higher frame rate comments on a non switch df video i will take 1080p 60fps over 4k 30 anyday comments on a switch df video frame rate doesnt matter resolution doesnt matter graphic quality doesnt matter muh portability i can play it on my shitter i dont give a shit paying more for an inferior port wait havent the just cause games built a reputation for having incredibly slow and buggy engines why would they choose them based on the strength of their engine or am i confusing just cause with some other franchise the shallow gamer will complain about the lack of visual enhancements on the x and pro to me and most df viewers 60fps is a huge enhancement and the reason i sold my regular ps4 to get a pro 1080p60 all the way for consoles gimme my framerate anytime for any action faced paced game i would always prefer 1080p60 to 2160p30 1080p and 60fps should always be the thing i think frame rate is more important on these enhance consoles i hope the new doom is also done the same way as rage 2 60fps and 1080p apex legends use source engine if anyone wants to know bethesda sucks none of their games support hdr so i will not buy any game of them hdr should be standard this is why i but a ps4 pro oveasly the pro vershan is batter thanks having a base console myself now i know this game is not for me no mention of the horrible controls at default settings finally what took you so long id take 1080p 60fps over 4k 30fps any day enjoying rage 2 on pc was hopping they would release rage 1 for switch that would be fun also that look kinda reminds me of far cry blood dragon taa really hate it so much i would rather have no aa than taa this is probably the most toxic fucking comment section ive ever seen on a digital foundry video this game is definitely a good technical showcase on why frame rate matters and i thought daytona was informative after playing about 68 hours of rage 2 on xbox one xperfomance image quality any day always the world looks amazing even at 1080p vibrant colors with great explosions good motion blur with option to turn it off and a locked 60fps the game is beautiful and to anyone reading this dont listen to the clickbait review channels like skill up gameranx gamespot etc the open world approach is done amazingly well here with great pacing that doesnt feel aimless in fact many of these review channels gave rage 1 now considered a classic by most people horrible scores of 310 to 510 additionally theyve given great scores to games that features freedom aka aimlessness like assassins creed odyssey and ghost recon wildlands rage 2 flips the script on these games and has a great blend of sidemissions and story that all meshes together during gameplay pick this game up if you have a good pc ps4 pro or xbox one x you will not regret it make sure to b i hate when you guys at digital foundry use the term all versions look exactly the same making everyone believe that 60fps visuals are equally as good as 30fps and for crying out loud is not the 60fps makes the game look sooo much better than the garbage 30fps they look exactly the same if there is no movement at all 60fps visuals are way superior than 30fps they look and feel better so please stop stop stop using terms that may be misconceived by those who dont understand from 30fps to 60fps there is a massive difference in visuals i believe in god so im not a heathen i dont like motion blur now say sorry is it possible when you were comparing ps4 pros framerate that the night time lighting in the town was affecting the framerate i noticed that the xbox one x comparison was during the day not complaining just genuinely curious i liked mad max i dont think it deserved the low scores it got im gonna pick up rage 2 on pc i think you can get it for 40 off cdkeys right now i fucking love this channel ive learned so much and very interesting stuff about game graphics over time while being entertained than you so much 3 compression is just the worst its because john carmack is no longer with id softwareits killing this companythe guy is a geniusthis game should be running the latest id tech game enginenot the avalanche enginehopefully this game will get enhanced to run native 4k60 fps on ps5xbox anaconda next november heathens and streamers just say no to motion blur been saying it since the release of these midgen consoles 1080p 60fps over 4k 30fps every time sure 4k looks nice but basically everything else feels and looks better at 60fps gameplay at 60fps is just 100x more enjoyable and since we play games not watch them 60fps only makes sense why didnt you throw the pc version too just to see if we could spot much of a difference i always like all comparisons and like to see the differences done to each anyway rage 2 looks a hell of a lot stranger than the first i cant say i played any of them as i played only like 30 minutes of the 1st and got bored lol but this one to me just by the video looks far worse and far stranger like alien crap not my taste oh and gosh i really hate all that blur the whole game looks like it has vaseline all over it gosh i really hate too much taa and overexagerated blur though i like motion blur on singleplayer games but not genral huge blur on the whole game just on the motion mad max is a crap too in my opinion i hate its gameplay tbh if they added a patch which enabled 640718p for base consoles with 60fps i would play that if it had proper anti aliasing take a hint from software and make sekiro playable on xbonex for fsake these devs are really good at optimization 5 says they will say this is a bit of an interesting one ign gamespot n other so call gaming jurnalist r sob when they come to review single player games specially as if they r the lobbiest for service based game over single pkayer games they always try to destroy this single player gaming over service based games they will talk about how there is no story or story is weak this same people will never complain about fortnite pubg or other games that has nothing in story watch df for gaming tech n if u dont know what this game is all about then read metacritic user score review they shouldve gave ppl the choice no buy for me they should have added options for 4k 30 or disabling that horrible taa this looks like 900p on a 4k screen no hdr is also a huge disappointment i was expecting cutting edge graphics like the original rage rage 2 i hated the ending in rage 1 tho ps there is something bizarre with some games running at 30fps looking and feeling way below 30 like no smooth at all ive seen other shooters running at some smooth 30fps but rage 2 in particular looks off im gonna wait for the ps5 pro then being on the base console sucks ill buy this game for sure it will take a month or two for me to get this game but ill definitly buy this game for my pspro optional is a great word so while i do respect 60fps 1080p but a 4k option would be nice hopefully it can be added down the line or at least hdr im interested in seeing what avalanche can do next gen with much better cpus why cant they offer 720p60 to base consoles heck i would rather take 480p60 than whatever res at 30 specially on a freaking fps game damn it whilst getting 1080p60 is a great achievement you gotta wonder whats stopping them from just letting the end user choose between resolution and performance the base consoles are running a 30fps build so theres no technical reason they cant just boost up the graphics at that frame rate for enhanced consoles everything shouldve been 60 they did it last gen doom did it this gen i regret the purchase a bit going sound little up my own ass here the simple fact it dosnt have hdr turns me away the use of hdr for this game would be amazaing so im waiting for a hdr patch if the 60fps is fairly stable like it is on pro and x than i will choose 1080p over 4k30 any day of the week for sure glad they went that route for the enhanced consoles most developers wouldve kept it locked 30fps both ways just because its easier but props for these guys making the good effort disgusting use of the x at least provide the option for 4k or 1440p 60fps why enforce parity with a lesser platform no sale honestly thats all i ever wanted i dont give a shit about 4k framerate resolution people who usually prefer 1080p 60 probably dont have a 4k setup as always it is a user preference thing and i am most likely the exception here but going from the beautiful iq of days gone at 30fps faux k rez on my 55 inch hdr screen to rage 2s 1080p sdr somewhat 60fps temporal blurryness was not a welcome comparison to my eyes although it is obviously extra effort for the dev as the end user i would always prefer to be given the option to choose resolution over framerate in the settings shadow of the colossus was a premium example of how effective being given this option on a console can be i call that bullshit or do you all forget that before the pro even exist much less the xbox one xthey launch metal gear 5 the pp and the game was an open world game that on base machines at least ps4 runs at 60 fpsand what happen then o well of course they want to make more money and sony that by that time was developing the pro cap any game even tho the base ps4 can handle it to 30fps so they can sell us this false performance mode please never forgetthis game can run at 60 fps on so call base machines but that dont make sonys any money dont theythis is shameful youre telling me they were able to make this game play at 1080p 60fps on the x but bungie couldnt get destiny 2 to do the same fucking hell i hate bungie anyone who in their right mind actually plays with motion blur enabled is the heathen lets get that straight motion blur sucks no hdr is a missed opportunity definitely the right choice and now that theyve achieved 60fps they can always go back and patch in a 1440p or 1800p mode that runs at 30fps whereas if they had focused on resolution from the start a 60fps mode would probably not be an option very good really for next gen consoles 60fps should be the minimum and really a requirements for games on them now pc version pc test will be awesome 60 fps hell yeah i prefer frame rate over graphics as long as the game doesnt look like ass loving this game either way cant go wrong any system shame they didnt do checkerboarding or something that doesnt seem to be done so often anymore good job guys for making decent tech review and mean while avoid spoilers the lighting is really cool but everything else in this game is just so visually unappealing in my opinion lol umm i think you clearly havent played much the game has a tonne of loading screens hidden as elevator rides whens the pc analysis coming its a blast to play this game very fun as much as i like shooting barrels and having them explode next gen i hope ai is smart enough to realize not to stand next to one in a gun fight when u play 60fps u never go back to 30fps just sacrifice resolutionit worth it i will join the console brotherhood if open worlds like gta6 will have stable not the uncapped frame rate that is worse than stable 30 60 fps 1080p on ps5 on vast majority of crossplatform games pc gaming is expensive and the current graphics is enough for me the only requirement i have is 60fps 1080p cpu limitation in consoles is the only reason i stick with pc have you guys considered adding transitions for each section of the video i mostly care about the tech commentary but can skip the console analysis parts since im mostly a pc gamer then viewers could search for the sections they want and skip what doesnt apply to them its super useful on ign reviews when i want to skip the multiplayer part for example just a thought absolutely love the framerate on the pro and xbox one x game would still be very fun at 30fps but the 60fps really magnifies the awesomeness of the great gameplay really enjoying it right now even with 10 or more enemies on screen explosions and objects flying around with the great feeling physics it still stays super fluid for most of the time good stuff i would rather of had a choice of 4k im sorry but 1080p looks horrible for this game especially on my sony 65 inch people with smaller screens may not notice but 1080p is not enough for bigger tvs resolution over framerate if you cant have both performance over resolution any day of the week ive spoiled myself playing at 144hz and now playing on console sucks for the first hour or so before adjusting to the lower framerate i feel on the enhanced consoles the could have done dynamic resolution 60fps pro 10801620 x 14401800 so like inside areas it is higher for me i always go for the high frame rate option on my x i can output at 1080p upscaled to 4k but at 60fps by far the best on titles like forza horizon 4 shadow of the tomb raider and so on 1080p60fps any day sadly i expect 4k30fps mostly on next gen consoles disappointing rage 2 doesnt have a 4k 30fps option on the x even if it was dynamic it would have been appreciated especially when you consider doom 2016 had a 4k patch for the x and i think doom eternal will be 4k capable on the x as well the worst use of xbox one x and ps4 pro ps4 pro and one x can easily do 1440p 60 fps i personally prefer resolution over frames i love the overall sharpness in detail of higher fidelity however i do believe that anything below a stable 30fps is purely unacceptable its 2019 and devs have been able to achieve 4k at 60fps on xbox one x why is it not a norm yet really hoping next gen xbox and ps are able to run at a native 4k in 60fps at the very least 4k is welcome 60fps is necessary i hope you make a video for a plague tale innocence its a gorgeous game no thanks purple llightning clusterfuck rage 2 looks so bad on an xbox one x i cant believe how truly bad it looks on my xbox one x through my 4k uhd it has artifacts all over the screen jaggies everywhere and garish colorsyes i have it i wanna buy this game buttttt id has great fps mechanics but avalanche has terrible vehicle controls and they feel so stiff the game looks fuckin awesome thank you for the video i also prefer framerate over resolution so id put at least such an option into every game rage 1 was also awesome to play at 60 fps and its great to see the sequel being so buttery smooth on the enhanced consoles 60 fps over higher resolution any day in any game for me now this video tempts me to buy the game no hdr is a dealbreaker for me u didnt test base xbox one cant too buy it on sale for 15 bucks at the most except for unlock framerate and resolution and mouse look any big difference between pc and one x please avalanche bring hdr in a future patch also an option to turn off taa would be nice i prefer details over blurriness even if i get jaggies shootout to the game developers 108060fps over 4k30 or 144030 fps shout out to the devs for focusing on framerate over resolution its quite the technical achievement on what is now aging hardware dont know about the consoles but i suppose joypads the fps doesnt matter much with auto aim stuff on pc though over 60fps and mkb is a must and you can keep the headshots coming easily it feels excellent to play and could not feel better the shooting is the main meat of the game like doom 75fps and over is where it feels best just superb i really dont know how a shooter on a joypad is enjoyable unlike the flick aim headshots on pc makes it totally different to play one is pure fun the other a bit of a chore to me just lower ssao below ultra as it drains fps for no visual difference i didnt pay 500 for an xbox one x to get 60fps i got it for 4k resolution very disappointed that they didnt have an option for 4k at 30fps no hdr as well it looks like ill be saving 60 for another game sorry not enough minor visual and unlocked frame rate is leaving overhead i would like them to give the option of a higher rez at 60 or 4knear 30 otherwise when its cheaper 60fps vs 30fps really doesnt bother me ps4 pro version seems really off almost like a downgraded compared to the xone x 607 not everyone likes motion blur and why are they heathens if they dont like it worst lod ever on this gen so real version on pc then great tech analysis terrible game can we just agree that rage 1 was a graphical masterpiece on it release day this is a game to test your graphics card in 2019 no hdr thats sucks i hate the taa here its on a blurryness level with resident evil 2 remake should have resolution mode and performance modenot a miracle you guys should do an analysis of the new ff vii trailer see what kind of tech is going on up in there this graphics engine is really impressive bethesda should buy it for elder scrolls vi rage 1 had the worst ending in gaming history no hdr support is surprising looks very bloomy and blurry sadly 60 fps is always the right choice for a shooter however the game actually is using dynamic resolution 60 fps is a must im on pc and i see many players aiming for 100 fps personaly i dont feel the need at all specially when sacrificing resolution andor quality i dont play competitive shooters they are boring and too repetitive give me 4k60 and ultra quality and ill be very happy why no hdr im playing at 4k on pc it looks pretty good but hdr would make this so much better should be standard now in 2019 visually rage 2 is a disappointment only 30fps on base consoles and only 1080p on x1x rage was the most technically impressive game last gen 720p60 on x360 with megatextures and rage 2 doesnt even have hdr seems like not many ressources went into pro and x versions gimme a good art style and consistent framerate over resolution any day without watching absofuckinglutely first person shooter at 30 is a nonstarter finally 60fps on enhanced consoles lets buy this guy my only complaint is the game beyond dark on ps4 pro why is there no brightness slider the biggest mistake of current generation consoles is that each company has 2 types of the same generation standardspro x and that is leading for bad results several times on enhanced consoles ps4 pro can easily do 60fps on all games they just want to promote 4k to sell 4k tvs i hate the whole pro and x situation and this video shows exactly why now when the ps5 comes out do i buy at launch as usual and risk getting gimped versions of games like this down the line or wait untill that generation is already half over and get a ps5 pro a console cycle should last 56 years this midgen refreshing causes problems like this and a multiplayer issue when a midgen refresh hits you no longer have the same specs across the board in multiplayer a 60fps player will always have an advantage against a 30fps player and if you have to upgrade every 23 years so you dont get gimped games whats the point of even going with a console then again pc gaming hasnt been great either tons of onlineonly drm unoptimized console ports and epic monopolizing the best games for their terrible platform there is just no winning it would be nice of something stayed consistent pc wins end of story there is a dynamic resolution option on pc with an fps target and it works rather well from my limited testing for me it really depends on the game single player story focused games id rather have 4k 30 and fast action gamesmultiplayer id rather have 1080p 60 guessing the pc review is coming soon gotta satisfy the console bums first i guess too lazy to play it right nowso im getting my dose via youtube no hdr support all that beautiful lighting waisted finally a reason to own a ps4 proi waited too long for this really impressive performance even the xbox one s is perfectly playable that is not common honestly a single player game give me graphics i prefer performance in multiplayer games in a world of choices how the fuck can i not choose to optimize for graphics rather than performance in this game do a plague tale innocence the best use of xbox one x and ps4 pro 100 yes 30 60 thats all anyone worries about back in the day some games had slowdown in it but didnt take away from fun now days a game anint good if it isnt 60 fps which is so stupid oh it drops down in frame rate 2 to 3 dam points and its complaining smdh finally developers are listening the pro and x1 are hitting 60fps at 1080p is what should be the standard imo to put how bad this game engine is compare it to gta v that engine is so much nicer looking and is old as fuck at this point this game is hot garbage especially compared to mad max 2015 which had imho better graphics and driving physics uninstalled this shit isnt worth 100aud i agree here with john at the end i dont understand why most avalanche studio games dont have hdr just cause 3 and rage 2 have such vibrant color pallets that could look even better if hdr was supported i really hope these two games in particular get an hdr patch some day he didnt talk about fov or did i miss it whats everyone setting fov at ive got it on 80 at the moment i mean im glad they targeted 60fps on the enhanced consoles but this game just doesnt do it for me im so tired of open world games theyre the most boring unimaginative slog ive ever played love the df channel and vids but who cares about the console versions lol pc master race even though the game is meh looking forward to picking this up at a discount later and playing it gonna skip for now outside of the fps differences theres a noticeable step up in clarity on xbox x over pro its clear to see even on this youtube video i wonder why this isnt mentioned by john when he is usually so anal about this sort of thing also the impulse trigger support is bloody fantastic on this game but hey platform parity right i have old i5 and gtx 1060 and i can also play in 108060 fps imagine that ill take 1080 at 60 over 4k at 30 every day of the week ps4 is shit again why would anyone buy one of those shit consoles a lot of 4k tvs upscale 1080p content just fine would take the frame rate every time maybe the enemies should stop attacking you next to red barrels does this one suck too doom eternal better be 60 fps on non pro i swear or you could get pc and play in 1440p at 100fps am i recalling correctly the og rage consisting of like 4 disc for the entire game 360 good times therei wasnt looking to make this purchase but i think im gonna go in i would like the option for visuals over fps on my xbox one x i wonder if they will patch it with options to bump up resolution and lower fps some high end pcs cant even run rage 2 2160p with a locked 60fps frame rate this game is very demanding so i didnt expect a 400 console hardware the xbox one x to run it above 1080p 60fps im fine with 1080p 60fps huge respect for id a shooter game on 30 fps is a joke once its heavily discounted ill check it out hopefully they can sharpen the image a little on one x the popin is way too prevalent for a system like the xbox one x i get the feeling they didnt push the system so that near parity is achieved with the ps4 pro it has more memory and at a much higher bandwidth a faster cpu with improved architecture and a much stronger gpu how were they unable to leverage all of that added performance to totally eliminate asset popin not gonna lie i rented this game and the visuals are so blurry to me the pop in annoys me to hell and i hate the low quality textures i usually love playing at 1080 60fps but this game just feels lazy unpopular opinion i guess but the dying animation look stupid to me like could you die and not fly away plz 712 and 720 other then that i agree with everything else this game is beautiful to look at and made me want to play it on pc a on off for motion blur owo if the base xbox one can run 60fps at 900p the x should be able to run it at 1440 at the minimum people arent playing their ps4 pro and xbox one x consoles three inches from a goddamn 20 monitor were playing on bigger 4k televisions this is unacceptable the game looks stunning and runs great 108060fps on my xboxonex so yeah im good with 1080p60fps does hdr affect performance hdr is fucked there are too many versions and variants of it on too many different tvs and none on monitors 2k dont matter 30 fps sucks gives me a headache when everything stutters the pc version looks and runs great add sharpening through geforce experience overlay and lock fps at 120p at 1440p easy what a lazy effort wanted to buy on x but wont now because of 1080p should be higher than that lazy effort as a ps4 owner im waiting for the ps5 to play rage 2 in 30 fps i would not enjoy it do developers realize most people that bought the x did is specifically to game in 4k i wonder if the driving in this game being in part an avalanche studios game is as awful as all other avalanche titles such as just cause or mad max they really need to put some time into redeveloping their driving mechanics as for the other parts of the game it seems like they are pretty solid every version looks blurry as fuck really doesnt look good the most hardware intensive scenes ive seen so far are actually in some of the mbtv stages i think its because of the fact that the entire floor of many of them has water on it which means the gpu is having to deal with a huge amount of dynamic screen space reflections almost constantly as well as all of the different alpha effects in the scenes from lights and pyrotechnics awesome i really want rage 1 added to the xbox1x enhanced list they need to patch the og rage for x imo ive noticed a lot of obvious shimmering on certain elements like small stones or shiny surfaces ps4 pro at 4k are they rendering certain shaders at a lower res or tbh the game looks way better on pc to me when you switch the antialiasing from taafxaa to just fxaa and also turn off chromatic abberation depth of field and motion blur the motion blur effect looked way better in doom 2016 than it does in rage 2 idk if its a frame pacing thing or what but it just doesnt seem as smooth or fluid as a pro and a one x owner i was disappointed to hear there was no 4k 30fps mode but then i thought atleast we will have hdr to hear it doesnt have hdr makes this a no sale from me this lools like the perfect game for hdr seems mad not to have it shame so acg was lying about the console or he only played the base console version of rage 2 the way shooting feels and enemies react to being hit is unparalleled in rage1 the artstyle ai graphics and sound are also exceptional john another fantastic console analysis breakdown what a legend console gamers want their eye candy over gameplay performance frikkin casuals 1080p60fps should be the norm or at least be an option if possible moving forward 847 id be surprised if there isnt a dynamic resolution scaling system on the consoles because dynamic resolution scaling is available on the pc version of the game if it isnt on console i think this would be the first game ive seen that offers it on pc and not consoles its usually the other way around this game is a blast best shotgun in the biz the original rage was a great game that pushed boundaries while rage 2 is bland repetitive checklist gaming but 60fps is all that matters i guess 60fps is great but i really would of loved to see a 4k 30 no one pc morons console players cant see and feel the difference between 30 and 60fps town comparisons between xboxonex and ps4pro arent the same one is night one is day shame the base systems are downgraded to 30fps feels like a step back from rage 1 60fps should be standard now for fluidity accessibility plus it doesnt age as well hdr should be standard only after 60fps becomes standard man im gonna have to get a new pc lol this game looks so good but my current pc is pretty old other devs take note framerate resolution more people benefit from a 60fps mode than a mode only usable by the small amount of 4k owners wait people are actually complaining about 60fps bdw loading isnt that big of an issue in rage1they arent that long id rather have 4k 30 and 1080 60 options like shadow of the tomb raider and gears of war 607 of course for the heathens that prefer not using motion blur i know jon is just joking but what can i say i just prefer not having the effect of vaseline smeared all over my screen at 60fps its especially pointless but also because the blur will obscure targetsenemies when turning fast i adored the first game despite its flaws it just felt right i also applaud the decision to put performance first and hope this is a sign of things to come theres nothing like a finely tuned piece of software no one switches back and forth between versions of a game getting used to 30fps is a non issue oh so they didnt use idtech afterall now i know why they cant do a switch port or 60fps for the base ps4 and xbox i will still take 60fps over the visuals any day if you are having problems with load ins then switch to pc all real gaming is done on the computer i prefer that the base machine are lock to 30fps because like in fortnite its around 60fps on ps4 in the pvp but in the pve its around 3540fps and that doesnt look great i guess i am a heathen no mption blur for me my eyes can do the motion blur for me no hdr support i was so hyped for this game and was disappointed when i discovered the game only ran in 30 fps so i decided to not buy it that game looks so fucking bad its pathetic rage 1 looks better than this garbage i have no idea what the fuck they did there the textures look like they are taken straight from the consoleversion and the taa blurrs the whole image and there is no lumasharpen to counter it listen 30fps for a fps is dogshit ive tried hard to enjoy games like far cry that run at 30fps as nice as it looked at standstill in 4k on xthe minute you moved it looked like dogshit it felt like dogshit and i genuinely cannot understand how it got the reviews it did maybe im just sensitive to iteven pubg in fps is a massive no on x i can deal with 30fps in 3rd person destiny is another one i couldnt play it for 10mins feels so off and laggy been playing it on pcas i did with the 1st rage i5 9400frtx 2080 xc ultra2x16gbintel 660p nvmebenq pd3200q 1440p its a blastand very good looking on my older ips screen at 1440pbut wish the texture res was even higher and yes the lighting is very good lookingi loved the original but this is much better i do not accept any game on console or pc to grace my 3 thousand dollar tv at 1080p i dont care if its 240fps yuck its cool we have an xbox one s game that doesnt consistently dip below 30 fps and run at like 860p the best use the game isnt even that good finally something to be impressed by good stuff avalanche really nice to see a open world game cater to 60fps still have so many technical features although blurry i think its a pretty good achievement why are you doing tests for substandard machines it still amazes me how developers are capable to use these severely weak jaguar cpus that plague all consoles because of this i eagerly await next generations ryzen cores what is a tad disappointing is the lack of utilizing the extra ram bus gpu provided by xbox one x since the game is nearly identical on both the x and pro i understand however how developers are trying to offer a similar experienceperhaps in the future an improved patch will be offered even 2019 aaa cross platform games still have the same issues the typical pc games issues npc are just standing around like robots when you walk past them they start talking when you go to them and hold e they start a different conversation which doesnt match with lip syncing or when you just leave them and come back you can see the lips still moving but no conversation these are typical pc game issues in my opinion its so sad that the pc fanboys iam a pc player aswell btw dont know how ridiculously detailed naughty dogs games are on pc even games like the witcher 3 go to npc blablabla just text go to b and kill all enemies repeat that 1000 times there you go this has nothing to do with story even the recent game a plague tale innocence has the same issue it will not be a good story game when you add random text and dont take care of details npcai talks about something sad just stands in front of you like a robot and at the end of his sentence the npc jumps i want options and i want hdr rage 2 is doom with a storyline had to fast forward two minutes at the start of the video because there was no talking game runs silky smooth on my pc will the ps5 be able to play ps4 games at 4k anyone else think it looks graphically worse than the first rage the character models and textures for environments look worse in rage 2 another x win i cant see how will cyberpunk 2077 run on these consoles even if its very well optimized itll come in 2021 maybe and it will be crossgen if gtx 1080 ti ran in just 1080p 30fps basically what its like to have a more powerful pc higher framerates rather than better graphics i hope console players understand the importance of better hardware for better performance but having better graphics too is an added bonus if we were barely able to 1080p on ps3360 why is the ps4xbo trying to hit 4k 60fps can we finally master 1080p 60fps locked on consoles first fuck 4k every console game should have the option to get 60 fps with a lower resolution dat blurry texture at the beginning game is a mess the xbox one x scam was to me the final nail in the coffin for my love affair with console gaming after 24 years pcmr 108060 over 4kish30 all day every day to anyone who says i dont care about framerate i care about gameplay remember that framerate has a real quantifiable impact on input response and player reaction times which feeds directly into the feel of the game tightness of control and developer balancing of mechanics framerate isnt the enemy of gameplay it is infact a stage for it an important take away is that unless a game is cpu bound the only reason it cant reach a higher framerate is because the devs sacrificed those benefits for prettier visuals in short you are either uninformed or a hypocrite hoping next gen gives both goodies 6o fps and beautiful detail visuals with hdr lol anyways ive been playing this on the hardest difficulty and its a total different experience but is extremely fun im on xboxonex yeah id take 1080p 60fps all day everyday over 30fp at higher resolution on fast paced action games one day we will hopefully have 4k 60fps on everythingps5 hopefully raged 2 flopped hard i love taa ill take softness of image over coarseness of edges and shimmering like a christmas tree any day why am i watching this im a pc player put your money where your mouth is console peasants and support this game you got the 60 fps at 1080p on x and pro like you always wished dont complain would gladly give up 4k for 60fps any day any game the game on ps4pro is so flat it makes it look boring rather heavy on the gpu is an understatement my machine sounds like its preparing for takeoff as soon as the game starts its a good looking game but its not that good looking which makes me think something isnt quite right rage 1 on my pc in 4k ultra at 60fps looks better to mei just prefer the look of the characters and the details and sky look better alsothis looks more ubisoft like its hard to explain and its the way i see itcant believe its so many years since the last one idk what digital foundary is talking about im playing on a 65 inch sony 4k on an xbox one x and the game looks like an xbox 360 game and the frame rate is not worth the sacrifice i would rather they given the choice of higher resolution less frame rate cause resolution trumps frame rate every time thats why they make 4k tvs not frame rate in contrast i just finished farcry new dawn and it looks like night and day vs rage2 i guess if you are playing on anything smaller than a 60 inch it looks better but larger screens suffer as a result the open world was unneeded in this game its definitely the worst ive seen in a while im confused how horrible this works on my pc i have no problem with games on high not ultra cause pc is five years old but this game runs only on middle and without vsync its horrible and with vsync this game works not over 30fps for me arent most tvs these days freesync capable that should eliminate any screen tearing anyway i just cant wait for the new consoles to come out so us pc gamers can start seeing better graphics and push our rigs to their limits its about bloody time if i wanted a weak 1080p picture i would not of bought a 4k console and tv 1080p on a 4k tv looks terrible this resoloution might be fine for people with old tvs but for 4k its completely useless and again clearly ps4 wins again where is the pc analyze of this rage 1 was huge at 18gb where 47gb was the max size for games at the time arent those consoles advertised as gaming at 4k lol this video contain flashing images epilepsy warning 4k is only great for supersampling id rather take a high framerate over meme resolutions at least rage 2s anti aliasing wasnt as bad as just cause same with the pop ins this game is a perfect candidate for next gen to see it really shine anyways pc has their backs with 4k 60 but i get that they made the right decisions to deliver xbox won x looks like the developer was reading dfs comments when making rage 2 sigh oh wait no one kurr about rage 2 a last gen game 4k honestly just in terms of general graphics atmosphere i think the first rage looks better it just looks veryraw i guess sure the textures may be softer but they have a strong personality to them same with the baked lighting baked lighting isnt some bad thing just because it isnt advanced i mean ac unity has some of the best interior lightingever i wish rage 2 was more like rage 1 but ramped up a little rage 2 has an entirely different personality i got the feeling that the development of just cause 4 suffered under this game because just cause 4 looks like garbage i guess im weird i have an xbox one x but i do not mind 30fps in games at all i prefer smooth over speed that being saidrage 2 runs like a dream and i enjoy it being at 60fps ill take 120 fps before taking greater than 1080p resolution haha the world looks huge but is pretty empty thats why it was possible to make the game run at 108060fps i have high hopes that every game that runs at 30fps on the ps4 could run at 60fps on the ps5 that will be a preorder without a doubt these visuals are really appalling with several layers of blurfilters on top of a 1080p base resolution even on the x prolly youd wanna play a game like this on pc with keyboard and mouse this is what i perfer 60fps if it means locked at 1080p i wish you could leave the per object blur on with the camera blur off you can tell its avalanches engine because the exploding barrel effects are identical to just cause 34 i think i might pick this up but i just cant stop thinking about a doomesque type rage 2 developed primarily by id and assisted by avalanche similar to the first one with no open world but seamless levels all with perfect lighting would also allow for 1440p 60 on the strong consoles and 900p60 fps on base consoles i remind you doom in 2016 achieved this ive heard that the open world is bland so a sprawling linear game would suit me fine especially as the vehicular combat looks subpar compared to say mad max 2015 why is the color so off on the ps4 pro sunning game on my one x loving every moment how times have changed with 1080p is considered a low resolution blood dragon is better than rage 2 the taafxaa makes the image quality on this game horrible they really need to add a sharpening sliderfilter that runs on top of it its like playing a game with vaseline smeared all over your eyes this is a new video and there are already so many people calling others poor because they choose the gameplay to feel smooth instead of the game looking a little better its always so confusing when people choose a more expensive way of playing and immediately invalidate any other ways even when the other ways are perfectly reasonable i feel like rage 1 has such a better more interesting world and characters rage 2 feels dead compared to it who cares the game is garbage anyway why cant there be an option to sacrifice resolution for a better framerate on normal consoles all other modern id games run at 60 and first person shooters look bad at 30fps damn xbox shits on playstation again lol they clearly didnt really try to make the most of the xbox one x a few dips difference with that much of a power gap disappointing no option to choose a higher resolution instead of framerate is inexcusable as well 1080p60 has become the great standard for powerful games for the foreseeable future something rather unique a first person shooter combined with a large open world u n i q u e needs dynamic res or least 1440p res this game has one of the worst performance to graphics engine i have ever seen games textures looks like something 10 years ago and it runs like garbage you cant even get 60 fps ultra 4k with 2080ti wtf i want option to 4 k 30 fps game looks terrible on big 4 k tv once 60 fps there is no way back simply forget 30 fps exist pc players can play 4k60 that make sens eh this is rage in name only i loved the original rage because it seemed like id was pushing the 7th gen to the limit with their engine rage 2 seems like a generic game made by a generic dev its a pass for me with the tearing i may have thought its my tv if i had played it and with the fps drops as long as it doesnt drop under 50 i think this is ok in really heavy combat im glad to play on pc with adaptive sync 144hz and 1440p playing modern games right now feels like trying to drive a bugatti veyron with a ford fiesta engine under the hood its pretty but its going to underperform to its expected standard finally a studio that listens to its buyers if i knew that they sacrificed resolution for 60 fps i wouldve preordered the game the right move here by avalancheid when it comes to fast paced shooters 60 fps should be the minimum its a shame they didnt give an option for those who prefer 4k30fps but it is what it is personally im playing this on pc with a gtx 1070 and its running 1080p 6080fps ultra settings and im loving this game im surprised how well the pro version runs i play on pc and an overclocked gtx1070 can barely get a stable 1440p60 i have to have the resolution slider on 80 to ensure 60fps at all times thats barely higher than 1080p ugh that popin is egregious that should be the very first thing the developer takes care of the immersion is ruined by it whats the point of fidelity if it draws in right before your eyes i also noticed character models clipping through geometry i think the game looks good but the flaws shouldnt be ignored why do games always lock fps on 30 or 60 why not on 50 or 40 it would be great and some base consoles could run on 40 fps is it just me or did the frame rate and resolution seem to drop around halfway through the video actually went to check my settings multiple times because something just wasnt looking right even the text for xbox was looking a bit blurry the graphics dont look great tbh played it maxed out 1080p on pc looks blurry as hell low res textures honestly suprising for them to bounce back from the trashfire that was just cause 3 on consoles good job avalanche 1080p60 is nearly always the best use of these consoles as thats where there hardware is optimal in most cases 4k is a gimmick at present and always needs major cuts in visual quality to get it with at best it being a copy and paste of the xb1s version at an increased res which really doesnt show off the hardware like increased image quality and frame rate 4k is the current gens version of last gens 1080p and 3d gimmicks that only cost visual quality and added next to nothing i love the 60 fps and the 1080p does not bother me i play the same way on forza horizon 4 in the town 1 is at night which has way more light mapping going on which will lower frame rate so to use the town on xbox during the day is intellectually disingenuous frame rate over resolution everyday playing with 30 fps is like watching a brand new movie in black and white empty world they should have gone at least to 1440p 60 its a shame but i hope they can release an update once the ps5 is out rather play in 4k ill wait for anaconda to play it in 4k 60fpsin gamepass of course finally thanks digital foundry though i am a pc player i just like these videos from you heathens who dont use motion blur motion blur islooks terrible haha thank you for posting this theres something special about the lighting engine but i have no idea what it is the landscapes look really right do you know what theyre using to make it look like that great video thanks john id take framerate over resolution any day but i would have liked to have at least resolution of 1440p on the enhanced consoles i play on a pro with a 65 4khdr set and i sit about 4 feet away from my tv and the iq does look a bit soft from where i sit a bump in resolution while keeping the same 60fps would have been nice 4k 60fps on pc vs 1080p 60fps on consoles wtf 1080p on a 65 inch can look soft and somewhat distracting ill pick this up on my pc my 2070 should be able to handle it at 1728p while maintaining 60 way 2 long video no hdr forget it this game screams for it i think youre being a bit harsh on the original rages graphicsbaked lighting and texture popin doesnt prevent it from being one of the top 5 looking games of the last gen but i thought xbox x guaranteed we would get resolution enhancement on all gamesthat was the sale pitch the developer shouldnt have been allowed to do this it is interesting to see who this title turned out since john carmac was not involved in this one since when is 1080p a low resolution artstyle resolution and i will take 1080p 60 over 1440p 30 any day id love an x enhanced rage 1 wouldnt it be nice if sony and ms would require developers to include 1080punlocked framerate mode for every game it wouldve made pro and x killer options for people with 1080p screens such an obvious choice and a missed profit for them i prefer original game on pc it was great game back than new one is like colorful open world doom meets far cry new down avalanches taa is always horrendous hope they implement a better one in the future and its heressy to like motion blur good analysis i love this game but one thing thats annoying is how many areas of this game are too dark many indoor areas that make it difficult to see everything i wish we has some options in the menus to adjust that probably a nice feature for pc thats for sure but it would have been nice for console too to answer the video title obviously yes why have yall been pushing 4k and hdr and ray tracing when we cant even have 60 frames anymore come on df how hard is this game on the cpu my laptops i7 7700hq can be bottleneck sometimes is 1080p 120fps possible on a 1060 with a 7700hq thank you avalanche this is the kind of multiplatform development that needs to become standard this is what the far crygta devs need to shoot for forgot the ps4 pro logo at 1440 but nice analysis as always but 60 fps is the only way to go 30 fps is awful and rage 2 is on higher resolution and settings very hardware hungry the pc version is a big jump over the consoles settings and resolutions rage is a game that looks much better when the resolution is over 1080p but needs for ultra and 1440p a 1080 and a 2080ti struggles in 4k to hold 60 fps no wonder why the ther is pop in on the consoles and only 1080p for higher resolution the game needs a lot more powerful hardware this game worth buying honestly i really hate the fact that there is no option to play this in 4k it wouldve been nice to at least give us an option like all the other games heck even kingdom hearts iii gives us such an option the least they couldve done is give us hdr support on the enhanced consoles i mean this is nice playing it in 60 fps on the ps4 pro but still better yet why not give us something like what was in star ocean the last hope 4khd remaster where we could choose stuff like what resolution to play in and rendering settings like antialiasing texture quality and the like if theyre this focused on speed it feels unfair of them letting the pc players get all the extra features with this one i havent completed rage 1 yet as soon as i have completed it i might buy rage 2 for pc i used to think frame rate resolution then i learned how to 4k i didnt go buy a 28 4k monitor as do 99 of pc gamers who mistakenly believe that theyre gaming at 4k resolution then declare that 4k is stupid they cant resolve the resolution so theyve gained nothing that 1440p doesnt offer they arent superhuman on the contrary theyre stupid there is never really a choice between 1080p 60fps and 4k 30fps devs can always give players an option fps resolution any day you said what im think love the gameplay graphics 1080p with temporal antialiasing looks like sub 720p with youtube artifacting built in to the game only heathens use motion blur 2059 can i hear a oof in the background glad theres an option to turn off motion blur when i tried doom on switch i didnt really like it compared to my ps4 version now it feels like im now in that situation myself as i only have the standard ps4 and xbox one without an enhanced console and dont think id be happy with 30fps looks an amazing game but will have to wait until i get a better console shame there wasnt a 720p 60fps mode on ps4 id rather play it that way i think but i know that wouldnt be acceptable to many xbox one x higher res and better stable 60fps over the pro yes fps is important in that case im going with the x wouldve loved 1440p 60fps on xbox one x so forward rendering is better than deferred rendering more games should use it then cause that way msaa will work again properly i completely disagree the game looks plain and blurry with xpro on a 75inch 4k display textures and geometry are last gen level und shadows pop in constantly when driving around the open world i am vastly disappointed by the visuals making it hard for me to enjoy the game given there are so much better looking shooter alternatives that manage to pull off a good compromise between visuals and framerate far cry 5 for example for me this went too far would love to have the option to switch to a 30fps option with at least 1440p on xpro not missing the hdr support though as the color palet has plenty of pop in sdr i will anyday choose 1080p 60fps over 4k 30fps another victory for the xbox one x higher resolution and better stable 60fps on the xbox one x over the soupstation im skip this and waiting for doom eternal oh its 30 on base well that combined with typical avalanche bad and hipstery humour and colour tones and of course the grindy padded out experience that im hearing about makes me not interested the 60fps i was hearing about was the only saving grace as usual digital foundry saying dumb ass shit the x has a much more powerful gpu and a slightly faster cpu if this game is 1080p and 60fps on the pro then the x should be able to run this game at 1440p and 60fps i know its unrelated to rage 2 but does a plague tale have a stable framerate on a normal ps4 i have been hoping on digital foundry to make a video on it but it hasnt happened yet 155 the skybox in the original looks like cardboard lol im so glad a lot of developers have finally made the switch to fully volumetric clouds cant wait for the switch version 60 fps 144 fps is where its at getting a one x today i still think rage 2 looks rather garish with the soft blurry look and all the saturated colors i prefer the sharper darker rage 1 atmosphere that is was 60 fps no matter the console was a huge feat too rage 2 couldnt even manage that instead opting for 30fps on base consoles edit 1834 uhh pc exists the lack of hdr support is criminal the use of colour lighting and explosions in this game would have looked fantastic in hdr 1000x yes if its an fps i would much rather prefer framerate i would almost even rather play at 720p at 120fps the biggest thing being input lag i cant even play overwatch on my laptops 60hz panel anymore aiming just feels bad compared to how it feels on my 120hz monitor i cant stand all the pop in not interested in the game but it looks like everyone is getting a really well developed game that barren map and clunky laggy menu absolutely takes away any benefits of no loading screens and 60 fpswhy have 60 fps only in brief encounters would of been better suited to increase resolutions and 30 fps to take in the open worldleave 60 fps for corridor shooters and online competitive multiplayer more than graphics the game is pretty fun in difficult is way more difficult than doom 2016 darn it mislabeled pro footage starting from 1324 still great video john as usual rage was a marvel to behold in past gen with its rock solid 60fps on the 360ps3 it was its staple playing this on pc and the gunfights are smooth as butter just adds so much to the realism 60 fps first then u can do whatever u want end of story 60 fps over 30 fps every single time 80 players on playstation no hdr so no 4k so how is it xbox one x enhanced most tv nowdays have a really good 4k upscaler console where you have to choose between frame rate and resolution i kinda dont like how the game looks to be honest the aggressive anti aliasing coupled with low resolution texture work just gives the game a really rough look i was hoping i could introduce a bit of sharpening via reshade but it appears the games renderer is vulkan on the pc which as far as i know reshade doesnt support so thats kind of a bust it also runs pretty poorly on pc on the gpu side as you mentioned im running at 1440p on a gtx 1070 and it hovers in that 45ish fps no mans land luckily i have a gsync monitor but still its a shame it has a similar performance profile to just cause 4 on pc which was pretty rotten its very annoying that the viewmodelweapon fov does not change by changing the base fov because its extremely low especially on an ultrawide monitor i cant seem to get this game stable at anything other than 108060 on my gtx1070 really disappointing i can do 1440 but with downscaling that always ends up looking worse rage 2 basically looks like avalances mad max just in first person personally i dont really like the neon look of rage 2 i think the atmosphere shouldve stayed dark like in the original rage or even like in mad max mad max was an awesome game tho this is what all game developers should do the price for 60fps is always worth paying waiting for the pc analysis one thing i have seen on mid range hardware like the gtx 1060 is the massive drop in fps with particle effects stuff like smoke after an explosion or blood splatter on screen after using abilities can drop the fps from 60 to low 40s so eagerly waiting for pc analysis either way its unplayable on consoles for me unless they have kb and mouse support really surprised microsoft and sony didnt want a 4k sticker on the cover and look for a dynamic resolution to be added i wouldnt pay full price for this game looks like a 30 game 60fps from 30fps changes how the game plays and feels 1080p to 4k doesnt yes finally a dev team that knows what gamers actually want 60fps beats 4k improved visuals and all that buzz words in console games amazing all we need is framerate over the resolution 60fps or more is the best for games like this in my opinion 4k is wast in performance graphics look better on ecu led 65in tv if you turn blur mode off but still id rather have 1800 p or 1440p at 30 given the option i can easilly play rage 1 at 1080p because image is still sharp but rage 2 at 1080p looks like my vision has deteriorated its unplayble for me and i commiserate to people who dont notice that problem ive got a ton of rage 2 gameplay videos on my channel running at 60fps ultra on a 1070 pretty well optimized imo i have it on one x and the 60fps makes the gameplay fantastic bethesda has idt ech engine which decided to used a moddified sourced engine insteadit is me or bethesda hates good gaming engine performance should be always preferred over eyecandy beautiful graphics thanks id software and avalanche studio for having such high understanding of video games looks and plays best on x1x at the question if you love blurry graphics yes its a good use but when you have in mind all the games who runs with dynamics resolution at 60fps on xpro or on standard console clearly not but the game dont corrige the principal issue of the first game only 10h to finish it ridiculous i played rage 2 4k 60fps but i own a 2080 ti 140 rage 1 was realy 60 fps on ps3 and 360 thats impressive 60fps is life wish they at least added an option to choose between 4k30 or 1080p60 and also include hdr support heard it was a shit game anyways rage 2 is trash 60fps and over is always welcome on pc this game looks like garbage i play on max settings 4k 30fps1080p 60fps they should allow you to lock pro at 55fps crap game annoying characters hey digital foundry can you check the grapical downgrade in red dead redemption 2 in 100 patch the lighting by valentine general store looks better than in 109 patch and im not sure the ambient occlusion and textures are back in the original quality like in the 100 patch there is no single reason to buy a console if you live in usacanadaaustralia and europe because building pc is so cheap in those countries for 3000 you can build i9 9900k rtx 2080 ti pc easily in usacanadaaustralia and europe in sri lanka you cannot able to creat a rtx 2070 pc for 3000 id rather have a 1620p30 than a 1080p60 on ps4 pro they should allow console players to turn off the depth of field that makes this game a smudgefest thanks for the quick work digital foundry great work unfortunately i cant support this game because it has microtransactions am i right that ps4 pro some sequence has more blueish color than other consoles short answer yes xbox is going away no point in buying on that console its pointless not as fast as doom 2016 yea you havent tried vortex jumping floating mid air and double dashing image quality on the x is awful no excuse for it being the same as pro the heathens keep motion blur on p every pc gamer not able to afford a 4k monitor its better at 1080p anyway is it true that theres no triple buffer vsync on the pc version holy shit 60 fps on consoles i am totally fine with 1080p60fps when it comes to prox enhancements i really enjoyed the first rage but it seems that this one isnt going for the same rpg feeling that had interactive unique npc in cool towns cities and multiple mini games also loved the waifus from rage 1 yea its best played on pc playing with a controller limits the possibilities and mechanical depth of the combat so much if all of you poor fucks had 4k tv you wouldnt say 1080 60fps is better than 4k 30fps ohh but you are playing on1080p budget tv to create some rather unique a fast paced first person shooter combined with a large open worldguess john has never played far cry 3 and the following games or borderlands lol 108060 over 4kish30 all day every day enjoy pro and one x owners im convinced wed have had more games this generation if everyone hadnt decided to write their own engine finally give me 1080p 60fps over 4k any day great video and a amazing game a 60fps option is dammed impressive for the console versions even if limited to 1080p on the pc side of things you need a beast of a pc to hit a stable 4k60 a 52ghz 8700k32gb 3200mhz ram and an ocd 2080ti will only manage 6080fps when the game is maxed out dont have an x or pro just like the analysis xbox wins this gen and next gen in graphics avalanche studios is awful at making games fun or interesting cool they were able to get 60fps its 2019 that should be the standard stop praising 60fps when in 1988 every game i owned was 60fps performance is always the best choice love your working digitalfoundry keep up the good work why not idtech this looks so muddy even in comparison with rage 1 what is the price of 60 frames per second the game looking like ass for one even tho its late its better than neverwhere a plague tale finally whats up with pc the game is buggy as fuck i play this in january 2020 more than half a year after release and there is still a ton ob terrible bugs in this game one time it crashed my ps4 wtf doors that are open are locked again npcs in cutscenes dont load in that beardy guy you have to work for was talking to an invisible lady when i first approached him when i wanted to fight my first mech in the swamplands it was completely broken i killed the mech found the crates there was always another crate right next to the lootable one that i couldnt lock on to when i came back the mech was gone and another one loaded in i killed that one too but couldnt repair it back to the crates that where already looted back to the mech he was gone again if this shit happens right at release its bad but i get it if the game has small bugs like floating objects or crazy ragdoll physics ok but this shit downright breaks the game dont buy this at least not full price the screen effects never bothered me then again ive been playing flicker fest games since i was a kid what bothered me was the twelve different sounds a gun makes when switching weapons yeah i have a nice set of over ear headphones i set the sound level up to get some good atmosphere going and holy fuck pssssshsschickclickclack chinckksherkclacakweeeeeeeee click every time i run and gun this shit i switch weapons between the shotty the rifle and the missile launcher after reloading a few times cycling through the weapons becomes annoying having to hear it every time like im walking through a huge pile of expensive cameras going off is it just me that really misses the card game from the first game the combat gets so awesome at the end you become so op even in very hard i wish there was a new game option with a fifth walker must die difficulty to play the whole game again with all abilities and just rush from combat to combat in an setting that forces you to keep the combo up to go overdrive all the time i hate the icarus it controls like a pile of hot garbage on an active freeway favorite way to score multikills in this game throw out the vortex jump forward use the slam on the vortex detonation point timed correctly you can wipe a whole squad in an instant while sandwiching them between two separate explosions optionately while yelling boooyah i saw the ad for this so many times but never heard of it after it was released slow start hmmp so uncivilized yes bethesda s future shock had every thing in it and it is awesome that it is still working as a publisher of this game wow the way he explained the missions is literally just far cry 3 do a bunch of bullshit with rare actual quest on the side to raise how much they like you or in far cry 5 dislike you and cutscene then main mission repeat 3 times and you can do the final mission and fight joseph literally far cry 5 this game looks like it could really take a toll on someones eyes but otherwise looks kinda fun this is just glorified mad max smh 341 any game which works the wilhelm scream into the gameplay audio is worthy of at least some respect this games is colourful question is this something to buy to get my fix of doom till eternal comes out it sorta looks similar in the shooting and guns the screen turns into an e3 video hah so basically its rage but better the price is offensive only thing i dont like is its too damn colorful and the protagonist has a voice also its not much of a rage game you didnt like the original probably cause the publishers didnt supply you with a review copy you fucking shill and the ps4 version of the game had frame rate dips during certain areas but i think its because i have an old model ps4 instead of a ps4 pro id software passed with flying colors for the shooting but with avalanche studios i feel like they half assed the open world rage 1 atmosphere is much better i dont know why but when i played hard it was soo easy i took level 8 turrets by ar without even needing to dash from their shots cuz the only shot they could land on me was right before their destruction i dont know how did this happen honestly i looked at lets plays and it looked like it should have been but for some odd reason the hard mode is basically baby mode on my pc the funny thing is that out of curiosity i tried normal and i got my ass kicked immedieately because normal works well normal i hope they will fix this issue ill be honest cross is hilarious for such a huge evil threat you kill him within a weekend i was so bored by the time i beat this game if you like it awesome but i couldnt stand it game looks good but tell me you can disable the bloom if that looks like a dildo to you i dont know where youre shopping 341 wilhelm scream this would explain why i caught todd howard hiding in my backyard but seriously this game sucks so bad used the bfg w 3 free rounds on first giant mutie after that its not too bad this wasnt bad but the campaign is a bit short that dodgeroll nigga was insane they shouldve call overdrive mode a different name like rage im really enjoying the combat in this game its a lot of fun however im experiencing a lot of bugs and crashes i simply can not do anything in the feltrite tab of the ingame menu the game crashes to desktop the moment i click on anything in that tab also i tried finishing the race but the vehicle control sucks and that one time out of 5 tries i did finish first i was still second yes you read that correctly my time was 124 at second place and first place had 139 someone doesnt know how to math ive been in contact with bethesda support for 2 weeks now and they havent been very helpful to say the least its full of bugs bethesda fix it we dont need new content theyve added some new stuff in the game a few days ago we need all these bugs and crashes to be fixed ive never had this many problems with any game ever and ive been gaming on pc for at least 15 years and own 400 titles that pulse cannon is straight up a reskinned doom 2016 gauss cannon fosters mate the fuck even you know that no one drinks foster in straya it looks like borderlands and crysis had a baby i thought the 1st rage wasnt that bad really dont like the art direction of this sequel the first was a let down to most but its art style was great thanks mate a review that helps you avoid a game is worth as much as one that helps you buy a game keep up the good work story mode sucks gameplay killing and using the nanothings that shit rocks and i love to throw back grenades sadly overall it was not the big bang hype game 2019 rage 2 is more like a drug infused 6 hour killing spree but with a big hangover why they really could make a perfect shooter out of this but i think wee need rage 3 so we finally get a well done package so please buy that shit i mean rage 2 i played rage bought it from a game stop for like 90 years ago i dont think i finished it however i got to the last mission and just sort of lost interest i do remember it being incredibly short and feeling like fallout 4 with vehicles this is a 810 game for the first two hours then 710 for a few hours then 610 till the end and in the end its 510 iplayrage1andenjoyedit i really enjoyed this game i hated the racing in rage 1 as well nearly stopped playing because of it wtfrage 2 do you even have a identity or are you just a copy paste of whats popularfuck sakes game devs now a days if the world was devastated to a certain degree by a meteor strike what causes the mutations felt like i was watching recent doom game with boring missionsstoryfarcry do x side quests before you can get main story quest hard pass for me ew you use the icarus instead of the car that hoverbike is fooking terrible and boring i rather enjoy driving around i only used the icarus a couple times and only in order to get to an elevated position i couldnt get to otherwise or didnt know how to get to otherwise i finished the game its boring and too easy even on nightmare bunch of redundant guns that you dont need to use situationally use assault rifle and melt through the game in a few hours play 30mins and youve seen it all last boss fight is a joke you spend whole game getting abilities and arsenal for a fight that never comes im really enjoying this game really hope to see some dlc or rage 3 on a small note thats the most beautiful shotgun ive ever seen why is everything so fuckinpink why wait this released i was actually kind of disappointed with the amount of weapons in the game like seriously a mind melter sounds so friggin awesome i recommend getting the double jump 1st made the game much more fun for me goty edition is never coming would be nice to see shooters drop hit markers and go back to something creative like visible bloodsparks on hit instead honestly cant stand seeing them anymore they should turn rage into enemy territory since were all nerds here id like to point out that a hadouken is not an open hand palm thrust its a fireball projectile i enjoyed it but was disappointed that i got the pulse cannon about 5 minutes before the game ended b u t t e r f i e l d the biggest flaw of this game is its tone the promo campaign was promising something in the line of bulletstorm fast fun and exaggerated rage 2 is like this in combat but the main story missions and characters are not they are simply boring and lacking the chaos and craziness of the combat system its a shame plus why the hell are all these notifications completed location completed mission etc are stoping the gameplay its such a strange desing choice in the middle of the great fast shootout there is a sudden stop to watch some stupid mission progress animation very bad design choice unfortunately the game is not as fun as the promotional campaign let us to believe it will be so its a combination of borderlands and bulletstorm sorta i think red faction armageddon had a weapon similar to the grabdart can you play in turnbased mode i noticed on the wiki page for the game that it does not use id softwares engine anymore i dont know what it is with this game but i end up with thumping headaches after a couple hours of play gun overheats ai walker im too hot i have upgraded the fire revolver it turns into a beast when you get the master lvl i have played all of the end levels with it i love rage 2 i have been waiting 7 years for this loved the first one ever play take no prisoners its a top down post apocalyptic nonlinear shooter by raven software thats all but faded into obscurity but it can be easily obtained from abandonware websites did i hear the wilhelm scream in this game your are death and carnage incarnate why the fuck does every sentence have to sound like hes asking a question holy shit thats annoying still complaining about how antialiasing makes the games graphics look softer you also said that in the resevil 2 remake i think it is made that war for objects that are farther away from the player to make the game run smooth otherwise it would stutter processing all that information 6 ppl played rage 1 your an idiot rage2 pretty much sums up what my dad told me about the bougans apologies if i mispelled that he was in australia twice during ww2 and a third when the hospital ship he was on broke up he always reflected on the aussiefolk with fondness am i the only one who thinks the voice of your car phoenix is annoying asf well if bfg9000 is overpowered dont underpowered it the noise at the very end of your video the noise of opening a chest completing a mission opening another chest another chest another mission i hear it in my sleep bwwwoooooooooooooooowm wow rep grinds the game the car lock on thing sounds like mad max which would lock on to blown up cars while some asshole is shooting the shit out of your car do a review of shadow man they should have added the car customization of mad max so it has original crysis 1 runningsprint awesome been waiting for a game to do that sort of sprint system ever since just the feeling of it would like if it was an option you switch on too too bad it has a shit upgradeleveling system man im so tired of that formula and a tacked on unorganized story ill pick it up during like a 75 off summer or winter sale much everything else of this game was rather weak but the combat was so good i didnt care i play the game it good but not rage 1 but i have more fun whit rage 2 than whit far fucking cry 5 this looks like it plays not at all like rage 1 i liked the original despite its many faultsthis however ill wait a long while 1 pirate the game 2 realize it crams feminism down your throat 3 uninstall after 20 minutes money saved awesome video dude certainly the fairest review i seen of this game thank you that story missions are side missions thing just killed it for me thats a hard pass for me sounds repetitive as hell im unsubscribing from your channel walker ranger are they in texas 205 oh shit gman went from insulting your mom to insulting the very country you live in theres no stopping the madman what kind of shit do you experience in the outback shame the game is getting negative reviews on steam shit is pretty good in my opinion great review as always gman 1110 upping the difficulty for a better experience is great but i also dont want to die as soon as i walk into a room hah the title could be from ssethtzeentach who called elex an urban berlin simulator and stalker a soviet survival simulator p rage 2 featuring destiny super abilitys 104 is that sexual harassment you are waaaay too soft on this one wondering if you could look at an original xbox title called armed and dangerous so they made a rage sequel and crossed it with bulletstorm and farcry blood dragon shillmanlives yea i also thought those racing challenges in the first game really sucked so im glad to hear that its a lesser thing this time around now i havent played the game yet but i bet the devs borrowed that slam ability from the nanosuit in crysis anyway a great review and keep up the good vids red faction armageddon had a weapon like the grav dart been waiting for gggmanlives to review this one just wish doom eternal woudl come out might wait for a sale on this one openworld games arent really my thing and ill probably only play it once and then again a year later shooters arent worth more than about 30 bux for me tops unless its something like doom where ive played through it about 10 times and spent a bit of time in the multiplayer think the multi on doom was underrated beceause people were expecting something else but still good sad to think that id might can the multi and just do this invasion crap seems like a meh to me ill grab it during a steam sale too many other games to play random question what do you think about just cause series just a cheap warmup for borderlands 3 shillmanlives going strong so its borderlands but without the cringy reddittier humor and writing nice waitthis game really uses the willhelm scream sound effect wow denuvo on steam no denuvo on bethesda launcher lmao bunch of fucktards fuck it yknow what im going to make an fps game with open ended quakeesque level design a huge variety of foes heatlh and armor pickups keyhunting and everything people like about old school shooters except fast movement speed and having all of your weapons instead theres sprinting and a 1 weapon limit this is to show what an old school shooter is supposed to be i really dont like fps with powers i just want to shoot shit damn it does not start after pc installation nothing happens have to say ive had the opposite problem with the performance with a 970 i58600k and 16gb of ram i would get about 25 fps in the settlements at 1440p on basically lowest settings that is just not acceptable i had to put it to 1080p to get even close to 60 and even then thats on lowest settings and also started to see proper stuttering not worth fullprice so i can wait this game looks fucking rad what video card are you using you should try playing exodus from the earth i get to buy 1 or 2 games every 3 months is this worth it is it worth the money cause if i buy this i cant buy any other game for 3 months however i had to say theyre racing missions are awesome well i have some major complaints about the fucking race mission however it was still fun fun enough so i wont have to do this bullshit again or will i im sorry but this is one of my favorite games of all time and ill never stop playing this game i hope they come out with more stuff for the game so the game can be longer everyone else has different taste for the game or whatever but i understand it gets the killer approval in my book so is that using the standard melee attack yo kick a grenade back at somebody bethesda hides bfg 9000 behind a 20 paywall for a deluxe edition i will just wait until 2 expansions are released and get the whole thing on sale in late 2019 i guess you dont talk about rage 2 toxic microtransactions and shady locked content for steam users because they will blacklist you right what a shame discovered it through the steam reviews at least not wasting money on this crap i did not buying or playing yet im waiting for a price reduction during a sale maybe but for the videos and reviews i watch i see that the weapon models are very similar to doom weapon models is just me or someone fell the same enemies tend to burst into bloody chunks after a single 762 bullet hit a way to fucking ruin the combat system in rage 2 its always either bursting into bloody chunks disappearing out of existence or turning into a low poly skeleton like who the fuck thought this childish and primitive enemy obliteration is a good idea makes me rage so fucking hard how am i supposed to play a shooter if anything i shoot at turns into bloody shit did they pay you too tho all the guns are underpowered until you level them up which i dont really like i already have enough stuff i have to upgrade i recommend picking two or three guns you like and focus on getting them up all the way to level 5 my assault rifle is kick ass now as soon as a character is introduced hes then unceremoniously killed off you do realize that was the joke right good fairly balanced review though i agree with your assessment that the beginning of the game is fairly slow and id add you arent really given much direction as far as side quests go i also hate those tutorials at the arks which i could imagine would make a second playthrough a huge chore i think the combat is amazing fun its like they blended ids most recent doom with random open world fauxrpg shooter fastpaced and with a lot of options once the game gets going but i bought the game due to one of the trailers where it said you could destroy everything and blah blah you actually can destroy almost nothing in the game that was a bit of a let down although in the end it didnt really ruin the experience for me rage 2 seems to be too much easy even on normal difficulty and this can be a problem for me does nightmare difficulty give us a decent challenge or the game is very easy on nightmare too 16 hours it took some youtubers 6 hours 16hrs campaigni even heard that is 10h or even less probably buying for 20 red faction armageddon has a grav gun tho you shoot one thing then shoot something else and it pulls them together all of the side stuff is main part of the game dman u gggmanlives you trigger my part of memory with saints row 2 in that game yes the sidequests are essential to unlock the main story of the game too bad from the third due to rushed development it was simplified to main story and side story thank you to all the suckers paying full price and beta testing the game for me ill grab the gotye in a couple years for 20 for a yfold sealed copy i salute you kinda looks like the australian out back swacked nah fam it reminds me of the south african karoo awei arent the rangers pretty much the rangers from the metro series i mean literally theyre both set in post destroyed earth theyre both called rangers and theyre both there to protect the people i liked the first one better for some reason not to put ya black widow down but a funnel web spider can kill a man in 8 seconds just by looking at him the first rage was pretty wellliked for those you played it it wasnt goty material but a pretty solid shooter is this the lgbtq mad max remake red faction armageddon has the magnet gun which is much like the grav dart gun except it can destroy the environment as well expecting hearing cunt in this review none have they changed the powers from nanotrites to a suit i started this game today played for about 30 minutes and i was worried about the pacing the cut scenes and exposition in the beginning went on too long and the combat felt very cover based almost modern military in the beginning rather than doomlike but seeing your review and seeing your gameplay im a lot less worried because it looks awesome and crazy and fast and doomlike later on hope i hit that point fast to be honest as a gamer who loves id studios games this one is a hard pass for me the implementation of bizarre pink coloured theme cringy comical story cringy and ugly characters female npcs are the ugliest boring open world that feels shallow and empty unintuitive pc controls bugs and lack of variety in regards to missions sets a bad precedent this distinctly takes me back to similar issues with mass effect andromeda anthem and far cry new dawn they all have a similar tone in regards to the not funny comical aspect and npcs are ugly not sure if this is a connection to developers hiring incompetent sjw staff who hold to feminist idealogies whom have a different outlook on humour and dont like good looking female characters in gaming because of objectification they also hold to a white man bad rhetoric and shoehorn in unnecessary gender choices and cringy empowered female characters wolfenstein youngblood will undoubtedly be another cringefest game oh wow thats so funny how i thought the authority boss looked like a strogg like 5 seconds before he said it feels deja vu much with doom shooting style and even weapons somehow i feel like the first game more red faction armageddon magnet gun does the same thing as the grav dart how long is the main history mad max by bethesda glad to hear its right up my alley almost hit the refund button i dont like having to hit the refund button honestly it pales in comparison to a road trip to katherine fun as fuck for me so far really dont understand the immense hate boner people have for this game this is the bulletstorm sequel that we never got turned it on and immediately was subjected to cringe worthy cutscenes of below b movie acting and action played for about an hour and turned it off this was made for children this is rage in name alone everything about this game is off the shooting the driving the open world the weapons feel weak as if they are nerf toys which is funny considering it would probably be a better experience if one was shooting darts instead of the supposed bullets that every enemy seems to swim in before succumbing to defeat ofcource they are all sponges ready to soak up a couple magazines worth of ammunition how else would you be enticed to use the protaganist superpowers god help the creative teams because years of college sure aint doing shit did you run this with nvidias game ready driver i remember you saying in a different video that you also have a gtx 1050 graphics card like i do but it says on steam you need a 1070 i was just wondering if the game ready driver update for it helped make it easy to run or if you bought a better graphic card altogether loved the 1st rage this time round i hope we get the proper ending we deserve this looks like mad max on acid haha great review mate picked this up and ive gotta say its just good old fashioned fun loving it so far ive already found myself going back to doom shadow warrior 2 for my shooter fix to be frank im not sure what people are seeing in this game honestlyit sounds like the previous gamewhich felt too weak in the characters and i felt like there was no growthnothing in the human emotion area to give a shit aboutit was boring i just want a world that feels more meaningful 907 waiting for the bfg effect ark tek core i am one of those 12 people and i liked it so i cant find a single scrap of info online that tells me how get the health augmentation in game it says out of resources so what resources do i need i played rage 1 when it came out and absolutely loved the gameplay and visuals some parts were absolutely beautiful it wasnt perfect but i enjoyed it a lot more than other shooters at the time rage 1 got a lot criticism mostly due to the texture problems on release i never had had that problem if i remember correctly on the pc there was a specific way to configure the graphics settings to avoid the texture bugs i followed the instructions someone posted on a forum from day 1 and had no problems it ran beautifully and was a great experience only let down by the plot which fizzled out towards the end 440 well so much for buying this then women with guns lol can you finish up the halo franchise please game sucks does nothing new or never before seen or experienced in any other game in fact it does everything a bit worse than other games like it names walker is a ranger holy shit were literally chuck norris looks pretty crappy actually might get it only on a deep deep sale like 5 or something i am having a blast with this game but unfortunately it just doesnt have enough cleft palates looks good enough problem is good enough really isnt good enough these days if you ask me there are just so many other things worth playing colourful single player apex legends over use of pinknew dawn and this red faction armageddon had a gun like the grab dart called the magnet gun it was one of the only things that made that game any fun damn it again i had high hopes for another release that has made me think about re installing an older game mad max cheers for an awesome review d i was so hyped for this then i found out its going to be infested with mirco transactions on disk dlc locked to deluxe edition season pass shillmanlives at it again there is denuvo and micxrotransactions in a fullpriced game no buy for me this will work while we wait for borderlands 3 to come to steam red faction armageddon has an arguably cooler version of the grav dart called the magnet gun meh i am not a fan at all of that type of story level structure just have a main quest and side quests not side quests to unlock main quests gman you know i had to schwak it to em lives i feel likes this game is a jackal walking in a mutes jammer simulator rage 2 the new just cause excellent reviewas always i thought it was black ops 4 for a moment or doom another boring run and gun shooter this looks more like doom than rage red faction armageddon had a magnet gun i loved the video btw and enjoy your other ones subscribed the magnet gun from red faction armageddon had that guns same mechanic i liked mad max even though it got repetitive but it had the perfect atmosphere and it got me hooked for days i played rage1 or as it was called rage i loved it yes it had some graphical bugs but i found a fix for it online and the fix is just editing a config file the game has good graphics smooth gunplay like in doom fun unique and interesting npcs fun side missions the car racing part of the game could be a game on its own it was a really good game imo idk why people are hating it so much lame feminist haircuts loosum turned into a middle aged mess not an attractive milf thats enough to turn me off from rage 2 the fosters joke was really bad i know that australians dont drink that beer at all you should have made this joke with vb can you take out hitmarkers watch it upsidedown for the immersion youre the only guy i trust to review an fps this games fun only problem is it doesnt tell you how to switch back to your regular armor so if you have on raines armor from the pre order mission there is no way to get back your armor that i know of a ranger named walker omg how original looks pretty good i going to get this some time in 2019 meh i think most of us will play it cause we gotta to do something until doom eternal or borderlands 3 comes out the reason why you feel like you need more abilities in the beginning is because you got to know to much in the trailers i only played through the first rage once on nightmare difficulty and it was great up until the final level where they gave those motherfukers shields im sorry but this game doesnt fire up any interest for me its way too cartoonish the enemies look dumb and boring the gore is lackluster and unrealistic the open world looks empty and boring i dont knowits just not for me i guess its borderlands the presequel my god this looks blandgeneric and just overall ugly to boot its obvious why they added so much random neon colors everywhere like an actual sjw or characters from this game it dyes its hair and covers up in make up to makeup for a lack of a personality reminds me of what dice did with city maps in bf4 by adding neon strips to buildings its mad max crossed with doom splattered in farcry new dawn colors honestly looks boring and uninspiring lol those masks at 1503 another lame atempt at making fun of trump speaking of fosters have you played beneath a steel sky its an adventure game set in postapocalyptic australia with the protagonist named after the beer its awesome and its available for free so theres no real reason not to play it very good review thx dude didnt know the juggernaut was in this game bitch looks like the same shit ive played a million times no thanks why does every group or agency have to have the most unimaginative name the division the agency the authority for fucks sake put some effort into it drowning in a river of xxxx you mean kinda makes me want to just play mad max again really im so tired of openworld far cry copycats every game that comes out is either openworld or a br why would you want to drown in fosters it tastes like kangaroo piss so like bulletstormfar cry only with worse story than any far cry and worse art style than bulletstorm mate i know 90 of your audience is outside australia so it doesnt matter but fosters in australia is like anthrax hard to find even harder to drink its awful love this review game actually looks so much fun this game is horrible it has no aim assit so it has no target acquisition so youll be aiming straight at an enemy and wont hit shit it has no cover system and no lean and aim system as well dont waste your money this game is trash far cry meets fallout australian walks to the store simulator i dont know this seems completely different to the original game rage was graphically astonishing when it came out the environments looked very believable lived in loads of junk everywhere the enemies were challenging and satisfying to kill the weapons actually felt like leftovers old patched together with duct tape this just looks like bulletstorm with doom armour with vehicles and an open world wont be buying this i like my post apocalyptic games to make you feel like youre in a wasteland the first game had you scrounging for every single bullet selling scrap to pay for ammo you had to prepare before a mission and if you miscalculated how much gear youd need youd be in for a painful trip as some missions lasted 45 minutes you can just see this was dumbed down for the low attention span fortnight players where vomit inducing colours and explosive fantasy weapons are necessary just to keep their eyes on the game lest they get bored red faction armageddon had that magnetic gun which is similar to the gravity weapon to this i was one of those 12 people i guess because i preordered and got it day 1 on ps3 loved the hell out of it i really liked mad max on par but just needed to be more 1st person feel or an option to do so this game ill try before buying it and hoping that rage 2 doesnt have force boss levels like far cry 5 just going around killin bad guys now forced to play level that i didnt want to play now where was i on the map again before i got kidnapped looks painfully mediocre your new logo looks impressive and i just noticed that you changed your name to gman from ggman boo fosters is shit carlton is way better now what we need is a titanfalloverwatch crossover with a single player campaign and thats not being over exaggerating the 2010 game that only 12 people played any other of the lucky dozen here 115 eh i miss her belly uh shes getting older real quick in the new one so i was expecting she will have a good look a bit id take drowning in a lake of furphys any day of the week its good to know theyre still making good fps in this era thanks gman cant wait to play it and great review like always thanks alot the combat really reminds me of bulletstorm just more refined i still am confused about loosum being alive as she died in the book why did id commision the book if they were going to delete it they only let you choose between 2 of the genders hope you get this one better than the fucking blood remaster boyo interesting wasnt on my radar but perhaps ill give it a go ill wait a while and pray they actually fix some bugs first though i held off on grabbing this until i got to see your review glad it wasnt a shit show does it have any forms of microtransactions like those in farcry assassins creed games so it starts like a metal gear game stop bitching did u even play the first one now theres something to bitch about 1315 yep sounds like just cause all right this is basically doom but in the other hell gmanshills o found that screen effects pretty damn distracting and vomit inducing i notice and said the same back when you previewed the game id needs to let us turn that shut off was waiting for this i wouldnt call it an australia simulator i mean not once do you ever get to punch a crocodile im a bit unsure about this one like a lot of people the first thing i thought of when i saw this game was bulletstorm the issue i had with that game was that with everything being ott all the time things quickly lose their sense of impact and it actually begins to feel more dull than something thats toned down a bit and reserves ott moments to punctuate the action the best way i can think to describe it is that its like heavily compressed music where everything is loud all the time uh i dunno it doesnt draw me in 343did you put in the wilhem scream or is that honestly in there this sounds fucking dull this looks pretty fun and also pretty lame gonna wait for it to drop to 20 bucks or less thanks for the review slowly turns to bulletstorm then to just cause 3 i really enjoyed the first game but sadly it seems like forced open world strikes again wait for sale so youre saying that rage 2 in a nutshell is borderlands 3 far cry sandbox elements this game looks closer to bulletstorm then it does to the original rage the feel and atmosphere is completely different the first was pretty dark and gritty and it really felt post apocalyptic this looks more like farcry new dawn maybe its just me but this doesnt remind me of the first rage is this bulletstorm cosplaying as mad max its out already best video to watch while you have a goth girl ride your beak in a yellow thong caw caw dont think i will buy rage 2not right now rage 1 ending feels a bit more validated now haha i liked rage 1 but i wished it was longer this really does look like mad max ive played mad max and it gets boring fast cos theres not much to do even that convoy bit in the video screams mad max game looks cool but basically plays itself because of how easy it is yeah i saw that coming wish those special effects has its own setting in options which is why the accessibility debate should be considered in i mean is it that hard to add on bulletstorm has the exact same gravity shot gun its a cool thing to include though here as it seems to be more violent and satisfying to use i unfourtantley kinda liked the first rage but rage 2 doesnt seem to hit near the same itch i liked the pseudo rpg style that i typically hate and all the weapon designs are interesting ans have a decent future apocalyptic wild west design that fact you had choices for type of ammo and the gunplay feeling so damn good to me it had that punch that made it so satisfying the abilities and player weapons and vehicles just dont seem to match well i get youre going to arks that are basically treasure of pre fallout stuff but they were supposed to be fairly rare and expensive to make the addition of abilities and making it more like bulletstorm kinda saddens me it adds a decent depth but it seems more like a deep puddle than a lake we have several games with the same abilities and they always end up boring with use like destiny cool at first but then its just meh the vehicle addition isnt honestly interesting mad max got boring with it but kept it going with great review bro i defin want to pick this up should hold me off till doom eternal o 1402 that may be the best looking desert ive ever seen in a game i hate these must do side missions to complete main mission if not for id tech i would have not even looked at it ty convinced me to pass 3 90 cyborg have vulnerable head does he wear a helmet nah fuck that shit thats for pussies missed mponline coop opportunity so far cry 2 is africa outbacks simulator watch out this comment section will lower your iq this looks like someone ate their pastel crayons and vomited them all over the game the sheer amount of pink gives me headaches sandstorms screaming neighbors joyriders yep this is australia its hard to ignore the fact that the voice of the main character is reminding me of the time where he voiced 100 different npcs in fallout new vegas my god the way cars fall apart is satisfying this is kind of what ive been asking for of the video game industry for years instead of taking a successful ip and milking countless sequels take a flawed game and try to work out some of the issues it had it looks like a good game i just wish there was a way to disable those awful edgy effects bulletcrysisragestorm this game sounds like it would have made a better crysis with suits made by different corperations vying for world domination that do different things gonna wait till the end of the year to get this but damn what an improvement over the first im so fucking sick of games that have hot pink shit everywhere those screen effect look like gimmicky garbage gotta be honest i miss the 1st games handdone animations they were so expressive and well done whereas this games seem to be mocapped im one of those 12 people and also one of the fewer who likes rage just saying shillmanlives i never got this design heres a game all about action chaos and fun now heres a list of busy work you have to complete to unlock all the actually cool stuff i have this game waiting for me when i get home preordered the special edition to try this out paid shill this as soon as you said it all i could think of is chuck norris in walker texas ranger lol the authority i dont like authority mate paul fenech fat pizza too be fair there is a gun like the grav gun and it was the magnet gun from red faction armageddon must be a glitch in the matrix i know gggmanlives dont do reviews till games are like 5 years old or more hard pass sorry but its just safe on every imaginative level idk what part of aus your from but no one drinks fosters here lol can you disable the dof or no this is a really thorough review ive only been following your channel for a short while but what impressed me is that you really dissect them like a true fan of the fps genre great video as always mate 3 so how is it compared to mad max cause i get more of a vibe from that game than rage though i still saw similar tech testing stuff with the combat like rage was only 12 people seemed to play huh so the same number of people as the number of hours you spent in total on blood noice cant believe were finally getting a sequel to rage 8 year wait baby looks like absolute trash 12 year olds will like it game takes place in australia and you throw boomerangs at people instant like but is it worth 40 so they did that thing everyone hated about the first 2 saints row games good stuff i am excited to get this in a few hours any way to disable the hud this is just annoying when its this extreme and in your face they turned 115 into 117 wtf no wonder this game sucks and is a creative coffin and nothing more than a boring grind fake where are all the chinese owning property the meth heads and the abbos rama rama postbrexit united kingdom ive just bought rage 1 disliked because australian something i did to enjoy rage was use keyboard and mouse obviously for the gun sections and have my controller on stand by for all the driving sections i tell you its night and day makes all the difference in enjoying the game hope its not a mad max clone c cant wait to try it the grav dart sounds like red faction armageddons magnet gun that was some of the most fun id ever had using a weapon in a video game even if it wasnt first person i think im sold xd ill probably just wait for doom eternal honestly a shame i loved the structured shooting gallery levels from the original rage sucks to see the sequel taking so many cues from recent far cry games of all things i thought the aussies werent that big into fosters no word about soundtrack in all out rocking fun games soundtrack is what makes or brakes the game trailer of this game featured andrew wk and thats what made it amazing general quake over there with is full armor except for his headclearly a brilliant mind at work do i have to play rage 1 before avalanche did the mad max game right why the driving is so lame im an epileptic and i appreciate you bringing up the screen effects as this is definitely a title i need to avoid most games are ok but this game takes the chaotic effects from borderlands and dials them up to 11 its a bit too much for me guess im using cheats for this one when will developers learn that its not fun making us play generic shooter 134 just so we can play the shooter we want a few hours in i really need something to play so i guess imma try it out theyre only including the bfg if you pay an extra fee on top of the 60 the game already demands skipped edit this still looks very fun tbh tho something about the fov in rage feels wide for me like the game is zoomed out every battle the enemies look tiny and seem a lot farther away than they are i end up having to squint down my reticle like a quake arena railgun match adding mobility powers seems like a great help but even then something about the way the game is presented i just dont get immersed a lot of the issues you described are actually extremely present in the just cause series then again i havent played jc4 and dont plan to based on how disappointed i was by jc3 yeaaahh its the juggganot bitch i actually really liked rage 1 no weapon limit thats all you had to say what is that swapt meme on 210 i cant help but feel like this is the far cry version of borderlands im gonna hold off for bl3 wasnt planning on getting this game at release but after watching this how can i not is the wilhelm scream really in the game if so ill buy it as an australian i can confirm this is the truth from what i can see looking at the road map the mech thats been in some of the trailers isnt available at launch is this true or is the june mech just a new varient that will be available is the ai as good or variated as the first game or just focused on gunplaypowers this seems like a cool game but it seems to have a lot of flaws i might pick it up when the price is lower oh look another shitty zoomer shooter that look all the same not in to open worlds much only exception is going to be cyberpunk i liked linear levels in rage 1 and id play two if theyd focus on levels i also think the visuals are downgrade from one this game while seeming fine looks waaay too been there done that to me pass 0850 red faction guerrila sequel had that very gun you could pull apart buildings with it aswell doom guy gets shot down to planet earth during the fall and hast to defeat liberals and antifa members 2025 colorized why is everything pinkpurple can we tone it down in options lol what rage 1 was critically acclaimed the shwacked gets me every time thanks for letting us know that you cannot turn the glitch effects off you just saved me 50 as even the video is giving me sensory overload so there is no way i could play the game thanks for the information man you just saved me from a bad purchase shame as otherwise it looks like the kind of game i would have a blast with hopefully someone will come up with a way to knock out the glitch effects via ini or they will get a lot of complaints about them on steam and patch in the ability to turn them off then i will get it when its on sale as then i wont have to worry about sensory overload but as it is no go why do games companies just not give a shit about people with sensory issues lets wait for a few months and it should be good ill wait for the dlcs in really on egde for getting this game the game looks sounds and feels good but some ways too many doom kinda things maybe but if its full of fun then yeah what a day what a lovely day love that starwars reference honestly you can tell if an fps is gonna be good by looking at the shotgun the vehicles and graphics let this game down for me some textures look so bad at times characters in the town areas are just awful to look at and you wont care what any of them have to say pro doom eternal when civvie you earned the like right when i heard giant dildo towers the grav gun red faction armageddon has that minus the rapid fire i thought australians didnt normally drink fosters isnt it like your worst beer all of these modern weapons and high tech gizmos have no place in a post apocalyptic game this feels way to much like crysis and not enough mad max i hear randy juggernaut hayes pimpslap yo ass bitch i press the like button looks really fun but i think ill wait a little while for the price to drop the id part of the game looks incredible but the avalanche part looks a little too mundane for me so in a nutshell its ids new ubisoft game great review sonny jimi just checked the ending and its easily one of the worst videogame endings ive ever seen in my entire lifethis ending alone proves why rage will unfortunately never be a great franchise id software most likely intended it to be and i even question myself how is it going to perform on a market nowadaysgreat review nonetheless and the game also looks very repetitive too well it does not have a lot in common with the original rage wait i thought fosters was austrailian for piss water pretty shitty not even going to bother thanks for the upload 741 nice republic commando reference please do spec ops the line i was one of those less than 12 people that actually enjoyed rage quite alot its one of those games i come back to once or twice a year since the release and it holds up beautifully imagine my excitment when this sequal was announced but oboy how dissapointed i turned out to be this game looks nothing like the first game and more of a open world cod shooter with power ups every enemy encounter in rage felt human and realistic how the enemies interacted and communicated while in rage 2 they act like bullet sponges with some sort of bulletstorm hybrid the weapons in the original felt dusty old and gritty very post apocalyptic and not spacefuturistic like with a few exceptions also the id tech engine really made the world in rage look gorgeous and unique especially character models rage 2 looks very generic codish with no heart and soul its such a shame looks linear and ordinary tbh trying too hard the game also whats the context for the schwacked joke waiting for bethesda to fuck this up avalanche fuck up yet again third vid on rage 2 a polish website calls this the best far cry game since years far cry blood dragon x rage this this looks better than i thought it would be so far looks like doom combat with open world elements red faction armageddon has somewhat of a similiar weapon to the gravity one crackdown 3 also has a gravitysticky gun thingin 3rd person of course but its great fun outback steakhouse simulator can you turn off the hitmarkers i hate that shit burn the world and boil the oceans whatever gmanlives makes the schwacked meme will always be there just like yo mama schwacked gmanlives youre one of the few game commentators that i can stand listening to youre really in depth and adult i dont have to wade through a bunch of silly pubescent jokes and shit like that even angry joe makes me cringe with how stupid all the attempts at humor are props man keep up the good work and yeah if id software has a hand in a shooter im definitely going to get it ill make sure to spend a good amount of time on the game first and seek out a bunch of arks at the beginning rage 2 be looking mean and saucy 954 had me smiling that looks satisfying as all hell i am hoping to play this game soon because it does look really fun my main issue against rage 2 is cutting out parts of the game to sell later as dlc and mission cutting in order to include it only in collectors edition sorry you paid 60 but not enough to get a complete experience fuck off you poor shit also apparently there will be skins weapons and other weird types of microtransactions inside a fully priced game other issue is that the map feels empty its filled with boring repetetive ubisofty questionmarks clear that camp climb this tower and do it over and over again main story is 5 hours short and boring as hell i was sure the game just starts after the boss and all i saw were the credits another aaa shooter clone perfect for those who think last few generations of far cry assassins creed and shadow of lootbox were good games you should check out mordhau its good personally i find this game to be slightly less boring than the first and no thats not a compliment the bullet sponges make the shooting feel weak that gravity gun was in red faction armageddon attack its weak point for massive damage australian outback simulator lol so good civvie called you out in his new blood review lmao sounds like fc5 do random shit until a boss fight land down under industrial synthetic mix rage 2 is looking really good except it doesnt due to that horrible pinky art style x hope the game isnt too draggy this looks really fun s c h w a c k are we supposed to already know what your pc specs are maybe note it somewhere how is it that all the gaming journalists say that this game is shit and has mediocre shooting like its all good and finding the arks is hard but fun like seriously journalists have no sense in good games seems like resistance series and ratchet and clank has not been topped for fun weapons oooooh damn he has a roy mustang pistol thats pretty sick is bfg what do you expect it looks like a futuristic sequel to black with vehicles and powers mad max had even less than rage 2 and its one of my alltime favorite game wilhelm scream at 341 lol anywho at least the game looks less bland than the original so thats a step in the right direction but kinda looks like a crysis ripoff now what a shiti review a dystopian hellscape in the ruins of a once advanced civilization now ruled by psychotic tumblrinas with problem hair seems like its just real life with slightly worse graphics i see we have degeneracy aplenty and the women are now dressed like feminist professors no thanks glad to see that they toned down the distortion vfx still hoping that we can turn them off after a patch or a modder will take care of it well at least the dev stayed true to his word takes about 30mins in the beginning to get to the good stuff oh yay another massive open world level grind to progress run and gun game filled with pointless artifacts i just cant be bothered it literally becomes to much like a job at the end of the day damnit now i want to get some fosters borderlands 3 mad max edition is lit the pulse gun is straight up the railgun from doom 2016 610 910 after you ignore everything and just bline to the arks and get all the powers fosters what no aussie likes that shit beer lol are you even aussie anyone else remember a ps2 game called black now that was a shooter superpowers always remind me im playing a game i should already be a badass with my years of skill playing fpss i aint an aussie but this represents probably arizona too just deserts i am glad id is still making new games but rage 2 is a sequel mainly in name what i loved about the first game is the ammo types and the equipment one can use during combat turrets walking sentries and rc bombs i remember doing a pistol only run where i used fat momma bullets like it was a 44 automag basically a howitzer with a handle now eh the combat for rage 2 does look okay but there is only so much crazed humans can diversify themselves for combat while the same time the suit makes the man more than the other way around i kind prefer gear and equipment where it remains tools and not what defines the character im using i know that is strange to say but i already own doom 2016 in the lore doom slayer is a badass without his armor and walker becomes a capable fighter because of his suit i know many people dont care about this and minor details are a bonus or curse this time its a curse i like sam riegel as a voice actor and in the critical role dnd looks like it would be fun but i honestly prefer the aesthetics of the first one more a more grounded oppressive feel works for the apocalypse and this neon eighties aesthetic reminds me that there isnt a necromunda video game youtube keeps turning my notifications off for your channel and its pissing me off lol who even are you this will definitely hold me over til id software gives us doom eternal cant wait to play rainbow mad max now hello what happened to the second g waited until 3am when it unlocked on steam finally about to play it now how pewdiepie has 80 million sub while you dont is beyond me 939 why lie gman aussies dont drink fosters you know this gmanlivesign still cant wait to play this game waited for you to review this thanks for the great video looks awesome ive got it preloaded on steam right now and i cant wait to play it yay a game with over the top flashing means i cant play it cuz of epilepsy thanks bethesda fostahs give me a frigging vb long neck git dat up ya dat wilhelm scream at 340 i now want this game hi ive just been playing it for the last hour or so not too bad either fcuk this guy is such a penis lol sonnyi play on hard and then complain about bulletspongy enemies jim so basically as i expected a good shooter but a poor open world game i think red faction armageddon had a gun that was similar to the grav dart it was called magnet gun if i remember correctly that one could rip parts off of buildings as well it was a fun weapon on another note this seems like a big improvement over the original i might have to give it a try oh hey look its new dawn 2 synthwave boogaloo the fact that the bfg only exists as dlc in the special edition is straight up bullshit is there mutated wildlife because you could do so much with that especially if its set in the australian outback is it actually i really dont know just take a look what borderlands did with its critters they had so much variation in their attack patterns looks and abilities the grav dart is super similar to the magnet gun in red faction armageddon stabbims skuttering skulkers someones been watching season 1 of red dwarf 0159 i just dont know this game just dont hook me looking like a brave doom with the color purple added maybe on a sale 942 foster wouldnt it be xxxx gold disliked rage 1 rage 2 hasnt appealed to me ill pass on this the simple grading system to determine if todays games are good from 2014 present is it better than gta v a game created almost 10yrs agowe live in the fakeat era this that sucked years agomake money later because of nostaligia the majority of ppl could care less for this game at timenot a sequel will be better so this review is telling me if u like open world games buy it if not dont however if u want this satisfying combat wait for doom eternal i still need to wait one more day for this to come out goddamn it i disagree with what you said about the powers i think if you had the powers from the beginning even if they were weaker they would not be as interesting you see the fact you have to track these down and work to obtain them is what make them special its the discovery what makes them awesome thats good fucking game design why so many unnecessary spoilers in reviews nowadays i dont need to know how the story starts and why id like to find out myself just say if the start point was good or not if the body was better and if the ending was epic or not no details needed at all rounding up the reviews ive seen so far rage 2 can pretty much be summed up with great combat everything else ehhh the grav dart gun reminds me of the magnet gun from red faction armageddon grav dart seems kinda like the hookshot from just cause 3 so i guess its another idea avalanche transplanted from their previous game i mean was hiring this developer to make a game like that a stroke of genius or what from the looks of it rage 2 is like a mashup of all the best things from just cause mad max and doom i believe red faction armageddon had magnetic gun or something which worked very similarly to grav dart and was very fun to use oh and crackdown 3 had one as well but it was pretty useless as for barrier skill you can combine it with vortex and turn enemies into fasta pasta i am personally kind of sick of open world game at this point but this one seems like far cry with really good combat and gunplay and that is good enough for me so fps version of crackdown 3 looks great but ill wait until its s30 or less s82 is way too expensive for me tbh i wasnt convinced to buy this game i rather jumped on blood fresh resuply good review finally been waiting for this game amazing assets and graphics but it is so fucking boring and we cant even see midriffs now fuck this piece of shit industry to hell seriously all this busy work what a mess we need some decent idea guys i can imagine this graphical power being used for a fucking original videogame so blood fresh supply is actually a dumpster fire looks like a quake 2 enemy is not as funny as looks like a fucking strogg have more faith in us really though great review looks way too easy and boring you talk about slow progression in the beginning and having to earn stuff that just makes me want to play it seems more like a shooter rpg than a straight fps which i am super down for this looks awesome it helps that you know how to play i cant wait for tonight well its good to hear that the combat is fun but the rest of your critique tells me that i should wait a month or two until they iron out the kinks the game isnt going anywhere so theres no rush this game looks fucking amazing definitely picking it up when im able looks decent not a fan of super powers but might get this for the shooting mechanics alone and that shotgun sound whoever made it deserves an award for boomstick sound design of the year this was my first time watching one of your videos and before i clicked play i was like this guy has a brittish accent the screen effects put me off when i first saw this game i dont mind the gameplay shit but those screen effects really fucks with my autism so screen tearing is now a special effect looks like mad max crossed with blood dragon ill wait for a sale fosters almost got a downvote for that im one of those weirdos that liked rage one really looking forward to the new one it looks like they fixed pretty much everything from the last one i really like the design of the environments the gunplay looks stellar as well this is going to get my full attention in the coming days 846 cant think of another shooting game that has a weapon like this red faction armageddons magnet gun triple g im writing a paper on how violent videogames dont cause violence can i get a quote just needs some emus taking apart an armed squad and its a genuine aussie experience aw shit i was worried this game would be shit as soon as i learned it was being developed by the same people behind just cause 4 what a bummer i was hoping this game would tide me over till doom eternal or dying light 2 came out ive been bored with no games to play for the last five months edit ok so maybe i jumped the gun there from the beginning i thought the review was going to be worse than it was looks like crysis mated with far cry blood dragon shwacked is officially gmans ultimate fuck you phrase great review man cant wait to get this projared lol theres the fucking bfg 115 mmmm yes please 833 850 youve obviously never played red faction 4 mate the magnet gun from red faction armageddon is very similar to the gravity gun its the year 2019 and i would have never expected to hear a my way entertainment reference you have no idea how happy i am right now lmao cant stand heavily scripted games where you just sit back yawn and think hey isnt this meant to be funits got deep sale written all over it it an offline single player shooter made for one purposefun factor already downloaded on my pro 1 more day and its time to rage i know im late but where are the other gs gman exposed aussies dont drink fosters xxxx gold and vb is proper aussie piss you hack fraud the blood remaster is not that good i had a feeling you would like this game before it came out preorder bonuses planned dlcs boosters and denuvo ill wait for the legendary edition which wont have any of these thanks gaming industry for teaching me to check for this stuff before i buy crysys aussie bulletstorm edition hey i was one of the 12 that played rage 1 i was one of the even fewer who liked it hahaha shame they showed off the entire map of the game before this thing was even released now i dont feel like playing it anymore i was really hyped for this game guess ill wait for it to go on sale developers should stop doing this games like this are way better than halo and its good to know that this game is awesome and very fun as hell and not a another cash and grab like fallout 76 just a another very badass fun as hell game made from pure passionate developers that bethesda thankfully didnt screw over and froce this game into a another cash and grab like ea and actvision i will definitely be buying this post apocalyptic masterpiece for my badass ps4 the console were its meant to play awsome games nice review looks like im going to have to pass on this im probably the only one that like the prequel and am disappointed they made a lukewarm borderlands lookalike also dont really care for the super technology based arsenal missed the simple ak or sawn off that be more akin to the setting i am so dissapointed in this game when doom 4 came out the hard difficult was way too easy with rage 1 i had to play on hard with a controller on pc becase that was a joke too this looks way easier looks like you can choose how to play but doesnt really matter i am not happy to say this but far cry 2345 has way better gameplay the good point is that i dont have to spend money on this game so thanks for the review vsync off the game i got sick from the glitch effects just watching some gameplay and since you cant turn them off i guess i wont be playing this shame looks good plus a modern aaa titel thats not deliberately made worse seems like a rarity these days can you look at the first mortal kombat game the gravity gun in red faction armageddon is pretty similar if not better so the game suffers from the same illness every open world game does you need to roam around the world almost pointlessly and grind your way through the progression system before you even start to give a fuck about the story they put a wilhelm scream in it great pew pew review it also helps the cars sexy voice is linda carter aw so the different type of ammo didnt make a comeback the first game make you feel like bat man with all the gadget and ammo rage 2 make you feel like iron man on cocain or mushroom lmao that magnetic gun when doom 2016 was about to be launched id holded a contest for the people to suggest what weapons they would like to see in the game encouraging people to ge creative i proposed a weapon that fit exactly the description of that magnetic gun with some extra features like sticking two phisical objects to squash people in the middle im probably giving me too much credit of course but i cant help but wonder if my suggestion had something to do with the inclusion of this gun on rage 2 my first thought upon seeing the demonstrations were that the glitchy effects were gonna be an eyesore on an otherwise good combat experience i bet theres gonna be a mod out to remove them within the week this looks pretty decent but i think ill just wait till doom eternal id pick this up on a deep sale though great review as always by the way the grab dart i think its basically the magnet gun from red faction armageddon so not entire unique in a shooter but still badass and awesome nonetheless nice video am buying this one but what do you mean only 14 people play its not out yet coming 14 may this game will unlock in approximately 10 hours hey gmanlive is mortal kombat 11 ban in australia does the game take place in a funny timezone too this game already came out why does the gunplay look worse than rage 1 i cant help but thinks that this could have almost been a mad max game 1503 trump please dont tell me this is another ubisoft game that pushes politics to my face hopefully finding all the arks didnt make you rage 2 hard im not sorry so you just dont care about spoilers huh not talking about gameplay btw of course this fucker blocks people cause he cant stand the truth a reviewer like john bain died and shit like you is allowed to live lets just hope this changes fast thanks for the difficulty advice there is no way to turn of those effects as far as i know well fuck blood dragon 2 lookin pretty good i love how its a simulator and the real thing is so much worse you said the blood remake was good all other reviews are invalid rage 1 looks deeper in its own way how about the animations the 1st one has one of the best animations in games also the nicest skybox and how the hell did they not include the crossbow and alt ammo and the cute spider robot so basically its like a slightly gritty bulletstorm entertainingly topnotch analytic review as always gman may the force of shwacked be always with ya the arks are kinda like the zelda botw shrines i remember the days of going to work looked a lot like this it looks great cant wait to play it i mean it is an okay game i had fun it has these mild negatives and i am totally being critical here so basically get sunnytards get it every review i am really tired of sandbox games right now so i might pick it up later 12 hour single player campaign excluding side missions that has microtransactions i find this so utterly despicable the value proposition is just wrong here and that is not even considering already planned paid expansions sorry this is just not ok to me in a single player game ill probably pick up a cheap key of the 1st game and play that while i wait for this one to go on sale please tell me you can turn off all that distortion mushroom pink n purple hipster shit filter if not im leaving it alone doom cry then far cry meets doom and a bit of mad max i still think that rage 2 is a good idea because it works a little bit like bulletstorm with better shooting but sadly will be ignored by many people because wolfenstein and doom are right around the corner i somewhat hesitate to buy it too i would wait for a sale people they said they were going to dip there dick in the game and add or change shit they said there will be no loot boxes but there looking into games as a service for this game in the future and ps if anyone bought dmc 5 say fuck no to data processing there trying to see how to sell micro transactions to you in future games and see how you play be carful wait for this you dont know what there going to do to it and i 100 refuse to buy a game that i have no idea how its going to be im paying 60 to a 100 for a game now not a game later it can turn into something i absolutely did not want to purchase spend your money wisely people me personally ill pass walker ranger why didnt they just make the main character chuck norris looks nice but it has too many pay to win aspects gonna wait for the free copy australian shwack wow both you and dreamcast guy uploaded your reviews at the same but of course i watched yours first gmanlives loved rage 1 but after watching this after spending an afternoon at campbelltown nsw i cant wait to play it also a mod that starts you off with a mid to 34 powered character just to shoot the breeze ie prevent the slow start im sure there will be a duct tape mod for this red faction armageddon had a weapon similar to the gravdart i play games for the story so this game looks terrible to me i guess its already may 14 in aus being hours ahead has its advantages thanks for the review sorry mate but fosters hasnt been ozzy for ages now we dont drink that stuff any more not since i think some indonesian company got it game looks alright though rage 2 otherwise known as this will tide me over till doom eternal rather have a new quake feels like a 5 experience it ant aussie if there ant no meat pies damn it the king of narcissists will trash this game as the worse ever and should be dead a long time ago following the first one being so shitty ever i dont want to tell you who you are but here the clue only idiot will play this game just came here to say eskimo callboys song for this game is wack af i wish this game have a coop mode you basically reviewed this game for 3 times guess gonna wait for discount game seems very meh looks like a sequel to bulletstorm especially the gameplay ill hold off til it hits 20 or so oh damn 16 hours to complete the campaign i heard some review it takes 5 to 7 hours to complete which is very short for open world game been waiting on ya review bro i liked the first one and will pick this one up too i think the maxx when i rrad about the australian outback great review gman this will be like 15 20 soon enough so if you want to just buy it for gunplay id wait till it is at least half price the screen turns into an indie music video i cried that was a great review mate every day im more and more proud to be an aussie seriously im more sold on this game than borderlands 3 i mean its all about mindless shooting gore and mayhem whats not to love for once in the history of the universe local post office delivered early as in friday instead of next tuesday meaning ive been playing this all weekend good stuff this sometimes the combat gets mindbendingly fast and you find yourself ripandtearing through an outpost like a lovechild of doom slayer and barry allen also special shoutout to the way the open world works everything you do side attractions bounties what have you fuels straight back into the upgrade system so even if youre just farting around the wasteland shooting some bandits it never feels like youve wasted your time australian outback simulator yeah but australia doesnt exist tho hm red faction armaggedon also had something identical to the grav dart one of the few reasons to buy that game fuck your fosters m8 i dont know how anyone can drink that shit when tooheys platinums exist great review sit there and take it all in like your mum shwacked missed oppertunity there gg wowwhat else can i say this looks as polished a shooter as can be talk about doom levels of action no double barrel shotgun even more flashy stuff on the screen than fc blood dragon which was like a parody auto targeting during driving banditsphoenix rising did better job cant wait to buy this i loved rage so much just not the ending typical id ending i just hope this game aint hype and from your review it doesnt seem it keep it up gman time to wake up gmanlives recommends rage 2 its time to party party theres going to be a party tonight really thorough review great stuff all in all rage 2 looks honestly amazing seems like one of the best sp fps in recent years you actually cleared it five minutes in the review and my head hurts i think ill go back to playing fresh supply so basically someone saw all the boring side stuff from ubisoft games and thought yeah but what if it was the main stuff the australian outback has not one person with a supply of reuben sandwiches im sorry but that breaks my suspension of disbelief im hearing far cry blood dragon meets far cry new dawn with the zone system of far cry 5 i like how avalanche and id made a better fallout game than fallout 76 and got bethesda to publish it 328 love the juggernaut bitch reference xd is there really a wilhelm scream in this game hoo boy finally a australian mad max prob gonna be one of the best games for me in 2019 d sounds like they wanted to monetize the shit out of this game slow progress unlocks and stuff how many people did you have to make suffer and die for 500 very realistic is there a new game plus storage containers 06 i hope its not filled with dogshit quest design like this for real im the juggernaut bitch why theres no lan ffa dm with bots to fill a low human player count why seriously this looks so good for a drunken lan party now this is epic bethesda can eat my dick for demanding 300 tl for this in comparisonvampire bloodlines 2 only costs 92 tl in base game preorder despite being 60 dollars im glad its good im gonna think of buying it do you guys its any as good as wolfenstein the new franchise and doom i feel like this is one of those titles that will be 20 within a month i hate the way it looks tho why does everything you say sound like it has a question mark ugh another half bald bitch i havent seen fosters in australia for over 20 years lol this game looks cool gotta wait for 1 more month until im buy my gaming pc i i was enjoying the video until 737 i dont care if you agree with the president trump or not but keep your politics out of video games the consumer wants escape not brainwashing i was literally watching your rage prerelease review the main character has such a generic name this game looks great cant wait to jump in tomorrow bethesda is never getting my support for their absurdly high regional pricing for the same usd5999 vampire bloodlines 2 rs1299 rage 2 rs 3999 ggman posts 1 min ago good choice for the vid mate not keen on so much purple bloom by the look of it though bulletstorm meets mad max meets far cry i guess damn was looking into this but might have to pass australian outback can confirm very accurate remind me to never move to australia too bad as a guy who buys games for their sp campaigns this doesnt sound like a game for me still thanks for your review looks great but im going to wait for a sale leaves work early to see the review first review ive seen so far great review man im still convinced avalanche started this title out as a sequel to their mad max game but was rejected so took it to bethesda please review the red orchestrarising storm series i enjoyed the 1st lets hope this is as good as the 1st gman bro should re do the blood remaster review is this coming to switch kind of a shame that this dlc isin my opinionbetter of the twoyet its freebut the secondwhich i see as less interestingneeds to be bought bruh i got this on a separate account and it wont gamergate wtf bethesda bedhesta you lied about in deluxe edition when player comes out the city just before getting bfg 9000 you lied in your info that in that deluxe content what contains one of dlc rise of ghost you lied that it contains new swords only the enemys and seems to be other in dlc dlc enemys sure envorimens sure arks with equiment sure others i dont know you greedious gets whole time bigger and bigger and now we need buy shitty dlc to get it fuck you we pay our content that we shoud get but you just care about a money and try get away again fallout 76 had one case where police have been investigate and you already get away a crime what happend in atomic shop and ruined creation club fix it you suckers music please this game desperately needs expanded content especially replayable content dear bethesda thank you for making elsweyr online also thank you for destroying the elder scrolls lore i am also extremely happy that you are now a extremely greedy company obsessed with money im also extremely excited that you are going to use the new shit engine for the new elder scrolls 6 i hope one day i get to work for a company as obsessed with money as you i also cannot wait to sell my car so that i can buy all your useless pathetic microtransactions also bring back horse armour please and of course thank you for banning god howard from coding his own games since 2006 youre a true inspiration for the gaming industry thank you 3000 3000 glitches coming soon to es6 looks like some cheap copy of half life 2 hello id my name is kris i have to say im enjoying the hell out of rage the combat is fun and addictive with a very unique art style and beautiful graphics i can tell that a lot of effort and time was put into the game and i can see it clearly but id like to offer a few suggestions to improve upon such a great game the crafting of explosives and drones should be integrated into the quick selection so that the player wont be taken away from the action the driving mechanics are spot on with the gun play but when im driving out and about theres not much to shoot in such a large world me im a action junkie and i think the fans who picked up this game are as well so i think more enemies on the ground and roaming enemies would help keep the juice flowing the weapons are amazing from the feelthe look and the sound i can feel the kaboom in the rocket launcher i have to say that letting all upgrades be equipped on all weapons would be a great addition with the ultra difficultywith t lol no one gives a shit about this game rage 2 new dlc and chaos wolfenstein 2 new chaos my ass they could have not killed the vibe with the dubstep or whatever the fuck that was damn this is sick boycut bethesda and watch them burn boycut bethesda and watch them burn why are they wasting there time on dlc when all we want is a 100 subscription service is this doom its like far cry new dawn accept way better and fun nope go back to the drawing board and come up with something fun hi beath side plz add telsa amour to fallout 76 plz i came here to say this i nutted watching the outer worlds bethesda can burn after fallout 76 after sucking each other off instead of getting starfield or elder scrolls done wasted time making a trash fallout 76 game sweet sweet little lies todd howard hey bethesda wtf happened to you micrtranactions in a 60 game total loss of consumer confidence this was your fault for your scummy corporate decisions it was a dream of mine to work for you but no longer im glad i dont have to be ashamed by the company i work for your games are trash i fear bethesda is going to monetize the shit out of starfield and elder scroll 6 hello my name is todd and i like to suck on my rod i tell many lies and when i do kitty dies i like to tell you stuff that makes you wallet pop on the stage i like to troll of hey i see the money roll promisses that was never held now go buy that yellow helm 5 dollers for a pop no wait thats for another job my name is todd and i like to suck a rod why cant i buy this man i love this game but it is also one of the worst games i have ever played the gameplay is perfection everything else sucks a wanna know something i dont care why bethesda why must you delay doom eternal to march 2020 we were almost close to november why must you do this to us 030 boys when tour guide says were playing paintball wars release fallout shelter online in all america the game is wonderfull but we cant play the game and its better than the classic fallout shelter please just release the game bethesda please remaster fallout 3 and fallout new vegas with the addition of mods for consoles that is the best option you have for a new release in many of your fans eyes seems pretty cool dear bethesda please fix screen tearing on the ps4 pro y fallout 5 y skirym 6 cuandooo your company is dying todd i beg of you take as much time as you need to make a game to save yourself bad guy is probably resurrected prowley in a mask just calling it rage 2 is not a diamond but it is a great game and for me the best open world fps it is so fluid and fast only doom wolfenstein2 and titanfall2 give the same feeling of perfect fluidity i love it gameplay gunfights explosions are amazing i have a lot of fun playing rage 2 it is why we play video games isnt it the content is very good for my point of view the story is ok but honestly i dont care when it comes to play a game like rage 2 i just want fast and crazy gunfights and rage 2 is one of best game for this technically apex game engine with vulkan runs very well as i said before global illumination is impressive the visual quality of the deep field is clearly a success textures are good fidelityfx sharpening works very well and helps a lot especially when taa is on the differents enemies animations are amazing however the water looks awfull when you dont look through it thanks avalanche studio id software and bethesda very good job so please make dishonored 3 hey you youre finally awake you were trying to cross the border right walked right into that imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there lol do people still play this shit is that the bfg so im guessing they are toning down the humor by 11 decibelsstill its only just another raider faction nothing more fuck yeah another 20gb to download even though i really dont want any of this thanks for constantly forcing those giant updates onto us in my top 3 of disappointing games 2019 had such high hopes for it after the first one yikes horrible i love id but will this one feature ghosting lag pixel degradation horrible voice acting and the great card game too hahahaha seriously loved the card game im looking forward to playing rise of the ghosts tonight i remember them from the first game i think better than shadowkeep please remaster fallout newvegas for ps4 cant believe they waste any effort on this shite finally an expansion lets hope it was worth waiting for hey i have 2 questions is this game multiplayer at all also is this game worth getting this should have been free this game lacked content more than any other game i have seen recently this any good if i have the rage 2 collectors edition i already own the dlc right gimme second starfield trailer pls ive put like 60 hours into this game love it it took like 8 hours to pull me in though once i got more guns powers and upgrades there are so many upgrades towards the end i felt like neo double jump air dash forward twice above group of enemies stop in the air and lock onto 3 targets with a rocket launcher and shoot ground pound into a group of 2 baddies turning them into bits force push nearby guy 50 feet down road all in one smooth motion if thats not awesome then ill turn in my 30 year old gamer card ps craftable weapons upgrades in rage 3 plz maybe some toxic weather trailer is great only the trailer so basically doom but less gorey that dialogue voice acting yeek its like a 10 year olds comic book brought to life i was wondering when part 2 of rage 2 was gonna be released is this going to be free because i just uninstalled this gay stylr weapon and color if this isnt free its not worth your noney tbh edit i own it and the gunplay is fantastic but the story was a weeeee bit lackluster whats to say this onell be any better who cares but does it make the game less boring lmao bethesda i wanna buy rage 2 on steam love id and avalanche but i dont wanna have to sign in to a launcher to play take it out please that wasted bfg shot hurts my soul too much how much is it i hate what you have done to this game i loved the first one i keep forgetting rage 2 even exists same goes for your new woke wolfenstein spin off with the 2 lesbians protagonist or what fucking ever oh boy cant wait for the mold special edition on this one but does it have proper side quests to keep things interesting ive gotten to the point where im expecting to be disappointed by any game no matter how cool the trailer is i bought the deluxe edition and linked my account and i still cant access the dlc does anyone know how to get it i hope dlcs and patches address the criticism i really want to play it for the gameplay but it seems to lack in other aspects too much honey wheres my super suit i uuhh shoved it up your ass but the wasteland is in danger poor id software they all went down extremely hard ever since quake and even today still in a really sad state standing on the brink of near bankruptcies stressed out and overworked just look at quake champions man this game was such fun but really lacked content especially storywise it just sorta ends its weird definitely worth the play if you can grab it cheap though only 1 new weapon lol considering how big the open world is that pretty weak still waiting on the dlc 2 details since i bought the deluxe edition to get the dlc just for them to announce a second dlc after launch that they say will cost extra even with the deluxe edition what a fishy company bethesda is becoming better villain than borderlands 3 actually lol why her voice is like dremora xd yesyesyes loved playing every second of this game wait if its an empty wasteland with nothing but banditsauthoritymutants to shoot then whats far cryborderlands supposed to be then memes by the truckload how is this trailer in 4k but the game only plays in 1080p this game is deadjust release the complete edition with all of the content on disc if you want me to buy it so badly i read this was coming out in december is this game even worth buying looks awesome a nice dlc for an awesome game oh shit forgot about borderlands 25 here maybe if it goes on sale ill pick it up ah good this should be enough content to make it a free dlcright is 76 f2p yet a wahmen boss what a surprise feminist cocksuckers is there no new trophies what an appropriate title for a dead game i have all bethesda game but this is not a bethesda game rage 2 have great gameplay and mechanics but the game story is so boring the main problem of this game is not bethesda or id software the problem is awalance studio 0 faith in bethesda 1 new weapon 1 new ability im sorry you have had how many months now to work on this expansion and what do we get a single boring weapon and a single recycled ability oh but wait we also get and incredibly short and boring new campaign this is completely subpar considering this is id software jesus i cant express how disappointed i am i dont think rage 2 is a terrible game though it clearly isnt worth its asking price which is why im glad i waited for it to be on sale the combat is fun but calling it one of the best feeling shooters ever is a fucking stretch though especially since the first rage had much more interesting combat and much greater feedback from its weapons it looks cool and fun in theory but the new gun and ability look like theyll get old kinda quick and the story missions and combat areas probably havent improved do yourself a favor and go play borderlands 3 imagine spending years developing an entire roadmap and content for this game and expecting people to keep playing this only to have it go on sale like 3 weeks after launch with no one even knowing what the hell it is looks good now hurry and release the next expansion as well so i can buy the complete definitive edition and play it i really really miss the stylized graphicsaesthetics of the first rage too much popcolor not enough grunge and rust how do you get to the city the suicide squad of shooters oh yeah this game exists lmao im just getting warmed up maam thats sick sorry bethesda i just dont trust your company any more after all the lies this year poor release schedule tho what with bl3 and all wheres the smug cliff hes the star of this game this took way too long to come out my dudes totally forgot about this game oops i kinda got bored with this game aftet a while i never finishef it didnt help that my deluxe content ever appeared where is moze and iron bear not bad shame as i bought the deluxe edition but the content wont appear in game last straw bethesda never thought id say it but your out i will always feel betrayed by the original roadmap new weapons they said new abilities they said and new vehicles as well the plural clearly meant that we will get at least two of each in both expansions and its a shame because it isnt really that hard to come up with a new ability or a vehicle ghost monster truck ability that can freeze an object allowing you to steal a car ability of shooting lighting from the sky or a flame thrower i could go on and on theres a lot that this rushed game could use if only there was a mod support to make those things a reality i wouldnt even care if i had to pay extra as long as its a fair price please avalanche make that dream a reality this game was too vastkinda got boring should either be coop or a single player corridor game edit dont mean to criticize the game its not bad but just giving my 2 cents why cant you just let go of failed games first f76 now this hurry up and sell your game at 20 so that we can finally buy it at what its really worth just kidding its only worth 5 or less but im being kind this shouldve been called fall of the ghost they dont stand a chance against walker floppity flop is it free i dont care what people say rage 2 is a damn fun game thats a pretty dope narrator keep up the great works bethesda oh okay thats why tim willits left poitless game and oh god the macrotransaction currencies in a single player game its fun to watch bethesda try so hard can we get rage game without unfunny humour and pink mist everywhere if only this content would have been in the base game nobody cares ok bye wow track please go get them sam this games so dead and nobody liked it just move on my brothers and sisters be thankful you will be the firs oh wait wrong steely bad lady from an id software shooter is this gonna be terribly average too wheres fl4k gone fallout 76 cancer no thanks we need to see dan once in awhile dan is awesome so based on daves description dan is the underdog hero also good job on being so supportive elle much more positive then the guys theres no loot in this game two minutes later breaks crate and loots it wonderful stream mates really enjoyed this one everyone should have a gaming friend like elle just lets u play isnt bossy and wouldnt only point something out after a minute or 3 the hell os wrong with this game graphics are horrible rage 1 looked better on ps3 oh man i never played the first rage but this sequel is like mad max doom and borderlands all had a baby and it is awesome when the enemies were running at dave in the sewers and some enemies running on walls and dave was using the combat shotty it reminded me of doom when dave was having vehicular combat it of course reminded me of mad max and the wasteland in general and some of the look and feel of the game reminds me a little bit of borderlandsi hope thats okay i love all three of those games and the mad max movies and it looks like i might love this one as well so is our character a cyborg or something we use things like nanotrites i see dave using and health infusions as well this looks like a lot of fun though that much seems apparent in a world where cryogenic sleep is possible biological age would refer to your physical age versus your chronological age for example someone who was 25 when put in a cryogenic sleep for 100 years would still wake up biologically 25 years old but would be chronologically 125 years old great video as always not keen on the game though fps is seeming a bit stagnant may seem ironic or hypocritical but we need a new killzone game play killing in the name of i hoped for 30fps with better graphics cyberpunk 2077 can handle it good no 60fps needed please play a plague tale innocence this game looks fun buthow is this game 60 dollars no multiplayer online no coop no loot grindit would be like if doom was campaign onlybut even then it has the doom brand at very least this is easily a rent and be done game there is no way it is worth 60 bucks dead dan will fix any technical issues whos the lady i dont now anyone who didnt show up on a friday feature until now im subscribed to your channel ive liked it ive rung the bell but i still miss the notifications of the livestreams such a bummer i love chatting it up while you guys play missing crysis you really are a bonnie and clyde kind of team now that you are playing rage so awesome to see their take on real life pro wrestler names in gunbarrel tomorrow the rage will begin well done dave that was close why is graphic so awful it looks like ps3 game time to rage against math class in favor of this video yeah 35 bullet mag and this man was releasing every 5 shots lol wheres the friday features bet dave still isnt gonna get a platinum from this game nice rack dave ellies hot too i guess the gunplay looks great i just finished rage 2 ive been waiting to watch this gamescast let me just tell you all that nick is right on point as usual i love hearing him talk about the games he loves and especially since they are few far between which makes it a real treat to get his opinion on these the gameplay is super solid easily one of the best shooters ive ever played the menus can feel a little overwhelming at the start but once youre about a quarter way through you understand how they want you to play it and it doesnt feel as clunky as before side note i played on pc like fran which could be why our opinion on the game looking wonderful is shared but i really dont know where andy is coming from when he says it looks muddy and not well detailed such surprisingly theres a been a bunch of reports regarding this as one of if not the best looking open world fpss ever and i wholeheartedly agree especially the designs throughout the world but also the fact that got the platinum on rage 2 the game is awesome but its very skill based on hard mode the way to go imho wouldnt agree on rage 2 being bad story its a shooter story everything is built around justifying why you got to shoot the bad guys for what it is its amazing the biggest problem is that the graphics fucking suck pro tip level up your guns get the icarus open all arks and get to the mad doctor kvasir as soon as you can the skilltree kvasir offers really helps when you are hunting down those spydrones the hardest trophy in the game by far all nintendo has to talk about is pokemon sword and shield nintendo sets separate date for pokemon direct so they can save the e3 direct for a 2nd half with zelda animal crossing luigis mansion astral chain marvel ultimate alliance 3 maybe mario maker 2 and anything else to be surprise announcements seriously saying nintendo has nothing to talk about is pretty stupid they probably have their most jampacked 2nd half sincewell besides the last two years decades i love the lenovo bit greg i completed all strongholds multiple times on challenge difficulty with matchmaking and have zero problems fran thanks for standing up for the people here we aint the vocal minoritythe vocal minority is the small amount of people who will actually be able to get 8 people together to play this rage was hands down better then rage 2 if all you need is doom gunplay youll like it but thats all it has going for it i beat the whole game including all areas in 15hrs though i did enjoy the gun play it wasnt nearly enough the entire time i played it i couldnt wait to get back to playing days gone in my book rage 2 6 days gone 8 andrea pokemon animal crossing luigis mansion 3 links awakening fire emblem mario maker astral chain any new reveals come on guessing the embargoed multiplayer game is gears cool to know its a good game oxenfree was fantastic not because of the humor but because of the scifi plot fran is looking extra handsome today i like nick being serious from time to time its dope ey fran shut up and let other people talk and actually finish what they want to say stop with the constant interruptions youve been doing that ever since you work at kf tim was right about rage 2 lol ive never heard nick talk like that about a game theres a games pundit somewhere in him lol you guys are insane this game is fucking awesome that gta like game looks like a cross of gta and commandos on pc i got bored of division 2 real quick ubisoft should have matchmaking in division 2 purely because they advertised it and people probably bought the game with the intention to use this advertised feature i switched to pc mid last year playing games in true 1440p 90144fps depending on the game ofcourse changed everything for me im so glad we have fran on this show our pc champion im sort of with fran on the topic of matchmaking for the raid my arguments would be 1 if youre using lfg tools to form groups or just meeting people by the helicopter the majority of raiders likely arent with friends only youre effectively just joining randoms anyway it has the same outcome as matchmaking except its less convenient the reason to not have matchmaking is that you cant vet your teammates but lets be real people are not vetting each other when they join groups via discord or pick people up at the helicopter most raiders are not inspecting each others gear for the right talents before they get started and although gs is more or less an empty number in terms of endgame power the raid has a requirement of 490 anyway 2 it wouldnt take away the ability to form groups prior to launching the raid it would be an option and hey if those attempts go to shit those people can go form groups instead there would be arguments for sure but l i couldnt give 2 shits about rage 2 but i thoroughly enjoyed that discussion especially when nick jumped in the conversation rage is really fun and very pleasing to the eye gunplay is rock solid glad i bought it etc but check this out avalancheid need a better algorithm for npc names ive met like 20 people called bruise armbar already 6 hours in this deserves more viewslove andrea should look into the wow raid matchmaking it works really well and could totally work in the division at some point andrea the base ps4 and base xbox one ran doom 2016 at 60fps dont give me that crap stop talking when you dont know what youre talking about also doom looked far better graphically at 60fps than rage 2 does this game looks last gen nick needs to have his eyes checked everyone knows rage 2 is ugly on consoles just go look at digital foundrys report on it andy is spot on about it god forbid andrea lets fran have an opinion without making him feel like a dumbass for it your wrong thats a bad take like jeez chill out when you guys were talking about metacritic i really find it annoying how you act like gamespot and ign are the only sites that matter many of these other sites are far more reputable than them especially when you have ign hiring people who plagerize or gamespot has people who dont even finish games like the girl who reviewed days gone ill take easy allies or acg over those two sites any day fran is 100 right about match making yes you will fail but in failing you will find 2 or 3 players you can count on then 4 then 5 etc thats how it worked with me and destiny 5 or so failed raids later i have a team of 7 people ive gone through 3 of d2 raids and all of d1 multiple times give us match making how is any different then using the d2 app besides being less of pain in the ass guys this show is almost done for i honestly dont see how theyre keeping so many people afloat when theyve only gotten like 290000 views in two weeks nick and andy should review more games kfafforstreamys kinda funny games sponsored by division 2 damn you and the splinter cell jokes um people afk and bounce even when you use sites to match up for raids all the time give people the option to matchmake i just finished the game today you can see it on my channel and i have to agree the ending is terrible now we know the real reason why greg hates days gone his top review sources are ign and gamespot lol andrea is one of the most frustrating people to watch listen to ever she is so condescending and shitty about others opinions and she can never accept someone elses point of view makes the show hard to watch sometimes bring back jared why did they put daddy scarpino in the the corner let him out to party doggie dog lol 221 lol having beef with metacritic is just silly props to nick and andy on the rage 2 impressions kfafforstreamys also imagine if nick was a voice actor in a far cry game thatd be too legit it always seems like andrea gets annoyed of fran very easily so for the first 20 minutes we have to listen to nick talk off camera while greg and andrea just sits there with little input why b jeez let nick talk about the game he played without interrupting him every 5 seconds the combat is unbelievably fun but the sidemissions are really repetitive worth waiting for a sale on this one but still overall a pretty good game idk why andrea was so against having options if people want to opt in to a bad idea let them nick summed up my exact reason for avoiding rage 2 the cheese of the game is really cringey and not in an enjoyable way it feels more like that kid in school trying to be funny and cool but is really just a douche fran i love the perspective that you bring to the kinda funny shows i would love you more if you stopped talking over people with what you think they are going to say while they are explaining something i want to pull my hair out when you this because it feels rude and unprofessional i hope you take this feedback into consideration love what you and the rest of the kinda funny gang do i agree with fran about having the option to match make on the division 2 raid even if i know it would be frustrating i would like to have an option to try and get the experience and get to know some of the encounters and mechanics in the raid that way if get really invested in seeing it through its entirety ill have a better feel for it rage 2 sucks boring and repetitive gameplay oh rwbysoft you should have asked them earlier fran great points but please more concise tend to be longwinded another piece of silverware purchased by citeh with their oil money congratulations rage 2 is a remake of a better game called mad max comparing everything to god of war is getting very very old enjoy games for what they are not what you want them to be days gone is all around a way better game than rage 2 i beat rage 2 last night but i found the story and the open world very bland i understand open worlds repeat missions or objectives but this game did nothing different even the 2 types of big enemies was just copied again and again then the ending was garbage shame as i loved the gameplay time codes for mobile 000007 start 000632 rage 2 judges week impressions 002828 rocket arena 003859 super market shriek 004500 the sojourn 004905 the creature in the well 005401 afterparty 005848 ad robinhood 005947 american fugitive 010411 dauntless 011243 the division 2 update the raid im really enjoying rage its clearly nothing special and i wasnt expecting anything really that special but the shooting is so satisfying im in the small minority that really enjoyed the original game and i think this is a very fun albeit repetitive sequel its exactly the fun nonsense game that i pour hours in whilst watching shows and listening to podcasts i can feel the e3 energy they had good vibes in this episode yoooo the kfaf guys do better impressions of games than the actual panel does give those guys a raise heres your weekly reminder to remind everyone gregg love fallout 76 and recommend to buy it and then said anthem is worth 60 dollars of your money with no shame on his face frans shirt reminds me of the crucible for some reason rage 2 doesnt have hdr support on pro and it shows its 2019 ffs wheres the hdr andy for rage 2 turn off depth of field and chromatic aberration if its an option on console not sure im playing on pc depth of field especially makes everything look blurry night and day difference its weird hearing nick review a game i would love more i love the game once you get flight and can get to the battles i skipped pretty much every single bit of sophomoric lore and butt plug humor bit in the game how can you have a problem with metacritic they just aggregate scores its a pretty useful gauge as to the general feeling towards a game thank you so much nick i always love the rare occasion you appear on gamescast i respect your opinion and i decided to pick up far cry new dawn based on you and frans input are you ready to rage oh yeah gamescom i come is it worth it getting the first game on ps3 i really hope this is les empty than mad max diverse i hate that word it already feels like its gonna be a very rainbow game ive never played rage but this one looks so good is this crysis or rage how come fallout games cant look this good bethesda enough cartoony fallouts theyre the worst in the franchise i cant wait to review this at gamescom ok ok this has me interested it looks like theyve taken some inspiration from there past games and improved upon that the games im most looking forward to in order red dead redemption 2 the last of us 2 rage 2 life is strange 2 ghost of tsushima spiderman cyberpunk 2077 days gone looks to be a very good replacement for those not interested in fallout 76 and the direction that instalment of fallout is taking if the game holds up to the standard of this trailer then it should be a quality game only worry would be avalanche and their input into the story missions their games are good but the story is always lacking mad max was a good game but could have been great but everything looks positive so far looks really good why has rage been turned into borderlands in the end of the video oh my god hhhhh i dont recall anything from the first game seems cool how about the graphics when is it coming this screams mad max d how was rage 1 i never played that game will there be a version on steam can you pls make co op in story mode nice dlctho rise of the ghosts was betterin my opinionkinda funny that its that dlcwhich we got for free how does rage 2 look so sharp here i have it all blury and fuzzy i turned off motion blur chromatic abberation and depth of field and it helped a bit but the game is still way not as good as in this vid i got a radeon vega 56 028 what song is playing the video well thanx bethesda i can not even finish the game rage 2 cause the last mission doesnt trigger and i see more people having that issue i read in some comments i have to remove the game and reinstall it and here is the problem it has a huge update with it that takes like a hour so no thanks if i bought it at full price i would be ffing mad btw we are now many months after release its december now and still didnt fixed that bug shame on you this is like a dlc what if you wanted people to forget your mistake but god was like remember when you ruined doom skeletons what a boring enemy bethesdas always late nowadays remember the time when they still have the chance to fix fallout 76 sucks just like the rest of the crappy games you guys make fallout 5 please you guys can make a dlc and more but you cant fix the mask of the dark brother hood really your terrible bethnet launcher program is like a virus and so are you this dlc is 4 black friday one thing bethesda can do to earn the respect of the fan base is to finally increase the mod space of fallout 4 on xbox one by 2 or more gigs sixteen tymes the terror have a option for fallout 4 where if you dont have a mod it will automatically download the mods and uninstall the new mods you downloaded or have a option for that rage 2 is a amazing game especially with the new content i enjoyed every second of the game and there was so many places to explore i was constantly finding a new area question marked im nearing the end of the campaign and still got 2 dlcs to play loved all the powers and upgrading guns the enemys were awesome each type seemed to have a cool look vibe to them fuck off its always pk hours how do i buy that waiting for sceleton narcopritins well that looks next level shit do you remember the day you sold out your game is shit 17 hours in and its fucked and i cant play you are a sorry fucking pile let me tell you embarrassing really but im not some big game reviewer so fuck me right no fuck you i will spend every moment of my fucking life telling people not to buy this 60 piece of shit i wasted my hard earned money on yeah how about focus on this and stop sending mod breaking updates to fallout 4 who is playing this crap id have to split with beth beth is just a stain dear bethesda thank you for making elsweyr online also thank you for destroying the elder scrolls lore i am also extremely happy that you are now a extremely greedy company obsessed with money im also extremely excited that you are going to use the new shit engine for the new elder scrolls 6 i hope one day i get to work for a company as obsessed with money as you i also cannot wait to sell my car so that i can buy all your useless pathetic microtransactions also bring back horse armour please and of course thank you for banning god howard from coding his own games since 2006 youre a true inspiration for the gaming industry thank you 3000 3000 glitches coming soon to es6 it is absolutely fucking hilarious how fallout 76 is losing huge quantities of money to the outer worlds lmfao enter the towers oh god kill the guardians oh fuck almost heaven west virginia blue ridge bethesda is worse than ea dont forget dont give these fuckers a damn penny son yo tom howard howbout you give cool content to creation club every month and give people in fallout 1st 50 percent off on creation currency it just works no news on fallout 76 huh bethesda you pieces of human shit forgot this game existed got it for free played it for about 2 hours then deleted it a total rip off after buying the deluxe edition youd expect all dlcs to be included lesson learned do not buy deluxe editions from bethesda spooky before christmas i cant remember the last game that disappointed me more than rage 2 i think thats only because i wasnt dumb enough to buy fallout 76 though kinda late to the party dont you think plz prey 2 favouritegame tom howard i swear if you gjys introduce online or micro transactions to the es6 you will loose your whole following and your company will die meh we celebrate christmas in november anyway i cant even get this dlc bc when i tried to get rage coins in the microsoft store just so i could go back to the game and buy the fucking dlc the coins i bought didnt even show up i didnt have any before then bc i never used the ingame store i tried restarting my console checked to see if the purchase went through it did and am currently reinstalling the entire fucking game i cant send a support ticket bc i lost the info for my bethesdanet password a week or 2 ago and desptie sending two password reset emails i still havent gotten any replies any other suggestions am i the only person with this problem bring back server hopping on fallout bethesda i am here to tell you that the best way to release a holiday event is not to start working on it on the holiday what you do you see is you work on the content beforehand before the holiday not on it that way it is capable of being released on the holiday the content is based off of i thought youd like to know or maybe if your intention is to become bankruptliterally every recent action youve done has suggested this then disregard this message happy halloween hehe i bet using the sword will be satisfying looks better than the original game buy yeah a little late for halloween arent we whats with all the negativity toward the game the fighting mechanics are great i want a rage 3 looks freaking awesome congrats on beating ea at being the most shittiest company to consumers thats a dlc fuck off empty game looks like perfect game for vr sword fighting shooter whats the name of the song reminds so much of painkiller played the crap out of that game back in the day can i sue bethesda for not giving a refund on my 100 dollar subscription cuz its broken and my exclusive helmet with included mold in it which is a health hazard how does it feel to ban players in 76 for doing your job in the community bethesda 044 dovahkiin teleport to rage 2 world if this free if you have the delux version of the game i wonder if these retarded pieces of shit realize that theyre actually becoming one of the worst companies in history this looks and feels like the autistic version of doom eternal packet into 2 hours or so oh look another bethesda game i will never play i will never buy a game from your shitty company ever again fuck bethesda ill hope you go down the drain asap idk the sword just makes me wanna play shadow warrior doom eternals lookin pretty good so far damn bethesda how much do you charge to watch the launch trailer is there a paywall for every step you take in the dlc rip bethesda you will be remembered anyone know if sword can taken back to base game world only way ill buy it this game franchise is the epitome of identity crisis ripoff version of doom you guys realize halloween was last month right totally mistimed the realease of this lol rage 2 wasteland of thives looking good boycottbethesda it looks like a another event for killing floor 2 lol bless king hashem he makes new dlc and games hashem be with id and avalanche studios bethesda and zenimax rage 2 is sorta like that annoying girl in class who always says lol im so random i thought that first mutant talking had emperor pilafs voice i mean ill take it even though halloween passed would have been better if they had entered the real of doom guy i just bought this and im so excited when did rage come out again if this wasnt exclusively on the mtx store and was included in the original deluxe edition i would have gotten this it really is truly impressive how much effort is being put into dlc for a game that nobody cares about boo bethesda is evil seems reasonably priced compared to shadowkeep for destiny 2 3999 my ass this gave me a lot of skyrim vibes this looks better than the rise of the ghosts expansion is this going to be released unfinished and buggy people are too harsh on this game theres no other game out there with better shooting mechanics other than doom 2016 better late than never i appreciate it the halloween jokes in this comment section funny asf but not gonna lie this looks pretty cool is this another game for bethesda to fuck up pack of retards working in that place i keep forgetting that this game even came out this year playing the new dlc lovin it having fun with sword turning everything into chop suey yeah this is definitely a halloween dlc that was not finished in time for halloween kinda sad id buy rage 2 on steam if i didnt have to make a bethesda account take it out please i loved the first rage a lot fix it bethesda please i wanna face that smug cliff looks pretty cool oh hell yeah im getting this i miss the racing from original that needs to be a dlc in the new one an actual race complete with upgradesboostersflames greedthesda and zenistacks at it again with more lackluster content oh boy played it finished it with all the trophies in about two hours its the same style of frenetic combat repeated six times over and if youve maxed out your weapons and abilities then this dlc should pose little challenge seeing a big skeleton try to drop kick you is amusing at first but quickly loses its lustre im glad it only cost 755 aud but am still somewhat disgusted that it was not included with the original deluxe edition i suppose they pulled the same shit with rage 1 deluxe edition not including the scorchers dlc you guys should really just give up on this series at this point wanna see how many people will buy this shit looks actually kind of cool and fun too bad the main game is a mediocre slog would you like an unpolished dlc on halloween or a late polished dlc better late then never make an infinite ammo cheat so i dont run out of ammo since i dont use most weapons as im scared ill run out of ammo when fighting a boss pls bethesda listen to the fans like this post so bethesda will see this comment shalloween ok this actually looks awesome unlike the first dlc missed halloween by a far window still im thankful id and avalanche are still supporting this game despite its mixed reception and not so great sales rage 2 was a disappointment nice to see theyre continuing that with the dlc just make a good solid interesting wasteland tale minus all this wacky shite that destroys the atmosphere and tone thats why you never use internet explorer to upload a video game looks cool and i want to play it however the price is quite high i spent 60 on nfs heat instead fuck you bethesda never again looks more fun than cod dont give bethesda any money guys honest this is a waste of money really i finished in nightmare in 55min with all achivs total disappointment that sword tho3 amazing dlc for christmas thanks guys 3 i love this game got 100 of the trophies including all the dlc my only regret is not waiting for all the dlc before playing would have been way better thanks for reminding me i was still subbed to bethesda from when they were a decent company ill fix that now people still play this game looks like the scraps from doom eternal nobody cares about try hard the game and you guys wonder why you didnt sell well about a month late i love this content but you guys seem to be always miss the mark game was 710 but this looks cool thanks why couldnt this just be a part of the game fun to watch yall falling for it again folks popcorn why am i still sub to this channel i feel like this is releasing 1 month too late happy halloween everyone you had me at magic sword this looks really fun definitely be playing this weekend is this an out of season halloween joke oh people disliked cause it came out after halloween how petty just in time for october 46th bit late for halloween but this actually looks like fun im guessing this was ment for halloween but got delayed this is great but its coming out the moment its out of season 1 bl3 did it better and thats from a guy that hasnt even played bl3 yet 2 your late 3 wth is going on over at bethesda why does everyone hate this game i really liked it i dont care what anyone else says aaaaaaaand another 15gb update that were being forced to download even if we dont own the dlc awesome me and my 2mbits are pretty fucking excited thanks bethesda what a let down this game was dlc for those who was drunk or just need more halloween ok that looks like a lot of fun lets hope its not a flop so many bandwagon jumpers quick to type their hate comments anyways the trailer actually looks pretty cool ill actually play the dlc before i make my judgement awesome i get to play the game on game pass and its new dlc interesting idea cool sword but i really wished the dlcs would improve in ways that the main game was critiqued for lacking in like the storycampaignmissions and linear sections cross play please and its already cracked and on the scene not that anyone cares or plays this kids see skeletons and they think halloween bitches this is about the macabre not samhains holiday they only read the comments and want to jump on the bandwagon millennials stop this bullshit launch tes vi already forr fucks sake honestly this game is a great fps but lacks narrative id really love if it was like a proper rpg with more interaction with characters every settlement is just the same copy and paste with little to do furthermore they couldve made it possible to join rival gangs to betray or takedown both lots of potential lost in this simple quick cash grab that a mistake bethesda cant make a good game its impossible 76 tho i thought rage was supposed to be a scifi game just what nobody wanted well done bethesda another fail that magical sword basically makes you genji from overwatch that pansy ass cyber ninja eh how much is this ill give it a go switch version for the love of anything holy woah this thanksgiving dlc looks kinda scary tho you guys gonna lie your ass off like you did for fallout 76 wat was the first expansion anyway never knew there was a second one let alone a first one and the crowd goes mild dear bethesda i am letting you know that you have became the next ea where you only care for greed why should i buy another game from you when theres indie games thats far more fun than your latest titles we as gamers will no longer support you thank you for the awesome earlier games you have created but you have lost your way i hope you as a company gets fecked in the buttt good bye lol they missed halloween by a few weeks trash dead game from a dead company isnt it to late for halloween 15 days too late for halloween this game is garbage 1 almost all the women were so ugly 2 they could have repopulated the liberated outposts with ally npcs i completely forgot about the game i completely forgot about this game this not fit to rage 2 this looks sick i wish i had the game sell your game at 10 retards fuck off bethesda stop working on this game and delete or fix fallout 76 sword thats cool we need mod support is this free if u bought the preorder edition a little bit late to the party but ok mannnn i can feel they trying but i so dont care at all idk i loved rage one rage 2 is just too silly and bright colored for the sake of it like they tried combining mad max and borderlands good game bethesda a little late for halloween dlc but i dont care ill take it also for some odd reason it has a borderlands vibe going on bruh no one gives a shit about this the rage 2 is awesome and i love it it is one of the best httpsyoutubemdcr0cm4ilm needs more smug cliff 810 you alll suuuuccckk you think we are gonna buy that sht no one not even rage 2 fans bethesda probably gonna release a useless broken rage 2 subscription plan for rage 2 players for 100 oblivion much oh cool a sword too late just in time for halloween 2020 i forgot this exists lmao everyone still hates you bethesda halloween already passed this is a fallout 76 2 hasnt halloween ended already fuck you bethesda oh yeah this game exists fallout 76 just leaveing this here third like a month fucking late from halloween nice game tes 6 first seems like a mix of half life 2 doom and mass effect i love this game i really do and l dlc including idk why it got so much had press the map is loaded with shit to do i find the map in days gone to be far more empty than this i love that game also but still theres plenty to do in this game powers and weapons are awesome you get about 6 fucking skill trees the driving in rage 2 looks a lot easier than the mako in mass effect rage 2 is open world doom without the demons i still think the driving in the first rage was some of the best ive seen which made the driving in this a huge disappointment i did still enjoy this game and think it did some fun things like the slam but it did seem like a step down from the first game the driving looks like a sped up version of mad max with the same lack of traction but 100 times the obstacles of driving across a dried ocean basin that was dope this was a great rum and very entertaining watch danejerus was great runner and awesome and funny narrator couch was great too and host was fine too really want to see dane running this and other games again preferably at gdq again however if he isnt probably will watch him on twitch i finished the story of rage 2 and did a bit of the side content and honestly i much preferred the original rage this game feels like a mashup between mad max and rage without the fun of either i think he uses the bfg too early because the enemy doesnt have a hitbox till it finishes his drop in animation runner introduction starts at 355 run starts at 431 couch commentary is provided by waifu and maxylobes aneternalenigma is host who is this anarchist what does this game have to do with anarchy make this guy a regular and give him a promotion while youre at it i got a trailer for rage 2 before this he does sound like a damn hospital hhaha make this guy the ceo of ign immediately whats with the voice cant wait to play this looks so much better than the first game this will be my food until borderlands 3 comes out what a great year for games man i hope my rx 580 can handle this yay it has microtransactions irish homosexual dwarf reviews game what a guy i dont know if im the only person that notices this but doesnt rage 2 reminds you a lot of borderlands this dude has so much energy in his voice love it so used to ppl sound like listening to a undead corpse talk has anyone seen anywhere anything about enemies respawning or not i hate when i get to the later stages in a game and the world is a ghost town ala rage 1 anyone know if they have fixed this in the 2nd iteration im not buying this next will there be any dialoguequests to speak of in this game or will it be 98 fighting looks like borderlands but not cartoonish the game looks blurry and trashy graphics are inadequate 114 the only thing i hate about avalanche game engine is the graphics is too soft blurry not sharp i own just cause 4 and generation zero both have same graphic style already preordered so excited just cause rage mad max combined oh yeah wish the first game came with rage 2 you should do every ign video man ilove these dudes voice such a shame hes working with ign this is basically doom goes on vacation to earth personally dont like the narrator which is weird because the comment section seems to love him find him annoying what is wrong with that girl the love child of mad max and doom he sounds like a fking hospital best part of this trailer in my opinion plz dont be red dead with a dune buggy plz dont be red dead with a dune buggyopen world scares me a little where is the buffalo we need radiation will there be animaltype mutants as well excluding dogs mad max doom just cause rage 2 hellllllllloooooooo i almost choked on a noodle bro when does the review embargo end cant wait bl3 and rage 2 look awesome what i love about these open world games are the towns that you visit its great to see wellspring and gunbarrel in the sequel im kind of surprised subway town didnt make it in there regardless its gonna be awesome cant effing wait for this i need a new single player redeemer for the misery i was in anthem ugh what a disappointment that was after all the years of waiting i feel like this is spoilers but i cant stop better run well and respawing bad guys thanks for making this rage 2 looks really fun huge and interesting loved the first one and this seems right up my alley ill be playing this a lot untill doom eternal this just makes me wish we could get a sequel to that mad max game that came out a few years back i loved mad max and i had love for doom this concept seems to integrate these two different games very well anarchist guide do they want to abolish hierarchy and install worker control of the mop the weeysttleeaand is this a game for ipad lol holy crap is that 1 radio dj pete donaldson doing the vo if it is that is a cool random surprise even if its not this dude is funny definitely picking up this game i cant wait that voices kills my ears 433 it does sound like a hospital i never thought of that he sounds like a hospital okay that one got a chuckle of course its an australian wait is it junkrat that is talking mad max on steroids is this rage 2 or mad max mate i am so confused right now if this game had coop borderlands 3 would be dead on arival i wanted to buy doom 2016 but i think i will for for this instead game looks awful sometimes it will be fail inb4 ign gives it a 610 game is looking great so far this guy is igns best employee cant wait theyre definitely naaaat inmortal anyone else thinks the ui looks a bit weird who else is buying this i am this is going to be epic i thought this was a reupload but its not damn i sure hope this guy makes a lot more of these videos its the best this is a great video i almost laughed up a lung cant wait for rage 2 looks so much fun and funny has hell thanks ign where are the skags i literally have no idea what hes talking about okay this one looks fun that borderlands 3 gameplay presentation though only reason i clicked on this was hoping for this guy fallout borderlands then the more i see of this game the more im convinced theyre just trying to remake borderlands without the borderlands art style when out rage 1 was sooooo underrated great gameplay solid action poor story 7510 ign this man deserves an oscar whats the name of this game httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqwrowad3kat131s im so hyped for this its look like doom but open world i was here before 200 views who else here hows the game peeps this game seems kind of boring is the game cool the new borderlands im hype asf no steam no thanks wow what a trailer nice this does look really good why do i need this game when cdpr is releasing cyber punk 2077 whoa danny brown track for a game ad nice borderlands meets doom meets any of the good fallout games meets mad max if borderlands 3 does come out its screwed rage 2 and outer worlds are going to be out first and doing the exact same things damnthis and the outer worlds both look really cool nothing wrong with a lil good ol mindless fun the first one was ok not as good as the hype but damn this one looks fun like borderlands but with the gore turned way the fuck up bethesda you do know that after the bullshit that you named fall out 76 this game will have a really low initial return right cause if you dont then you are indeed as stupid and greedy as we realized from fall out 76 i dont know i feel like the first game took itself more seriously open world me sigh uuuuuuuh borderlands much because its has uuuuuuh cars and uuuuuh guns and uuuuiiiih its in a wasteland uhhhhhhhhh whats the song fucking suck ass this is not rage any more quality reviewer nuff said not usually into aaa games as the publishers are greedy twats but this actually looks like a really good game the farcry games do open world nicely but the actual gameplay is really boring due to it being grounded in reality more or less this game looks like it was intentionally designed to be fun first and foremost and they built the game around that which will probably work out well for it as fun is sorely lacking in most games today where the focus is on psychologically manipulating the players into spending more and more money look when gmanlives says hes addicted to killing in this game you know its gonna be a great game technically gta v is extremely repetitive in my book but that doesnt stop people from dishing out money still so as long as combat is exiting and keeps me on my toes ill be hooked far cry five had none of that and put me to sleep after seeing recent footage of the game the gunplay doesnt look that good anymore they have removed alot of the blood and gore details on consoles there is no blood splatter on walls or floors after you shoot an enemy and everything looks really half assed i dont think ima be buying this one either all you have to do is watch recent gameplay of it at a slower speed like 025x and you will see how truly shity it looks and how they are trying to scam everyone if fallout mad max and new dawn had a threesome than this is what happens at least youre real about it its on steam game looks bland boring and repetitive in the wrong way the tv arena was garbage in first game and looks garbage here toobethesda store exclusive will never buy xd complains about doing the same thing over againwants to do the same thing over again i really dug the first one but this looks like effin boredomlands i think they should give you a review code id planned on passing on the game not liking the first but your preview has made me reconsidermight even give rage 1 another chance can we see the body of the ranger bethesda confirmed in a tweet that rage 2 fallout 76 and doom eternal and wolfenstein youngblood are coming to steam serious sam clone if you ask me but hey this is just me lets hope alavanche not use same driving phyisc as just cause 3 to many launchers like seriously beths steam epic origin gog batnet upiss the original rage was pretty generic shit do you have to climb radio towers i was looking forward to this right up until you said bethesda launcher well fuck that for a game of soldiers hmm they should get rid of all the rainbow color bs and just let you paint the walls floors and ceiling with blood brains and guts plus some glory kills would be the sheeeeeit this looks like bulletstorm borderlands dna spliced with rage which always had a bunch of potential imo just a bit undercooked with a shit ending and for some reason ppl mauled it with mondo negativity fuck knows quite why all you want to do was find something else to kill but you dont like that the game seems to be going around and just wiping out outposts and killing a load of guys over and over too bad its a bethesda store exlusive theyle probably put it on steam store after they see it doing poorly copypaste popamole shit looks like youll do most things in the game in the first few hours then rinse repeat 100 times over i like to blow things up and kill things i work a lot so to turn on my console and get to do them things will suit me down to a tee if all you do is play games everyday for hours then i can understand why it would be repetitive good preview and thanks for your insight on the game i will be picking it up look i didnt even give a shit about rage 1 and im not that into open world games but everything you showed there as far as combat goes reminds me of doom 2016 and bulletstorm in the best of ways this preview has made me go from meh to wishlist and ill consider buying the first one as long as its not as bad its only 1 right now on greenmangaming so why not edit id love it for it to come out on steam for a plethora of reasons but i certainly want to support the id soft games another classy review gggmanlives who does not like the original rage i seriously have never heard anyone say that and i am a huge gamer i hang out with mostly gamers and my fiance is a diehard gamer like me we both love love love rage doom 93 doom 2 doom 3 and doom 2016 finally id was not attempting to be political quite frankly i am so tired of forced polutical agendas everywhere i am happy that id told the gaming journalist that kept attempting to force their npc pc nonsense that they were flat out wrong they literally and repetedly had to tell the game journalist that they are not political not implying the video maker did anything wrong at all you would think after the apex fiasco proving that games journalists are nothing but activists only wishing to sow discord in gaming they would stop have they or even sodderland misspelled he does not warrant a google search for proper spelling even bothered to appologise to us after calling us all bigots homophobic uneducated and a thats kind of like waiting in line for a rollercoaster only to have someone else take your place no you still got to play the game you got to ride the rollercoaster what you didnt get is the photo from the ride thats a thoroughly stupid comparison you had the game in your hands and you played it you didnt watch someone else play it i liked the first rage as well so they took the ubisoft template with the open world ugh surprised to learn this is utilizes avalanches apex engine and not id tech it looks stunning and seems like it runs and plays amazing as well rage 1 was one of the worst games ive ever played i loved the first one as well did they get rid of the crafting system my only question is are they going to ignore the first game i really liked the first one yeah i saw its shortcomings but it was intriguing none the less i dont like the fact that you play as a ranger in this one in the first one you played as a survivor from space and when you get to the second town people are looking at you with suspicion i wish that idea was in this game but more fully developed im still excited for this title looks like a better far cry 5 then far cry 5 no way someone else liked the first rage i loved the first one and was very happily surprised when they announced the second one at one point you complain about doing the same things over and over such as clearing outposts and then say you could replay the combat sections over and over am i missing something here or did you get someone else to write this i hope the rebar thrower gun will come back but it probly wont the most satisfying fps gun ive ever played with rage 1 isnt all that different 3 hours so you played the full game this game is my mouse and keyboard have never been good in any driving game its not donald trump id software are far from left wing 330 made loosum look like that cunt kathleen kennedydammit i completely forgot that this game is 30 years after rage so that means loosum is an old lady fuck you bethesda from the looks of it all the women will be bland derp face so i will skip this and avalanche is making it so rage 1 was good shooting shit vehicle combat rushed ending and lots of hot girls to look at httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3u8lxabkqne so now arcady game mechanics is fluid lmao people using terms wrong nowadays you can have realistic weighty game mechanics and still be fluid the fluidity is just the flow of how the pattern of movement is consistent meh abother mediocre game at best whats with the coins shooting out of dying enemies looks kinda rediculous almost as bad as the numbers flying out in so many other games i would much rather have some gnarly gore effects so it is a better rage with an endboss from what i saw it seems the atmosphere from the first game is gone this just reminds me of doom that how repetitive and mundane games have become great tirles you expect alit from are taking save positions what should be great has become stagnant mad max felt openworldy in the wrong reasons the gameplay and combat wasnt enjoyable enough to keep me interested after doing the same kinds of outpost attacks over and over again if the shooting in this really is as smooth as doom i could see that problem being fixed and being able to repeatedly find more stuff to kill would be super fun the max payne 2 section with kaufman and his cleaning crew coming out of the elevator best shit ever looks like farcry 6 retarded edition hmm seems like the open world aspect might get in the way if not fleshed out and doesnt just do the whole climb radio tower take outpost repeat gameplay of most of them gun combat looks pretty fun though bethesda launcher ah fuck not them too i wish they had just made the game more like the first rage and fleshed it out a bit and longer hated the racing the corridor combat missions were awesome dont like the open world stuff i still play the first rage from time to time its one of those games i still come back to at least once a year so its not an understatment that i was very excited for a sequal but the sad part is that this version of rage 2 looks nothing of what made the first rage special and great this time around it looks more of a openworld bulletstorm futuristic military shooter where every enemy is just an obstacle in the previous entry it was the dusty post apocalyptic atmosphere that really set the tone everything from weapons vehicles cities and enemy characteristics there was no guns blazing every enemy felt alive there was no super powers it was you and a gun in this scary world they really took this game into a new call of duty type direction and thats not what rage is one word broborderlands not buying because only on bethesda launcher not after fallout 76 to summarize a solid id software shooter in an open world that avalanche went kinda lazy and safe about though given their experience and expertise its not necessarily a bad thing fair 644 they better not put doom eternal exclusively to the bethesda launcher or i will start rip tearing i thought the original rage seemed rather unfinished and i was mostly right i saw potential but it was not a great game the combat in this one looks like it could be fun though so i am willing to give it a trywhen it is on discount ha rage was a huge disappointment i forced myself to ply far beyond the point where i was bored hoping itd get better it never did this seems like it has more but just more generic openworld game features maybe theres some cool hook well find out about but with the new metro coming this doesnt look like itll be taking up my limited gaming time even while hes telling us the negative things about the game its playing in the background and looks super fun so while his points are valid you kinda cant agree with them atleast imo it looks like a glorified post apocalypse doom a big fan of the channel but i dont know mate your preview videos just seen watered down versions of your reviews it almost doesnt feel like its your voice hadouken shoots a fire ball that looks more like he just dashes up stiff arms the guy these videos have become an important part of my presleep ritual your accent and tone lend perfectly to asmr lol thanks for your effort and work bud from london uk i remember those days playinh ragedamn they were good honestly the races in rage 1 were one of my favorite parts i already played borderlands 2 if only you could actually shoot donald trump in this game something about this new art style the game is taking doesnt really appeal to me coupled with a bethesda launcher i think ill have to pass on this one at least one fps actually looks fun coming from a major dev okay now i kinda wish they stuck with the original rage art style the first rage had good aspects lol wow another far cry game i dunno about this the guns look like shitatleast the first game had some throwback guns like the ak and sawedoff all i care about is friday really love your straightforward honest reviews hope you are enjoying the cash luckily there are plenty of other old school youtube channels that make good content about games i like seems like nice game so thats a real shame bethesda bury it with they own launcher i know exactly what you mean with having more feels less this happens to me frequently with games like the far cry franchise or borderlands im not saying theyre bad games they are really good but i personally get bored in a open world where you have to do a lot of similar missions the coop will be tits looks like rage and far cry are trying to fill a scifi adventure rpg that borderlands had been supplying with borderlands 2 and pre sequel people do not seem to complain about it and ik id are awesome at that usually but i find the gunplay to look sloppy like there is no recoil the weapon are ugly and the sound design isnt that impactful what do you guys think i loved the hell out of first one from time to time redownload it to finish it over again but i was skeptical about this one until you said combat is like doom 2016 with superpowers im hyped now thank you dude only thing i hope at least they put it in game so we can learn what happened to our mc from the first game i really wanna know because rages ending felt like it was incomplete this looks like boringlands without the cell shading style looks nice but metro exodus already got my attention exelent insight i wanted to hear about combat and if your impression was good then im in this is doom bro good luck selling this shit on the bethesda launcher this game looks fucking sick it probably wont sell well so wait a week after launch and buy it for 50 off literally looks nothing like donald trump i thought the first was underated cant wait oh great another game that turned all their female characters ugly to pander to sjws and feminists once again full of left wing propaganda no buy for me i liked the original rage except for the vehicle drives i would normally have picked this one up after the first discount but being available on yet another launcher is one hurdle too much for me 147 well he looks likei was going to say fat elvis having a love child with trump and hulk hogan but guy fieri and trump having a one night stand shouls have released it in 2020with both doom and rage 2people will certainly go with doom and forget about iy im gonna wait on this one specially after what bethesda did wit 76 i know avalanche studios made the game tho greedy bethesda are behind them pulling the strings which is cancer to the gaming world at the moment watch thisshows new weapons httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvyamkanncsq most excited game of 2019 is for me im only concerned with extreme repetiveness just like in the mad max gamemaybe this is just a skin with fps guns mad max was crazy repetitiveride 100 meters climb out kill something ride another 100 meters climb out kill something ride another 100 meters kill something this bugs me this donald trump shit is making me madthere is no donald trump in this game and was never intended as the game has been a few years in the making allready 30 years after the first one on the website it says 20 years after the first one is it me or is pc gaming getting uh divided with all the launchers people gotta use to play specific shit makes me kinda glad to be on console we dont have the most hi end graphics or mod support least on the ps4 depending on the game in question even has it but everything is together minus the console exclusive games like sunset overdrive being only on xbox hopefully though the game will be neato didnt know walker talks huh i kinda like the silent protagonist like seriously pretty much every game nowadays is a first person shooter open world pseudorpg narrativedriven game with really pretty graphics i mean they are turning out a lot of good products within that format but its really all gotten to be pretty predictable and vanilla that being said this game does look cool like a combination of far cry doom and mad max not bad inspirations to have 1 no review copies 2 bethesda laucnher exclusives 3 fallout 76 and ignorant publisher attitude to so many failures i dont care at this point how good this yet another open world game is bethesad lost me as a customer huh weird his voice actor strangely sounds the generic spunky video game protagonist voice it feels like its just different enough to have that same weird flaire but also sounds so disgustingly similar probably wont get the game anyways though doesnt seem that appealing hard pass this looks lightspeed better than the past couple farcry games im sad about the bethesda launcher only but im actually starting to see the flaws with steam at least form steam reviews ace combat 7 is getting review bombed into oblivion right now and i know it is a decent game on pc game looks fun as hell but im really sad that they said there isnt going to be mutiplayer i dont really like playing games alone even just a coop mode would be awesome when will a great fps with classic multiplayer come out i miss killzone halo 3 old gears wheres that kind of multiplayer these days dont day cod or battlefield im going to be highly disappointed if there arent any reuben sandwiches in the wasteland i enjoyed rage a lot was really looking forward to rage 2 but considering the generic open world repetitiveness im a bit worried still probably wont hesitate to pick it up been looking forward to release for too long cheers for your as always well informed opinion appreciate it man man i really wish they didnt double down on the open world aspect of it it feels more repetitivegeneric with those standard open world missions plus im afraid it will end up with just a lot of empty and uninspired space for driving shooting looks good and the glitchy gay bar aesthetic is pretty nice but id rather have them work on the flawed points of the first game another triple a fail one things for sure the graphics look amazing people just cant leave their politics out of gaming can they this commentary seems a bit silly too run around kill bad guys shoot a tankgenerator shoot more bad guys isnt that the point of call of duty fortnite pubg etc etc etc same shit different game im not gonna download another launcher to play this game not buying it rage sucked oh another youtube that was indirectly paid to shill for a game donald trump seriously thats clearly guy fieri what youre showing looks horrible to me its gonna be like any other far cry mediocre everyone on the ubi train i prefer metro exodus over this game fellow fan of rage 1 here you made me interested in rage 2 all by yourself everyone elses take and the initial announcement made me just think the game was pushed heavily towards a borderlands clone thanks for sharing your thoughts and getting me interested in playing 504 rage meets bioshock nice xd i trust avalanche studios and id but im still going to have to wait until release before i make a decision i love open world stuff and violence but this being a bethesda store thing and allwell you know by now man its bad enough that books music and movies shitting on our president trump now its video games can we enjoy some mindless entertainment without political brainwashing for god sakes the huge mutant monster looks like trump sick they still have the armor destruction that and the enemies having a sense of self preservation crawling away when wounded really made the game feel fantastic bethesda launcher yeah thats a no from me buddy did they let you change any settings like mouse acceleration mouse smoothing vsync if not on a gsync or freesync monitor that may have affected the way it handles whatever game triggers liberals i buy it so basically its just a first person version of avalanches mad max game edit aaaand just as i hit submit gggman commented the same thing bethesda with a touch of avalanche will wait for massive 75 sale before buying i still dont know how rage got a sequel not exactly sure who was hoping for a rage 2 rage 1 fizzled and was meh it would be cool if they added visual weapon customization like doom 2016 multiplayer but adding more things than just camo and weapon quality what you said about outposts getting repetitive reminds me of mad max which is quite similar and was made by the same studio hope it doesnt end the same great but poorly utilized gameplay with way too much similar content i thought this was a preview not another negative opinion oriented review that i normally avoid the mad max game driving was so good funny how pc gamers are the only bunch of fucks to openly praise monopolys its not on steam i wont even think of buying this game because of bethesda i dont care how good of a game they releasepublish im done with their shit and i will now avoid what ever they are involved with because of fallout76 these big companies are getting way too fucking bold as of late and i wont be supporting any of them theres too many other smaller companies that i could be supporting or other big companies that are creating much better stuff with much better quality the old saying look like racer like a baby oil mix with doom and mad max voicing fps protagonists is always a mistake unless its in cutscenes i can only wish that eventually we will get to play as walker texas ranger in a video game well just looks like another mediocre game to me no thanks the visuals are pretty nice not gonna lie only left wing wackos think that looks like trump do factions fight eachother can you encounter random things like such when out and about wheres andrew wk the game does seem more colorful in comparison to other video games set in postapocalyptic worlds but the same thing applies to far cry new dawn the driving in the mad max was fine you are not gonna get super detailed driving in a mostly shooter gamewas it like mad max or not as goodthx for the update and keep up the great work this game has some insane pop in issues its all over the placemakes you wonder if that will be fixed before release definitely in no rush to get this game will be a bargain bin discount 510 when nothing else is around 200 is that the natasha from tf2 greatanother launcher i need running on my pc that could easily be avoided by just using steam first metro exodus and now thisi really want to not give in to their bullshit but these both look like fantastic games soon every developer studio is going to have their own launchers and our pcs are going to be bogged down from these stupid launchers running in the background they just cant stop finding ways to piss gamers off it looks pretty good but what is with the nauseating amounts of pink and teal i kinda figured rage 2 would be exclusive to the bethesda launcher but i technically already have an account so thatll be a pill ill have to swallow if i wanna play this shit it feels more like bullet storm 2 than rage 2 look out your gonna be called a shill again good info about the game jesus christ im so sick of hearing you pc players bitch and moan about fucking everything ahhhh the framerate hurts my eyes oh man cant wait till it comes out on pc was this optimized for consoles first how fucking dare they uhhh yeah these controls feel like they were made for a controller on and on and on with you guys and now youre all boycotting metro exodus because of the steamepic fiasco cry me a fucking river enable subs go to 415 the cock controls is probably the weakest aspect they shouldve funded prey 2 over rage 2 does anyone else feel like bethesda spends more money on marketing and pr than development well at least now due to ggms first impressions im kinda interested in the game due to the great combat i loved rages combat all the neon and bling bling from the trailers really put me off i still cant get rage 1 to run right on my pc i see more of a fatter guy from diners driveins and dives i love open worldly there will be more weapons if you get the deluxe edition you get the bfg 9000 i can only imagine the wasteland shitstorm you could start with that gggman and icarus my fav fps tubers two awesome unbiased dudes great review as always keep it up bro that ps3360 era popin the launcher and possible extra drm are not worth it give me a gog version really interested in the game really not interested in using bethesdas launcher well which one wins out i miss the days of voiceless protagonists or like the old master chief that spoke like twice per game i enjoyed rage initially brought it on sale last year an omg thats some trash where as quake and other classics hold up rage aged like whole milk left in the sun oh and klegg looks more like johnny bravo and guy fieri had a baby then the donald typically what do in games like this is use the mouse and keyboard when on foot and keep my xbox controller handy for when i hop into a vehicle the console build looks so blurry im glad im not the only one who enjoyed rage 1 so the big blonde dude turns into a monster is that a spoiler p ive not even played rage 1 but have had it in my library for years now any day now i enjoyed the first rage myself thought the combatgunplay was very satisfying i wished youtubers would not let publishers decide what parts of their game are featured in a review also do not fool yourself putting up a video about a new game is effectively percieved as review regardless of what you put in the title modern journalism has become a total sell out im sure you noticed that as well so pls dont follow their route if they wont let you use own footage in beta phase ignore the game until it is possible love the graphics and setting it has great gameplay so what else do you need lol donald trump come on man thats clearly guy fiery the footage shown off so far doesnt do much to show off much of a challenge fighting enemies hows the difficulty playing it the only thing that remotely looks trump about him is his hair and while trump might be the most famous person with hair that bad many people have had hair that bad i mean as others have stated you could make a better case he looks like guy fieri and he still doenst look like him either oh yes and as always a through review with sound explanations as to why you feel certain ways about certain things youre already 10x better than official game journos fucking trumpreeeeeeeeee 010 from ign so is it just an ubisoft open world game now even the trump character looks like hurk it kinda sux that the driving is floaty cuz the 1st game had some decent control while rage had really awesome weapons dat rebar gun was just mmmm with multiple ammo types and animations these look like generic scifi assault rifle and shotgun yeah and the talking hero is a no for me this is how dead space 2 was ruined also the animation looks much worse compared to the 1st game where are the slimy mutants oo calling it now doom eternal bethesda launcher only so isnt that fat trump guy the monster as well they look kinda similar nah klegg isnt anything like trump he doesnt make me want to wash my mouth out with soap after looking at him so this is peasant footage with lots of popping and blooming lol 134 oh boy youre lucky i used to catch reruns of that show a couple years back otherwise i would not have gotten that outdated reference you 90s kid you i want to see a crossover between titanfall and overwatch with a single player campaign 558 finally a reviewer who doesnt call fun too easy well this looks a fair bit more cartoony and less meaty than the original your the best video game youtuber man serious yet sarcastic and hilarious gutted loved rage and have been waiting excitedly for the sequel but the bethesda launcher can get fucked bethesda launcher peace do you really have to compare every game to cod love fear man we need a remaster gggmanlives is the best reviewer on youtube i only trust in gggmanlives gggmanlives is the most informative reviewer ever i love you gggmanlives damn did you all have to turn this comment section into gggmanlives fondleage club i never seen so many encouraging comments in a youtube video ever ill allow the fondle to continue because its true that when it comes purchase decisions gggmanlives is indeed a good indicator cant wait for this but ill never preorder thats what idiots do and how the hell does that look like donald trump voiced protagonists is a crime like who the fuck thought it would ever be a good idea really disappointed it looks fun though i liked rage because it was a postapocaliptic game where characters were not some sort of disgusting satire borderland failed for me because i hated every character because they were some sort of hipocrite scum or some dumb american humor trope on than front how were the npcs in this game down to earth like previous game or gta like human trash hmm not very happy about the open world repetition loop they always feel like a chore to pad the length and it would be uneeded in a more focused design yet the combat looks really fun and the presentation looks creative i will keep an eye on this one i really dont see trump lol i see guy fieri im not a fan of all the static popping up in the screen for the game otherwise looks fine sound design seems pretty good too love when guns have a feeling of impact in an fps game honestly seems like its trying too hard to be goofy like saints row just isnt appealing also doesnt seem like the game is going to be a challenge at all but otherwise some of the stuff in the game world looks interesting but i already assumed it was gonna be another generic open world game with no real depth so i wont be surprised if this is what it truly ends up being i might try it in the future only if its on steam been watching your videos for probably a good year or two if im on the fence about a game that you reviewed i normally give it a watch before buying plus love the sense of humor as well plus you grew up playing doom as did i so it good to know your tastes in games are about like mine hope you have a good one and keep putting out awesome videos damn they turned that cute chick from frist rage into an old wreck why did you use picture of russian disk box for fear tho just a random pic from google loved the first rage i was going in without any real expectations thought it was just a generic fps in postapocaliptic setting but i was wrong everything seemed to be so smooth enemies actually moved around on the floor on the walls sometimes even on the ceiling if my memory serves and their movements were so fluid making it feel pretty realistic and damn hard to shoot controllerfps issues it was actually challenging because enemies of every shooting game i played before were predictable here they use pretty much everything they can i dunno maybe its just nostalgia kicking in but thats how i remember it lets hope the second game will be the same ps also always crashed intentionally into things with the car just to see the dude flying partly for the funny ragdoll animation partly for that hilarious scream doom with space dishonoured powers i dont get the donald trump comparison at all it seems really forced to me and most likely stems from the likes of kotaku polygon eurogamer etc outside of the character having blond hair very different styles too and being fat i see dont any resemblance i loved the first rage as well when it came out really cant wait for this one too could you make a video on the metro exodus epic launcher shit deep silver really shafted consumers up the ass with the decision i think avalanche is getting too big for its own good just cause 4 was a disaster and now this doesnt sound good just more of the same plus superpowers so they basically turned it into farcry was excited till i found out it will only be available on the bethesda launcher i loved the original rage this one looks amazing besides graphics and sound there is nothing worthwile in this gamethis game gives me a vibe of cod black ofs 2 mixed with fortniteu play for few hours then forget itoh and there are way too many fucking colors in thisits fucking nauseating why does the screen glitch out when a super move is done does my character have a television for a head i dont understand came to hear an aussie say shiiiiiiiiiiiiet stayed for the quality content just think the guy looks more like a fat paul phoenix cant help but think that downwardthrust was probably talking about rage 2 does the bethesda launcher require that i connect to the internet to play my games because that is a 100 deal breaker for me please can anyone confirm or deny mix of doom and crysis fek dis shite im excited for it thought the first was hugely underrated for the gunplay if im not mistaken this is an exclusive to the bethesda client im just tired of having to install one clientdrm for every other game i might just skip this one because of that you lost me at its captured on a console so all the bland open world stuff with great fps combat i wouldnt buy it even if it was on steam on day 1 let alone bethesda launcher which has no regional pricing thank for covering it sonny jim i also never understood the hate that rage got it was a standard id fps with larger level design basically a quite immersive and technically impressive at that i guess they have never been known for their storytelling skills so my expectations were set for that so i think that might be the reason the ending and pacing never let me down i just hope they dont finish this one with a cliffhanger although given how most games just want to push possible future releases and dlc as much as possible its hard to believe they will make players feel some closure with the ending i prefer voiced protagonists imo even if they have badmediocre voice acting greatgamegaze man as always have you tried to strafejump in rage 2 while holding sprint the same time the moment i have lernt how to make strafejump properly i rediscovered multiple idtech based games from entirely new point of view quake 2 is obvious example but return to castle wolfenstein with nofatigue cheat soldier of fortune 2 doom 3 and rage requires to sprint while strafejumping look at the first 25s of this gamplay record only first 2min without sound and imagine mutanbashtv after httpsyoutubedwjmpak1ugy i played trough every idtech based game multiple times excluding doom 2016 doomnoob 2016 get handicapped with dbljump mechanics which caused me to squeeze those poor wsad without a purpouse its a shame then that its a bethesdanet exclusive was hyped news its not on other platforms hype died im reminded of dragon age inquisition it was the first dragon age with a big open world but it was the dragon age that felt the smallest to me not every game needs to be an open world its quantity over quality just add an open world and fill it with repeatable tasks i rarely play modern open world because of these reasons the gunplay in this video looks really great though im keeping my eye on this one yup same old same old ill pass might pick up cheap down the line im gonna be a bit more picky about the games i buy now does it have alternate ammo like the first gamer i liked rage 1 a lot i also liked the races therefore i liked it more than you looser rekt you just killed all interest i had for this game by simply saying bethesda launcher and exclusive they make it like justcuse instant rage the bethesda launcher exclusivity has me worried i dont mind the epic launcher because at least it has potential to be good people bitching about it must really love their monopolies but the bethesda launcher is a buggy massive piece of shit gotta say this looks better than the demo i saw a couple months ago the way you explained it it looks boring looks like yet another openworld shitbox are the guys behind mad max into the project i bought 2016 shortly after release but i cant support that publisher in its current behavior its so sad how consumer unfriendly bethesda has become over the last years maybe picking this up in a year or two for a cheap price i am sorry for the development studio they do great hey its ragu sauce 2 bethesda launcher eh ill pass for the moment i am sorry but the fact you go to play it at their place is enough of a reason to not really trust your review that much i mean if you want to continue going you will have to be careful with what you say or they wont invite you again i just dont think it is a good idea to do this it gets to a person is it braindead in a good way like doom where i can turn my brain off and just have fun or is it like a ea game kind of turn my brain off where im doing the same thing over and over again and get bored this game is looking to be a ripper open world and taking over outposts and side missions is this farcry new dawn or rage 2 hopefully this game does better i mean not even open world ubisoft games got me this bored from doing the same thing over and over and over again like the first game did the game look amazing and hope they showed what happened to main character from the first one cause all i remember is the hero waking up all his friends or soldier buddies from the ark or whatever they came from after 3 hours they made you rage quit if you showed me the fighting sequence i would swear im seeing a bulletstorm footage i cant wait for this game personally i really liked the car racing in the 1st game the fact that gggmanlives and huber from eza have nothing bad to say about this game just fortifies how i already feel about this game plays like doom with more new weapons and abilities im sold im not swayed by criticism like repetitive every thing in games is repetitive doom is repetitive only that its sooooo good you dont mind it being repeated ive heard silly criticism as well like how the colorpalette is too colorfultropical also rage 2 has a glider for you to fly over destinations how cool is that repetitive my ass vehiclecombat remains to be seen but for a game with that much variety than other fpss out there repetitive just seems like the incorrect term to use for rage 2 btw its clearly guy fieri the one and only seems like another case of been there done that this looks intertsings but the i will not buy any game from the publisher at reals looks nothing like the first game rage 2 i see youve done well for yourself glad to see it youre the favorite gaming coverage channel ive seen such a high production value and a gradea personality not your own footage that sucks ive been waitin 4ever 4 this game the combat looks great but if thats all there ends up being then i might wait for a price drop on this one my main worry is it the open world might suffer from the same issues just cause has courtesy of avalanche where for all the upsides of giving you a massive open playground its filled with copy paste content that just feels like a lot of nothing and busywork after a while and beyond the combat gameplay loop theres not much substance to entice exploration i hope that im wrong though because i really want the new id to succeed as they seemed to be going from strength to strength with their new doom releases it realls just does start to feel like youre just doing the same thing over and over that was mad max made by the same studio in a nutshell and the main reason why i never bothered to continue playing the game after a few hours really disappointing to hear that this game apparently has the same issue blonde hair donald trump i think he looks like adam conover seems like another game bites the ubisoft open world dust nice looking combat though im really looking forward to rage 2 but as i said in your previous video the machine gun looks as if it could come from any other modern generic shooter with its stockstandard dotvisor the first machine gun in rage 1 looked like a glued together kalashnikov which wasnt anything special either but better than this the other machine gun with the zoomscope in rage looked great on the other hand of course its more important that the guns feel good to shoot hope the gun feels better than it looks but im still disappointed by its mediocre design and yeah hopefully you can get your hands on an early reviewcopy youre one of the few people whose opinion im still interested in and trust when it comes to the genres you play so another generic open world game think ill pass this one why does every game has to be some soulless open world bethesda launcher im out surreal seeing sonny jim securing secret screenings of shooters 90 of people will play it on a console so it makes sense they captured it on console is the game hard though i always loved blood for example because it had over the top action while needing some strategy to get through the missions rage 2 looks like those game where you have too much ammo too strong of a character and you only die when you fall to your death is it possible to be accurate without using sights i hate having to use those in a game like this it just blocks all the nice action boi the hype is real am i the only one who noticed that the mutant in the beginning had the same hairdo as donald trump edit okay it wasnt just me thanks i am a bit sceptical about this one but i believe in your fps taste and after your preview i think i might give it a chance and thats a good thing always honest as shit reviews thanks again for always being true to yourself and your reviews i probably wont be picking up rage 2 until a price drop or when it comes to steam if ever i hope they have some cool unusual weapon for the release like doom 2 has super shotgun quake 2 has railgun and unreal has any gun so they ubisofted it hopefully its a vulkan title meh fuck bethesda launcher i dont need anymore of those damn things in my pc would gladly play this game through other methods im excited to play this i just hope that it retains the id software charm that the first one had since well id software doesnt really exist anymore which still saddens me but i know in rage one you could still kinda see the id roots in it the doom3esk art direction and such im really not a fan of you playing as another character i dont see why this had to be done the first rage had you building up your character it was a story of a guy who came from the past with nothing built up his reputation in the wasteland shacked up with a girlfriend if you count the dlc and became an important member in the resistance why the hell would we care about this walker guy when i see these returning characters from the first game i want it to be a reunion of old friends being the same character i was in the first game you know yeah im like you gggman im one of the few who actually gives a shit about the first game sounds like a good 80 off game it looks interesting might have to get this one on ps4 is its going to be tied to the bethesda launcher i really enjoyed rage 1 so hopefully this game is the sequel the first game deserves i like the look of this a lot kind of got that speedadrenaline rush like doom thank you for the prereview gg dunno how it could be possible to feel like it has less stuff than rage1 i preordered this game few weeks ago and your preview only makes me want it more may 14th cant come soon enough thank you you have helped me get some great games dusk amid evil are some of my favorite games the game looks way too colorful in my opinion like the new far cry i prefer more realistic and grittier art styles great video man thanks for the insights but im still waiting for your opinions on anthem another awesome video as usual my man you really make me know a lot of games that i dont know before keep it up bud i just wish they write better characters those from just cause 2 were cool enough like cheap vhs movies now every npc is just dry pointer sending you to quest locations if they are trying to make cool games by making post apo with more colors why not make cool npcs thats where rage1 owns sequel oh and rage2 is bethnet exclusive no steam no buy also theres a gravity gun in the game it seems but no sniper weapons it has potential when ever i see this game i think of breaking bad bethesda launcher exclusive ill pass ive been highly skeptical of rage 2 because of the middling nature of the first with its highlights being its various easter eggs which were a major turnon to me being someone who didnt have the privilege of experiencing those classic id titles in their heyday not being born yet will do that to you still i feel like rage 2 is a very mixed bag from the looks of it combining mad maxrage combat and gameplay with a we happy feweuropunk aesthetic it could be great but i hope to christ it doesnt go the way of the first or bulletstorm im looking forward to your coverage as always and i hope that at least one aaa abilitybased openworld shooter series wont be a flop now that bungie has cut the cord with activision good work and gg the bad guy be drumpf i want real world politics in my fps fantasy game very important in 2019 or else looks like it will have the same problem as mad max game developed by the same studio yahtzee from zero punctuation called it the sandiest sandbox game he ever played and theres a reason for that hope they turn it into a much more cohesive game by release time everything else about the game looks fantastic by far the best reviewer on youtube i enjoy your reviewspreviews the most you just seem so honest in your opinions which is awesome ya if its the same stuff over and over i will just get farcry new dawn since for some reason its 50 canadian and this game is 80 doing the same but cheaper i have to agree with gggman im playing quake 4 on the hardest difficulty and the game is superb but the vehicle sections are shit while i was playing it last night your words from the review were echoing in my mind and i understand why still not preordering and no one should be you absolute tools however buy after release wait for reviews buy from a platform that allows refund ive been stung too many times you looking forward to blood remastered if someone had told me a few years ago that i would be sick and tired of open world games i would probably have lifted my eyebrows and middlefinger but yes im actually really sick of those games today just mentioning that a game is open world usually drops my interest in that game to nothing hm bethesda launcher parts of the game racing vehicle handling seem like an afterthought on pc gameplay structure seems lifted from err every just cause game ever so mmoy clear this location stuff without any story prompts to differentiate one location from another car races are in again le sigh alternate ammo types we dont know yet rage 2 still seems like a shooter of the ill try it when im bored could be partially good kind but with being exclusive to bethesdas store i am hesitant to use that and seeing as the game outside of the core fps combat loop doesnt sound too enticing either if i wanted to play a racing game i would buy one and i am tired of keyboardmouse being treated as secondrate input devices even if only in parts of the game i cannot play with controllers so anything that doesnt work well with kbm is right out this one looks like itll remain a pass i would probably pick it up were it to come to gog but if wish more sponsored content tripgman haha jk love the channel sonny jim three early playthroughs and the year just started i thought it said slitdown instead of stiltdown xd i loved the first game especially that card game in the subway car i will be playing this does anyone know a downloadable card game that is exactly like the one in the subway car i love that game sweet cant wait for the yearlater steam release same for doom eternal so bottomline is it worth reordering for some reason it reminds me of bulletstorm 112 it has a flyinghover bike now thats a dealmaker i will not buy tell your full review when games out or close to release date i trust your opinions have heard similar criticisms of the driving etc i hope they listen as this looks like it has the potential to be great i need them to put up a steam page so i can wishlist this shit now ragestiny d bugthesda launcher exclusive no buy rip in bananas doom and rage i trust nothing that shitty publisher does anymore good luck have fun donald trump nigga thats guy fieri representing flavortown the combat doesnt look very challenging from the footage i hope its a pleasant surprise why it must be bethesda store exclusive thats trump 003 better than fallout 76 maybe bethesda should let id take a crack at fallout or avoid fps to shake it up first game had amazing feeling shooting tbh this is going to be a buy no doubt for me at least what would improve about rage 2 if it were on steam other than all my games in one place when you are looking for shooter info and reviews accept no substitute gggman every time pew pew sonny jim thanks for the preview so ids attempt at a far cry formula gggmanlives how was the enemy variety theres been a bunch of these open world games with boring old human enemies i saw a little bit of variety with that big lads but seems like more of a boss fight thing most of it seems like just dudes with guns or dudes who want to beat you up with a melee weapon one of the greatest parts of doom 2016 was all the different enemy types and how they change how the fight goes down i liked the racing in the first game in your preview did you get to use cockpit view real talk probably gonna pick this up after launch looks like a good time but i wanna make sure 105 holy crap i will crack or buy this game only to do this shit i was actually thinking a fat duke nukem you are killing it so far this year loving all these preview reviews again great preview looking forward for this game as i too liked the first one am i a minirity considering i sometimes just watch the video for the content and already decided whether i want the game or not yeah i aint buying it if i have to use that shitty thing bethesda calls a launcher its wonderful how a company that i used to love i absolutely despise now edit so its on steam now good on ya bethesda to this that i started watching this channel through gal gun wish they didnt take the path of ubisoft open world game design its really repetitive and boring does this game have fast travel at least this and cyberpunk are the two biggest games im looking forward to the fact they opened with andrew wk at e3 just amped up the excitement can they just hurry up and get this shit out so we can focus on doom eternal im early let me make a joke bethesda launcher rage 2 epic game launcher metro exodus making video preview for rage 2 before it get launched what a mad lad no pun intended too bad no multiplayer i just cant justify buying campaign only games anymore at least not when it first comes out maybe next year when it comes down to 20 rage 2 possibly generic i absolutely abhor free roam games that require you to take over outposts and gain trust it feels so repetitive and it takes me out of the experience disgusting design choice in my opinion but the rest looks good i really hope the narrative is good man i was kinda hoping for a fps of 2018 video one of these days you kind of contradicted yourself when you said you go places kill people and do it over again and it gets repetitive but later say you reply missions so you can carry on shooting peoplesurely if you went and did the missions killing people would be the same but youd be progressing the story i like ggg he is most honest reviewer out there and fairly say negative stuff and positive stuff rage 2 will stand as one of the sequels i never expected but so damn glad its happening this year with metro exodus doom eternal far cry new dawn and now rage 2 2019 is gonna be a sweet year for shooters exclusive for bethesda launcher why just why the lod is so badly handled in this game by looking at the footage look at all the popin when the player is riding the chopper i find it lucky you get to play raaagee early sonny boi 3 looks like doom 2016 plus fear plus mad max plus bulletstorm plus cod plus half life plus far cry dragon whatever plus borderlands so basically they made it like a far cry game sooooooooooooo another open world fps game yeah ill wait for doom eternal at the risk of sounding like a sicopath killing never felt so good that is a perfect ringtone thanks for the footage possibility even though you couldnt upload your playtime for me to buy a bethesda gsme it has to be 1 not developed by bethesda 2 sold on a platform that allows user reviews bethesda ubisoft ea and epic can go fuck themselves im really at a loss as to whats so exciting about games like this it looks like a japanimation cartoon and an overlyflashy fantasyscifi hollywood flick had an ugly baby and then raised it on a strict diet of gg allin and vegan casseroles i guess that means they approved this video if it comes to steam then ill buy it it feels weird watching you fight your mutated clone at the beginning of the video between this far cry and metro which do you like more such a better reviewer than anyone at ign hands down looks too pg13 for me it was repetitive but you loved doing the combat over and over again whatever you say i respect your opinion gman but im still super stoked for this gonna be a good winterspring for fps games rage 2 and metro exodus makes me a happy camper what is everyone talking about he looks nothing like donald trump no not that ranger the shooting looks great and fun but it seems like it would benefit more from having a good story with more linear level design than being a boring open world game with bland storytelling im honestly sick of open worlds i really do hope the different ammo types to come back in the game i enjoyed that in the first game otherwise i am worried about this whole open world thing as well its kind of the thing that made me bored of mad max after awhile especially as im a completionist and have to clear out everything as i progress in the game i am less interested in rage 2 for some reason wait did you even see the needle gun all the other broll for this game theyve released has needle gun footage its a fastprojectile shooting weapon that has an alt fire that pulls the target away in the direction you aim reletive to the target the more needles or whatever they are you peg into the target the more force behind the pull 0138 wait what you wanna tell me that this is that girl from rage 1 with a bangin ass thats her too many post apocolypse mad max clones even metro is set in a boring looking desert we need something fresh i remember you saying the first games shooting was fun but the enemieslevel design was kind of copy and paste it made every encounter the same this looks like a huge improvement though realistic borderlands as always thank you for these previews when i look footage from a game and as i see it my thoughts go ah it reminds me of x game and ah it has bioshock elements even cute than i know itll be another generic aaa title uninnovative and boring honestly i think nier automata ruin every single aaa title on pc for me yes you can still enjoy the same ol thing but every time i repeat the same process a part of my soul dies having said that i too liked the first game but will definitely pass on this one id never had made the connection between that character and trump why is this game looking like cod all the time i think its bo4 the original rage had great combat sections but the momentum of the game was destroyed by the quasi open world element the driving between missions felt pointless despite the game giving the player very surface level incentives to actually use the vehicle outside of driving to missions this sequel appears to have solved that issue tenfold im actually looking more forward to this than the latest metro game meh fuck rage and far cry this year doom eternal when just release borderlands 3 just by looking those car explosion i feel like they are made of cardboxes rather than heavy metal rest is fine it feels like just yesterday i was watching your review of the original keep up the great content i really wanna play this but bethesda launcher vomits the games reminds me of bulletstorm but now its open world looks as boring as rage 1 not a fan of the psychopathic characterizations but this game looks more substantial than anthem manhow many games with post apocalypse themes we will have this year doom eternal rage 2 atomic heart far cry new dawn metro exodus what more i dont know about anyone else but im excited about this game bethesda giving games a sequel they dont deserve but the one they needed why does id want me to see this preview with console motion blur and controls i am super tempted to get the bfg in the deluxe pack but im gonna wait for your review just cause 4 was an impressive explosive sandbox with potentially awesome set pieces but offered nothing nada zilch for 60 this gives out the same vibes will it also includes nylon bag looks like im not getting it cuz its on a shitty launcher this game looks like it could be better than the first it just works seems like a far cry clone i think the analogy would be you get to ride a rollercoaster however when you go to the booth you are forced to take a picture of someone else on the ride rather than your own rage 2 really didint know anything about this decent review always like your opinions but bethesda launcher is a at this point a no buy for me tho fuck all these shitty ass launchers i want my games on steam not having to get 10 launchers to play games im pretty sure the mc is voiced by sam riegel whos straight up awesome and ill never complain about him in more games i think its lacking some sorta punch compared to doom 2016 i cant quite put my finger on it maybe its the enemy variety as these punks dont seem all that fun to kill they arent aggressive enough in combat i loved rage 1 still dont get why ppl hated it play bright memory its super fun so is this one locked to the bethesda store or can we pick it up on steam to be frank i absolutely love the look of this game its a lot more colorful than i imagined it to be into the wait for a sale bin it goes looks more like guy fieri than donald trump game journalism at it again to politicize everything and push their agenda on us gamers who just want to escape from reality in our hobby looks like a solid game this and metro look great diff launcher than the first game here too metro exodus and this game wont get my dollary doos steam or nothin devs just aint feeling this game thats guy fieri 500 eye divine cybermancy had that energy blast move back in 2011 ion maiden got a new playable level and new weapons plus enemies thats a video update id love to watch 148 reminds me of ricky from trailer park boys say gggman is it true you can change the characters gender i knew it gunplay look very good and you just confirm it im fine if the open world part of the game is incomplete ty for the video and info i agree on the games combat system and i wonder if the guns the other guns if they do probably dont know we didnt see are either semiautomatic or full automatic weapons or just explosive but its probably over the top if theirs a lot of explosives that we couldnt keep up anytime theres a new id software game theres no other opinion that matters cant wait to see what night dive studios does with that blood remaster you enjoyed rage how i meant its be better than fallout 76 thats what i meant to say if this is anything like doom 2016 then itll be worth the purchase but fuck the bethesda and epic games launchers fuck that exclusive bullshit i want these games on steam will you ever review red dead redemption 2 rage is fun an another postapocalyptic game yeah probably be better than fallout series 6 like all of these games ill definitely be waiting until its on sale for like 1520 dollars before picking it up or through humble there are so many great games out there that playing within the first several months after release isnt really worth it thanks for your input on it though the combat and aesthetics are pretty cool that interview from the mentally ill journalist was nonsense the cringe worthy assertions that the developers were secretly orangemanbad resist mywifesboyfriend with a trumpalike but were just prevented by the trumps from saying so made me want to die he obviously isnt supposed to be trump dont be cancer too man i wish i discovered you abit sooner like a year or two ago you actually give real reviews you probably wouldve saved me alot of money between then and now love the videos btw ive gotta say this looks like a damn fine appetizer to the main course that is doom eternal not on steam i aint gonna buy 622 this screen distortion effect that happens after the melee attack is it just an added edit effect of the b footage you were handed or is it like that ingame too cause im not over the moon with it kind of reminds me of kane and lynch 2 and not in a good way it doesnt happen at 644 and that attack looks the same which has me confused we love you jablinski games great video make more videos brother i cant get enough and here i am twiddling my thumbs and waiting for cyberpunk i dont really know why rage got all the hate it did i thought it was fun kinda looking forward to this one too i love the first rage but i dont like anything i saw of this sequel this is the mass effect omega game i was looking for the video glitches and color palette reminds me of kane lynch 2 are they in game but why fear disc is in russian im so glad you were one that managed to get capture of this greta video mate nooo loosum isnt hot anymore 010 that blonde guy is fat johnny bravo no multiplayer huh this game couldve been a sick looking version of borderlands 2 what a waste love your vids bro why do none of these open world games never give you a motorcycle to drive around is it only just cause that lets you fuck around on a bike bethesda store exclusive hard pass edit yes not anymore your reviews are better than any other reviewer i can find because youre straightforward lmao surprised you havent mentioned the health system or i probably missed it which is entirely possible is it regenerating health finding supplies to restore your health or a weird mix like the metro games have between health kits and regeneration love this channel is it me or is the npc animations worse than in the first who invite to youtuber to a event just to make them use b roll looks great i will buy it ive heard bethesda wants it only on its own store what that means no steam no buy gameplay video you show gives a feel of being a mortal doom slayer or using 00000000000000000000000000001 power of ds i really enjoy your previews so glad i found your channel d thank you for delaying my sleep for 728 minutes i still find hilarious how far cry new dawn doesnt even hide that they smelling rage 2s arse when you say shiiiittteee in some of your videos are you doing that on purpose if not then i dont mean any offense i always love your always no bullshit assessment of games great stuff mate also cant wait for doom eternal lol donald trump i thought he looked more like guy fieri personally why they do this they should re make quake i dont know where they are getting donald trump from he looks more of a cross between guy fieri and john candy holy shet im early loved the video first to be second racing fucking annoys me except forza horizon awww why did they have to make loosum fat so bottom line rage 2 or far cry new dawn im thinking metro lol combat looks cool but everything else looks boring as hell hard pass i watched this gameplay video of 15 mins the other day and went to steam to pre purchase the game and didnt find it i wasnt aware it was a bethesda launcher exclusive until i was ready to throw money at the game now id rather wait to see if they release a steam version or ill skip the game entirely i hope they dont do the same to doom eternal its time to kill with skill or was it use skill to kill idk is there a kick melee i love how these smaller youtube content creators arent allowed to use their footage in previews and yet 4a let ign upload their abomination of an uncommentated travesty of a gameplay video for metro exodus bethesda launcher only ill pass hello ggg i liked the on foot parts of rage 1 quite a lot that part of that game was really solid id and it looked great but this one just no from the first unveil i could clearly see that level design is non existent outpost here outpost there and instead there is bunch of repeated stuff everywhere so even thought the shooting might be good or even great powers and what not lack of levels is a deal breaker for me not interested in open world games at all since oblivion never liked far cry also rage 1 seams to have much greater detail within levels even thought shadders etc are old 135 lost all interest question as someone who hasnt played the first game why do they call it rage the gameplay doesnt scream rage to me the same way i would think of in doom game looks awful no i am not using another launcher looks more like barfjohn candy than trump not sure how i feel bout the fancy lookin future weapons in the post apocalypse setting really dug the look of that pistol and ak lookin assault rifle in rage 1 wait did you play on a console with the mouse and keyboard or just a controller later in the video you mention about the movement with a keyboard feeling more tuned with a controller earlier you said you played on console my brain hurts to sum up this review in a nutshell welcome to rage 2 where never has killing shit felt so damn good that should honestly be the tagline for the game if you ask me if its good that is i just wanted to ask who the hell uploads videos at 4 am and then i realized there is a thing called timezones nevermind this is a great channel and i really enjoy your videos you brought me to play tons of older games i would have missed without you greetings from germany the gunplay is exactly cod not sure i like that so you play as a us army ranger from call of duty modern warfare 2 and you get put in a pod and get frozen for a hundred years or something noice cross over so about that half life 3 review not worth the money i was gonna buy metro exodus but since they are doing some stupid shit i guess im gonna pick up rage 2 instead to get my post apocalyptic fix 145 that guy doesnt look like trump you might as well say the big guy at the beginning of the video looked like trump all of a sudden every character with blonde hair is donald trump this would be an awesome success or will be considered an underrated gem 10 years from now the main characters voice just sounds generic rather have a silent protagonist like doom guyslayer otherwise looks like a lot of fun donald trump naw man thats guy fieri its a good game because it isnt developed by bethesda softworks looks fucking good man hopefully they do polish it more but i have faith in id does anyone want to play the first game again after watched this greeeeatso first metro exodus gets pulled from steam for the garbage af epic games store albeit it will be returning to steam in 2020 and now rage 2 is gonna be exclusive to the bethesda launcher not to mention bethesda arent on the best terms with their fans right now cough fallout 76 cough so i really hope that this game doesnt end up suffering because of those two things different launchers dont bother me so i will be picking this up when its released voiced protagonist that killed fallout 4 for me i fucking love this channel hey gggmanlives im curious are you looking forward to rage 2 or metro exodus more at this point just give us doom this game has some pretty good aesthetic going on damnit they gave the protagonist a voice looks cool sad the price isnt as good as new dawns special edition is looks generic af typical ubisoft open world game would you say that wave of enemies mode is more fun than far cry 4s arena mode i think i might be buying this just for that having only found your channel not that long ago a few months i would say the overall insight you provide along with actually knowing what your talking about has made you at least for me someone i turn too for game reviews purchases its just the way you create your videos and the information you provide it all culminates to a sense of validity and trust upon making purchases keep up the great work and rage 2 is definitely something ive been hyped for bethesda launcher youre a funny guy ggg thats why when you post a new video ill at least think about watching it yep i love ya i agree with you i didnt think that rage was that bad and keep up the good work man bethesda shill the laymengaming didnt get invited rage had a lot of potential hope they get rage 2 right looks alright but i would prefer doom eternal hopefully you will be able to play a preview sample of that i thought he looked more like john candy in spaceballs really mutt or whatever you trashed the first game in your review and today you said you had a lot of fun with it i didnt get that from previous videos with the epic disappointment if metro exodus being moved to another launcher i can say that this game shall fill the void of a postapocolypse that is different in its own regard bethesda launcher kills the game for me still in awe that this is a real thing i dreamed of a rage 2 but never thought it would ever happen i just really hope its good in the end you better get ready to rage friendship ended with far cry now rage 2 is my friend first this game reminds me of the mad max video game not say thats a bad thing insanity not incluided hahaha it looks amazing i need it this is mad max in first person is that mutant crusher at the end wearing a thong what is this the disney version of mad max boom boom and more boom seem like a game that will have a story mode that plays like its a side quest doom eternal rage 2 all we need is a proper turok and quake 5 from them it looks insane and the combat is very similar to crysis seriesjust much more diverse im riding on the hype train chu chu its like doom had an baby with borderlands then someone put some bulletsorm in it and i love it i got fallout 76 red dead 2 and doom on my list idk about this game looks like it will bore me fast day one buy hell yeah rage 1 was solid but got overlooked since bl1 rushes to the scene with personality rage 2 has seemed to turned the tables and i honestly can say im in no rush for bl3 now this looks amazing was interested until the was no multiplayer i will pass well being that no one has a gun to my head saying red dead is all that matters ill get this and im sure plenty of others people act like they can only buy one game a year or something this game looks great the first one needed work but i still really liked it the soldier at 103 is doing cpr incorrectly your arms shouldnt be bending they need to stay straight so that you can apply an adequate amount of pressure with your body weight to push blood through the body just needed to get that out mad max on steroids goon squad reminds me of best buys geek squad i really cant take them seriously this will be my borderlands fix for the moment this looks very promising indeed so excited for this what day in spring cause i want this for my birthday may 28th looks like a mix between halo and mad max they need to add a more variety of weapons i swear so this is what happens when doom has a baby with mad max rage 2 time to rage again everything looks amazing bethesda good job is this coop is it available on playsuck 4 borderlands 3 is still in the drawing board so i guess this will fill that gap for now the commentators voice sounds like mila kunis voice the sound the bullets make when they make contact with the metal or wall behind the enemy when you miss that tingtingting sounds awesome finally borderlands 3 cant wait to play this on the new xbox scarlet i feel like we are going to be overpower vs all this wk ui i hope this leads to mad max 2 day 1 buy to support avalanche i dont need it i dont need it i definitely dont need it i dont need it i dont need it i neeeeeeeeed iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit needed to be third person now this looks impressive plus xbox is still the leading console due largely to the amazing service they offer to their customers this is mad max on steroids cant wait to try this out cant wait to play this in 4k i played it at e3 the gameplay is as good as doom so you know its good i dont care what the nay sayers say im getting this when it comes out for pc im excited to play new games on xbox one x best way to play games this and rdr2 open worlds look stunning mad max but with more colors and explosions wont buy cuz im already spending 180 on battlefield 5 red dead 2 and fallout 76 in a short period of time looks amazing as long as it has a better storyending than the first im sold rage 2 is all the rage rather get red dead redemption 2 so you dont even care about rage 1 why time skip mouse and keyboard great game feat game rage 1 was epic this is just insane i cant wait im so excited for it its really remainds me bulletstorm by gameplay mechanics easy mode on this or red dead the gameplay is very much like bulletstorm 212 is that the halo 5s shotgun design this seems like they just put borderlands and mad max together is rage good this is made for xbox this is pc footage just saying i dont like black pplbut this game looks good you had me at rage 2 i hear skidding 331 but yet there are no roads yes cant wait more rageland doom fury 2 really nice but not 60 euros for this game this kinda looks like mad max combined with doom remember the first rage from years ago it was alright but it was average all around i had honestly forgotten about it until i saw the first trailer for this a while back didnt think it would ever get a sequel but this looks promising goty second place first place rdr2 sorry kratos this looks really fun is it just me or is anyone else not excited for this plp help me wa game should i buy like right now i got 40 quid to spend on xbox be better than rage 1 please release it now and ill buy it release it in fall it stands little chance for me against rdr 2 when u have no cash omg yes please so hyped for this and doom eternal it looks amazing its free pls subscribe to me pls well im here early got off call of duty once i heard rage was added to game pass really fun game and its on gamepass well that was lame basically doom i still forget that rage 2 came out this year i wanted to play this game so much thanks xbox for adding it to the game pass i cant wait to get this game for christmas low key forgot about this game im getting this bit late for halloween but whatever why the hell did this miss october it comes out the moment its out of season yes thats how games work now sell full price then gamepass when dlc comes out great xbox that should fun really late for halloween welp looks like its time to get back into this game hyped for this xo19 awesome game thanx for including it with the gamepass have they fixed the rage meter glitch i really dont wanna play from the beginning been enjoying this game in some videos im doing about 2 hours in so far if youve played mad max or far cry the bandit camps are very similar clear out the area kill dudes open chest at end best part of the game is definitely the parts parts id worked on the shooting feels on par with doom minus the glory kills the shotgun is very much the doom shotgun with a fun slug alt fire when you aim down sights weapon wheels are a plus and the driving is silly enough 603 which one is girl awesome edgy affect guys amazing how youre both able to switch from proper english to whatever broken dialect that is what the hell happened to gamespot where are the reviews every time i see mentions of rage 2 i get confused for like 2 seconds before my brain realizes that its not about streets of rage 2 i do not understand rage 2 pc are so high but graphics dont give that nextgen felling trailer yeah actual gameplay yawn this video highschool project play faith 3 and faithpleaseplay lisa the firstpretty please george brown 3 im sorry but couldnt they just shut up when its explaining the story like were here for the game experience not for commentators this looks fun to play i dont know whats more bland the commentary or the game it self lol smh will there be a video review game looks like nothing special how is this a 2019 game it is no different than anything that has been done one hundred million times wtf happened to this channel who else hates gamespot sort your shit reviewers out seriously a game should be scored on for what it is rage 2 is just about kicking ass and fun the gun play is amazing and the world is fun 510 because white zombiesgamespot cant wait to see their lazy 30 minute review that walmart canada burn i think this is one of those games that in the long run will be remembered fondly not because it did anything new because it definitely doesnt but it looks like it leans into what it is and does it well just needs to have some memorable easter eggs and stuff and people will get nostalgia vision for it in 8 years andrew wk are you ready to rage audience i want to rage the hype that im feeling for this game is fucking unreal lol shit crowd fuck all of those people 846 is that a dogo on the moon andrew wk in the flesh walks out starts playing music the camera looks at some people in the crowd very little people jamming out the fuck people do you have no taste in music listen to shitty rap and that shitty pop music then get the fuck out of my way cause im gonna rage and you dont want to get in the way god that intro song was so cringy headbanging with a piano what the fuck he looks so happy but the crowd rage 2 looks good but i cant wait for fallout 76 to fail epically hopefully then bethesda will quit wasting time on multiplayer games theyll value the customer base that got them where they are the only good thing bethesda announced hold up isnt that guy with the white on cartoon network a few times i thought it was the game andrew wk got indifference from the audience and the devs go a collective oh well its a game nobody asked for but why not i wouldve put some andrew wk right after one of the games boss fights have it feel like it feels like its coming from the game but no motherfucking andrew wk is here in e3 so what was the ending of rage amazing tech wasted on dumb soulless game with vapid atmosphere lets all raise a glass to alexander anderson wingsticks are back baby sweet no one mightve been dancing here i was jamming out at home i hope theres 3rd person view because i like rage but i cant play fps because it makes me dizzy i feel sad for andrew hes in a business conference pouring his heart out on this performance of his revived song ready to die in a game that this song would actually work hell i wanna buy andrew wk music just for this song what has heavy metal turned into im dissapointed im still hyped about the game and its a fitting song for the game wow tim reminds me of your average car salesman xd lol shit like this is the reason i dont bother watching the e3 conferences and just wait for people to put the trailers game news on youtube like fuck all this noise and show what the fuck youve been working on lol i did not like the first rage game but then again i didnt like the first evil within game either but bethesda was able to impress me with the evil within 2 so maybe this time around theyve learned from their past mistake with rage 1 and will once again make a sequel that ill like instead i loved mad max so i have no doubt this dev will deliver another awesome game i came for andrew wk losing his shit on stage and godamn i was not disappointed i feel sorry for the crowd not understanding anything the rage 2 reveal was the worst thing at e3 this year a metal band that is too smiley and hyperactive and two presenters both with no energy and one that not only couldnt be understood but also stood around awkwardly quietly nodding damn i almost thought this was henry rollins tbh i thought rage 1 was a average game and i thought rage 2 was unnecessary but the game looks really good i might buy it when is worth 10 dlls on steam for a moment i thought that its romero my biggest oh fuck in years the running jumping and gunplay all look like a direct copy and paste from fallout 4 still excited as hell lol andrew w k the late 90s just called they want their shit music back fkn dumb crowd doesnt even know the song i dont see how people pull off grafics like this i dont think anybody wanted to rage everytime is see pete heinous i want to open my car door and just slam dunk his stupid mug face inbetween it until my car breaks apart they may as well have brought out dr rockzo the rockn roll clown and i thought andrew wk was dead lolthe burn i waited 7 years for thisnow i have to wait another year as long as it doesnt feature bethesda bugs i should survive ill be getting this i saw 3 whole guns its kyle crane from dying light survived the apocalypse god i love id software i loved the original rage and cant wait for this to come out andrew wk is awesome but whoever was in charge of sound mixing needs to be fired there was like a foot difference in height between those two dudes lmao im ready to die after that fucking intro song i thought emo died in 2007 if that remaster rage 1 with it that will be cool the game looks fkn amazing but anyone who has played the first one knows that this has nothing to do with what rage was like like can anyone actually tell me if the song they played was good or bad cuz i do not know how to judge if the song was good or not i honestly have no idea if the band was playing good or bad music we came to party interesting been waiting for this for a long time i hope they did it right this time rage while being a fav was a total mess even the people in the audience are cringing so the game is borderlands with abilities still just killing mobs when will they add something new to these games maybe destroying buildings able to make holes in walls need to get out of the damn follow the track type games so sick of those yeah i know open world but showed going to basementcave and kill more mobs yippee 2018 and and still this type of dull combat whatever wow that crowd is boring as all hell i rank this presentation 2nd best of all time at e3 next to wii music at 1 the crowd went there to see games not a rock concert i mean they cheered but did you expect them to get out of their seats and start a most pit also andy cant sing live his harmony is completely off tbh would anyone want to get that collectors edition the head ruins it for me personally idk how everyone thinks about it spoiler you just saw every location in the game andrew wk was awesome thanks this is so beautiful priceless beatific heartening humbling encouraging precious and inspiring my bodys riotously convulsing as i type this this is the best e3 yet possibly in all the years ive watched e3 this is the best omfg this and fallout 76then i see andrew wk gg this is sad not impressed allill have to see what features are in the game when it drops but this looks like a typical post apocalyptic title it looks promising but there is all this hardcore music and the character is moving at a walking pace please match movement to the chaos going on fleshy revenants ive been saying it you cant go wrong with bethesdas ideas bethesta we need a story wasteland ok wingstick hype dam this game looks fun af i really like the style of it that grave tshirt is metal as fuck andrew wk 15 years after anyone knew who he was laaaaaaaame any body still playing rage my gamer tag is mcyamun for playstation this is the kind of games that when we can play them they do not look or play anything like this destroy build destroy look up ready to die tfs hellsing thank me later good to know punks notdead i guess afterapolcalypse of cyberpunk2077 devilmaycryish fps doommad maxdeath race rage 2 theres so much video and audio pollution here who is this aimed at sucks to read so much hate in he comments andrew wk has been nothing but a beacon for positively since he became popular for in the 2000s redeye is the real deal lol andrew wk is so shit never liked him some hellsing abridged vibes here cause of that song how about nobody cares about music at efking3 just play the damn trailer or gameplay or something to do with games at e3 a conference about games which is all we wanna see at e3 the game conference for games wtf this looks nothing like the first one this looks like cod those were real rockstars is that the guyfrom destroybuild destroy on cartoon network cant believe im saying this but id get this over fallout 76 and id get dying light 2 over them both sad because i love fallout crowd full of nerds awesome grave shirt swedish death metal gods has long has it been since wk was still relevant 10 years lol i wonder if theyll remaster the original for us who havent played it did anyone play the first rage tbh i think rage 2 will be awful why do developers keep putting exosuits in good games why andrew wk is here to save video games that intro music was like why does e3 keep on doing live music youre playing to a bunch of boring video game nerds who have less energy than jeb bush plus their sitting talk about playing to a dead crowd why not just call it what it is doom rage this game looks amazing rage 1 had the worst ending in gaming history purchase in torrents shop cant wait for this looks superb props for that grave shirt that music did not make me want to rage at all you fuckers needed rings of saturn or fucking slayer man im not sure about this i loved the first one though damn that magnus dude must be 7 feet tall or the other dude is a hobbit lol those graphics looks sexy the most awkward moment does anyone think walker sounds like aaron paul from breaking bad wahou rage 2 3 3 make me want to buy a ps4 or xbox one just for this future huge hit andrew wk and rage 2 is a pefect match dont like it too bad love everybit of it lol looking forward to it no one is going to mention the open ending of rage 1 and how they are most likely not even going to continue that line or give us a look at what happened after the events of rage 1 it looks like an amazing game but it feels like a real cocktease options audio music off whoever told andrew wk he can sing needs lowering into a pit of toxic waste very slowly fck way better than doom this looks dope reminds me of doom in fallout universe mad max bulletstorm and borderlands thrown in a blender shooting some fiminist looking ass punks im in omg that pun shitty croud has always this had better be like the first game which did not need to be always online to play as i fed up with game studios and developers making great games but you cant play them unless your constantly connected to the internet bethesda already ruined fallout for me so i hope this doesnt go down the same path of it will be a no purchase the guy looks like a fuckin titan next to the guys at id the amount of fucking confusion in this crowd when the music started magnus is probably drdisrespects father please never do anything like this again magnus nedfors viking name and viking stature surely he rules avalanche with the tyrannical fist cod meets doom rage 2 this and metroexodus have me excited lets see if doom gets added to that list this game looks fucking amazing okay but why cant we play as one of the cool mohawk ladies instead music aside the game looks dope where is the blood and gore it looks like paintballs hitting people madmax and titanfall with mutants also looks a little bland to be blunt i feel slightly repulsed by the theme and atmosphere rage 2 is trying to achieve to be honest the crowd sucked rage 2 looks badass i will say this rage 2 has been announced borderlands 3 has not patiently waiting i like the band but this conference really doesnt understand its fan base at all so few of them were actually enjoying themselves haha i think a lot of the people who attend are so serious about games that they dont laugh or actively look like they are enjoying themselves they just cheer when the action card comes up when will these cluless fuckers learn just show the game that is the only thing anyone is interested in at e3 i wanna play as magnus in jc4 wow the a w k part the crowd looks like deer in headlights holy shit these people couldnt look more disinterested in andrew wk hes one of the best live shows ive ever seen and theyre all just braindead destroy build destroy i like how you can see just cause 3 leaking through the explosions and physics if borderlands was realistic i am going into this with zero expectations so definitely an improvement over the first game well looks like rap killed the music already people are just dont know what to do and everybody was saying hey im not stricted to just one genre blablabla and in the end it was just a crapy escuse to listen to this rapcrap while all healthy adult people was saying what it really is look at them know dont even know what to do when some music comes in i havent seen such faces since never had i suppose sorry for this crap it is just insulting seeing this nice grave shirt im in love with it id rather wait for this than fallout 76 looks more fluid oh my gawd i cant listen to this song with out seeing fucking alucard struting up and kicking ass xd that intro is pure crowbcat fuel what a beast of a man that andrew guy what kind of punk electronic metal is this haha that music i remember as a kid his party song was cool but he is like a parody now what kind of unholy machine are they using to run those graphics i want one are you ready to ray its on my list avalanche studios really makes good explosions wheres mick gordon dammit reminds me of mad max would of been hilarious if rage was being presented by ea then with the band asking them if theyre ready to rage as long as i get to blow shit up im happy as one wasteland warlord once said mediocre this is mad max and fallouts love child and i want it this is probably the most cringiest moment of e3 yet this is like the spiritual successor to bulletstorm ahaha all the audience is like yeah im not about that rock life get ready to die crap lyrics and performance bla they brought a singer to the reveal well go big or go home i guess whos that homeless guy on the stage this game looks like pure chaotic fun im hyped as hell finally some different music sick of all these dub steprap in all game reveals that band was the greatest example of how some people will do anything for money including the worst music written this week that was horrifying and to make willits follow it by acting excited about that tripe is just disgusting fuck you bethesda andrew wkruining any subculture he gets his shitty little handle attached to christ that music was awful still preordering though i hope we could use flying machines as well pistol has no front sight pistol needs a front sight i hope handsome jack is in this one it looks more like mad max than rage first version is much better are u ready to rage crowd so i see the audience was thinking the exact same thing i was namely what the fk does andrew wk have to do with rage 2 its like a mad max crossover but a better version tho how am i suppose to rage to weak ass music like this wtf was that intro music that was actually pretty dope they have my money gameplay looks pretty awesome and the graphics are amazing but what is with the music taking up half the video preordered only the head as a fan of the first rage im still not sold on this the tone just doesnt work for me honestly there is a tiny bit of promise here however that office building setting level definitely felt like the first game atmospherewise but everything else from that hazy colorful power up thing to the heavy metal approach to the marketing just doesnt work for me i guess i was hoping for something a little lessnoisy and more atmospheric and tension driven i love andrew wk instant buy for me 3 doomadeffectlands another doom wingstick is the iconic weapon of rage this and cyber punk you had the nerve to include the cringy music lol its making me frustrated the way hes killing the sentrys because hes too scared to shoot them with a gun that intro is lit blood on wall zackthis looks good love you zack youre the best youtube or ever zach scott

what do you think of another rage eww i was told how shitty these adds where had to check it out for my self great game but should have been co op 022 not cringy in the least last day of school sounds about right tfw you can play this song on guitar back here again for the rage 2 hype ladies and gentlemen the apunkalypse glab george miller added more colour to the mad max sequel i just want the next elder scrolls please godco op i actually really like this trailer nice mad max gamei mean doomsorry i meant rage this biography of the effects that has meth on people really changed my life all of andrew wks songs are exactly the fucking same oh look another trailer with no game footage for a sequel im fairly sure no one wanted for a game from 7 years ago that everyone forgot about hope you blow me away bethesda because i currently couldnt give less of a shit about this aye andrew wk lmao the gameplay trailer got me more hype than this trailer is this borderlands 3 this looks like an edgy teens wet dream love the song a squel made by bethesda oh boy cant wait to mod the shit out of this game for the next 8 ears with fuckloads of bugs i wonderanother post apocalyptic game by bethesda but it seems a lot lessserious than their other one in terms of tone maybe they can do better with this than the last one you know i like this becuase more pink the better also it reminds me of borderlands 2 makes an embarrassment of the first game thats for sure so much cringe stop making money of other peoples trailers perfect now i have to change my ringtone so people dont think i liked this mess of a trailer i think another rage is so dumb also this ad made me hate fat people so much i want this to be good but this trailer is trash why bethesda why today in games nobody asked for just go to make elder scrolls 6plz id tech 6 avalanche engine badass and epic physics no thank you bethesda shouldnt a trailer show you game play wtf is this looks similar to borderlands never got to play the first one but maybe ill check this one out now that im older do you know what time it is its tomorrow wheres the actual competent trailer not this e3 psycho active drug trip bright colored loud music themed junk haha now i wanna go watch hellsing abridged what the heck i just saw is like borderlands mixed with carmaggedon mixed with gta in a single triler i hope this has better ending than the previous one what garbage terrible marketing decision on bethesdas part hopefully he gameplay trailer and game are alot better than this live action has no place in video game trailersjust cringy who tf even asked for this liberal mind in a nutshell please dont be another boring piece of shit the first rage was one of the most boring aaa game i have ever fucking played oh shit here we go now where the heck is battlfield 2018 trailer or teaser huh lol this trailer is so awful i thought the first one was pretty crap to be honest it was almost a total ripoff of the fallout franchise some nice backgrounds yeah but closeup textures looked bloody terrible the gameplay was meh too so no i dont care much about this game nooooo i want tes6 not this trash looks like some weird mad max battle royale shit trailer no gameplay dosent give me the slightest nudge to wanting to buy it no one asked for a sequel well just from seeing this trailer i dont want to buy the game wtf is this trailer is that real or graphics fucken hell dear bethesda no sincerely everyone for real just make another doom game already and stop this trainwreck before its too late maybe if the first rage was actually a finished product a second game would be enjoyable i enjoyed the first one by why make another all these years later will buy this game the first rage game is good its not good like borderlands but its a good game so their adding some wolfenstein spice to the mix im game dual wielding different factions and it seems we can actually customize characters rather than have the same dual one in the first one this is what happens when you put your 4050 year old marketing team to make a trailer based on their idea of what teenagers find cool and interesting nowadays i like the game but this trailer stinks an amalgamation of fallout madmax and borderlands after this live action trailer its a real big miss for me i liked the og rage as well this is just awkward i hated the last one and i didnt want a silly post apocalyptic game we have boarderlands for that gives me the mad max vibe i might buy this this trailer serves no purpose its garbage reminds me of watchdogs 2 have an entirely different tone than the first game and doesnt take itself seriously i think the game could be good but the trailer is just so bad was hoping for a 3rd person option lost opportunity on character customisation i dont get all the hate on the trailer i mean its an okay trailer certainly not on the level of past games published by bethesda but i think its still a pretty neat trailer and me personally im stoked for a sequel to rage the first one was good with the capacity to be great if not for a few shortcomings and if they remedy those shortcomings i dont see why rage 2 wouldnt be a great game looks like feministes and gays made this game lol and the one sucked maybe the next one will be good i expect purple blood the dicks people would suck for money nice to see that bethesda is working hard on elder scrolls 6 2000 copies sold worldwide type of game what in the fuck was this kinda surprised to see a rage sequel after all it underperformed at retail didnt it thats usually the killing blow for a franchisepotential franchise this took a lot of percocetsecstasy to make this trailer come get me when they announce elder scrolls 6 who asked for this oh boy a sequel to a shitty game that looks like its done the impossible by looking even shittier than the first without even showing any game footage way to go bethesda you make maryland proud wait who gave a fuck about the first one for it to warrant the development of a second the 1st game was pretty good but i dont know i dont think i would play the 2nd one it wasnt that great a unless some really good improvements look forward to gameplay tho the first game was really really good right up until the ending it was a lame as ending because of some nameless authority or whatever as the main protagonist but the rest of the game in the story was great this trailer looks like s looks like they put it together in a hurry and man it shows if this fails id just straght going into fail train the weirdest part about this is that its developed by the swedish avalanche studios as in the creators of just cause 12 and the mad max game its not le id tech the chic with blue hair has a much better dental plan than everyone else hey mad max no its just fucking rage hopefully they got rid of that awful texture popping if the gameplay and story can match this tone i will be in 100 this looks dumb as shit and fun as hell the first one took its self way to seriously im sure the game will be amazing but that trailer was terrible a sequel to a game we didnt care for a week after release pretty bad trailer not the worst ive ever seen but its pretty out there now if it were only a sequel to a game that people actually cared about i dont know whats with all the hate in the comments never even heard of the first game but when i see a mad max esque world with the bethesda name i get hyped oh god they went the saints row route no one asked for this wtf a new mad max would of been better yeeees finaly there will be part 2 please have better level design than the first dont make me battle 100 bad guys to get to the end and find the trap door that automatically takes me home or something stupid like that again it all felt horribly inconvenient and cheap good game and the worst trailer of the year trailers like this make me what the game even less real life actors imitating video games are either super cringe or really good most of the time its the first okay i have several questions firstly why is bethesda doing so many sequels to games that nobody asked for sequels for wolfenstein doom the evil within prey though thats more of a reboot dishonored and now rage granted i guess its okay to give these series an additional chance at life but are these series really lucrative enough to justify this decision wolfenstein and doom id believe dishonored is pushing it but id still buy it the evil within prey and rage i honestly doubt heavily secondly given the rise of internet culture and specifically in relation to online parodies after the rise of team four star was this song really the best idea after hellsing ultimate abridged basically grafted it to alucard furthermore is using existing music really a good idea in the first place given that series that try that generally dont go over well especially given that to my understanding bethesda is a company thats doing fantastically in comparison to many sounds like a burnout song this looks like shit mad max feels superior heres what the game will be an open world survival game like borderlands with a strong narrative focus with co op and a focus on doom style combat fighting mutants across several biomes and a over the top character customization the game will have nothing to do with the first game but be set in the same universe with maybe some of the original characters and many other flamboyant and exotic characters similar to the first game on top of all that they will probably shell out some kind of competitive co op experience with random events that pop up while you play co op like car racing killing the most enemies in a specific way or accuracy contest this will most likely be the most generic rpg you can play but with solid combat mechanics and a good engine with good graphics 710 ign too many mutants what a load of shit no one cares for rage so a live action trailer does sweet fuck all if you didnt care before you wouldnt now first game was rubish second game trailer is utter trash the fuck good to see andrew wk is still around weird that he made a song that isnt about partying i personally am not a big fan of post apocalyptic titles i hate mad max rage 1 and pretty sure that wont change with this title plus the trailer looks gross rage was constantly on sale for 5 on steam i still didnt buy it that was gross looks to be a vr game cant wait to see what it turns out to be who asked for this no seriously who the fuck asked for this he needs a kick in the ass i walked in on my parents doing it but this is still the worst thing ive seen all day the first rage was so underrated not one person asked for this the worlds most over priced piece of shit ever where is the new elder scrolls did anyone else feel some battle royal undertones to this trailer i have no idea why but i just got that vibe maybe its just me and my hate for battle royal games but did man i hope not i have a fear that we will get s crap ton of royal games this e3 and would hate this go be the start of the invasion of crap who ask for this i dont remember the first game did well what the fuck so where getting a sequel to a game with not one original idea was made more or less on the canceled doom 4s assets and textures and was a shit show technically on release meanwhile the canceled prey by humanhead studios is not getting a second chance so is this id making rage 2 lets hope not they should be working on the next doom not this conclusion alucard did it better to think of all the bethesda games people actually want sequels for lets hope bethesda pulls something off with this like how dishonor 1 wasnt the best but the second was great lets just hope this can make the comeback and not be overhyped oh thats what theyve been working on eh gotta pass on this one ummmmmm what this looks awful i dont care rage was garbage who cares about this really lovin some andrew wk but like who is this supposed to appeal to well to be totally honest you guys id rather have this than another skyrim remaster e3 2099 a cryogenic chamber is rolled onto the stage a once thought dead game director steps out bethesda is proud to announce skyrim the next elder scrolls game is still currently not in production steps back into cryo chamber i suddenly feel like going for a walk andrew wk automatically makes this game 1010 tank girl the video game not the game i wanted out of bethesda this reminds me of that mlp cupcake video even if the game is good that was the worst trailer ive ever seen i already have no faith in this they had 1 chance to hype ppl up for this game because of the shit show that was the last game and this vid did not do it lol can thank walmart for the leak the first few times i sow this trailer i found it awful but it grew on me kind of like it so this is borderlands 3 soooo this is the game bethesda has been working on i mean yea its pretty cool i guess but i feel like elder scrolls 6 should be the focus rn ok yeh definitely wanna play this local coop what a f rediculous trailerno way in hell i am interested in that garbage i asked for this i dont remember rage having this much character and pink i boughragefor 4 it was worth 4 best way to kill e3 for sure an underrated hidden gem still dont know if that warrants a sequel i want this game in my mouth now wow the graphics look really good so cringy when they get real people to do shit like this i bet you i am the only person in this comment section thats actually stoked for a sequel i enjoyed the hell out of the first game it was short but it was beautiful and a lot of fun its very colorful can someone explain to me how neon hair dye is so plentiful in all of these post apocalyptic worlds that song makes me want some cupcakes wait wasnt the first game shit thank you bethesda seriously thank you for this ive been waiting for this literally the only thing that came to my mind watching this trailer was ew lmao mad max mod for fallout 4 confirmed i dunno thought this looked goofy and fun in a good way well see with the gameplay but its not like the first game mattered so whatever trailer is like shitawful thanks walmart for leaking this do people actually get excited watching these nothing ads theres no gameplay footage and nothing about the actual game is revealed the only things this accomplished is to announce the existence of the game and put off potential customers with this insulting cornball gag reel its 2018 companies need to stop advertising like its 1918 wow of all the games did not expect this to be announced did anyone ask for this no disrespect but this is a garbage trailer for anything is id developing please let there be more content than the first but why its looks like mad max being beaten to death by a punky rainbow what the fuck is this battle toads am i the only one who thinks the chick with the blue mohawk is kinda hot 53 seconds of cringe fest sigh bugthesda where the african americans at welcome to the apocalypse welp e3 has got a pretty lame intro so far hopefully it gets better with sony nintendo what in the fuck is this woooo what a great suprise cringey ass announcement trailer bethesda release game game isnt elder scrolls bethesda fail i really enjoyed first game back in the day still have it on pc as well lets hope its not a flop that teaser was so over the top lol no one asked for this what the fuck is this i just had to go to the bathroom to wash my eyes im hoping this one is better the first one was boring and dry i sense a tone shift i guess nobody wants be dark like the dc universe any more i miss the edgy ness of rage 1 cringe not about it what the fuck was that i am so turned off by it already the fact that this is being made by avalanche gives me some hope get ready to die i can already see it now is rage 2 the dark souls of fpss this is like a bad metal core music video so edgy well the trailer was shitty this is cool hoping for a co op experience if only a game like this supports split screen co op also would be huge which i know wont happen now im really hoping splinter cell is real haha this game is gonna fucking suck flop the first one had graphics that were way ahead of its time that ugh that was not a trailer that was pure cringe and whoever thought it was a good idea should be beaten with a hose this is one of the worst things ive ever seen in my life mad max college years does anyone actually give a fuck about this shit are you sure this aint mad max this trailer is shit im excited but this trailer went on for a little longer than im comfortable with do they never watch trailers back and be like this is cringey as shit maybe we shouldnt mabe this one wont come out 10 years after the announcement hahah what this is amazing walmart was telling the truth rated e for everyone despite all my rage i am still just a nic in a cage fuck yes i know rage wasnt a popular game but ive been dying for a second instalment for the last 7 years the trailer looks fucking weird but who cares its rage the walmart leaks is real borderlands 3 splinter cell is coming mad max but with lsd in getting it because i fucking love this song and rage and this why you musnt do drugs kids this is a mistake i believe in bethesda i believe that rage 2 will deliver what a stupid trailer loot crates coming soon this seens like a cringe teen rock video clip andrew wk get ready to die 3 shut up and take my money this is the worst teaser i have ever seen the music is awful like jesus christ for some reason only orquestal music matches madness and cars mad max name of the song is this by id software its about time rage got a sequel ive been wanting to know what happened to the other survivors 2007 called they want their edgy game back i enjoyed the demo for rage 1 but thats about my history with the franchise ill wait for gameplay to form an opinion as this looks intriguing cool they colors mean customization or whatwas now that much color in the first one well i never gave the first one a try so ill definitely try the sequel out hopefully it turns out to be great huh i never expected to hear about rage again the first one had a garbage story and terrible ending but the shooting was top notch hope this one is an improvement also the blade boomerang was hilarious i really liked the first game but i really feel they got too inspired by the recent mad max movie btw the song is ready to die andrew wk looks interestingsee what happens with the gameplay reveal lol words never said man i realllllyyyy want bethesda to make a rage 2 this game is gonna sell poorly i was a bit thrown off at first so much hype for a reveal that turned out to be just a live action trailer disappointing till i saw the end that theres a gameplay reveal tomorrow does certainly seem that theyre going for a much more chaotic lighthearted tone judging from this trailer not sure what to think yet thanks walmart cringeworthy kinda seems like theyre taking huge inspiration from mad max fury road tf this a battle royale first rage was alright but not really rememberable thought this would be an e3 announcement this is 2006 i loved rage i hope this trailer isnt representative of the actual game because without connect just dance mad max wont be worth a buy pretty much every post apocalyptic desert bandit settingthemed thing is inspired by mad max no one is plagiarizing it all had to start somewhere is this the game that were getting from bethesda game studios or are they going to announce starfield if the borderlands series mad maxxand death race had a test tube baby after watching the resident evil extinction movie i dnt really feel any excitment or hype from this at allkinda gave me a headache to be honest lol please dont release this game bye call of duty same game again hi rage 2 played the first one and never finished it no one asked for this man ummmmas a huge fan of the first rage game despite its obvious unfinished elements and abrupt ending also adding the fact that ive dreamed of a sequel for years thinking that itll never happenthis trailer was utter trash if this in any indication of the tone of the sequel then consider this fan crossed off the list of eager buyers i remember liking rage more from its gameplay then the story taking lessons from doom and wolfenstein it could be fun i just hope the story and openworld is better i really dont like bethesda rest in piece a once cool game company nobody asked for this i didnt ask for this you didnt ask for this adam jensen didnt even ask for this shiny and chrome what a shitty advertisement the person made this and the person who approved it should both be fired literally no one wanted this lmao im pumped already i loved the first one i needed this it gave me something too live for why does the music sound like the product of a screamo metal song and one up girl from mario fucking hardcore in a back ally should i even bother asking i hope it fails badly where tf is es6 at bethesda now showing the sequel that noone asked for lol hellsing abridged theme song battle royal mode confirmed hm interesting eh not excited rage had great feeling combat and looked good but it was so outdated when it came out poor story annoying characters weak missions let down of an endgame forgettable soundtrack and predictable level design what the sequel no one asked for lol 7 years later they finally announce a sequel if you go back to before rage 1 came out they had already talked about how they would make a sequel to it thats how condifent they were in it lol if this game is 2x as good as rage was it will be ok dunno if the game will be good but i know for a fact this trailer is pure garbage quite honestly does anyone actually care about this i bet this is going to be yet another battle royale vying for space in an already saturated market if so make it f2p or go home bethesda shit apparently they misspeled the name the correct one is gayge 2 this is ummweird hang on is id software not helming this their logo is nowhere to be seen just bethesdas because uh im not super stoked for it if id isnt developing it im sure bethesda will do fine with it but i want more rage not a spiritual successor to fallout with the rage property taped to the front cover no thk its finally here it will feel a bit like mad max as avalanche studios have coworked on this game lets see who saved their racing certificates wow looks like crap these are the guys that made fallout and skyrim people i feel like this might actually be awesome but ill have to see some game play first hopefully this one has a better ending so there will be coopmultiplayer thats what i got from the trailer mad max is the masterpiece and hokuto no ken is better than this always this was a pretty terrible reveal live action was an awful choice its always a good sign when a video game announces itself with a cringy liveaction trailer if the shitty greenscreen effects didnt sell you maybe the forgettable punk soundtrack will i know id software made the first one but i have a feeling machine games is making this game id is already working in quake champions and probably doom 2 i could see machinegames and tango revealing games at this years e3 and revealing that theyre also multiteam studios just like id and arkane the leaks were true 1st rage ending was hella unfinished and i hoped for some dlc to fill it but this this is way better team that did doom working on this sign me up rage 1 is like borderlands 1 but with less jokes now it seems like rage 2 is going to be like borderlands 2 but with less jokes or just like what watchdogs 2 is to the watchdogs 1 trying to lighten up after the oh so serious first game i dont know lmao its real is anyone gonna play it though this is more a mad max video game that the actual mad max video game switch version the amount of people saying this copied mad max is too high to be acceptable at least they didnt waste an e3 reveal on this everyones just fucking complaining but we should all be happy that bethesda is making so many great single player games of which at least in my opinion have never been disappointing at least in more recent memory they have faith in the developers and their vision if they want to make rage 2 fuck it lets make that it could be great this also gives me hope that a prey sequel might come out in the future despite how underrated it is wingstick is back bitches who asked for this shit this is a game or movie the cringe is real bethesda make any game except a new elders scrolls game the game no one asked for wat was that why the first one was crapand short didnt think people would want a sequel yeahh imma keep waiting for dead island 2 cant wait for the best ai of any game ever to make a return oh hey walmart was right oh no walmart was right half life 3 confirmed i trust id software after i saw what they did to doom looking forward to this andrew wk is perfect for this game beard physics confirmed soooo no starfield wellyou have my attention what cancer did i just watch atleast make a final boss this time please so basically just a mad max game with bethesda as developers how original played the first on ps3 it was actually pretty good wished it was doom continuation this is the shittiest game trailer ive ever witnessed shitty music actor everything seriously im gonna sue this trailer cut me from too much edge mad max meets fallout anyone else get a battle royale vibe also how come andrew w k is not used more often in trailers this mustve been one of the worst trailers ive ever seen if mad max and borderlands had a gross love child that was thrown off a cliff landed in a cactus farm then set on fire with battery acid you got this is that a quake crossover cool a sequel no one asked for ib4 but i did gtfo i hope you still play as one of those time capsule people garbage trailer hope the actual game isnt just as shitty please no multiplayer please no multiplayer who asked for this its gonna be buried six feet under by borderlands 3 they were right this doesnt make me want to play the game trailer probably made in a rush because of the leak game should look amazing in the new doom engine i love andrew wk it will look glorious on my 4k tv via the xb1x xboxfor the players wait i thought they had the wrong font on the leak so it was fake looks off in my opinion give us a switch version excellent song choice i love andrew w k cant wait for e3 ummmmmmm the fuck this looks like something only edgelords will play a game nobody actually wanted by a studio that doesnt understand what its audience wants next its been so many fuckin years hope they have something better than this at e3 the game industry seems to be spinning its wheels the only thing i got from this trailer at 015 youre life is falling out falling out falloutits all coming together well at least they used the best andrew wk song fuck this i want skyrim 2 next project by machine games loved the first game walmart was right edgy with a hint of goof these are the spices for a fun game question is how is the main dish wheres terry crews pass you can keep this sony it looks like its having fun instead of being super serious nice try but they already made a mad max game gameplay reveal morrow also who asked for a rage 2 that was fucking awful fuck ya loved the first rage that moment when bethesda parodies its own game so it means that the leaks ff7r omg no money for real trailer this looks stupid and it looks like a copy of mad max i thought it was a movie lmao co op car combat this time i liked the first one but this looks so bad rage 1 was disappointing i was expecting it to be like fallout but it was so bare bones i hope theyve improved 2 im actually hyped to see what the game will be like as someone who loves the first rage dearly wtf was this trailer that was bethesda oh lord in hell i hope starfield or whatever its called shows up soon im worried about bethesda if this is all they got yknow who could have seen this coming if only they had dropped we subtle hints on twitter fuk now im gonna have nightmares fist of the north starthe game the remake how dare you steal alucards theme song this is mad max but colorful ready to die andrew wk id rather have a sequel to doom 2016 than this this trailer was probably made in a rush because of the leak so sad that this more than likely had to be released early because of the walmart leak oh hell yes been waiting for this for so dayum long lets just hope this one does not come out a buggy mess like the first one anyone remember when they blamed graphic card manufacturers for the games horrible performance loved the first game dont get me wrong but damn was it a buggy mess every time you travel to a new location you crossed your fingers hoping the game wont crash skyrim post apocalyptic edition who asked for this i cringed tell you what im fuckin pumped for this game mad max sim 2 coming for linux this fall gayest trailer ever i see complaints that this is just a mad max clone but id like to point out that with bethesdas track record this will likely be a improved version i for one am always for improvement of preexisting formulas i m so confused is this borderlandsmadmax would someone please tell who tf asked for this plz dont whats with all the mad max comparisons this game had the same aesthetics as the fist one that came out in 07 must be cause of fury road and the mad max game so that definitely means new splinter cell then we already knew this existed and we still dont have a clue what this looks or plays like so this announcement meant nothing other than to give us cringe rage again 2 where you gather the best weapons and there is no final boss to use them on what is that shit is bethesda on drugs too edgy so that ending for 1 killed me on the game i hope they let you start where it left off at what the absolute fuck was that im optimistic about this what a bohem what the fuck is with all the pink way too pink for a bethesda title are they trying to get all the female consumers ready to die is giving me hellsing ultimate vibes walmart ruined this games reveal its pretty sad because i was shocked that they even considered a sequel i woulda been more hyped if i didnt know the game was coming and a reveal trailer like this was showed stupid walmart always screwing up this looks like colorful mad max movie where is starfield mad max crossover borderlands looks good i legitimately forgot this franchise even existed doesnt bode well i wasnt too impressed by the first one think i will wait for the game to come out and watch some youtubers play it before i make up my mind guys we didnt ask for this really the first one came out like 7 years ago was this necessary hellsing mlp and now rage can be added to the list of media this song has been used in oh great a sequel to a game that had one of the shittiest endings in videogame history a gameplay trailer coming this soon fuck yeah im pumped for the sequel since i loved the first game but this trailer was just awful what oh what were they thinking my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined this looks like it will be hot garbage cringe wow the graphics look so life like this game play trailer most be running on the high graphics of a nintendo switch uktra 4k undocked mode on 5 low battery mode this is the polar opposite of the original it was very atmospheric and took itself serious what the fuck is this shit quite the gameplay trailer this is obviously because theyre pissed at us for going on about es6 i guess walmart was right wtf is this how did that game manage get a sequel vietnam flash back of rage 1 ending i was sorta pumped for this game then i watched this thing feels like my dad says slang words that he thinks my gen think is cool bethesda you dont have to put the anarchy in the rage logo to know how edgy it is wow didnt expect rage 2 better be longer than the first i really didnt like this trailer lol but why no thanks next its like mad max and tony hawks american wasteland withness me also was that the song used as the intro to hellsing ultimate abridged nope its the one where alucard makes his boss entrance that later segways to the party party party song this looks like splatoon but with more violence please let bl3 be here soon am confused graphics are promising tumblr apocalypse this looks like its trying way too hard cgi trailer bolocks meh still got rage on xbox 360 and red dead redemption on ps3 would rather see another elder scrolls from bethesda and gta from rockstar the first rage didnt make me rage it made me yawn looks as disappointing as the first just trash that is all no more battle royales please i dont need more shallow multiplayer gank fests im hoping this is a deep single player fps i love andrew wk i didnt finish but the first one was good i should go back and finish cant wait for the actual game they will announce at e3there will be one rightthis isnt it is it is this supposed to get me excited was this trailer made in 9 hours is this another version of mad max pink is a peaceful colour is this the universe from rick and morty where morty gets a giant arm and rick steals some crystals it was a terrible trailer sooo the song was more than perfect for the trailer but the trailer itself first i taught this is a fan made prank sequel but when i saw it is not well we will see when it comes out i dont know a single person who wants this i dont know a single person who has mentioned rage since shortly after its release maybe they have a ton of fans out there i dont know about but ive never met one the sequel might turn out to be a good game but its an odd choice of games to give a sequel theyre hyping the sequel like its an eagerly awaited title will it still cost 025 like the original tottaly rage can think of quite a few games i would have preferred they reveal over this one the original rage so bad and trashfuck this one toonot even consider buy even if it gets 90 reviewscancer flop lets hope the multiplayer is good never played the first one i do like the light heartedness of this though this game is no longer to be forgotten anymore not mad at all is this a trailer about those people from the road rash menu screen well that was awful i am pleasently surpised basically saying rage is back and it will be stupidly fun this time just looking at that thumbnail dropped i hope they fixed the save system lmao no one asked for this so rage 2 is a junk rat family reunion yesssssss i love this andrew wk song its perfect for this game i didnt like mad max but this looks interesting to say the least oww so this is the new cheap to make fallout lol the graphics looked amazing how they make it look so real sarcasm is this the star field replacement damn bethesda why a few youtube channels rubbished this when it was included in that leaked canadian pre order list id like to say from walmart but im not sure looks like its true still not sure on the forza horizon 5 listing though lol after playing rage and witnessing this abortion of a trailer i can safely say i am concerned for bethesda who the fuck wanted this holy shit they used andrew wks ready to die hahaha awesome why we can have nice things i hope gameplay gonna look like the game of the year material because this looks like sht well good thing this is out of the way besthesda i hope you have other things for e3 to announce finally oh alright bethesda making a new game you sure this isnt skyrim version 208 for the microwave fell like weve waited ages for this sequel not much of a surprise if youve been up to date with e3 leaks lol tf what in the holy hell i would have rather watched this revealed at e3 but friggin canadian walmart had to mess that up haha this is a terrible trailer to introduce a game to people welcome to new jersey bad trailer well know one expected this game to come out before the leaks of walmart so it really make you thing that the leaks are correct and were getting bordeland 3 and splinter cell looks cool but doesnt look like my kind of game this is trash damn this new mario looks amazing i really enjoyed the first game i just hope they dont make it too funky well this could be be like prey in terms of keeping the name but changing everything else so it is its own story not sure if rage 2 or a really weird mad max bootleg i quite liked rage this trailer though this looks like its going to abolish all credibility the first game had for fuck sake bethesda hey isnt this alucards theme song when you crossbreed mad max with a nickelodeon commercial hell yes the first game was a proper underslung gem much graphics such wow at the time meh 10 on the i care scale so if thats true i hope they are kidding with this so glad this wasnt skyrim for the heart rate monitor would have been nice as a surprise but you know some stupid fucking american had to fuck it all up this is just another creation club skyrim mod and btw bethesda is also releasing skyrim for airconditioners and refrigerators get ready to die witness me this ad was terrible but im excited for the game ive already played this it was called mad max not sure why they are making this game but maybe it is something like borderlands 3 or destiny sandbox confirmed nice hot topic commercial when first was coming out i thought it will be some kind of stalkermadmaxfallout mix but it fallen short maybe now i actually asked for this thanks bethesda e3 is going rock the game literally no one asked for new mad max game is awesome this trailers almost almost as bad as the the first game there it is the game nobody asked forno seriously who asked for this literally nobody asked for this game make another elder scrolls sharpen the meatbicycle and shout your lungs out to the neverending slaughter of plebistic meatbags make it rain guts and blood on our faces and rejoice for the postapocalyptic war of shining metal this is bad nobody asked for this rage 1 was pretty decent ill buy rage 2 if gameplay is enjoyable that game trailer was absolutely horrible holy fuck the walmart leaked list turns out to be true xd guess a new ac game is also coming this year it would be pretty funny if this trailer was fake and they were just trolling walmart and us do we actually need this sequel i will wait for gameplay so much yes lmao walmart spoiled this i didnt know e3 was this early that was an awful trailer brink 2 maybe as well wow is it just me or did this trailer just come off as really dumb i got contact high from watching this i liked the first rage but this looks awful did i just saw a trailer from a new mad max game or was i being trolled lol i loved the first game and am actually excited to get the new game my only worry is way back in ps3 days the games file size 50gb was so huge of that time and unheard ofnow that couldmight double for ps4 omg im gonna go out on a limb and say it has a battle royale mode if you close your eyes the whole way through it sounds like this was a reveal for a new sonic game this trailer sucked still pumped for the game i think will have battle royals mode elder scrolls six please im not asking for much but no we get this instead who wanted this i know i know i know im sure theres fans out there dont send me nasty comments i just really want the elder scrolls six is this a mod for skyrim what a fuck i knew they would fuck this up is this what they really think we want shit fallout raider in a nutshell that was extremely colorful reveal trailer because walmart canada leaked it before e3 lets hope the game is better than this abortion of a trailer who ever come up with that needs sacking with immediate effect wtf this trailer was ass but cant wait for gameplay tomorrow but why lets hope its not a dumpster fire like the first one was i hope who bui the game story is not the same who wrote the script for the trailer hopefully this one doesnt have a stupid ending still im excited we want the borderlands audience thanks walmart oh okay that took me by surprised right thereall i ask is that the 2nd rage explains the missing parts of the first onejust saying this looks like a game made by the cast of watchdogs 2 it alldepends on the gameplay no use giving us a mad max type hype if the gameplay is shit why is some games so crazy now a days i got the funny feeling im going to playing this song when the gaming industry hits the point of no return and crashes or maybe just then end of ea and activision not excited they have ruined it at first look that music was horrendous couldnt get through more than 20seconds maybe in the future dont get your sons shitty band to score the trailer so the leaks were true why does this look like a fallout madmax game trying to be like borderlands but is john goodman in it though ew at that filthy thirdwave feminist on the thumbnail greetings from alucard what is this im very confused by what just happened dont suck so e3 is pretty much useless now coolcoolcooli feel like 910 times i just have to rely on hope for games these days thanks walmart this couldnt be an e3 surprise from bethesda themselves get ready to get 100 completed hehe dat trailer made me want to kill myself so much edge all i want is fallout 3 10th year anniversary remaster 3 my mother cant wait to see me sitting in my room 247 cringe damn madmax fuck fallout and had a 2 kid too much plastic hopefully they dont blue ball us with this ones ending like they did with the 1st why even bother with this trailer if gameplay is revealed tomorrow bethesda is a weird but amazing company i forgot that rage existed oh its only rage 2 lol i was hoping for an important reveal this teasers is pretty cringey lets just hope that the gameplay is good awful trailer but im sure the game will be fun i might as well wait for the gameplay and then complain edit i just now watched the gameplay trailerhmmmmm idk man i might give it a try awesome i love this game its in my top 5 favorites trailer was wack as hell tho but i think its meant to be like that so people talk about it but looking forward to this tf did i just witness woohoo man i hope they stick the landing this time i loved the first one up until it ended abruptly most disappointing ending ever was there a rage 1 this is more like the live action tv spots you get closer to release rather than an announcement trailer well maybe it is a tv spot they just uploaded in a hurry but where muh starfeild or fallout 5 or elder scrolls 6 says the dipshits who cant accept that not everyone is stuck in a nostalgia trap circa 2009 i like the first one hope this ones better if this is more multiplayer than singleplayer i will be pissed probably this will have more colorful theme than first game yeah hopefully no multiplayercoopshit campaign i loved the first one and saw the potential of an open world single player fps that song was for walmart canada wtf lol wtf is this that was different well i always thought a sequel would be a good idea because the first game pretty fun so much for star field ohh walmart oh my e3 oh myavalanche studiosubisoftmicrosoft im waiting this should have been fist of the north star excuse me but im a fuckmothering vampire i killed a lot of people to get this title i deserve to be called such didnt see this one coming tbh the teaser looks good but rage was shit rage 1 was good hope this is as good or even better hmmm a lot of people are first i still remember finishing the last mission and thinking what went wrong because the ending was a lose end hopefully id software is making doom 2 as well xbone losers are hungry for an actual game lmao i actually really enjoyed rage thanks walmart im glad theyre making a sequel but damn that was a terrible terrible trailer what is genre of this gams i never play it before no one cares if your first or not i did not expect this there better be character creation wohha knew it this walmart ca doing i dont think anyone was asking for a mad max rip off so rumors are true huh why im not surprised the sequel we never knew we needed 1 chip falls lets see what other rumors are true wow that song brings back memories first 1st comment i win cookies now first what a surprise wait the beginning is a reference to pickle and peanut guys who were waiting for doom before it got delayed here is your doom get this dlc m getting this game at black friday and the blood and the gore this is not rage anymore it s doom whats not to love i dont understand halloween is everyday this is doom 4 game is dead rage 2 was terrible boring characters a plot that barely existed and weak guns it was like a fallout looter shooter if only there was a month were this dlc could would be relevant rage 2 is boring and stupid no guys you got it all wrong they are really early for next year can you get it ready by halloween b we got work out the bugs ok release it late nice ill try it on xbox gamepass its not halloween related has this game a flashlight now very cool is this a free update thats an update rip rage 2 this game is dead rage 1 was better than this shi not much different than jedi fallen pass bethesda had done it again should have just made this its own game and not made rage 2 he sound like dr doofenshmirtz from phineas and ferb i am confusedis this a halloween themed update10 days b4 thanksgiving everyone shouldve released this on halloween also everyone plays the dlc even after halloweens over is this for free is this an out of season halloween event i miss the scorchers l thislooksdope yes but is it free is bethesda using internet explorer very cool love the sword i hope they make more dlc for this game id love a christmas dlc maybe call it ragemas cool reminds the game darkwatch does anyone know if i can get the trophies or achievements with this 5 upgrade or if i need to pay 1750 game looks like its nearly out of beta i want it how much is this i cant be bothered to put the disc in and do the rage points conversions right now bit late for a halloween update halloween has past already i wish i waited for all the dlc before playing dont care about other comments as long as there are more content im happy why did the they release this before halloween i completed the dlc in 2 hours i already finisht it it is so short the deadlands are super small i realy like this game but this dlc is bad similar to borderlands so this basically those tower game modes in mobile games then except this time it looks way more entertaining and worth while hahaha destiny 2 festival of the lost but in rage 2 can kill gaurdians poopy head who would play we got borderlands 3 found this game to be pretty mediocre this is cool for free right what is this doesnt feel like rage at all considering the timing it would have been better to call it turkeymania so when are we getting christmas dlc valentines day this game was forgotten the moment it was launched rage is the internet explorer of the videogames christmas content will arrive in easter week make mobile ps3 emulator and all games roms woaah i hope im a youtuber who can play this someday btw see my youtube this is like releasing christmas dlc in january hmm reason to come back it is november right a mix between darksouls undead and rages colourful palette funny thing is i came up with a concept for a postapoc game literally called the deadlands the gameplay would have been a mixture between gta doom and fallout sony give us dont starve together in december i clearly sold mine because it was just a huge disappointment wait this isnt borderlands 3 interesting i thought this was borderlands for a sec combat gameplay mechanics excellently some of the very best in the open world genre graphics b everything else like open world design story etc runofthemillaverage at best overall a 710 especially didnt like how rage 2 dumbed down mad maxs vehicular combat more than expanding upon it deepening it 95 of the open world was void of anything interesting even nonmission structures every single one of them were unrewardingsave for a crate of one of the horribly basic loot resource system is it halloween today now we could fight the immortal shrouded with honor its november tho lol looks funny this is dope theres nothing more depressing than halloween content after the party is over just in time for its inclusion into gamepass im getting some strong evil dead vibes from this xd love it i probably would have bought this dlc if it wasnt exclusively on the rage mtx store also upset that this isnt part of the original deluxe edition that i spent an extra 20 for cool this is doom dlc waaaaaait a second hold my beer halloween is already over or did i miss something this is what happens when you dont crunch you release seasonal content late borderlands with doom ahh thats basically doom with skeletal monsters im loving it remember doom eternals crucible sword well this is rage 2s answer just in time for halloween next year happy halloween rage 2 we got death stranding great game but it didnt need an open world keeping the halloween spirit i love it terrormania is the skydiver that pulled the cord too early and is just watching everyone else walk away from the landing zone looka sword me i better off playing skyrim than these most underrated game of the year gameplay wise this is a video game thats what matter the most its straight up amazing its almost christmas this game flopped shortest disappointment of a game needed dlc badly too little too late it looks like free halloween dlc they cut up and sold to player very cool awesome i put a lot of time in rage 2 cant wait to start it up again a couple of weeks late for that kind of dlc doom eternal got delayed did this from a month ago the tilted towers ps4 do rust for free plz rage 2 turning into doom who trying to 1v1 woah this game is alive cant wait for the game of the year edition thanks in advance are they high finally pretty crazy fun rage 2 was over hyped ps4 you neet to do rust in de store not this thats nice subscribe to my channel guys rage 2 is so underrated i hope there wil be more dlc why didnt they release this on halloween perfect just in time for hallowe oh wait doom eternal is the only thing that will save bethesda forgot to release on halloween a long awaited dream finally come back and its even better but for real what is this song and who made it its even better then i saw i dont buy bethesda games fallout76 was enought this seems like mixture of borderlandswolfenstein and doom old days were bettermost games had something that set it apart from other games good games certainly had uniqueness about it this is what happens when d00m mad max and borderlands have unprotected threesome sex this ir what doomguy use to do before mars invasion i have a feeling this game is going to be a flop just give us release date doom eternal already crappy music sorry but outlanders and borderlands 3 are coming rage is a game that no one will really buy because everyone is too focused on borderlands 3 yeah i was all on board until the very end parts of the game being locked behind a fucking preorder is about as shitty as it gets its basically doom in a different universe lool what is rage 2 copy of doom 2016 but with vehicles more enemies and open world bethesda i swear to god if you ruin this or doom eternal the community will bury you looks cool and all but why play this instead of borderlands 3 best looking fps yet imo add another network mode derby and of course battleground how do we go about requesting fov for console this trailer is the one which finally helped me figure it out it reminds me of bulletstorm its like if id made bulletstorm i know bulletstorm wasnt critically or commercially well received but i had a fun time and so thats a good thing for me personally ive always been more of fan of the story and writing in games but rage 1 felt like it lacked in both story and gameplay this one at least looks like it has the latter down cant wait to see how it does ill probably pick it up depending on reviews since it is so close to my birthday bethesda makes some interesting shooter games this game is looking good ill have to keep my eyes on it i wonder if you can get the doom bfg via gameplay somehow as otherwise itd really be the only thing exclusive to the deluxe edition aside from the banner but that one doesnt do anything anyways i need this song plz can i see the legs of the ranger if i look down like in halo series with master chief someone saw the trailers for happy better then days gone flop icantwait to exited for this i hope they have options to turn off the bajillion particle effects what is rage baby dont hurt me dont hurt me no more how about rereleasing rage 1 on ps4 i fancy playing it again but my ps3 sadly died 2 months ago cool god i just hope the story is good the first rage game was awesome gameplay wise but the story sucked i dont even remember it id has definitely delivered gameplay wise yet again now avalanche needs to make sure the story is fun and engaging rage 2 is softcore doom thanks for watching rage was one of the first games i ever played on my channel so im happy to be playing this sequel for you guys i love how there was rage

lesser quality saints row games why would i rage if i am watching zacksttgames tbh this game looks fucking terrible like ps2 levels if anybody says that they hate rage 2 i will kill them almost

late nooo btw 9th pressed video once i got notification play this game if your lose fortnite im early please dont ruin my moment if im not why would i rage if i am watching zackscottgames first best moments in video 47255021 the way jeremy just facepalmed himself when he saw that and i laughed so hard when ryan made that comment afterwards the best part though it happened more than once what the fuck was this hotdog funny shit haha despite the audio lag and the game i had an enjoyable time with this im not sure i like what rage 2 is trying to do the key word there is trying this or days gone please follow me oh man i know its not much but it bothers me so much that the audio doesnt match jeremys mouth xd its making me triggered tbh walker sounds kinda like lindsey or at least the character she plays in gen locke really wanted to watch this but its synced horribly first you hear the game audio then you hear the webcam audio then you see it happen in the game then you see them react nothing is synced to anything couple that with an extremely low volume and i could only make it 9 minutes into the video just unbearable to watch the audio is so out of sync shame cause i would really enjoy watching this if it was done properly i dont understand how a production company of this volume and with this following can have such errors so often from webcams not being started to mics not turned on to streams being out of sync i love watching their stuff and im not going to stop but it makes some videos unwatchable for anyone who came here from between the games 5500 audios out of sync at the start thankfully it fixes itself about 10 minutes in this game is amazing and so are the people the desync between sound and video on web cam is annoying ryan cockaim has to be an homage to battle buddies vs hitler testicle shot one day one day they will get the audio sync with the streams can we just do and oof for that cam desink boring silly game rooster teeth from indie developers to industry shills is the audio weird for anyone else ranger jersey died as he lived shirtless you me that guy and corpsie ryan no hate for rage 2 or anything but this whole rebirthoccultic hiddenhand narrative in all of ubisoftbethesda games is really getting old it also seems like the destruction of the male hero patriarchy it looks like you play as a woman with a friend named lily lilith hmmm id have no problem if that entire first scene didnt make a whole show of those ideas i appreciate your video anyway though believe me people this is not rage for sure but just cause 5 why is the audio gain so fuckin low when i first met marshall he was downstairs not at a bar thats weird dislike unsubscribe too much intoverse this looks like titanfall 2 a long video with jeremy and ryan take all my time please please stop eating during videos i am really enjoying rage 2it is so much fun we did our first thought on our channel towe loved the game so far who is there hairless streamer i dont know what focus does i tend to find that reading helps with that jeremy that there will be more game play soon half the volume very nice more rage please its so hard to look at jeremy i dont know why but the general guy at the beginning seems rather cross its basically shooting and alternate fire of doom vehicle play like mad max blow stuff up and cause chaos like just cause humor of borderlands objectives and side quests like far cry its a great game this looks like such a better single person fpsrpg game than far cry has ever been kinda tempted to pick this up now reminds me of mad max please play more its amazing how clean people and their clothes are in a dusty apocalyptic wasteland only fucking faggets pick female characters whos the cue ball would love to see a jeremy ryan geoff lets watch please they forgot to load jeremys beard lol left as soon as i realized jeremy wouldnt shut the fuck up long enough for the narrator to actually say a single word please get ozzy mans voice pack 4730 bugs that light your day is he just acting or is he really that dumb my favorite part was when gavin stood in front of the camera filming them to film them game look bad on console the intro scene for rage 2 gave me serious nostalgia vibes to the killzone speech scene lol who even are you yes you are live and giving a wonderful lecture on peach and mango flavorings was jeremy having an identity crisis after it was shown that he and chef mike are clones does this game have multiplayer campaign and is it fluid i eat hot dogs without buns also used to eat just hotdog buns with just butter theres a company that makes potato rolls you can polish off a pack of 8 in no time at allmmmmmmm will someone please get that man some hair okay im all for watching cool lets play streams but for the love of god can they please turn off the fucking chat its useless and it gives misleading information because its full of dumbass morons half the time what part of kept away from being an official ranger specifically for this scenario did you guys not get oh wait you guys didnt listen to any of the dialogue ghost aunt expected cross to reappear and that he would try and kill all the rangers and elders so she gave mc ranger rank and authority within the computers and full training while not giving her the official rank thus meaning she only needed the one recording for the mc and thats it jeremy what the fuck did you do to your face did dollar shave club really make you go that far for the sponsorship you should totally turn rage 2 into a lets watchbattle buddies series i was getting the doom vibe as well as a borderlands vibe and at the end when he looks up at the balloon thing i swear they are in sanctuary without the cell shading holy fuck lil j glad to see you survive kings landing shaven jeremy looks like a fetal jason statham the video is so glitchy watched a more in depth video of this for anyone wondering about the game looking bad or whatnot its basically a farcry but with more explosions and more guns anyone interested i recommend watching russian badgers video on it as it was end game and more showcased much better what the game is trying to be good at playing as a human chainsaw wielding two flaming chainsaws chugging energy drinks while lighting yourself on fire who else watched russian badgers video 1923 am i trippin or does that look like a cyborg teddy bear he look real mad too lmao jeremy trying to read ravine was painful the quest for the second storage crate was fantastic along with the hotdog cheer great video adhd the game eh uninteresting gameplay no special guns cod feeling gunplay no flashy stuff feels like timeshift plustoo much ahhhhh women power yaaaaahhh pass not my cup o tea shaved side of the head hairstyle looks ugly on literally any and everyone man he hairless and slimmer ive been way for a while wwwwooooowwwwwthat ai drivingpathfinding doejesus christ does jeremy have eyebrows i cant tell im close to assume that he had a short stint as a buddhist monk right now 716 that has to be the shittiest most degrading and infuriating way to die ive ever seen edit i feel like thats how war is no matter how mighty and legendary you are you still die like a bitch okay is possible to increase the mic volume on streams frankly im having to max out my volume just to even hear people lately if i tab to anything else for a split second i go deaf on some stupid ad looks very much like gears of war i got the boomer rang this looks like fallout new dawn yes jeremy playing rage2 im andrew wk are you ready to rage are you ready to rage are you ready to rage its so fucking frustrating watching these guys play these types of games jesus christ i wish this was a channel that actually gave a crap about playing well and not like a bumbling idiot they dont live up to their name at all anymore 300 since jeremy is a dirty prequel memer i feel the need to say this this is getting out of hand now there are two of them just another far cry nicholas raine is the main character of the first game for those wondering john marshall was the head of the resistance against the authority in the first game i see basic bitch jeremy and all i can say is nope im out why is it so zoomed in hurts my eyes this game looked so motherfucking boring dude stop rambling let me hear some of the game ffs guns boom boom jump and shoot shoot where do i sign up when he said he was in the know the music of the channel played in my head literally his definition whats so complicated about swish swish stab whats up with the steam community these days full of toxic people ratioing everything i honestly believe people think it makes them look cool to dislike games seems like they couldnt give any given npc more than 3 animations man sometimes ryan is the worst kind of gamer we get it stop making us read how things work five hours later oh huh you can totally do that thing thats neat too bad it didnt tell us about it oh it did but i ignored it five hours ago whatever beautiful game as long as they work on the ai a bit this is looking like a great game just gotta say love that shirt awesome design can somebody help i pre ordered the deluxe edition for ps4 and i dont know how to claim my items this game looks like crap it looks like a clone of mad max and a generic shooter hot dogs are better with mustard gotta love how this went form just jeremy to a battle buddies play through ahh yeah the thumb returns jeremy needs to get himself a flos hot dog up in cape neddick me i was so happy when rage 2 dropped me and my dad love rage and hell probably be excited to play this and the menu music is awesome to add avalanche always make big maps but i think rage 2 has a little one best thing is when you start the game with the deluxe edition and you get a massive meteor crashing into the ground right next to you on the road blood red and straight from mars it cracks open on impact concealing the bfg xd this game looks awesome and a great improvement from the first game which i loved the open world looks so fun the egg is growing a fuzz 4733 jeremys reaction is priceless i just read an article about rage 2 the entirety of which was the author being personally offended by the negative use of cleft lips fuck this game and your video and youre stupid advertisement whats jer dying of now ive been drinking bang for a while but it seems like they just started popping up everywhere now whats up with that voldemort before he lost his nose jeremy shaves ah community ive never me this man in my life 1852 those are some nasty looking brown teeth dental hygiene must not be a top priority wow the game looks not great its hard to pay attention to the game with the giant glare on the screen god damnit jeremy why did you shave before recording i cant see id probably buy this if bethesda wasnt involved with it fuck people really look worse when they shave subtitles late to the game just like me really wish people would stop just drinking bang like its nothing you really shouldnt be drinking 300mg of caffeine and small doses of supplements like its water if you arent engaging in strenuous exercise every day all youre going to do to yourself by drinking all of that is get fat baby face jeremy ah rage the illegitimate child of mad max and borderlands that turned out to be significantly more mundane than either one at least it looks pretty hopefully this one is better this stream wasnt about rage 2 but peach mango flavour drink love the look of this game btw edit and love both peaches and mangos jeremy looks like the main character from resistance 2 waaahh clean shaven jeremy now he needs a ear piercing to be mr clean ryan should shave his head and beard too team skinhead xd why does jeremy look like a bad clone of himself after playing and beating both doom and rage 2 the whole quote about the enemies being locked into a room with you is so backwards in doom you have to run around like a scared rabbit hoping to knock enough health off with your pea shooter of a gun until you can melee kill them and hopefully not accidentally kill them with your gun in rage 2 you have amazing abilities cribbed from destiny but still awesome here and powerful andwacky guns and you destroy everything so much fun versus doom being kind of boring due to the monotony not the intensity rage 2 is doom but actually fun im sure this game isnt a masterpiece but i love the art style and goofy humor the setting and world of this game is what draws me in ill def be giving rage 2 a buy as long as the reviews arent terrible and also im not a huge fan of it only being sold through the bethesda launcher but thats a different discussion lol i liked the first rage when it came out this sequel looks even better if its similar gameplay and graphics to doom i will love this game rage 2 is doom with superpowers and cars i finished rage story was great but man i hated the amount of guns in the game and i hated that if i go back to a cleared area its always cleared eegh the original rage was pretty fun this was a completely pointless video like wtf was the point just to say you dont yet know what rage is trying to be can someone slap the skinny guy on the left thank you the pink and purple colors of the hud and the game in general is killing the mood of the game for me at every turn pink and purple colors are repeatedly splashed all over the screen i keep thinking am i watching a barbie or my little pony video while watching rage 2 media i have to remind myself several times that this is a post apocalyptic game the persistent splash of pink and purple prevents the game from feeling like a post apocalyptic world at all to me i loved the first rage played through it three times after seeing the gameplay and trailers of rage 2 i think i will have to pass this franchise is ruined now imo well back to metro redux fallout 4 and the original rage for that great post apocalyptic experience and this is why no one takes you seriously anymore ign did this dude just imply doom was a corridor shooter honestly the most fun i had with the first rage was having to use my brain in firefights every faction had a learning curb to it the wingstick was my best friend against the ghost clan and armor piercing rounds worked wonders against the authority so long as the combat is varied and rewarding im happy well the combat was made by id software the creators of doom so it makes sense i look so much forward to rage 2 i loved rage and beat it multiple times yes the ending was rushed and not great but the overall game was great and is one of the overlooked of last gen and to be honest doom 16 has taken a lot from rage and made it better so i look forward to load up those pop rockets d best ammo in any game d ign your scoring and opinion on games is very inconsistent more so within your organization mainstream waffle the first race is hands down one of my favorite last gen games its great wheres a proper quake n focus on vsuals and phsyx better version of fallout 76 possible ign gave doom 2016 a 7therefore their opinions are worthless cant wait to play this on pc every time i see an ign review or writeup on a game it reminds me more of how trash these people are these are the people diablo mobile was made for i love how game journalist are like i actually finished that game like you dont play games religiously its literally the game nobody asked for better than doom 2016 what was this babble that was awful like the title bottom left of screen did rage 2 learn from doom i dont see the connection why you compare these games seriously you all sound bored negative well as for ryan sounds like he doesnt care anymore mostly negative in unlocked period just saying i really dont trust ign i dont know what to believe with them i feel like i should just wait for doom eternal 204 why put a swear word in then censor it some of the comments in here are genuinely making me scratch my head manrage 2 is coming out in may why cant it come out tomorrow its not horrible its not phenominal its just fine gotcha if rage 2 feels just like doom then it will be awesome i think the wingstick is upgradable rage 2 is made by id software so looks like doom but was also made by avalanche so looks like mad max too its better than the first one the first was amazing except for the ending they said a whole lotta nothin is this made by bethesda because ill pass speaking of which i wish rage was just a open world doom spin off like just cutout all the rage enemies and replace them with demons and give the enviorment a hell on earth skin yes but for me it feels uninspired i mean i played many postap games borderlands 1 2mad maxfallout i get been there done that feel postap is not that interesting for me anymore doom was sick lmao i got it on release and completed it in october this year was one of those games that i couldnt be bothered to complete and just used up space on ps4 so wont be buying rage 2 or doom eternal instantly even though theyre amazing games hail satan hail bethesda but its 60fps even on the consoles i dont like rage 2 because the boomerang didnt kill someone in one hit rage 2 will be one of the best game yeah idc what it is but how does it make you feel ive seen the trailers i know how it looks thanks im not blind guys ign said that rage was great and gave it an 8510and now they act like it was just an ok game with flaws that most people didnt finish soulless game alright men the enemy is coming i want everyone in defensive positions and dontt forget to line the camp with exploding barrels especially those of you that like to work in groups if you dont have an exploding barrel near you you just arent safe when rage 2 will be released rage 2 far cry new dawn fallout 76anyone else getting postapocalypse fatigue also theres that wb mad max game in my steam library which l havent played yet doom was not fun for me and i havent been a fan of the ip rage 2 looks more fun to me hopefully its more isnt than is call me crazy but i want more from my games than just walking down hallways pulling right trigger ign needs to stop comparing games and take them as they are rage 2 looks hella cool these are idiotic people who dont know games doom mad max 12 call of duty rage 2 2019 1resident evil 2

wingsticks are destiny grenades im just hoping bethesdas launcher isnt buggy im positive about the game but im concerned rage 2 really makes you feel like the doom slayer how rage 2 is like far crydawn you can say the same thing with any other game that has a sequel example red dead redemption and red dead redemption 2 watchmen roarshack im not locked in here with you your locked in here with me rage 2 actually looks fun though my brand new xbox one x is always ready its more like mad max 5ifth i actually prefer a more weighted feel than fast and fluid i was hoping this was more like that hi all guys are a little youtuber who really wants to grow on youtube i thank in advance whoever subscribes to my channel totalpino 88 third first want to see extended rage 2 gameplay see our e3 2018 gameplay presentation now httpswwwyoutubecomwatchveluxrbcdlre games like these may not win goty but damn are they fun as hell song from 2001 bethesda softworks no one will know this song who choose the music cupcakes hp what everyone talks about the song and the game itself what no one talks about the same song used in cupcakes hd cupcackes hd 011 when you plug your samsung galaxy into a charger 020 dang tomba grew up badly when his series was cancelled is it just me or do i love this song rage is cool but this game should have been mad max 2 in my opinion lol what the hell was id smoking cause i want it the music really fits with the game and i love that picking ready to die was a pretty sick choice for the trailer great game anyone who says otherwise probably didnt play it or were expecting something completely different only here to hear awesome song of alucard i have no intention to play crappy bugged game the hype is real lol i love id software avalanche studio and bethesda my review of the game compared to this announce trailer is the game is awesome but this revealing trailer is ridiculous too bad this game has been made by bethesda also very bad news the game is full of glitches why did i even hype for this game i really hope i can get the game soon oh what a game what a bad game whats the name of the girl with the blue mohawk i wonder what song was playing while this was recorded lol funny to see that the game comes out exactly same day as the trailerjust a year later this is by far one of the worst commercials ive ever watched imagine being a dev on this game and creating something you cant wait to unveil to worldand then they hire an ad agency that produces this unbelievably cringestorm of liveaction idiots to completely devoid everyone of hype 16 days d days gone given me some relief of bordem the last couple days but finely this is close youre on crack if you think im going to pay 8000 i have the feeling they had fun during the making of this trailer what in the ever loving crap did i just watch they pretty much had already confirmed theres female version of walker with this shot at 012 and 043 can you see the legs of the ranger if you see down the gameplay ive seen for this game looks fun as fuck this is comment 9000 as a gay person i found this trailer to be fucking gay as hell not in a good way to be honest i only had enough money for 1 game this time so i was going to get mortal kombat 11 but looks like im getting this one the song wow i remember pinky pie xd my little pony mad max future no butthurt comments beyond this point please shut your mouths and let others like what they like thank you and fuck off when i get this game im gonna go for an enthusiastic walk doom a game about slaughtering all sources of evil as the unstoppable wargod that is the doomguy wolfenstien facing a never ending tide of nazi horrors as the last free people on the planet rage 2 no rules just guns go fuck shit up ladies and gentlementhe bethesdaid shooter trifecta cringe cant wait to play this the true look of madness and what the mad max game should have been like developped by bethesda crucial fact to know before to buy never noticed this was exactly a year before release 14th may 2018 14th may 2019 looks like a place the crimson fucker would go to fill up on his lifehack did you add this song because of cupcakes hd i see someone watched hellsing abridged why do it have some furious vibe of mad max finallyheckyeah i love idsoft i loved your guys rage game and this is a surprise to me thank you guys rage was always one of those games i had always ment to play but never actually did and i feel the second will be the same p did anyone notice the day this video was uploaded is the same day rage 2 is suppose to be coming out next year can i have some cupcakes had rage played through after 40 hours and then again and again ive been waiting so long for rage 2 best trailer 2018 need more these costumes scare me so do the people in the video why does this keep giving me chills my name is pinkie pie hello and i am here to say how ya doin im gonna make you smile and i will brighten up your day it doesnt matter now whats up if you are sad or blue howdy cause cheering up my friends is just what pinkies here to do this s doom and borderlands mixed together and i love it anyone else notice post apocalyptic boogie2988 that trailer is crazy insane xdddddd total madness thats what i need 3 3 3 who is the actress playing the punk girl are these real humans in the trailer i really hope bethesda had least as possible to do with this game in terms of game engine design ect i am sure jesse pinkman will love this game this is so fuckin awesome what a gay old time the sequal we never knew we needed yo that was a great andrew wk music video whats rage 2 tho first one sucks and now second one looks better bethesda explain this is there seriously no one pointing out the girls cat tattoo on her stomach and in other news andrew wk received his first royalty check in 17 years i hope you like leather bet you they had fun making this commercial what the hell why is there live action shit in a fps game trailer least of all an id game trailer what a terrible terrible cringe trailer however the other stuff theyve released on this game has been much much better so long as the pc port is solid i think ill be getting this oh what a trailer what a lovely trailer is that mad max copy damn red eye sure moved up in the world he went from being a dj for a raider radio to fullblown heavy metal legend in the apocalypse why the fuck this looks soo sjw much better than the live performance you know its gonna be wild when an andrew wk song is part of the soundtrack strange but awesome at the same time my prossesor at college says if you have an opinion it better have damn well facts to why you have that opinion or at least a decent argument so for those who say it sucks and is a waste yout opinion is invalid because it hasnt come out yet hellsing party party good song choice god the comments section is always so cringy nowadays opinion disrespecting complaining about the most stupidest shit loads of trolls that are either 40 something lifeless fat and unattractive bois just lives in their mothers basement or some asshole little kid being a complete idiot ex some dumbass named token black etc i know that song dave david whelp this is unique im playing the first rage from 2011 again first rage was pretty boring if you ask me this one seems interesting if the beginning of this game does not give a little explanation to what happened after the end of the first game im going to be pissed what is this gay ass shit damn do i hate live action nonsense its a video game ffs dat shit only worked in command and conquer back in the day when a cgi segment would break the bank and take up most of the cdrom space that said however i was not as down as most on rage simply because its gun mechanics were second to none what with wall running mutants and enemies that could be shot in one hand drop their assault rifle and then proceed to get their pistol out and stuff like that the whole authority shtick though was terribly done and it hurt the game for wider audiences so heres to hoping for an actual bad guy to present themselves and no stupid narratives being shoehorned into the game immediately thought of alucard as soon as that song started not cupcakes we swear there better be like a cupcake skin or item because community still exists your life is over now your life is running out when your life is at an end then its time to kill again rage best game i ever played then fallout third skyrim coincidently all involved bethesda borderlands 1 was by no means bad but it was lack luster boom the squeal was awesome so maybe rage 2 can be its series savior besides andrew wk is better then dubstep trailer borderlands 2 had i mean this game was awesome ok the trailer might suck but why so many dislikes arent you happy about rage 2 when you go away for the day and the catholics are crusading while the nazis are invading nobody asked for another rage game gaylords 2 took long enough lol been waiting for years its cringy in a bad way bad actors i mean never heard of the game tho where are they getting enough dye and styling product to maintain those mohawks considering its the apocalypse the next mad max movie looks great so this game is about gay people finally my type of thing another overhyped half assed garbage with shitty gameplay toxic fanboys and a lot of money wasted on marketing and bribing critics is gonna win the goty again like it happened with the last of us bitcher 3 overwatch and zelda breath of the wild 032 kids are wathcing i finished rage i cant wait for this game mad max on crack hello im luda im one of the owners of the new rage amino a community centered around the game franchise rage come join this new community and post chat create content and a lot more httpaminoappscomcrageamino and i saw this i liked it so i decided to preorder the collectors edition i really hope this game has a multi player where i can play as people like the ones here in the trailer they look like theyre having a wonderful time im tired of playing angsty generic grizzled soldiers let me be a fucking spraypainthuffing cannibal lunatic let me have fun feels like fallout 4 and mad max had sex and made this beautiful game wtf is this am i the only one having a cringe overload watching this trailer everytime after the first time this trailer really reminded me of how much i dont want punks like that in a game all i can hope is that theyre just enemies or im not gonna play it because those punks are annoying and cringy af we need the first rage remaster for ps4 tht would be awesome id gladly buy it all over again just to play it since fallout 76 is going to be the only online fallout you guys should totally make a rage online we need a mmofps after all insanity rules the catholics are crusading while the nazis are invading anderson it been 2 days but feels like years you better get ready to run cause here they coooooome well it seems that the catholics are crusading and the nazis are invading alucard what go for a walk when al hope is lost send me forth on a moonlight walk you know i cant believe they never figured it out that alucard spelled backwards is dracula this is gonna be great i thought the first rage had a lot of potential and it was shame it didnt hit the mark i loved it still here we might be getting the game we all wanted wait rage as in that one obscure game that i didnt think about it much until i bought it this is way less fun with live action or when the music is live for no good reason terrible trailer for whats going to be an absolutely incredible game im so freaking excited i think bethesda would do a good job remastering balders gate champions of norrath series yea yea yea im soooo hype and shocked to have seen this rage is one of my all time favorite games and i never thought they would release a sequelwhat 7 years later hell yea looks lame didnt really like the first rage much either so bored i couldnt complete it wonder if they will use mega textures in this game cupcakes i need my damn cupcakes now hey bethesda please remove your anal tampons and stop trying to appeal to the feminist hacks who probably make up less than 1 of your fan base i have purchased and loved every title youve released since morrowind even your awful games like brink but im sad to say that rage 2 will never make it to my m2 and genuinely hope you lose money on it stick to your roots put your real fans first thanks hellsing anyone no its just me k my face is literally heating up with cringe cupcakes hd i heard this trailer was bad turns out it really is pretty bad wtf is that1 007 hellsing ultimate abridged episode 8 anyone the game looks incredible but this trailer is a cringe fest so any mention of the crimson fucker in this game if rage got a sequel than you have to do brink 2 as well please why cant i stop watching this andrew wk makes me want to play this game even more well i hate this new punkrock aesthetic they thought the already metal setting needed but i like andrew wk and i like that its also apparently turok rage wars according to the description box so im willing to give it a chance my god 2018 graphics look so good now a days i cant even tell if its real people or not after seeing fallout 76 i dont think im going to buy this anymore i dont want to support a studio that blatantly disrespects its fans the way bethesda did someone who treats them the way ea and rock star treat their fans shame this looks like an amazing game am i the only one who gets mad max vibes from rage needs more punk woman and im down sjw unite its not ragereal rage is dark and sad this is looks like bandits banging and shooting mutantsbethesda fix your shit you had me with andrew wk when hope is gone undo this lock and send me forth for a moonlit walk alucard motherfuckers stole my theme i cant believe they made another one after how much rage 1 sucked cupcakes hd anyone cupcakes hd i hope the full game has the same killer soundtrack i remember i played the first one what song is this this ad is annoying as fuck this looks so freaking insane and i love the color in the tone nice game bethesda cupcakes hd anyone all i see arecupcakes so manny cupcakes this is the song for cupcakeshd turok rage wars may contain content inappropriate for children nahh man idk what are u talking about d ah good to hear this song again i love it i heard it in cupcakes then ridiculousness then here nostalgia fucking hit me can we just aknowledge this real quick for those thinking rage was a ripoff of borderlands borderlands was first announced in 2008 rage was first announced in 2007 and quakecon the rage tech demo looked rougly like the full game aside from the few gameplay changes the borderlands tech demo in 2008 seemed more like halo at least the way it looked and the vehicle play so before leaving your criticism just remember do some research lmao i thought the song was something from smash mouth bitch love cannons a message to antigame underpaid clickbait article authors prepare to eat your motherfucking hearts out bethesda and id software are the boss looks a little bit like mad max fury road the fuck why does the description say this is barbie fashion designer im gonna be a good boy in this game what kind of borderlands is this awesome im going to be tuning in 219 ultra wide support yeah this looks both bad and good this is a cool psychopath game fuck off stupid loud ass ad came here just to dislike cause this piece of shit ad wont leave me alone beat it i dont remember barbie fashion designer being like this look at what youtube thinks this is barbie fashion designer advertised under the video hahahah the girls in the trailer oddly seem hot cupcakes hd hope the way vehicles handle is more realistic this time great fucking song barbie fashion designer nice youtube gaming i hate post apocalyptic games doesdoes anybody remember rage 1 what is the song in this trailer itsabouttime thank you so much i dont know what the hates all about i think this announce trailer is pretty damn sweet i thought this ads music sounded familiar it was used in hellsing ultimate abridged ep 08 but their version was better just saying this is the most fabulous thing ive ever seen now i wonder if the actual game is anything like this why is this the only ad i get was anyone else reminded of hellsing abridged into rage was good lets see rage2 fuckers hellsing abridged theme the song name for those that wish to know is ready to die andrew wk great but please this time add normal working coop even if not on lan play years later and andrew wk still eats ass what is the music when hope is gone undo this lock and send me forth on a moonlit walk so borderlands fallout neat alright so ill agree the announcement trailer is kinda bad the other one is sooo good though name of this song now so i can download it and run to it for miles and miles and miles i really hope that the guy with pink hair is referencing who i think their referencing a friend of mine with the cigar is in the video now thats what a trailer looks like not the shit like battlefield 5 is blake in it playing as raiders huh i honestly hate this ad i see it everywhere and the blue haired guy pisses me off for some reason where is the grit of the first one please let there be character customization yo so i think im totally into this battlefield v trailer looks so good ww2 is so wild what the fuck is this shit it was such a dark and grim game why defuck the pink theme im getting some sjw vibes lets hope im wrong anyone have the mohawk chicks number asking for a friend wold the gameplay be the same as the live action pc game but with guns if there are no females in this game then i aint buying cupcakes hd love the song love the trailer love the game time to rage why rage 2 the first rage came out like 80 yrs ago the fuck nigga basically burning man you in the comment section did u ask for this game it seems like this game is one for taking very enthusiastic walks if you played rage 1 like me and enjoyed it you preordered the game but sadly its 7 years late looks fun to me is that mad max 2 im just here praying bethesda hasnt fallen to sjws never even heard of the first game and now this trailer is being shown thousands of times in ads the song i use to get out of my bed in the morning d its amazing this is questionable my new kind of aesthetic only one hero can save the day stranger holy heck i need to play this game this game is crazy is this post apocalypse splatoon miss me with that gay sht where can i get that song music cupcakes from mlp i am more excited for this than i am for fallout 76 hell yeah skyrim is best game of bethesda and dlc dawnguard with snow elf please have andrew wk be there for your e3 conference i would be so fucking happy if you did i didnt know that anybody else uses andrew wks music honestly im used to teamfourstar at all honesty i dont know anything about rage 1 but this trailer unsettles me thats a no from me andrew wk was a radical choice for this trailer for sure man kratos really went to some hard times huh if anyone wants to hear the whole song they played its called ready to die by andrew wk but that is his only song he made that is intense like that why does that one girl look like she from fry cry 3 ow the edge i loved the old rage hopefully it isnt completely different wow this is surprising cool but surprising im going to be pissed if this isnt an open world mad max meets die antwoord rpg where you can basically be a raider and screw everything up andrew wk ready to die made this trailer even better lol mmmmmm cupcakes and also come to this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoksf8c7m55w so who wants to go for a walk hopefully they get the reference game has colors trailer has colorful hair women and fat people people already complaining that liberals ruined this game and that its just a sjw heaven guys pls its just a cinematic trailer fuck it looks like a new mad max game wait this is going to be developed by the same people that did mad max the music replaced with allstar by smash mouth new battlefield v looks good holy i love this doesnt this look like bryan from team edge 029 not gonna lie i think a little something came out worst part is i dont feel guilty about it not gonna lie i think a little something came out worst part is i dont feel guilty about it i love this fucking song did anyone feel a sense of nostalgia hearing ready to die i kept thinking of team four stars version of alucards epic entrance when the vid loaded up with andrew wks ready 2 die i had the best nerdgasm ever okay who at bethesda is the hellsing abridged fan because this feels a lot like that tonally first one wasnt good enough to warrant a sequel why is the guy at 19 wearing a bra sniff iv waited so long oh what a day what a lovely day ps ok sunset overdrive this is how you do a wacky live action trailer well i wasnt expecting this im not complaining its just weird hell yeah been wanting a rage 2 for years thank you bethesda man you need money to buy this game go earn some mone from this link httptakingworkcomwork8372 i hope that fat guy with the bad teeth is an actual character you can encounter you know what if the game is going for a even more over the top mad max then i am all inn i wonder how those converse look but this is an amazing commercial looks like another settlement needs our help with some raiders wtf is going on with western game development song is fitting and pretty lit what is it cupcakes intenfies why am i strangely addicted to this video the andrew wk song itself if an earworm but i like how theyve constructed the video too and this its how you ruin a good game andrew wk get ready to die this reminded me of alucard where is fcking fallout 5 xd i wanted doom 2 is this multiplayer pc coop miss me with that gay shit hell yeah insanity kicking in is this battlefield v sweet seims the us seim song from hellsing abridge one its so broken please fix fallout 4 its sad that nowadays when people see some bright colors they automatically think that its gay not even kidding i didnt hear anything about this game but ive had that song stuck in my head for the last week and ughhhh this is blink 182 and mad max thats bfv elder scrolls 6 no one want this am i the only one that thinks of cupcakes because of the music but how man old i look forward to murdering all of these rainbow hippies i like the song these guys look crazy okay i did not know i needed you until i found you so i want it wow that was incredibly cringey getting fallout 4 nuka world vibes rn this should have been how the fallout 4 nuka world trailer been time to go on a very enthusiastic walk this makes me want to rewatch all of the mad max movies and tank girl seems like a cheap fallout im sorry is this the same song used from cupcakes ready to die by andrew wk was a good choice what is up with the 6k dislikes is it because this isnt an elder scrolls game and it only took them 7 years in an alucard voice well well well this game is not rage im 100 sure of that dislike omg loved the first rage minus the half ssed ending but why do all these games now a days gotta be a joke or something funny cant we get a serious game dev that wants to make a game for people over the age of teen thats gritty and messed up how life would actually be if the end came to be it seems like the last of us is our last hope for something that doesnt seem like its just made to pander to that certain 6 to 15 year old boy im so disappointed in this trailer i really hope this game isnt a joke and is at least as gritty and messed up as the first one was devs take note of the games that make a killing and people unanimously agree its good witcher 3 gritty real and best game ever made it huge and wasnt made for kids of all ages wow i really hope this game isnt just thrown together to make some money off the title bc rage could be huge if done right especially if its not made with everyone in mind heres to hoping we get a m rating and someth wolfenstein iii looks awesome now that ive finished the second installment i really anticipate a new decent fun shooter fingers crossed mick gordon is on this i want to see these characters in game as npc if they made the final boss not as anti climactic as in the first one this game could be a gem who would have guessed all the promotional stuff featuring boomarangs dustpunk characters and the a from the rage logo would have turned out to be a new rage game shocking i dont even know what to think of this help loved the first one for exactly what it was been waiting for something like this for rage 2 developpers from mad max which i loved joined in proceeding to buy this upon release i cannot help it guys if you dont like post apocalyptic this simply isnt for you i love the genre less or more serious who cares mad max 2 had gay humungus and punks and it still felt compelling and quite somber loving its the most disgusting trailer ever even when i love bethesda if i wanted a fps smoothie id put borderlands fallout and destiny into a blender and this would be produced the game looks like itll be a blast to play and love the different types of enemies and combat on show weve reacted to the gameplay trailer too and would be grateful if you guys checked it out if youd like to hear what true happiness sounds like haha goddamn it now need to watch tfs hellsing abridge again cause the song as the world fell each of us in our own way was broken it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else i watched this thing about 10 times the energy is awesome this trailer looks like a mad max acid trip congratulations someone has finally made a video game trailer that was so bad that it almost convinced me to avoid buying a game ive been waiting to arrive for years i hope they dont make a promo about oxygen because it result in thousands of people suffocating make an elder scrolls 6 already i am certainly intrigued but lets face it hellsing ultimate still pretty much 0wns this song is this a tony hawk trailer or a trailer to a sequel that wasnt silly like this cmon guys that was pure cringe andrew wk makes this trailer great what the fuck have you done i leave for a day and the catholics are crusading while the nazis are invading terrible character design and everyone is acting at double douche level 10000 good marketing mission accomplished there isnt a second of that add that is tolerable this looks like theyre trying way too hard to sell some unfinished tech demo f i n a l l y all the long years of waiting has finally paid off as a christian couldnt care less about the message this game looks dope as hll and enjoyed the first one i imagine my mother may disaprove but my dad is as hype as i am so umm im not into politics but i never even noticed the hair dye until now i dont think it has any political message despite the wacky awesomeness of this trailer why are people taking such offense into pink and blue hairdye itself bland and dull with a hint of red to mad max meets doom at coachella i played rage 1 when i was like 9 it scared the shit out of me come on guys starfield talk to me damn the only things that were missing in the first rage were story coop and global map cant wait for rage 2 where do i preorder it that song rocked the gameplay trailer looks sweet this is pretty gay though if doom wasnt as dark as it turned out to be lol i liked the original rage but not this trailer best trailer ive seen for the last time stoked aiming to do something creative like this with the borderlands property later this summer if your attending burning man hit us up doing a film shoot there for a borderlands piece man that was shit ah hell yeah its back 032 junkrat makes an appearance cool i prefer fallout new vegas oblivionbethesda this trailer is the definition of insanity d whats this a postapocalyptic game with an art direction that doesnt rely on washed out colors and at least 10 shades of brown that alone piques my interest i dunno i mean i think this trailer is great the its so cheesy its good kinda deals plus you got andrew wk on that excellent i really dont understand the negative feedback this is getting but to each their own i guess finally omg rage 2 sooooooo hyped ps perfect song choice for the announcement trailer winstick this definitely seems much more psychedelic than the first one but im glad to see that a sequel has materialized just hope its got a longer campaign wowfinally where is the gameplay time to play rage 1 again p better story than childish gambino this is america here comes the craziest game of 2018 i love this song howbout song i really liked the first game and i like the punks with the died hair but lets be real were would they get the hair dye idk the first rage had more of a serious take on the apocalypse nobody wanted this bring back tamriel huh people werent lying this trailer is pretty cringe rage 2 we found more colours now randy pitchfork really need to bring his agame borderlands 3 to perfection this maybe his big threat fire your marketing team this is what america is going to look like after another century or two of miscegenation if mad max and overwatch had a baby what is this song is there a multiplayer pvp looks a lot like destiny 2 fused with doom thou most annoying trailer of all time everyone in this post apocalyptic world stands around with their mouths wide open gurning at cameras and each other while covered in dirt somehow with perfectly styled dyed hair reminds me of a high school expressionist dance show still looking forward to the game though rage had potential but got boring so hopefully they fix that bethesda have been doing good recently i wonder if well get an elder scrolls announcement i want rage 2 but what the hell is this sht trailer this trailer is both incredible and terrible and i like it andrew wk ill take it im glad sydney from payday 2 survived the apocalypse im gonna play this either way still hyped for e3 2018 bethesda has something else planned i hope thanks leakers day 13 still watching this trailer killer sound track lol i saw this as a add and noweven if i am not a gamerlove this trailer and the music and the colours wow they sure took those generic brown shooter criticisms to heart rage was adhd on a disk and now the wrist bangers have released a sequel this aint running on gtx960m 8gb ram i could die to this song ive never played rage but i kinda want to now you all know its buyasaservice people like eso fuck bethesda boycott this shit fallout 4 on drugs rick and morty im going to play the living shit out of this oh hell the fuck yes when the rage 2 comes out bethesda smoke weed holy shit this is the one game i wouldnt expect to get a sequel i hope they fix the original though lots of issues like the entire fucking engine making you vomit thanks to this song i expected alucard to come in and give some snarky comments thank you hellsing abridged alucard is missing in this trailer jesus whats up with punk colored theme so lame it suppose to be post apocalypse not a punk ass party please let these characters be in game is it a dream or what i am seeing nowfuck if this was a mystery trailer you could easily tell its bethesda by how cringy af this announce trailer is lol fockyou we want elder scrolls or starfield fuck off with this piece of shit another funny cool im crazy riderbulshitnot buying but why tho hmm dunno about the trailer so amped for this has to be one of the best video game trailers of all time icannotwait the teaser of looks freaking awesome not to mentioned that theme song time to make some popcorn because this trailer has put in two polar opposites guns with big burly men and pink with crazy hair lol im down for this im so excited hope it has a collectors edition with something cool in it wheres the fucken game play dont want hillbillies fucking around you stupid fucks thanks walmart at first i couldnt tell what they were selling a new hair dye or a new energy drink i probably wouldve bought either but rage 2 fuck yeah song name pls pocs rage 2 there was a rage 1 oh yeah that disapointment of a game that everyone forgot about fuck rage 2 the first game was ass guardians of the galaxy plus mad max this trailer bad trailer looks like an superultrmegauber cheaper borderland great music choice props to the guy who had the idea finally dont know how i feel about the art direction though was this meant to make me watch hellsing abridged again can you make another elder scrolls is this song the one from hellsing abridged someone make a wall paper of the chick with the shotgun shells for middle fingers thats my new background awesome fucking reveal also i think wal marts mess up actually worked to their benefit looks like that trailer was quickly thrown together to cover the leak fallout 5 looks great this is a terrible trailer geez looks so cheap and cringey the gameplay trailer is definitely better than this way to waste time and money with costumes and live actors for this embarrassing mess can we get a rage remaster with preorder well that was shit this game is a disgrace for the genre a zero depth mainstream shit game tailored for mainstream audience who loves playing fortnine league of legends and other carcinogenic games and whose attention span is that of a three year old this game embodies a lot of whats wrong with todays gaming culture as usual for games like this one it will spike in popularity on youtube with fun gameplay moments videos containing attempts to be edgy and memeful as well as containing a lot of obnoxiously autistic screaming from all these popular and wanna be popular youtubers oh how glad am i to be a gamer of the past generation im interested but this trailer is awful without having played it i liked the seemingly grittiness of the first game an open world fps with rpg elements and emphasis on combat is how you do it i think this is meant to be a prequel set before the arks were opened and before authority was createdgained notoriety music seems a bit more light hearted than rages give it the doom style music back whoa jk stiles has been hitting the gym hes not morbidly obese anymore nice new do too we need elder scrolls vi alucard be pissed that you used his song just saying this comments section is at each others throats loved the first rage always felt it was underrated missed by allot of people again another live action trailer yuuuuuk degeneracy everywhere maybe this trailer sucks but im hyped af anyone else watched the trailer on loop for like 2 days straight clown fiesta too much edgy screemo teenager for me its like fallout and mad max had a baby and came out this bad ass game this trailer sucks so bad i want to rage is this a fallout raider simulator looks pretty amazing so far honestly if only wed know what bethesda game studios is making pink is the new punk wow this looks like shit the libtard virus struck another one wont be touching this garbage well that was interesting i think it looks pretty chaotic f it im down to try it out maybe this will become the best game ever made i am not sure but it looks like as if maybe it can even beat far cry 5 which seemed absolutely impossible only a week ago one thing about gamersor maybe just comment boardsyou are hard to please you dont need to have pink hairif you dont like itguess whatkill them and them make fun of them over their dead body they owned an ip with name recognition known overall concept and made it faster bigger and all around better i dont think they were worried about offending the rage community because there really doesnt seem to be one it looks cool to me im excited unpopular opinion but i really enjoyed the first game i hope they make the driving even more fun why not a fallout 5 its mad max fury road meth edition im super excited for this looks amazing this trailer is shit i dnont mean the game only the trailer is shit your so upset at walmart you revealed the trailer because it wasnt really hidden anymore sees the title yes yes yeees fuck yes sees the trailer im sorry what release teso vi im not wasting a dollar on this shit oh well i better save my money for red dead 2 finally more rage a bit too late no song andrew wk ready to die i guess that all the punk gamers are finishing themselves rewinding this trailer the blue punk girl is ok for a rocco siffredi hardcore movie for the rest of them i woul suggest a final solution third reich style this is pretty much as bad as it could have been almost as if someone actually intentionally made a fucking cringe fest in order to deter as many people from their game as possible you better put in the homoeroticism of the original mad max this confirms the walmart leak any hint of actual gameplay im getting a rather tryhardy edgelord feeling from this truly horrible trailer oh crap those cupcakes not again hey splatoon just called they want their paint back was curious about the downvotes watched trailer understood the downvotes does anyone else think this trailer looked awful what is the name of music sooooois this the otherwise known as one game less before elder scrolls 6 borderlands 3 rage of mad max and his gayness woohooo awesome game im so hyped i love this song xd who came here before 1m views comments are so bad this was a cool video awful trailer music and aesthetics hope the gameplay trailer actually shows something anarhosyndicalism simulator subsucribe me chanel okay thats one game thats getting added to the list of avoid at all costs i heard george lucas who else heard george lucas you dont expect anything you click a song on youtube you see rage 2 in the list first thought pff fake uploader bs and then you o just before you xx and then you click the motherf awesome love the first one say what you wanti love it cringy tude is back it seems multiplayer or die is what this is the big question is how big is the map i could definitely see myself watching a full feature movie looking like this trailer looks as bland and as soulless as the first one you think this one will have a cool ending like the first one too you know where you push a button looks shit have you fixed fallout 4 yet plus you should make all your creation club content for ps4 free still no external assets that why wtf is this couldve done without the live action shit it looks like a colorful hipster abomination with probably sjw content and retardation culture lol ill wait for ion maiden party party party i wanna have a party i need to have a party you better have a party oh party party party you gotta party hardy only thing missing now is kenshiro from fist of the northern star the people saying the music and colors doesnt fit are right in the sense of the actual game rage but the trailer it fits fine and works with the atmosphere given in the trailer after seeing the gameplay trailer ill be picking rage up sometime after the its out bethesda really upped the graphics on this one almost like its real life the cringe is da wae the first one was so underrated i am glad to see a sequel will be funny if rage 2 will same shit like a rage 1 but song is very cool imagine seeing hair dye and thinking aw fuckin feminazis the rightwingers are wild this is the awesome apocalypse so the ones that developed mad max are doing this might be fun i liked madmax id shotguns are the best in the industry i look forward to another masterclass in shotguns i love the first rage but this trailer is terrible stfu haters and watch somebody that knows more then you do httpsyoutubeuplaqmd8by so fucking excited thank you bethesdaseriously 3 looks like that rick and morty apocalyspe lol a e s t h e t i c s none of it wow makers of this game it better be good i hardly finished the 1st one bad mixed doom with rage 1 this might be the best thing ive ever seen a game for sjw of the futur lol im excited everyones a critic sjw the game looks great but i want the elder scrolls mad max sexual overdrive 036 that my boi one of the most underrated games ive ever played i only hope that they make this one longer and packed with more than the first as that was the only thing i really disliked the game no one asked for why is the comment section filled with ignorance and hate it looks like the borderlands edgy brother i actually made the effort to login to youtube so that i could thumb down this abomination no one asked for this uhhh what not even waiting for e3 not a good sign fckin sold this is probably one of the worst trailers i ever saw in my entire life and i saw a lot of crap all i think while listening to this is alucard piloting a battleship into the middle of catholicnazi occupied london anyone else stay with elder scrolls and fallout games thus game looks stupid play it for a few days and after that its one of those game stop 499 games that cant sell lol so many upset why though alucard did it better i love all the kids who downvote this lul whats rage is that like cod ha fuck off babies and git gud scrubs next year we will see the elder scrolls 5 save this comment the fuck music thanks walmart canada d finally some fucking color im glad devs are realizing that colors are fun i was actually expecting a hellsing abridged reference to pop up weird f finally thank you so much what is this even about im sorry bethesda but why i loved the first one i think this trailer though is abominable delet dis i dont know what all the hate is for i played rage when it came out and i loved it it was a day 1 purchase for me and so will this hate all you want you know youll want it well andrew wk was the dj in nuka world just give the game a try ok looks like they asked some random fucking larpers they found on the street to armour themselves up for a gay pride parade and pose with whatever came into their minds in front of a camera shit caricature of borderlands with gameplay looking like an imitation of destiny hope itll flop as hard too loved the first rage this looks awful rageoverrage rage was the best game i ever played still do this day and what the fuck have you done what the fuck is this gay pride the fucking game well guess what you never ever ever ever ever ever getting my money again so take your elder scrolls and fallout and stick it up your gay pride ass fuck you i like it how over the course of a couple of days everyone was bitching like babies regarding the teaser trailer and now everyones sucking bethesdas dick all of a sudden adrew w k still cranking out the party i see trailer sucks gameplay looks good though im stoked since gearbox wont get off the pot and announce borderlands 3 already hears music time to go for a walk tfw youre so brain dead that you believe that this game is taking the place of fallout or skyrim and brushing this trailer off as some mediocre trash with sjws instead of realizing this the kind of the direction rage should be going why would you bring a fucking dumbell to a gun fight hey its post apocalypse better be just a little retarded with the design finally on the one hand its a little bit of cringe just a tad here but its definitely here however at times it did feel like the serious tone of rage 1s story was sort of at odds with a game where your arsenal included death frisbees exploding shotgun shells and bombs strapped to remote control cars so maybe this is a step in the right direction who is that blue haired thot i can already tell this is gonna bomb hard like was there anyone who remembered rage after a few months let alone 7 years fucking music is so hyping rage was a great game i cant wait to play this bet it will be fun or even better than the last one first game was pretty good this trailed is bloody terrible so not a new skyrim or fallout not cool mr howard ma max 2 official trailer when hope is gone undo this lock and send me forth on a moonlit walk release restraint level zero oh is that a cupcakes reference it looks like a good raging blasting time shame i never got to experience the first game would love to see a remaster of it on ps4 amazing can not wait why does everything have to impliment pink in it lately the only thing the 2010s are gonna be remembered for is that everything tried to be like the 1980s the trailer couldve ended with a voiceover of a dude going war wars very gay now too much cringe now i want allucard in rage 2 lmao 5k triggered people fuck you ive been waiting 8 years for this moment looks like a quick cut from wasteland weekend lol customization i loved rage so much but like why im so confused yes finally i loved rage and have always wanted a sequel im so excited this was abrasive and not in a good way also why are there so many people crying degeneracy because of dyed hair homoeroticism and sjw feminism im not an sjw and didnt get anything like that from this trailer people seem to be really reaching i love this trailer and punk song today is tomorrow do do people not think this looks cool who else remembers the song from my little pony cupcakes andrew wk huh you really know how to hook me arise andrew arise they couldnt have used the actual graphics this trailer was just a hodgepodge of bullshit and nonsense that looked similar to the style from rage plus the boomerang this looks gross i dont understand the appeal folks in the comments concerned about homoeroticism think that this is gonna turn someone gay im gonna go buy 6 copies and blow about a dozen gamestop employees looks more like rage 2 the feministing for some reason watching this makes me thirsty for an energy drink whoevers in charge of marketing for this game shoot them absolute garbage after hearing from my friends how bad this was and then finally watching i disagree this trailer is fucking sweet i can see how some wouldnt like it though hopefully this game takes itself less seriously than the first one like the trailer implies plus points for bethesda managing to upset a load of insecure neckbeards once again this time with bright colours and andrew wk i highly approve fat beer man is my spirit animal mad max meets saint row i dont get it is everyone calling this gay because it has pink in it colorful sploosh fallout doom rage give me fallout 5 not this shit the new skyrim version looks weird 013 i think shes hot love the trailer music that feels like the old and great times of gaming whom ever okayed this needs to be fired i enhanced the framerate of this trailer to make it look silky smooth on my channel httpsyoutubeb1fnexcow to be fair very few live action game trailers are actually good borderlands doom dirt showdown fallout saints row rage 2 this is awesome song please i think they fucked up by adding those colors i first saw the gameplay trailer without this much pink and yellow shit ans seemed awesome i saw this trailer and i thought its crap what our jewish lords are back with progressiveness such an inspiring trailer awesome i loved rage i dont know what people hates about this trailer it looks badass to me watched it like 100 times rage was so beatifull but probably this one will not be that good raaaaggeeeeeeeeeee loved the first game glad to hear this news looks like fallout 4doom hybrid meh lame hey beth you already screwed fallout now this good job what if fury road was autistic af seems like this trailer turns off a lot of homophobic douchebags xd the marketing campaign for this game is an absolute travesty i need this now im very into this aesthetic like madmax buttfucked bulletstorm in borderlands bathroom we need tes 6 do skyrim 2 please instead of this junk the biggest disservice to all the talented and skilled people who slave away in the gaming industry producing amazing games is the way in which the publishers debase their art and craft into total cringefests marking campaigns shit in a hand and clap thats what i was waited for fuck no tone deaf reanimation of id ips again doom succeeded because you played to the core fan base with the main game doom multiplayer flopped because you didnt quake champions flopped because you didnt you shouldnt be trying to mooch 9 year old clownshoes from fortnite with id ips make fresh ips for them id ips wont work for that and the fact you cant see that is extremely disappointing rage2 fiesta gay con los cringe boys facking love it gayest fucking song of all time fucking finally looks like this should be a borderlands game wasted money on making this trailer gameplay was all what we needed i am watching this wayyyyyyyyyyy to manny times screw this i want the elder scrolls 6 i dont care what anybody says ive waited so long for a sequel and im hyped if you love mad max you will love this whats the song thoooo wow this comment section is a shitshow even for yt standards good entertainment the gameplay trailer is better than this crap woah wtf lmao whats wrong with the comments whats cringe about this trailer im not even joking i dont get what you guys mean it looks badass to me idk tho and what does this have to do with sjws fuck sjws but this is punk stuff i dont think that means sjw the girls are lawbreakers levels of ugly i play rage only for hourmadmax for dozens im surprised the comments hate this so much it looks okay the raiders seem as weird freaky and flamboyant as in any other postapocalyptic gamemovie looks like feminism in a postapocalyptic settingwhy we cant have nice things anymore suicide squad wtf is this shit get ready to die bethesda screaming at walmart canada can somebody tell me what the songs title please does anybody know what song that is lol this is terrible did i just become a andrew wk fan id like to think that the people in this are the dev team just fucking around after working on this game for so long wtf is this wanna be mad max punk bullshit why does this look like a movie about gay people being gay fucking ready to die god i love that song drugs not even once is anyone comes here because of mlps fan made video alright no microtransactions like 2k right im in cant wait to see more seems like i have a crush on that blue mohawk girl 5k dislikes guess they never knew rage was a franchise too bad add snapeditor and i definitly buy it so the secret ip that beth is working on for years is this graphic looks realistic though resurrecting a dead game for a proper burial song ready to die andrew wk i dont know what people are on about honestly rage 1 might not have been a masterpiece but it wasnt bad and this looks awesome down with the haters rage 2 d hope you dont fuck it up like f4 bethesda question why do video game companies make live action trailers whats the point i dont want to see people in costumes like ingame characters just show me the ingame charactersingame helsing song ship scene damn its andrew wks get ready to die love this song for a long time btw is this an actual song or just made for this this looks like racidal heights fortnite typo stuff i hope this has something to do with the original cool rage or else im going to be utterly disappointed maximum cringe did anyone ask for a rage 2 this looked more like a trailer for a new heavy metal album dental hygiene is at an all time low finally im a little confused on how to feel about this for starters the original rage was absolute garbage so why did excited for this one but bethesda has been knocking it out of the park with pretty much all of their single player games ill wait for the gameplay before i pass judgment but after this trailer im just left with one question why tho this isnt the only game there releasing bethesda has said that they have big plans for this e3 so this is a taste just remember that another cool thing from id the worst trailer ive ever seen this game is produced by sjws lmfao i really dont get this femminist sjw scandal in this trailer back in the 90 there was punks having coloured hair seems to me people just are burned out but all the sjw crap at the point now is becoming a paranoia also in some comments i did read the witcher 3 femminist people read the books witcher 3 is the most book friendly title of the saga alright if theyre going to make this game it had better not have some shit ending that just ends like the first rage this was a great game but the ending was just fucking awful please tell me you will pick up this weirdos in the game as companions that they will be absolutly insane and im sold love the video and the idea live action trailers are a waste i just hope there is not thousands of loading screens every time you open a door reminds me of mad max im happy were getting this oh look mommy another propaganda please tell me this time theres actually an xp level up system otherwise im not getting this one either am i the only one that remembers the first rage being a sleepwalk all the parts were there but the game simply had no soul i would rather have any other current bethesda property than this i cry am i the only one who liked the trailer make it as gay and corny as possible say no more fam terrible marketing cringe im confused on the colors good music looks better than destiny 2 i like this loved rage even though i saw the flaws glad bethesda are learning from their mistakes and trying to improve on their ips instead of throwing them to the dust id actually like to see them bring back brink 2 with but keep the original concept and style of brink but fix everything else with the game from gameplay to the dated graphics other then that cant wait d when will the gaming industry know that live action teaser trailers for a game is never going to get people hyped for the game geez where is doom 2 trailer looks shit but fucking hell that song is catchy as hell very disappointed bethesda you ruined a great ip flamboyant colours and pop music is not what rage is about it should be a dark and gritty game wannabe suicide squad marketing a pretty crappy thing to emulate this looks cool mad max and borderlands had a baby that baby became a botchling this game is that botchling rage 1 was a tech demo for id tech 5 without an actual game there this teaser looks like theyre giving the game an actual identity unlike the original if pink hair punk women and neon coloured men upset you and make you think youre under attack from feminist and lgbt propaganda you need to put on an extra layer for your tin foil hat and stay off the internet for a few years reminds me of sunset overdrive but with less gameplay and more mad max looks extremely generic its more likely to be a punk bandit theme than a feminist theme as some are saying they both share the same hair though the women in the trailer actually colored their hair pink which is feminine but thats about it even some of the guys have colored mohawks showing its not a statement about women but raiders in general how could you possibly put this franchise above a hexen reboot rage should have stayed dead it has absolutely no potential generic af i want this game so bad rage 2 electric boogaloo liked the first one and tbh this looks like a blast as well holy shiz i just replayed this last week i guess i should play more games i want sequels of xd this is the second biggest nut ive had after fallout 4 trailer i dont know what the fuss is people should wait for the gameplay reveal before shitting on this so quickly everyone rage is a boring game just generic fps they shouldnt make anymore bethesda yea well watch us honestly i thought the only reason why they made the first rage game was to show of the capabilities of the id tech 5 engine i dont think they really needed to make a second one this game will get rolled over by borderlands 3 rage 1 was fucking awsome but this is some pinky pinky gay shit give us a real final boss and i shall be satisfied not going to buy not interested in it in the slightest oh god that trailer it is an abomination of cringe and gay millenial shit what about next fallout cucked sjw feminist social warrior garbage willpirateit yeah no one would rather have another fallout over this garbage god fucking damit someone smuggled cocain into bethesda offices agein wtf is this shit you guys are fucken stupid why would you make a second game the fist one was shit and was made in 2015 but felt like a 2005 game holy shit i didnt know it was possible but i actually look down on the bethesda hate community even more its a live action one minute trailer and people are hating on it rage was a great game and im glad that theres a second if any of you played the first one then you would know that its not really comparable to borderlands or fallout its a great fucking game also its not even made by bethesda game studios just published by bethesda softworks so this isnt interfering with any bigger game you guys actually think this is their only announcement the negativity is so premature and completely ignorant its ridiculous hating on a company who has made some of the best games ever just because its such a cool thing to do i wonder how old all these people in the comments are probably not very the downfall of a video games enjoyment starts with the community and you guys dont realize that this ruins games for other people based on the 19000 likes though i know there the first one was darkgray and tanwhy did it go rainbow why are they trying to make a serious game goofy this videos still better than the comment section being a big fan of the original rage game i can see what they were going for and they took a risk but it seems like most people liked it rather than hated it entirely like most of the screaming willies im seeing all over they could have at least showed some actual gameplay after the live action part but showed this out of there post apocalyptic sexual innuendo fest instead and thats what people really didnt like about it is id developing this game or did they outsource it hell yeah cant wait for the gameplay reveal rage 1 was nice but it wasnt so self ironic and had a normalserious tone dont make it a joke like you did with the trailer amam i the only person who liked rage who cares just rerelease skyrim for ps2 i have nothing to say to all those complaining about bethesda making this let me say the id software makes rage not bethesda they only publish the game bethesda said they were making a game so sit your whiney ass down and wait i dont care this isnt starfield this looks awesome probably the worst trailer i have seen since i started watching trailers this is an example of how not to market a game i hope it will not turn into the same scenario like with rage technically it wasnt a bad game but lack of content and promised coop turned to a deathmatch game the trailer looks like the smell in a gas station bathroom madmax colorful apple ad this trailer what nobody wants a rage 2 what the hell bethesda its like construction workers given a contract to maintain a perfectly good road just to have something to do that summer this must of been all the employees not good enough to work on the triple a titles poor bastards trying hard to be borderlands first game had promise but was short and unfinished more like a tech demo sequel no one asked for this is terrible hoping the gameplay reveal is rage 1 wasnt exactly good love it i really love the crazy vibe it gives what do you reckon its going to be rated all the negative comments are feeding my rage boner love it today is tomorrow so boooooring is this what the people want a borderlands fallout metal game i say no this game is useless i wanna see a new fallout and not broken pls the day one patch was 2 times bigger the the game install is this american game or japanese game i really liked the first rage it was short but i replayed it many times the online was boring this trailer makes it look been bad though if its actually open world this might have a chance nobody cares about this game bethesta trials of the rage dragon mad max and the invasion of the gender fluids 028 this guy carries metalplastic box on his hip those boxes were used in former yugoslav army i wonder how it got in trailer rage 2 this is america i hope this is just pissing around and not a representation of the game and that the game will just be a super improved version of the first one what a fantastic trailer showing a little glimpse into the freaks wandering the wasteland rage 2 will be a banger probably the worst piece of shit trailer ive seen oh yeah i believed in new doom but this looks super epic new doom maybe next time im not going to call it bad or whatever butdid anyone ask for this granted the first rage was ok but that was 67 years ago did anyone really ask or beg for a sequel i believe in second chances and good sequels wolfenstein and doom but idk hopefully the gameplay is leaps and bounds better than this cracked up mad max trailer im glad its open world is this mad max 2 walmart was fucking right the amount shorts in this teaser are off the charts avalanche lets hope that optimization on consoles will be good this made me want to spray paint my mouth and bash it on a wall literally no one asked for this youre a dumbass if you think the game is going to be colorful like this reveal trailer the reveal trailer is literally for the fucking looks they even show parts where it looks darker the trailer doesnt impress me asked for elder scrolls 6 bethesda enjoy rage 2 seriously when rage 1 came out everyone forgot about it come on now jeez bethesda i dont mind yall trying to make new major ips like elder scrolls and fallout but listen to your fans first if we want elder scrolls 6 make that game first then you can try to make new major ips while your fans are busy playing elder scrolls 6 bethesda try to put your fans first next time thanks looks intentionally shit to bring more people to see how shit it is why would anyone come up with a trailer that left no lasting expression and question the sanity of production team need to take a book out of kojima latest game trailer that trailer shows no plot or storyline but left an impression that demands curiosity what about doom 2 i shall call this game emergency borderlands backup i really hope the game is better than this trailer looks terrible why are bethesda so averse to sticking to their core successful brands of elder scrolls fall out doom wolfenstien rage no one is really asking for these mediocre games new lgbt game looks great this is bullshit we want skyrim vi why are there 5000 dislikes am i missing something i dont really understand how everybody thinks the fact that avalanche studios making this is a good thing and then everyone points to just cause oh you mean that game that you go and do the same thing over and over and over and over go to mission accept mission take base next mission that game is fucking awful repetitive garbage if this game turns out anything like just cause its fucked this looks gay degenerate and cringy af really wasnt expecting to see a rage sequel ive always hoped cause i liked the first game despite its flaws it wasnt bad it just couldve been so much better if they can make it the game that rage shouldve been to begin with im down as for all the sjw talk im no liberal but sorry if your fragile probably compensatedwith a gigantic truck masculinity is threatened by the color pink and women with guns youve got some seriously fucked up issues i advise you go see a therapist really hoping they can pull a 180 with this ip and get it to the level it always shouldve been at really bethesda rage 2 when everyone wants an elder scrolls game or another fallout you waste your time and resources onrage stop working against the fans work with us and we will gladly give you our money in exchange for cool games like we all know you are capable of making butrage bethesda look i love yall but this just isnt what your community wants weve waited long enough and instead of elder scrolls vi youre developing rage 2 dont get me wrong im sure rage will be great but its time to show us what we want maybe with combichrist music sounds better huh didnt see this coming but had been wanting it for a while odd trailer choice live action with pink smoke little metro for a game about demolition derby racing and shooting but the first rage was an amazing game just could see it was incompleat at the end was the first product id had under bethesdas payroll hope this one to be funded well and feel compleat albut keep that quality of ai and hit detection they had cant wait live action with pink smoke fallout 4 shit rage 2 shit you kill fallout series i hate you bethesda repeat after me everyone bethesda softworks and bethesda game studios are different things finally i needed closure its gonna be a female character this is fucking horrendous so long ive been waiting dont fuck it up just cause devs sont worry ppl this is e3 fluflf last year it was themed like this as well lots of psycho active drugs and pretty colors with loud music in alot of the game trailers khajjit is sad khajiit wants new elder scrolls gamethis was creepy the crimson fucker is coming probably too much rage for me sounds like a complete ripoff between far cry and borderlands it would be awesome if this game had something kind of like glory kills from doom only with one or two qtes to make it interactive and that featured weapons that street brawlers use chains clubs broken bottles brass knuckles switch blades etc that either the player or opponents use awful whats with all those neon hair colours and cringey accessories shit looks more like that netta video from the esc than some game id play bethesda please abandon the bullshit leftist sjw soyboy train and start bringing awesome games again jeez i gotta puke rage scorchers dlc is honestly one of my favourite games for so many reasons the ending was retarded but excellent game all round what really stood out for me was rages official trailer the one with a perfect circles counting bodies playing in it that song and trailer reflected the first rage perfectly this teaser thoughi cant sayits nearly like a trailer for an apocalyptic fortnite or something im happy to see rage getting a sequal i just hope it doesnt lose the atmosphere the 1st one had people got paid to make this video the new fallout looks weird you can clearly tell devs are older than 30 years old were not in the 90s kids dont care about post apocalyptic scenarios anymore this is a game for older generation s loving it ready to die by andrew wk pretty nice song to go on a killing spree with i just want to see the gameplay trailer today i hope it will be better than this piece of junk first game was ok it was realistic and harsh the sequel looks like it wants to be more like borderlands not impressed from this trailer rage was my favorite game of the last cycle and i google rage game sequel at least once a month that said this trailer worries me the original was spooky gritty and atmospheric if im getting a spunky pink haired girl and bisexual welders in a wacky world than i hate to say it no go for me if it has the same atmosphere of the first game preorder deluxe game in support please stick to the original script with the dangerous feral savage gangsgroups great graphics unique post apocalyptic settlements racing and the card game oh how i love that card game the fact that id is working on this and not doom 2 makes me furious hopefully id just assisted with development too much gameplay shown in this trailer its live action silly bollox that really impresses gamers jesus i want this song on my phone like now please bethesda for the next fallout release some bow and crossbow why there is some nuclear plasma laser and other high tech weapon but there is no bow and crossbow v it was the most strange thing ever in fallout game fuck yes i fucking loved the first rage so much please dont fuck this up bethesda why do half of the characters look like sjws mother fucking pink hair ass what is it song you all need to calm tf down lol all this is is just a reveal trailer like hey yes that leak was legit were makeing rage 2 i guarante the actual trailer will be less over the top like this oh and on a side notehow can you say this game will be shit when you havnt seen a damn thing about it yet xd good lord just chill and wait for the gameplay reveal wich is tomorrow for all ya dumb fucks out there who didnt watch till the end this real i am so happy this so surprising thankyou bethesda bethesda have already announced games coming to other platforms updates dlcs and even games and its still apparently their biggest conference hopefully we get to kill those colourfull degenerate humans and mutants thats an awful trailer if i ever saw one did they just rip off fist of the north star my favorite game was rage 1 imagine going to art school and this is your project you had to work on damn its cringey and just unappealing its walmart in a nutshell i gotta say that trailer got me hooked played it s few times already first game was really underrated lets see if round two will bring it up looks like suicide squad the video game no thanks fucking finally i loved rage it just needed more polish and an ending to not be shoehorned in allucard is that you didnt they just make fallout 4 oh boy the cringe is real when people complain about a punk look to the game and thats the style fallout raiders had for years and no one bitched i get the games apocalyptic but seriously why is everyone assuming the games going to be shit right off the bat because of a few colors blasted here and there are you seriously going to complain about the color scheme used by apocalyptic psychopaths youll be shooting in the face yes idc this game is going to be awesome rage hella needs this i am ready to buy it im not going to say anything about this until i see the gameplay reveal why so much hate nice i am excited for this game the first one was nicebut the ending the song in the trailer was also nice does anyone knows the name of it this crap has no soul i cant believe people are saying this is going to suck before we even see gameplay for it the first one needed some personality and it looks like this one is aiming to give it some besides that we have no idea what this is besides it having raiders guns and cars calm down people we want fallout not this porco dio well you have my attention whats that song i swear the antifeminists are just as bad as the feminists sometimes look what no one asked for nukaworld 2 looks great i mean it has to be a joke bethesda cant seriously think that this kind of cringy shit will actually sell a game to me sure why not when only thing you want is the elder scrolls vi and you get this rage gay pride edition delete this st pls awesome work bethesda ok i loved rage and looking forward to rage 2 but this trailer was fucking shit 015 by far the most interesting shit in this trailer edgelords 2 welp i wasnt expecting that when will you open the steam store page for rage 2 i want to wishlist it xd is that a dream after 10 years finally a singleplayer shooter again holy shit i had no idea the xbone could play games so in short since i havent manage to get the first rage muties psychos wastelands and madness for fuck sakes what the heck with the comments its fucken post apocalypse why the hell everyone see sjws or any other twat things here when this is typical post apocalyptic style and the way that people often raiders portrayed in this genre of games books and films its cool and gives a punk vibe not the fucken sjws didnt play the first one as i heard it was a hot mess guess ill see what happens dont think psychopathic females are related to a social justice warrior i mean how is murder social justice no new elder scrolls yet of all the series they couldve worked on why rage woo all these spicy comments to sift through really enjoying the hate ones that get shot down the tip of my dicks pink too damn i actually liked rage but this looks awful whats with all the bright pink explosions hope this series doesnt turn into numale shit like borderlands did you had so many persons involved with this trailer either none of them said anything about it or their complaints were ignored because theres no excuse for this video to exist not to be a killjoy but am i the only person whos recieving some flashbacks to suicide squad while looking at this marketing i fucking loved rage hell yes gimme back by wingsticks it just looks like fallout with more colours we want the elder scrolls its a bullshit ok now im concerned this looks like a reboot and pretty different game rather than the sequel it deserves why am i thinking of nazi vampires we have to trust walmart next time please someone kill this with fire i guess you can call it a postapunkalypse lol it would be cool but i dont think bethesda is going to do this game right trailer is fucking awesome well done 044 in game reminds me of tank girl meets paramore who or what is the target audience of this marketing it left me confused and annoyed rather than excited single player borderlands without cellshaded grafics love it 3 at least there dont care about there nda like other companies denying the leaks this shit is so punk love it was that bulk from power rangers i heard rage 2s developed by id software doom quake avalanche studio mad max just cause well i for one thought rage was an exceptional fps only major issues i had with it were the ending and the game being real brown in terms of color almost a hidden gem that a lot of people forgot about hopefully the second one is also gud throws up confetti asleast the music is good idk i really like this trailer the song is kinda good as well this is actually black friday walmart commercial ads all rights reserved by bethesda walmart if the game is half as insane and amazing as this trailer ill be destroying my xbox by drowning it with the load ill be shooting from playing this game it looks like the most joyfully insane game ive ever seen im very glad it looks like the more serious everythings fucked and dangerous tone from rage 1 is being dropped its like rage1 played a shitload of sunset overdrive and went to a motorhead concert wheres my elderscrolls or doom2 beth rage 1 was boring lets see if u can make it fun bethesda this was poorly choreographed kinda hard to see the tone they went for okay so they just turned rage into a complete joke theres tonedeaf bethesda for ya also not sure how much avalanche studios can be trusted anymore me seeing the trailer on my homepage people wanted a second rage me 8 seconds into the ad sold i dunno im personally ok with this i liked rage didnt love it but it had solid shooting and cool ideas guess they figured to try and flesh it all out this time i just pray to god its not battle royale centered peace of shit i quite like this trailer the music is probably my favourite part perfect for absolutely wrecking shit in a wasteland setting didnt play the first one might keep an eye on this one awful trailer im now worried about this game what this nonsense it called trailer took u long enough i wonder who asked for a sequel of this game this trailer is bad bethesda what the fuck is this were you on crack this is just toecurling fortunately red dead 2 is just 5 months away now really disappointed bethesda you could have spent your resources on some new ip no one asked for this bof who is responsible for making such a terrible trailer if thats the way rage2 is going it will flop big time ive watched the trailer i dont have much to say about the video itself but as for the music any hellsing abridged fans here xd well well well im offline for a day and the war boys are crusading while the spraypaint is enraging bethesda its been only a day but it feels like years yes finally first one was awesome lets see if the 2nd can surpass it everyone loves andrew wk rage was underrated but i thought it kicked ass im actually stoked to play rage 2 this game is gonna be some fury road style craziness and i bet the people upset and concerned will be very much surprised doom 2 wolfenstein 3 or prey 2 this is mediocore wow i cant believe that alucards in the game interesting trailer reminded me a bit of fallout merged with mad max like some of you im an old school gamer loved rage 1 for the immersive story and how they brought a new twist to the apocalypse games in the future i was hoping they would follow on from the first one but i think game creators now are making games for the next generation with new ideologies and morals its a shame really but hopefully we the older gamers and our ways wont be forgotten song andrew wk ready to die top it up whether you want the game or not i thing we can all agree that this trailer was absolutely shit not sure rage 2 is such a great idea i am open for everything though i really hope you play as a wasteland raider in this game im tired of these games encouraging me to be good i want to be a monster damn it walmart looks pretty cool i cant wait w h a t aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa so hype just cause 2 was better than 1 rdr was better than revolver fallout 3nv was better than fo 12 you get the picture i personally loved the first rage but this will be even better the animation better be as good as the first because if not then why bother developing it worst trailer ive seen in a while its like a shitty trailer made 10 years ago im pretty excited lol i dont know about every one else in the comments im so excited nah but for real hopefully they do this one some justice first one was okay should be good seeing who is behind the game time shall tell im bethesdone this is cringeful as fuck hope its just an initial and isolated misfire i hope we can at least customize our characters armor to more than that of selecting one of three archetypes like in a normal rpg or would that be too similar to fallout despite the fact that first game had issues i liked it it was a kk game now this trailer is just plain stupid and shows nothing of interest to me it looks like a very bad borderlands trailer i believe people prefer grim postapocalypse with a touch of dark humor here and there we dont want a bad borderlands ripoff mkay yall shoulda let the brink folks do this 400k taiser to say hey gameplay tomorrow hum ok right on cant wait if the borderlands 3 leaks are also true then why would i even bother with this 036 that fat bastard yelling with the lyrics is god damn hilarious 054 why tomorrow cant wait for another sub par borderlands knock off late for the battleroyal party holy shit this is garbage people dont seem to realise this is bethesda softworks a publisher the developers of rage are id and not bethesda game studios bethesda game studios will most likely still have something to announce at e3 if not then its most likely to be another pushover of a conference like last year correction its being developed by avalanche studios now thats a god damn intro video count me in cant wait for this loved the first game 54 seconds of shit that music though pretty lit there better be a walmart easter egg in the game cough wheres skyrim 2 cough bethsoft or id so bethesda i see that youre going for the saints row watch dogs crowd now you hiring porn stars do the voiceovers also thats a must for edginss cringe rage is a good game and the only problem i see in this trailer is that weapons and enemies are the same but i think they need to make everything new and i dont want rage 2 as well as doom 2 as well as bloodborne 2 and etc dont worry bethesda the people who are hating this are the ones still playing minecraft and they think those graphics are really cool or lit lol i cant wait for this game why pink this is a terrible trailer way over the top this may appeal to 12 years old kids people that hate mad max fury road also hate this trailer i love it sun set overdriverageedgy splatoon but shut up and take my bottle caps already so long its not as bad as fallout 4 of course nobody wanted this but okay so what its gonna be like a battle royale or something what the fuck did i just watch i hope the gameplay trailer blows me away this trailer is kinda shit on de lowkey man as someone who hasnt played rage or heard about itthis trailer looks absolutely terrible but id love to see how it turns out ready to die andrew wk for anyone else wanting the full song so its borderlands with neon paint i mean i love borderlands so fuck it ill play this too sooo excited for thisbeen waiting for this for yearsits about time i absolutely love the content these guys make but oah no i dont know what to think i really hope its good and can compete with boarderlands never heard of rage until now i will play the old one i do like the vibe the trailer is cool but kinda cringey i will still buy but i hope to see some remakesremasters of the fallout and elder scrolls series to keep me occupied until a new one is announced hope there is more than this or to hide a really awesome game im australian is this appropriating my culture this is gonna be great i missed this games gunplay so much dont want rage 2 leave adult dont want rage 2 moan crybaby finally after big pile of shit in recent months it is something i wished for long time dreams do come truenow all im needing is haze 2 and a new obsidian fallout something like fallout new york trailer was actually really cool hahaha when borderlands 3 gets announced this will be completely forgotten at last loved the last one its been so long rage how i mist u id rather have morrowind remastered or oblivion remastered id rather have morrowind remastered or oblivion remastered finally been waiting on this one since the first game ended hope its better than the first game rage was fun but it just seemed like it could of been better the gameplay loke dope had a very good time with rage 1 and was not expecting sequel in any kind of way but im still happy to see as it looks like it going to be another fun ride into madness yayfallout animewaitwhat bullshit trailer catering to amass hype and early purchases from people who still think fallout 4 is a masterpiece in terms of taste and iq awesome trailer we will always party hard d just another verizon commercial im guessing this is gonna be bethesdas battle royale game cuz the trailer makes it like theres gonna be a bunch of random gangs killing each other for no reason about time this is one of the worst trailers that ive seen in my life music doesnt fit to the theme and these characters are so cringe so its basically another dlc for fallout 4 right is this tes 6 i dont know how i feel about this rage wasnt exactly the most fantastic open world fps out there even more so when it came out of bethesda who have fallout for this to compete with but at the same time its been long enough that i could see this being a marked improvement and this trailer just makes me want to play it already looks like a proper decent trailer for a trash game lets hope its actually the opposite why the fuck does no one understand the post apocalypticpunk theme most of these characters look like and average raider from fallout or mad max but suddenly retards have decided that this is feminist sjw propaganda fuck off we are only interested in seeing the game and the gameplay not to look at some stupid actors doing silly poses trailers like these make me feel intellectually insulted like someone is trying to manipulate me though failing miserably degenerates like you belong on a cross ok its so crazy its a cinematic trailer yes wow the first game i ever played on pc is getting a second game now ill get to play this game on console xd rage 2 a battle royale from bethesda hope not yes this is the game i wanted wingsticks thank fuck those things are still around they were wicked then and lets hope theyre still wicked this is not how you do a trailer for rage 2 what a waste of time and money you already turned down so many potential buyers i played the first game when it came out now im gonna play he second oh yeah another destiny 2 killer xd ah damn i cant believe blue hair dye has made all those nice men and women into liberals maybe its why their world ended so early all i really know is that i suddenly care immensely about the tone and atmosphere to the sequel of a mediocre shooter i rented on a friday evening at a hollywood home video yeah remember those the one i went to even had a gamecrazy in it but after playing all of one hour of rage 1 i felt so repulsed by its use of brown that i thought it was trying to represent the overall tone of the game or was trying to send brain waves telling me that its shit like the cia does about my life when im in the shower anyway i cant believe liberals ruined something else again i cant believe that hair dye and fat people are real and there better be a mission where i can bomb a planned parenthood so that this videogame doesnt make me feel out of place in the arkansas trailer park ill be pirating this game in i like that theres more then like 2 colors now finally they are disgustang fallout 5 i just want the gameplay and guns to be cool the first game is great but this trailer is shit im waiting for a new fallout or elder scrolls game and skyrim doesnt count fucking hell bethesda stop wasting your time on games that no one wants and make elder scrolls 6 come on bethesda wwweeee want fallout 7 and elder scrolls 8 why you no give us basically half of this comment section if this just another garbage launch like 1 did not gonna buy it i was in high school when the first came out finally lame as fuck xd but rage was pretty good if rage 2 isnt wankers sticking tongues out every two minutes could be alright lol the name of the song mad max first person version the hell did i just watch whats with the arm in the car wtf is this shit doesnt get any better this trailer just tryhard freaks doing random shit i was excited about a new rage game coming out until i saw this now i get the same bad vibe i got and ignored when i bought fallout 4 well you fooled me once bethesda plays the who full blast wont get fooled again is this madmax also bethesda dumbasses the cretins were the bad guys in class of nukem high best trailer since years this trailers more evidence that the wrong side won ww2 i dont care what anyone else says i loved rage when it came out and still do i have high hopes for rage 2 there was a rage 1 looks like mad max after dropping a gallon of lsd and im all about that yes i waited 8 years for this wtf is this borderlands 3 so what was rage about i actually like the trailer the music in it too its getting so much hate though i guess i can understand why for some people who asked for rage 2 todd this had better not be starfield i like andrew wk but why rage 2 played the first rage and was hooked and played it till the very end the ending in my personal theory hinted at a possible mmo since more then one pod was opened were they called pods regardless of my theory its nice to see my favorite company bethesda bring forth its long awaited sequel to which i say well cocks shotgun its about time letsrage im interested just need to watch the worldwide revealed gameplay tommorow and see how it looks ive never gotten the chance to played the original rage what the fuck was that im not even angry im just confused what the hell is this trailer even much worse than mad max fury road i know its a game about you being insane and killing others but at least not put that much weird and cringy scenes really thats a lot of family love those raiders looks like a ugly geys fucking yesss but this is not the elder scrolls 6 fallout 5 or doom 2 why waited so long for this thank you when bethesda fanboys try to attack people and call them complainers for not wanting to play rage 2 when we havent seen any gameplay and we dont know anything about the story jesus christ the bethesda fanbase can be so fucking toxic sometimes im not sure if i will get it until i see some real gameplay i hope fallout 5 is soon ah yes a sequel nobody wanted in a franchise that most people hated gg cant wait fo this so its this game then another game and then elder scrolls 6 baby why do developers think its cool to make live action trailers because they just look laughably bad like this one its time to kick ass and chew lead while shooting mutants in the face with a shotgun yeaaaaaaaah i think like 3 people wanted this game and you going to die like a full fledged vampire its a shame your bloodsugar daddy wont be here to see it bethesda making something other than slightly different versions of skyrim and fallout 4 what is this trickery rage now with more tank girl the only reason ill buy this is if alucard from abridged appears in it that song was awful the arent we so wacky shtick is old now it is my prediction that this game will launch with poor user reviews but good professional ones this trailer is amazing the game can be shit ill just watch the trailer instead so no doom sheds a single tear god thats horrible its like a cod trailer but much worse somehow its miley cyrus postnormal it tries to be punk but ends up as pop just awful why is everyone complaining lmao literally just wait 1 day if you want gameplay salty fucks get ready to die nah us gamers are a defiant bunch thanks though i fing love this song xd anyone else get the impression from this trailer that this might just be another hero shooter like lawbreakers or quake champions fuck this game where tf is elder scrolls 6 lazy fucks the left really got in touch with fallout just beat the original tonight after friend linked this to me the ending doesnt seem so bad consider it a prequel of things to come gj 2011 this looks awesome cant wait for the bloodshed weh weh this looks cringe sjw trans buzzword dirty masculine women with flat chests are groooossssss have you guys never seen punk before fallout 5 looks great just please you can have your car stuff but let that be more of an option i loved the first game but it seemed held back at times by the only way to advance being by endlessly racing and upgrading your cars the first game are disappoint hope this one be good as doom great we all just got aids really enjoyed the first game looking forward to checking out gameplay of this fiiiiine ill stop procrastinating a rage 1 playthrough this better have a switch version fingers crossed reminds me of the mercenaries 2 track oh no people whos undercalculating this game must stop cmon guys its bethesda how could it be wrong i see bethesda seos are t4s fans too adds some color and a girl to the trailer autists omg sjw bullshit im boycotting you all havent even seen the real game yet be patient i never asked for this adam jensen the rage is great but what about the elder scrolls ffs not the online bullshit tho ty cupcakes flashbacks i hate these types of trailers their so stupid the video game industry has a serious false advertisement problem just show me what the game is actually about i get its just a reveal trailer and its only purpose is to generate some foreplay hype but thats my point im also talking about game trailers in general its stupid unimpressive and in my opinion it hurts my image for the game right off the bat how about showing some constructive criticism sight some problems with the first game and shortcomings and tell us how its going to be addressed and fixed in the reveal trailer instead of some stupid pointless dribble that doesnt tell me shit show off some new features to get my dick wet then color me impressed the red dead redemption undead nightmare trailers back in the day got me super hyped because they showed off the features of the game in the trailers really showed them off transparently i dont trust any game trailer that doesnt represent the actual game ju the new madmax looks cool literally who asked for this this is justreally ugly and gaudy maybe doesnt help that this hyperactive rainbow shit evokes obnoxious hipsterism and annoying social justicey stuff shitty nonsense trailer is shit that said its a promo well judge the game based by the gameplay trailer tomorrow i was really hoping to hear about doom this year holy shit i loved the first one cant wait for the sequel its like mad max but have no max looks interesting need to see gameplay before judging on this although this trailer makes it look quite different from the first i get a saints rowborderlands wacky feel from the trailer which isnt good cringe so the walmart leak was true awesome even tho im more interested in borderlands 3 than this rage 2 game lol but im happy for those who wanted this mad max with paint at least this one has some personality looks like rage crylands by ubisofty the andrew wk theme tho the first game is one of my favorites cant wait so they got nothing to show for the game itself sigh edit because you idiots dont even realize the problem here yes i know they are announcing the reveal tomorrow saw the lameass message right at the end of the video the big issue here is that they made a trailer for a trailer like what the fuck just release the trailer ffs otherwise im not gonna be impressed by these cringy cosplayers pretending to be something from a videogame let alone willing to see what they show tomorrow first impression is always important no gameplay video ok then fuck off we got tricked by their lame ass clickbait title trailer was cringe that was dope interesting some of these comments are braindead retarded first game was freakin great just please have a real multiplayer game mode or none at all the car shit should not have been the multiplayer at least not the only multiplayer i dont mean coop mind you the coop was fine albeit short as hell and pls dont be short as long as bethesda rpgs are and as long as rage was ill be super disappointed if the game can be beaten in anything short of 2530 hours i hope it doesnt rely on the first too much i loved the first game i cant wait to see more that is awesome 000 to 032 i was like ok im with it but after i was like uhhh if my my cought me watching this it would be more hard to explain then miny mouse and micky mouse porn conspiracytheorists starfieldstarfieldstarfieldstarfieldstarfieldstarfieldstarfieldstarfieldstarfieldstarfieldstarfield bethesda fuk you guys rage the sequel that nobody asked for i hope it is coming out this year well i hope bethesda learned from the last rage game not showing gameplay yet though im thinking yes and oh god no at the same time too bad they didnt choose songs form the clash so like why i mean the game looks good well i mean this trailer is certainly something ill wait tell e3 to make a decision but if there was no rage 2 i dont think anyone would be to upset over that a totally new game idea or just a new doom or elder scrolls or anything i would rather just saying i dont even give a shit about the game im just stoked they used andrew wk for the trailer never played the first one im a fan of mad max ill give it a try just remember the same people saying this is gay is the same fucked up generation that said this is america by childish gambino is great what im getting at is theyre retarded is this gonna also have paid for mods 12 of 10 i wanna hear the voice of john goodman again meh played the first one and it wasnt deserving of a sequel at all new mad max looks great fidget spinners are big in the future im very excited about this game and knowing bethesda and id it will come out this year people are such cringe lightweights these days trailer made me lol want the song trailers weak but the game for sure it is not i dont know how andrew wk does it but he always manages to get me super pumped so i am naturally hyped for this game i cant wait fallout 5 me ugh yes i hate this this is revolting bethesda more me please the hype is real strange some of these characters look like the meth heads in my city damn the haters are salty andrew wk because fuck you thats why when i think of rage the first thing that comes to mind is androgyny no one ever ngl that was one of the worst trailers ive ever seen for a game not feeling all this pink shit as well who asked for this id rather have a remastered fallout new vegas its 2018 why do such trailers even exist anymore graphics are good enough to leave fmv and such live boring clips in the past good thing that gameplay trailer should soon be upon us i loved the first game so ready for this what does pink hair have to do with rage goofy i really liked the original so ill probably still pick it up but i cant say im happy about this aesthetic direction as long as they dont blow it like they did with prey 2 1st game was awesome on the hype train choo choo first game was shit second one is gonna be bigger shit except a shit from a huge ass gay horse but not fallout 5 another year hopefully loved the first rage that damn shotgun wasnt the firstone a total failure my dreams came true ummm im disappointed as fuck can i get a movie with this much style and enthusiasm for a grim subject such as the postapocalypse i just have to ask why i mean rage was a good game but i dont think it warranted a sequel dafuq did i just watch i love the song they had no choice but to release this as walmart blew the whistle already wutface still gonna have a hard time competing against borderland 3 sounds neat fucking finally what is this piece of shii of trailer soooo does this mean borderlands 3 and gears 5 what the hell is this crap 13 hours since this was posted 17000 likes keep this updated the first game was so underated ir was short but good hopefully this is longer and a more fleshed out version the trailer is bad but hope they will have a better one when they announce this for switch my wallet is open i loved the first game oh boy they took everything i liked about the first games aesthetics and gave it a millennialconversion gotta say not happy with this shit right now thank you for reminding me of a song i havent heard in over 10 years wtf did i just watch i never thought they would make another one i loved the first game and had a blast playing it hopefully this will be better who wanted this the game literally no one wants this may be another borderlands vs borderlands 2 situation for me i couldnt get into the first one then 2 was released with that comic book style art and i was able to get into it i really wasnt the biggest fan of the first rage im willing to give this one a shot if the gameplay trailer looks legit also omg omg omg im so super siked for this i think this could be a damn good game if done right okay this trailer was absolutely awful however this is not the game i look forward to seeing gameplay tomorrow then i will start to form an opinion for the one person out there who doesnt know the song its ready to die by andrew wk got to finish the first one now finally the first one was great but had much more potential this one could be really good saints row mad max yes please i dont remember rage 1 being anything like this what happen this looks god fucking awful considering this is exactly what they did with fallout prior e3 i hope this isnt their big e3 announcement please give us starfield the first rage was bad give us a new ip ive been waiting 7 years for this game hoping the gameplay reveal turns out good so borderlands and mad max had a child and that child took a whole lot of lsd and became rage neat why is everybody so mad over this it is very obvious that it is over the top and kind of a whacky and crazy spin on a wasteland theme it would make total sense to use alot of different colors with cuts to grotesque mutants most people seem to have gone to watch the trailer with a certain mindset before hand id much rather have this than a tryhard we are so edgy and so badass trailer you guys need to have some fun man anyone know the actress who plays the blue mohawk lady rage 2 heaven for post apocalyptic cosplayers man i love cupcakes this definitely having a battle royal mode first one was fun waiting for gameplay reveal and to see how id tech engine works in open world game i like id tech engine in doom it was well optimized trailer looks promising and i like it just please dont ruin this game with microtransaction bullshit i cant wait i liked the first one so i hope this one will be better i liked rage and am looking forward to this but man that is a really bad video it felt like an early 90s cereal commercial just show some gameplay ffs from what it looks like it is a female protagonist music you guys remember from the batman 1997 film the uv paint goons httpsyoutubevnozv71vwy this game needs that effect with to make sense if theyre going to use bright colors the original was actually one of my old time favorites so hopefully bethesda can do it again thumbs up the song is ready to die by andrew wk for anyone wondering and yes it is bloody awesome mad max in id tech 6 definitely will buy hell yeah this is going to be awesome i played the fist rage and it honestly wasnt good so maybe this change of tone is beneficial even though the trailer is basically made for edgy 12 yr olds like seriously i cringed so fucking hard so if rage 2 is true does that mean walmart just leaked every major announcement for e3 2018 this is what i see when i look in my toilet after a nasty poo rage was a fuckin great game im so beyond happy to see a sequel this kind like fallout were is fallout 5 this trailer was garbage rage 2please have a better ending than ragegreat gameshitty ending my only criticism is theres absolutely no bass in the audio wtf is this doesnt look like a sequel to me oh well yyesssss i have been waiting so long this 1 minute trailer for rage 2 gave me more entertainment the bungies destiny 2 expansion what game engine i loved the gameplay of the first rage but the world never really drew me in enough to get past the first few levels i love this new style though and i cant wait to see more this game looks decent so far from this trailer but you can only judge tomorrow when gameplay comes out all i am hoping is that what pete hines said about how there will be a game for everyone being shown at this e3 and that this e3 is the longest one yet because there are plenty of big reveals is true and that bethesda game studios will come with a game like starfield or another new ip cant wait omg yesss its been so long since we first one i cant wait to get this game jesus what the fuck is wrong with me i thought i was getting the cupcakes animation as an ad what a fucking horrible announcement trailer i hope they add a full body dismemberment system like if you do to its reaaaallll bethesda games women are friggin ugly its a pain in the arse to make one in a character creator that doesnt look like a crackwhorealienover 40 ps looks like the protagonist is gonna be a chick from the few rpgish ass shots of someone we are getting at 12 and 44 this is gonna be fun lets hope its as polished as wolfenstein the new colossus hellsing ultimate abridged wow i didnt expect that that was a fuc surprise wut is this a new dlc for fallout i really enjoyed the first rage but it had major issues i have a good feeling about rage 2 tho they did a amazing job on doom and wolfenstien so i feel like there gunna knock this game out of the park but i gotta say this trailer was pretty cringe great song but over i feel like it was a mess is it bad that im disapointed i was really hoping for a new fallout or tes game literally everyone on twitter replyed with negative comments lol this games gonna flop definitely has me interested because i liked the first one glad gameplay is coming tomorrow yeah story went no where but the characters along the way were fun and it was a great shooter i mean id so of course it was a great shooter i think the towns had great atmosphere too so hopefully with this new generation of consoles itll be able to be what the first one wasnt wtf i bought the first rage game when i was in the 7th grade and i played it for literally a full 24 hours until i beat the game one of my favorite childhood memories no one asked for this why the homoeroticism tho bethesda game studios makes fallout and the elder scrolls bethesda softworks is a game publisher that publishes for zenimax which is the parent company that owns bethesda id software arkane studios and so on id software is developing rage 2 and bethesda softworks is publishing it just because their name is on it doesnt mean their game studio isnt developing the game you want a quick recap for any troglodytes that dont understand rage 2 is not being released in the place of fallout the elder scrolls or even starfield was uwe boll hired for this wow i havent the words this game trailer looks like ass the music was fkn terrible not es 6 not starfield also this is not in game footage so who cares this gave me aids this reminds me of hellsing abridged please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit please dont be shit this trailer looks super gay there is one good way to make this game good make it goofyish dont make it serious just make it crazy fun andrew wk um sign me the fuck up this is going to be bat shit crazy looks decent i have high expectations since this is being made by the same devs that worked on mad max and just cause also just a quick psa this is being made by id software and avalanche and is being published by bethesda software not bethesda game studios devs behind fallout and elder scrolls cant believe people cant tell the difference nowadays i loved rage but damnit bethesda i want elder scrolls whoever made this trailer was on waaaaaaay too much weed anyone else immediately think of hellsing ultimate abridged when they heard the music these comments are a hilarious storm of salt i bet beth marketing people are happy that their little trailer elicits emotions in people no elder scrolls 6 wow thanks graphics are very realistic i got suspended today and i was really mad but this just made my day thank you so much bethesda fuck yes i dont see why everyone is complaining id is awesome and so is bethesda i really wouldnt complain because look what they have done with doom they are going to treat this game well and all these critics will be overwhelmed because of how good this game will be ill be waiting why the actual fuck are devs still releasing liveaction trailers for fucking video games rage 2 now with 1000 more color can anyone tell me what song this is should have been fallout 5 instead of this bethesda just gets everyone on that hip train i wasnt too intrested at first but you used ready to die for the trailer take my 60 now they didnt show us anything no starfield great now im going to have to wait two extra years for doom 5 fuck mad max this what i want right here hate trailers like this gets flashbacks to cupcake hd nintendo switch i expect a mp heavy game with some singleplayer and maybe battle royal something like borderlands with more multiplayer first one was garbage but hey this could only be an improvement and if takes forever for borderlands 3 then ill have to try it also one thing i could take away from the first game was the prequel comic those covers from simon bisley were awesome all those hipster games nowadays even in post apocalyps gotta keep the good memories from part 1 and not touch this its been confirmed mah dudes 13 of comments yes rage 2 13 of comments that was the worst thing ive ever laid eyes on 13 of comments why last bethesda e3 stunk i have a bad feeling that they will stink again this year with if they dont pick it up ill give this a chance to pique my interest further but if were being honest id rather just get a new borderlands andor fallout im sure the game will be fine but can we talk about how bad this trailer is what were they thinking this is so bad hopefully gameplay trailer tomorrow will be better postapocalyptic wasteland is a bright happy and tolerant place all right i didnt like the first rage but i guess ill try this one holy shit i am still waiting for a apology from bethesda for the creation club its even the creation club at this point i would have gotten over it but because of all the lying that came with it i gust wont a acknowledgment that they made a mistake and a apology for the disrespect of our intelligent for misrepresenting the truth if its punk rock then ill play it i dont wanna see any of those 43k dislikes come back tomorrow and be like holy shit i love rage gameplay is gonna be sick with how good id has done with doom avalanches car combat from mad max this could make for a monumental open world game love the soundtrack i bet its going to be epic looks like someone in bethesda watches team four star hipster pg trash full of fat lgbts kill yourselves bethesda no one respects you anymore give up i cant believe yall are dismissing this game already for just a announcement trailer wait for the gameplay then yall can judge i know that a lot of people wont agree but i hope this game is the switch i like how they spliced in footage of the coke heads running bethesda next to footage from the much more tame looking game at first i didnt like the trailer and thought it was wierd but the more i watch it i start to get hyped to see what it actually is like no one asked for this dog shit so is alucard a playable character in this or not did people play rage lets get ready to die bitches neat trick turn off the sound and watch it see the difference it makes hope it has super mega textures that look blurry and laggy as shit rip amd card owners i really fucking hope that id isnt making this instead of doom 2 games going to die fast asf watch oh hey its todd howards i cant believe its not skyrim 2 i joke this is the worst video game teaser i have ever seen i love andrew wk i enjoyed rage but it could have been more so hoping rage 2 gives us that i honestly hope this fails rage 1 was a hot piece of trash that no one asked for and the 2nd will be dead on arrival if at e3 todd howard will be on stage in cosplay from rage 2 trailer ill buy 2 switch version omg i never lost faith please be good please be goood andrew wk ready to die ok can anyone explain to me how this is lgbt pandering or whatever guess what you fucking edgelords colors aint just for gay people this is what rage should have been a mix between mad max and the craziness of borderlands cmon people rage is an amazing game hipe they even remaster it as well for current gen consoles cant fucking wait for rage 2 kind of getting a battle royale feel from this anyone else i hope not i legit cant fucking believe that theyre making another one this is fucking terrible been waiting for a sequel this is great idk how to feel about this god i am going to love this if its like the first just wish the first was longer trying real hard to be borderlands 3 when it should have gone in its own direction fuck haters the original game was perfect and the second one will be better trailer is awesome im too old for this will it run on idtech 6or whatever iteration that its secretly on the sequel nobody asked for this trailer looks shit cant wait if my memory serves me rage was cut short because xbox didnt have blu ray and they couldnt break the came up into 3 dvds and still make it playable and they couldnt release 2 versions because microsoft terms stated that they couldnt release a better version on another system if they did they wouldnt allow release on xbox none of this is a factor now so looking forward to this one i am definetly looking forward to rage 2 but i am also hoping for starfield if that truly is what theyre making from bgs but i guess well see i love bethesda games one of the worst trailers for a game ive seen in a long time still looking forward to how the actual game will look though clearly my new ringtone hope the actual game isnt so rainbow themed i loved the first one hello humans a car gets crushed by a giants foot the giant destroys earth in a matter of minutes its a glorious moment as you hear the sound of silence a giant can change the world for a true better tomorrow terrance out this made me physically cringe if there was ever a chance i would give the sequel to a mediocre game a try this trailer destroyed it first one sucked optimistic but not confident good on you bethesda for giving this underrated gem a second chance im excited for it just dont turn it into one of these shit multiplayer shooters keep it single player with a multiplayer mode if you must add multiplayer what no thanks ill just wait for borderlands 3 instead getting some mad max vibes from this sign me the hell up liked the first game a whole lot but this trailer has me questioning this one skyrim 6 fallout 5 i dont want play rage 2 go fuck your self skyrim 6 fallout 5 i dont want play rage 2 go fuck your self for the people saying that this game is already shit or it looks shit or it will be shit and so on who fucking knows sure i havent played the first game but you can at least give them a fucking chance its the goddamn announcement trailer for fucks sake for all we know this could be the best game ever made now that wont happen but give it a chance why tho its like flamboyantly gay twin brother to mad max kind of an awkward trailer first game was fun to shoot stuff in but it just kind went on and on and didnt know where it was going after a while it was the same feeling as climbing every ubisoft tower in a row gets old quick i really hope they do rage the justice it deserves this time around rage 2 was so bad the sequel has the same namw httpsbethesdanetengamerage2 what is rage 2 dive headfirst into a dystopian world devoid of society law and order rage 2 brings together a true open world fps experience where you can go anywhere shoot anything and explode everything there people stop complaining and starting getting hype looks like mad max and suicide squad had a love child i have been waiting for 7 years and i want it badly i dont care if creation club is on there i want to play the game myself colours and blood still own rage love it for its gameplay style but thats about it so come tommarow impress me bethesda even do u

avalanche studios who did mad max with id software that should hopefully excite more people who have their doubts i was foolishly anticipating a starfield teaser but after this one right here im on fucking board cringe fiesta i didnt think the first one did that well i didnt like it hopefully this isnt the only new bethesda game at e3 the first was short but it was amazing af its kind of funny to see all the people who either havent heard of andrew wk or only know him from dbd just absolutely slam on his music were talking about the man whos entire career and style of music can be summed up by the episode of aqua teen hunger force he was in this is the definition of bait a video game announcement that showed no video game interesting this trailer make me wanted to be hang out by my dog the first rage was cool it just didnt really feel complete in terms of an actual game it felt more like they developed some cool tech and just threw a game on top of it sort of like a console launch title just late to the party hopefully rage 2 doesnt make the same mistakes that being said i actually really like this trailer its cheesy and it tells us almost nothing but i appreciate cheese and it at least seems to have some sense of identity rage was actually a really good intro to a game heres hoping they dont end the second one right after the title card should have come up ready to buy rage had an identity crisis the feels like it knows what it wants bethesda is trying to meme this dead franchise into existence as a thinh stop it just no im so fucking excited never played rage 1 but im definitely playing 2 i wonder what this game is like guess well find out tomorrow wow what everyone wanted i didnt play the first one but i cant wait for this game rage had one of the shortest storylines in a video game that i have every played i think i finished everything in the game in 8 hoursits literally small scale borderlands with different graphics and no monsters we want the lawbreakers audience oh shit a new borderlands this trailer was way too upbeat for a game called rage awful trailer excited nonetheless i really enjoyed rage 1 rage 1 was awesome cant wait man is rage a linear game this would be great if it were powered by id tech 6 the new doom engine finally a continuation of a good game i played the crap out of thanks bethesda looks gay bethesda should be working on tesvi not this shit this wouldve been an awesome reveal if it wasnt leaked maybe it will have an ending this time im very surprised how many people hear obviously didnt play the first game pretty excited for this rage was one of the worst fps games i played the last 10 years lets hope its better this time this being announced early bodes well for the conference imo unless they made all of that viral art for nothing with the 514 which is doubtful i for one am excited for rage 2 a damn shame people are writing it off complaining without even seeing the gameplay trailer mad max ripoff ohhh who cares bethesda this trailer was fucking terrible all this trailer ever did to me was that it made me worry about what the games overall tone and writing quality will be like this is the worst live action trailer everliterally makes no sense these dam kids these days dont know what rage was about this trailer is trash this is the most cringe announcement i have ever seen if this has any reflection on the final product its is going to be a flop i had hopes damn im truly surprised this game is coming out i loved the first game but i didnt think it did well enough for a second game exited to so where they go with it though ugh this looks dreadful omfg it looks like a my chemical romance music video on crack it looks like a complete tonal shift but ill be optimistic nonetheless sad that id isnt making it though does anyone know the name of the song i know we have to many right now but rage 2 could ba a great with a battle royal mode the song is get ready to die by andrew w k lots of focus on the raiders it seems i wonder if we get to play as one this time around e3 is just around the corner the fact that they didnt wait till e3 for an official announcement for this game means that theyve more than likely got something bigger thats going to be announced might be a year before its released but this should hold you over till then well this was horrid i hope the actual game is better trailer looks like pink unicorn shit wtf i see here cringe rage had a lot of potential which was a shame but with the original incarnation of doom 4 seeming more suited to be a rage 2 and id software having proved themselves capable of producing a game worthy of game of the year doom 4 im hopeful for rage 2 i will say though that almost everyone in this teaser looks like a social justice warrior from the mad max universe if they had any i know im not the only one thinking it who asked for this seriously rage of all things rage was shit why are we getting a sequel to the most average game ever made its sales figures werent great either who was asking for this but will it be a true bethesda game it better have all the dayone bugs and require tonnes of anticrash mods to function so this is one of the games bethesda wanted to work on before es6looks like borderlands borderlands called they want their trailer back wot so fallout mixed with saints row that actually doesnt sound too bad this is one of the worst video game trailers ever scrapping the original tone in attempt to cash in on what they think people want hahahaha disgusting im a massive fan of rage and i gotta say you are turning off new players from coming to the series and you are also massively disappointing old fans what the fuck even is this trailer it looks like a god damn college students short film about edgy post apocalyptic life damn i have a lot to say but im just some loser on the internet so dont feel obliged to read my ramblings okay so i will start off by admitting that i am a touch biased the first game was my first introduction into gaming as a whole i wasnt very old at the time and it remains my favourite game ever even to this day i loved the art direction in the first game and it was everything that futuristicapocalyptic should be bleak desolate unforgiving and full of unnecessary death and violence perfect however this game seems to be losing track of that its too early to tell at this point but this game doesnt seem to take itself as seriously as its predecessor while i love the look ive gotten through this trailer it doesnt feel like the logical evolution of rage i see it as a direct parallel to borderlands the first one was a deserted wasteland full of death and misery it had some happy high points and a fair few jokes but it remained grounded the s im ready for the sequel i waited to long and the teaser hypes me up for it anyone remember hearing this song in the cupcakes music video thats the only other time ive heard it just be glad that we got this instead of brink 2 finally please let me get a side mission that closes up that ending on rage one so its gonna be free right the first game which had the worst pc launch i can think of was maybe 10 hours long with 70 of that being car bullshit and then it just ended they made a demo to a game and sold it at full price fucking ripoff i thought i couldnt possibly be any less interested in a rage sequel then i watched this trailer you learn something new every day i guess ech id is really good at making worlds but the last couple game have been kinda meh i want this game to succeed but i dont have much faith i will still buy and play it but theyre arent many people who like it that can critique it it will mostly be people who didnt like the original and will go into this game in a more negative tone song was 100 better in hellsing abridged just saying this is such a huge risk by id software they cant even bank on an audience of fans going out and buying this game because its a very niche title i dont think there is a huge need for another post apocalyptic game right now this game would truly have to innovate heavily on the genre to be good if its either received with average reviews and ratings or its received badly im sure we can say goodbye to this series stupid fucking trailer you paid money for this garbage i was looking for an elder scrolls and i find this crap i wouldnt say cringeworthy but just slightly obnoxious this looks like mad max on a acid trip 8 years perfect use of awk mymy lifemy love i dont really care what people say but im actually kinda excited to see where this game goes i just cant bring my self to be excited for rage 2 rage fell short on so many levels we will see how this goes im interested in this game but awful trailer this is possibly the worst game trailer ever im actually one of the few to like the original and very keen for this but this trailer is cringe worthy first game was good not great but this announcement trailer is so so rage really rage really nigga just wow why make a rage sequel look i aint tripping it will probably be good but why rage out of all your ips well then ive wanted a sequel to rage for years but after watching this trailer i feel extremely concerned andrew wk yesssss this game is a party thats quite similar to the leap in tone we got from fallout 2 to 4 or even 3 if this comes to redbox ill try it otherwise pfft not worth it id software i just cannot see rage 2 doing something new in the shooterverse where wolfenstein and doom havent prove me wrong but i just do not see this being a good game of all the games you know weve wanted you make this hopefully its not an empty lazy half assed world with the excuse build your own settlements its fun we swear as an excuse lets hope rage 2 doesnt have as much stupid car racing haha andrew wk stahp making apocalyptic games colorful its a contradiction someone else came by walmart what i love about bethesda is that they give a shit about their mid tier games unlike some other publishers just when i go broke too damn it make a new hexenheretic the first game didnt get amazing reviews but i thoroughly enjoyed it i shall watch this with interest finaly a game who doesnt is skyrim the sequel no one asked for though i do like the direction this seems to be taking based on the trailer hopefully it will actually be fun first game was so boring this feels like an intro to an old school tv show and thats not a bad thing love people trying to critique an annoucement trailer rage 1 was fun this looks fun relax ill buy it on choice of trailer music alone long live awk rushed video edit and production i have to give it to bethesda they got some real balls to make a sequel what a shit trailer what a nice theme lol so random xddd1 yeah no thanks i would be interested if rage 2 took a more colourfulcrazydark humor boarderlandsesque approach to depicting a lawless postapocalyptic world it certainly seems like thats what theyre trying for in this trailer what even the fuck for those who want the song its andrew wk ready to diei made a cod montage with it a year ago httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpiwhytvu20 i cant judge the game but this trailer was retarded yes more texture pop in this trailer is simply awful i loved the first one and this look nothing likeremember the towns and their wonderfull npcs clearly not the same universe they lost all the spirit and the mistery of the first one wich was a really underated game and a technical masterpiece destroyed by stupid reviewers that cant even install a patch i hope the gameplay reveal will be something else because this is just ridiculous i like that girl with that blue mohawk honestly this was worth speculation to grow into hype its no starfield but of course were a month a way before bethesdas press conference pree3 plus the first rage was an exceptional gem and had massive ambition i personally enjoyed it to tears so to the people downplaying the quality of the sequel over a 30 second live action teaser how about the wondrous concept of open mindedness its fucking id software if ive seen talent its definitely id software that defines that word why do people hate this the trailers is fun very well done and is entertaining honestly one of the best and actually entertaining trailers for a game i have ever scene this is great marketing old white people at bethesda im not liking the tone of the trailer loved the first rage i hope it keeps the same look but have a feeling it will change walmart is a god tier company so that happened mad max by any other name is still mad max i guess loved the mad max game btw rage 1 was okayfun gameplay but story wasnt too good and there was a lack of content i think ill pass on this one first game was great despite the abrupt ending i will certainly play the second but seriously what the fuck is this shit what fucking goon at marketing thought this ad was a good idea the first game was great it just ended too soon i hope the amount of tiume between games means this one has a longer storyline if they waited another year they could have said the classic after 9 years in development hopefully it would have been worth the wait hopefully they make it actually open world this time so awesome loved the first game bois i better be able to play as the authority would totally play this if it was a battle royale style shooter well that trailer was annoying as fuck restarted as f really stupid and unappealing great job bethesda played the first one and enjoyed it so im excited for 2 this will definitely have a battle royale multiplayer mode thiscame out of left field i wasnt expecting this but im surprised and ill definitely check out the reveal this looks like a complete 180 from rage 1 which albeit was fun but just when i thought it was gonna go somewhere the game endedlike they ran outta time or something hope this is more of a explore the wastelands style game with tons of guns makeshift and military grade along with cool vehicles and fun past id software references i know theres no indication of actual gameplay here but this looks like homogenous derivative overdone trash i really hope bethesda has learned from the mistakes done in first one the concept was awesome the gameplay was meh at best and insultingly bland and boring at worst well that was something i loved the original but the new aesthetic is looking pretty cool looking forward to seeing more does who think besthesda have nothing to show at e3 apart from this dont dorget avalanche studios working with id software on this title dont make normally games for bethesda there is still their main studio bethesda game studios arkane studios who havent announced anything so there may still be some suprises from bethesda at e3 wow this new mad max game looks great what is the song there was a rage 1 i wanna know where the fuck is tes vi looks fucking retarded and the style of this trailer looks like a rip off of 1 2 3 switch rage 1 ending was sht i hope the end on this is better and with multiple endings or allow us to keep playing or something that will make the game more fun and replayable about fucking time bethesda took ya long enough was about to play the first game a few months ago now i reaaaally want to play it pd is very similar what 2k did with borderlands 2 they change it to more colorful funny ans crazy loved the first one im fucking hyped for this this fucking blows this teaser blew my mind first game is one of my fav games my fav being borderlands 2 i seriously became 200x more hyped now brink two next year lol okay something is up i think this is just a cover up for another game could a more bland and uninspired designed by committee game even exist oh my gawd i loved this game awesome does anyone care about this wow the new borderlands looks great well shit they made a sequel lets hope all the other walmart leaks are accurate i am most excited for splinter cell and assassins creed that was weird why am i getting enormous sjw smells from this hopefully without a shitty ending this time really hoping this is tongue in cheek anti marketing cause that was quattro formaggio level cheese is this mumkey jones 2 doesnt look like skyrim to me just kidding i liked the first rage and am looking forward to this one snazzy job on the trailer as well even though it doesnt show much this isnt starfield made by avalanche studio makers of the just cause series and id software who created doom and its being published by bethesda with those names behind this i cant see how it turns out terrible you guys are just overreacting as usual wtf did i just watch seems like a good game to playwhile taking a walk in the night and killing some vampire priests cupcakes i love most of your games bethesda but im not sure what we need right now is more mindless violence glorification thumbs all the way down the more i watched it the more i understand the vibefirst viewing i was hung up on the little details because they used cosplayers but zooming out and watching the whole frame it makes sense now we just wait and see if the gameplay hits on this mark which in my mind is seeming like it would be fun is this morrowind 2 hello bethesda borderlands wants their schick back yes dick got hard anyone else d rage 1 had a long ass story line but it was good except that the ending left you with a wtf boy i sure do hope that my wifes boyfriend buys this for me damn this trailer was cringe the dislikes come from es fanboys nobody asked for this wow they did this instead of tes 6 you think they wouldve made this still without mad max fury road existing do i get to shoot every single one of those cringey motherfucking degenrates ingame if not il pass destiny 2 for weirdos why you guys use such stupid music for a trailer vaping will never be cool i dont understand the hate i think its a cool trailer well done looking forward to the actual gameplay footage looks like mad max on crack oh look they didnt learn from wolfenstien 2 and keeps pushing for uglier and uglier women and men in games bravo u guys learn nothing keep the dislikes coming i was excited for rage from the day it was announced and it did not disappoint me so naturally im super excited for this and hope it isnt another four year wait fuck we were going to announce this at e3 but it got leaked no one believed is when we tried to call it a fake so i guess we better just announce it this is an interesting way of announcing tes 6 loved the first one but i expect much more dead city and less this they really missed the mark with this teaser im still interested though hopefully the gameplay trailer will be a lot better as fun as this trailer is to watch i dont know how to feel about a video game trailer that uses tons of live actors in costumes very impressive awesomelooking costumes ill admit but it feels dishonest since it doesnt show what the actual game looks like still ill be keeping an eye out for the official trailer wow i cant wait damn it where is es6 rage was a repetitive demo for megatexture which sucked this looks like a casuals intro to postapocalypse i feel sorry for tes6 fans who still doesnt know the branches of bethesda softworks i just realised that andrew wk song came out seventeen years ago in fact the record came out a month after the 911 attacks someone had to many magic mushrooms finaly after so many years dude is this breaking bad 2 ive waited a long time for this moment we want fallout nobody asked for this its lgbtsolely cause they have the color pink in itwelp looks like colors now support an agenda and if you use that color you support that agenda i guess you also cant have females in your trailers at all or its sjw got it fun trailer lets hope the gameplay reflects it tomorrow hmmmmm doom 5 hmmmmm fallout 9 hmmmmmm eso 12 hmmmmmmm bethesda and bethesda game studios are different properties hmmmmmmm saints row the reckoning hhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm bitch lasagna this is the worst game trailer ive seen in a while looks dumb cant believe bethesda are wasting their time on this and delaying tes 6 uahrg dont go ubisoft with your vharacters and story keep it gritty this shit looks like a gearbox game lmao worst trailer ever made award congratulations bethesda using andrew w k is cheating that wasbad so that walmart leak was true oh bethesda you spend all this time and money on a game no ones ever even heard of why didnt you guys just make fallout or elder scrolls inb4 people are disappointed or surprised i was fucking tired of all these shills following ign gamespot angryjoe at the time blindly following the consensus that rage was a disappointing game rage is a pretty damn solid game but i can agree it was kinda disappointing to see it not push boundaries harder in terms of creative diverse enemies a underwhelming climax that could have been waaaayyy better but other than that rage is a pretty damn good game it had solid shooting solid driving except for that one racing mode im looking at you rocket rally had great animation like come on you have to support a game that actually does something innovative in each enemy having dynamic well done coreography i was in awe at seeing the enemies all run out of their hiding spots to duck actually react to you going around the cover or shooting them compared to lazy games where an enemy just grunts lightly keeps on moving unphased i usually hold skepticism with hyped games but i show good hope since id software fin i never asked for this it is rumored that rage is in the fallout universe only in another year im not hyped but im interested life action trailer dont help to hype anything ever but i prepare for a lot of microtransactions since bethesda got a taste of blood well i do hope this game turns out better than the last it had great potential i remember saving my bfg rounds thinking oh shit something crazys about to go down and then nothing i really hope the sequel bait was worth it as snarky as im sounding im cautiously optimistic about this game fingers crossed i love the song they chose bethesdas recent shooters have had a strong identity looking forward to seeing what they can do with this one elder scrolls fanboys are on suicide watch right now as soon as its released on gog i get it bethesda but seriously this is so unwanted and the cringe levels for the trailer are unreal damn it bethesda your throwing all the other developers on that walmart list under the bus to try hyping up your lackluster mad max knockoff utter garbage should have made a new ip this game better start right after taking over that freaking tower will there be mod support 90s punk like fallout and sunset overdrive i like how this is stylized but quick question is mark zucc cannon in game question will bill cosby be cannon question will disney owning starwars be cannon in game hmmmmmmmmmmmm wow and i was hyped for a new ip mad max ripoff omfgone of my favorite games borderlands 3 gonna outsell this lol finally a sequel to one of my favourite fps games im not sold on the direction at allreally liked the first one hope rage 2 isnt like all their other games not a huge fan of this trailer but i liked the first gameaside from the abrupt ending and lack of story oh goody bethesdas going to release a shitty mix of mad max and sunset overdrive that no one wanted because the first game was dog ass every commentor needs to stfu and see the gameplay trailer before fucking on this game you have no idea what its going to be like seriously doubt they are going to repeat the same mistakes as rage 1 they are not activison or sledgehammer or ea god awful trailer oh bethesda how far you have fallen those in top management need to be fired at this rate this company is going to be bankrupt in 5 years for their ineptitude and hubris in creative design and business decisions gotha ride that guardian of the galaxy colorful wave amirit how embarrassing i didnt even know there was a rage 1 it looks like it could actually be worse than the original hooray music is trash doesnt get me pump pink is the theme really post apocalyptic i enjoy the new art direction but yeah this trailer is pretty edgy lmao it feels really forced and stupid apparently you cant do any kind of punk theme without someone giving the middle finger like theyre in middle school bethesda studios now in 11 genders bethesda give me doom ii please ahhh thought you were gonna apologize and finish fallout 4 ok who was the one person that asked for this raise your hand please mad max hipster edition its like a college campus ran loose in a mad max world walmart knew it cool its like raiders of the broken planet except they want you to pay up front thank god we are getting colour and some sort of personality in ths game the first rage felt so generic what a waste of resources literally no one wants this where the fuck is starfield i dont remember the first rage being this colorful its a strange turn in art direction given the setting its in this wouldnt even exist without george miller something tells me they are taking this into silly borderlands type garbage this looks like shit and nothing like the first one that was great except for the shitty ending a teaser for a videogame with no videogame in it hard pass who fucking cares this feels less like rage and more like borderlands oh godi sense the darkness of a battle royal inevitably forced into the gamei hope i am wrong whatta faff is this a joke just like knack 2 this is a sequel literally no one asked for who asked oh this shit again the trailer itself speaks its quality lame like the 1st one part1 was my 1st shooter game on ps3 still have it but as i grew up i realized the story telling really sucked and all hope this has better story and narration no stop it bethesda stop as long as it aint the 1st one all over again time to beat the shit out of the wasteland again i never played the 1st one but i hope there is a bit of customization involved cant wait for the gamplay i hope its good did anyone actually play rage i am pretty sure i saw it in the discount bin a month after its original release and what does this mean for project starfield odds that this has battle royale i am stoked though because this reminds me of something akin to mad max cant wait for e3 me personally i really like this new aesthetic theyre going for with this trailer its cheesy colorful dumb 80s fun should make for a pretty fun and crazy game im excited hopefully it doesnt turn out a flop like the first game but if this trailer is anything to go by it seems like theyre going in an entirely different direction from the first game and i am all for it im cautiously hyped just when u think u have heard the last of andrew wk he makes his return some how oh the cringe im super glad you guys are giving us a another rage game before elder scrolls that is why i like about you bethesda you listen to your fans and customer base plus im sure the share holders prefer mediocre sales then to smashing sales records to the fucking retards saying bethesda should make a new elder scrolls or fallout game instead of this this is not made by bethesda game studios so if you dont like it you can fuck off and wait until 2020 something for a new entry to those series who the fuck thought this was a good idea get me some wingsticks boi i love this trailer have you ever wanted to play a game about gimps spewing rainbows i know i havent im still not sure what to make out of this trailer tbh but ill remain optimistic ive never played the 1st game so this one would be a fresh start maybe it turns out good who knows live actioncgi trailers are meant to promote games more than anything theyre trying to sell the idea maybe the tone well have to wait for the gameplay reveal to know more about this despite its many many issues i still enjoyed the first game quite a bit i hope that rage 2 takes all of the promises and set ups built up over the course of the first game and actually delivers on those expectations all they need to do is give us everything that rage should have been and actually have a real god damn ending this time i just dont get why bethesda would give us something no one wanted instead of the stuff everyone wants i liked rage was too short tho lets hope this is more inspired wheres starfield lol somehow i see this and think gay pride parade what even is this the e d g e not gonna be as good as fallout or borderlands stuck in the awkward middle nice job leaks are 100 ruining e3 it really sucks that this sequel got leaked early there has got to be some kind of penalty or real accountability to those that are responsible for leaking something earlywith that out of the way i am very excited and cant wait i loved rage 1 alucards always been a fan of id software games ill wait for the real borderlands sequel thanks i would much rather starfield then what ever this is everyone hates social justice warriors so i know lets have everyone look like a social justice warrior and take their most common hair dye colours to lace all over the merchandise oh dear i hope it is just a poorly designed first impression rage against the dying of the light wow bravo gearbox was there any game play in that just to let everyone know this is being developed by id software not bgs so if you were hoping for starfield dont worry are you going to release this on nintendo swith too if you like fortnite check out all these wacky things and bright vivid colors we have well what could you really expect from a game no one was asking for thanks for reminding me andrew wk exist psyched post apocalyptic brutal light hearted and fun im confused is the a bgs game or is there still a chance were getting starfield cause i remember they said they were working on 2 new ips which this isnt really one very interesting looking game and im intrueged but i kinda hope starfield is still a thing because that sounded awesome they must have something huge for e3 if they can announce this game a month before e3 super excited iits pink my only consolation is hoping that i can personally kill in game every character featured on this teaser yes yes yes finally really hope the final boss isnt a button this time first rage was fun af i mean i could just play fallout though i boo wheres starfield who the fuck said you know what i want rage 2 never thought id be excited for another rage had the original years ago and i loved it but until the walmart leaks i always thought that was it from the series glad to see the series seemingly getting a tonal overhaul too since the original was too grey and brown for my liking very nice and now i want doom 2 hell on earth fallout 5 looks great ffs no one wants this game also game of trailers have the worst music a lot of the time its horrendous covers of otherwise great songs bethesda is one of the worst offenders looks good but i would want a fallout new vegas remaster pvpcoop i need now wait this isnt skyrim why andrew wk is a god among men i feel like im the only one who really liked rage 1 despite how much it did wrong ending and being repetitive i loved the gun play of the first and i cant wait to see what they do next as i think this trailer looks so cool ahah im looking forward to the gameplay trailer tomorrow im guessing they are gonna showcase more gameplay at e3 since they announced it this early no stop please be a joke im so fucking pumped im ready to die wait im hyped for this game and will probably buy it but im glad it wasnt the big reveal for e3 id rather have sterfeild a new fallout or elder scrolls over anything tbh gonna flop just like the first one this looks better than rage 1 that was extremely disappointing plot twist rage 2 has anime visuals this might be their battle royale never thought this would get sequel you guys put off elder scrolls 6 for this i could use some more boomsticks in my life right now always kinda had a soft spot for the first one it wasnt the greatest but it had a nice tone and feel to it the gameplay was also pretty damn fun im down for a sequel oo what the hell is going on with bethesda please beth please get yourself together and go back to the admirable company you once were remember your roots and what made you popular in the first place ps also stop dumbing things down why so many dislikes favorite andrew wk song is this a commercial for people addicted to pink a friendly reminder that rage 2 was announced before half life 3 xd wait thats not tes6 looks good so far hope the game play and narrative match this the sequel nobody was aksng for what happen to fallout mami the new mad max game looks wierd what are we some kind of suicide squad the game tm whats with the neon pink i loved rage but this trailer was so lame who asked for this the first one was doodoo alright wheres alucard you played ready to die so that means hes going to come in any second now and kill all the nazis catholics and the kkk i hoped for fallout but this looks ok i hope there character creation rage 1 gritty post apocalyptic game with fun gameplay reminiscent of doom and quake rage 2neon pink mohawks and andrew wk bad first impression watch it at halfspeed to really torture yourself youre welcome maybe it will sell more than battleborn this was just awful hope the game doesnt suck this bad ok i dont know what to think about this ill just wait for the gameplay reveal i cant lie this looks awful not sure if its a good or bad thing but this feels an awful lot like sunset overdrive some experimental drug disguised and sold as a neon pink energy drink totally inspired by nuka cola obviously is gonna lead to the apocalypse wtf is this shit this looks pretty gay good music choice i love andrew wk this was a really shitty trailer fuck this so much hate for this reveal trailer damn i thought it was a really fun trailer hope this game is good the first one i remember was beautiful but story was meh gaylands 3 cringe edition love it will buy cant wait what next brink 2 im expecting hokuto no ken references i still love the first game hope this will blow my mind as well now we know we can get a wolfenstein iii if the garbage can that was rage gets a second shot in all honesty this looks like sunset overdrive and borderlands had a child with a hint of mad max looks fantastic cant wait to see the gameplay all those people complaining make no sense obviously they pushed this announcement forward due to leaks starfield will still be shown along with other games at e3 dont judge the game on the first one that came out years ago rage 2 andrew wk yeeeeeeeeeeeessssss its not the best trailer ever and i hope its not reflective of the tone of the game but for an eye catching announce trailer enjoyable huge fan of rage beat the first game this might work out yet i will ignore what i just saw i liked the first game it was just way too short and too easy i beat it played it on hard beat it maxxed out difficulty beat it then i wondered what to do with the rest of my weekend i did not find any major glitches and the post apocalyptic setting worked for methere was a build up in the story that kinda petered out with a nonclimatic end i wish they would just pick up where the first one ended and continue the story sorta like mass effect you know we wait tes6 andrew wk is god its kind of cheating to use andrew wk his music is raw energy that can hype a ham sandwich if you set your trailer to coldplay and its still cool then youve got a good trailer i dont think this trailer would have passed that test what the hell is this game even about i really loved the first rage but what a shitty trailer ill not judge till i see the gameplay tomorrow a good story driven game with a detailed open world with memorable characters is what we need im sorry bethesda but who in tf asked for this stillwaitingforfallout5 rage had some really enjoyable aspects and i highly enjoyed the combat lets just hope this is more of a reset than it is a sequel absolute garbage trailer waiting for the gameplay one hopefully game is good so i might buy it but just so you know bethesda you could have completely skipped this one and gone straight for the gameplay and it wouldnt make me less inclined to buy it just because of this shite this isnt elder scrolls 6 bethesda youre overthinking this just alternate between making elder scrolls and fallout for the rest of eternity and i promise youll make money it doesnt matter if your team wants to do something different you work for us now mad max the game good version i absolutely loved the first rage not a perfect game but way deeper than most id shooters without going as deep as a fallout a nice middle ground this game is being made by id and avalanche studios who made the mad max game which i loved if they can combine an improved shooter from rage and the car combat from mad max this will be an amazing game also calm down nerds starfield is being developed by bethesda game studios and is still coming to e3 did they really just rip tank gril that badly so many people are judging this game before theyve even seen gameplay you guys need to chill out did anyone ask for this why couldnt they just wait for e3 to show this well that was fucking awful rage 1 had potential but in the end it was boring and simply average i expected so much more from id 5 years down the drain rage is the only id game i didnt like i mean rage 2 might be good well see tomorrow but im really surprised that rage is getting a sequel no doom 2 for us no new quake that is focused on singleplayer im really surprised bethesda didnt want id to make doom 2 asap considering how good doom 2016 was edit oh avalanche and id will codevelop this game so we still might see doom 2 at e3 leaks spoil it for me yes more rage one of the the most underrated bethesda games my takeaway they lack the means to create normal shirts but they have bright pink vapes ugh mediocre immortan joe dislike who the fuck actually wants to play this just give us the next fallout or elder scrolls whats the song anyone know ill reserve judgment on the game i only kinda remember the first but this trailer is just atrocious the clips are to fast theyre kinda lacking in rythm and the whole thing is just trying so hard to be quirky wasteland weekend the game god i just love ready to die probably the best wk song should of just stuck to making mad max 2 no one asked for this looks awful for anyone disappointedbethesda and bethesda game studios are two different thingsno need to worry so this looks gay af what did you do i swear to god so many of you people are utter obnoxious no one asked for this this game is gonna be t r a s h just like the first one are you honestly listening to yourself just because you didnt ask for it doesnt mean that bethesda should souly focus on the pair of you who cant wait 1 more year for elder scrolls 6 or the new fallout give them time so they can fucking perfect the game i have waited 7 years for this and there are many others who have as well now go back to your basements and finish eating your fucking spring rolls what was this song i cant see this selling at all the first rage was a good game it just suffered from lack of content if they can fix that then this sequel could be great should of done a different song this game didnt do great commercially when it first came out and they need more mainstream appeal to get better sales if they want to grow the series and i dont know about how anyone else feels but i dont like the vibe the song gives off this is what mad max fury road should have been i would like to know if this was made with same engine as fallout 4 raider in fallout mad max i enjoyed the first game and found it to be quite enjoyable my disappointment with it was the lackluster story and horrible cliffhanger ending concerned the new mad max game looks a little garish the people that made this trailer better not have anything to do with the actual game or i swear to god i will kill everyone in bethesda software maybe im biased because despite its faults i like the first game but i liked the trailer i think ill dust off my 360 and play through rage again makes me wish for another fallout game trailer is pretty meh but im looking forward to seeing some gameplay bethesdas revamped id has been doing fairly well with bringing back old ips this feels like watching someone elses drug fuled fever dream id software now bethesda buckle up this outta be interesting if not amazing this is much more fun when youre drunk source am drunk rage 2 who gives a shit i already hate the pink blue colored mohawks can the multiplayer for rage 2 be fps with loadout system and game modes not fucking car derby multiplayer like rage the first game that was dogshit boring yes please wish you would have put more effort into the first one though dont disappoint us were counting you yes rage was such a friggin great game underrated with a flaw here there hope they dont go open world with copy pasted environments that look the same but instead a more diverse world thats created with interesting environments as they did with the 1st but just make it bigger longer develop on the driving with more to do on that side basically fix what mad max did wrong bitches love cannons seeing as bethesda revived prey from a neat antialien puzzleplatform shooter with spirits to a killer survivalhorror on a space station i think rage 2 has a chance woahtotally unexpected fucking love it reminds me of suicide squad with jumpy editing and weird color scheme i dont like this so imo the trailer is really fucking annoying but i love the color scheme already i think a really trippy version of mad max with better gameplay could be cool bethesda you fcd up yet again thats gay and ugly this is why bethesda will never be up there with the big dogs i adore the direction the game went i dont know what to think about this when you find a bug in the game just remember the time wasted on this video instead of actual content i asked for this what if starfield is a red herring i wanted starfield but this is good too amerimutt in 2022 wowthe new season of doomsday preppers looks intense as long as its not as short as the first one great game but only had a playtime of about six hours this must be the same fucking creative team that made woftenstein 2 the new colossus when tennagers take over creative control video game ips go to shit why not save the reveal for e3 compared to the original rage trailer you wonder wtf happened lol httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnh7hqrqywk did they think this was cool ooooooooooooooo yes please i think the style of this trailer fits to the general style of rage so in my opinion well done bethesda well done xd am i allowed to say im slightly interested in this without being attacked by keyboard warriors is it made by actual bethesda or the publisher andrew wk youre still alive i liked the girl im so happy that my fav game of 2010 will get a sequel d great job guys personally i loved the first rage and this lookswell very mad max so i cant wait for the gameplay reveal mutant bash tv returns borderlands 3 oh no it just remember me this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgqkkhjhui an asteroid hits earth humanity hey lets f each other up some more worst trailer ever seen preorder now for a track of the marketing team laughing at you wow there so many people dislike this okay i get it people were not hype for rage 2 i think they really want a rumored game like starfield i thought this was fo5 for a sec oh yeah this really makes me want to play the game please dont be half a game like rage 1 why would you announce this before e3 looks more like a trailer for a free to play battle royale hero shooter cupcakes anyone this gives off the wrong vibe i mean did those guys in marketing think this was a good idea its got andrew wk so its probably gonna be awesome then maybe you should have waited until tomorrow instead of releasing this idiotic shit fire your marketing guru whoever the moron is what the fuck did i just see lol and i played the first game too haha we want elder scrolls 6 not this shit yep that was obnoxious i want a hybrid between the arena shooter and vehicular combat i dont want a carryandcarry campaign the art desing in rage 1 was amazing installing rage 1 again to hopefully beat it this time just in time for rage 2 so im getting a mad max meets fallout sort of vibe to this okay well if it keeps the cartoon animated aesthetic of the first one i might give it a look when did bethesda give their ips to sjws where is jinx song i actually dig it a lot everything bethesda touches it turns into s day onelooking forward to this more than last of us 2 or anything else at e3 please remove the driving add more rpg elements and give us a real ending just copy fallout without the 50s flair even though i feel that the first game was rather mediocre this has me genuinely excited this trailer is really fun ok hold on youre releasing a sequel for a game that was essentially abandoned after very little dlc dose any think this looks like mad max and far cry this is the most cringy game trailer i have ever seeni wish i could unwatch this and regain the 53 seconds of my life back why didnt you just wait to release the gameplay trailer you know the thing that matters oh this is real not mad at all just confused why this came out before doom 2 or at all they litetally try so hard to look like badass punks yet they cant show middlefingers they cant show neither blood nor violence this is such a cringy comercially refined garbage so even thinking about it makes me sick the song is ready to die by andrew w k hey bethesda who the fuck asked for this hmmm nobody thats who either bring a new elder scrolls or starfield or stay home this is lame men should never wear short shorts end of discussion well that was an assault on the senses damn that song is cool if this is the big project im angry this will win eurovision 2019 no question for people disliking the trailer remember this was supposed to catch u off guard and not to be taken as representation of the game but the leak spoiled it hmmmm ill have to keep my eye on this is this song by andrew wk can someone give me this song i hate live action trailers so much so much cringe keen to see what the game looks like though you know the rules no gameplay no hype i hope its better than the first game though those are some good graphics hell yeah bethesda so what about tes vi i mean no offense but honestly that was probably the worst launch trailer ive ever had the misfortune of viewing actually no not probably it was definitely the worst the game nobody asked for everyone complaining about this or that yet im over here like oh shit andrew wk in a game trailer im sold i am but a simple man remove the video title and all the logos and i would have assumed this would have been a borderlands 3 trailer what the f did i just watch well i guess thats one way to kill off a large majority of your customers a more colorful mad max now beyond that i hope rage 2 does better this time rage 1 had so much promise but then it just ended whos thinking they should of done a new fallout game or elder scrolls no hate on this game it looks amazing i dont know anything about rage but from this trailer alone it looks like a mad max wannabe ok but why tho this mad max teaser trailer looks dope looks like theyre putting a lot of effort into the marketing i hope that means theyre also putting effort into the development more than just the graphics this time this feels so fucking 2003 i couldnt care less about rage 2 to be honest but i am happy that this is strong evidence for the walmart leaks being true but what about starfield whats the song in the trailer damn the comments here are a cancer shitshow rn be grateful for this it obviously isnt fallout or starfield but it will be better than the first rage for sure no one asked for the witcher 3 no one asked for god of war no one asked for horizon zero dawn no one asked for crash bandicoot remake and the upcoming spyro remake just wait and then you can bitch later blast of dislikes from nobody asked for that people i believe that tomorrow gameplay trailer change your opinion if not i feel sorry for you shit cant wait day one buy for me first rage was a gem this is what happens when you have zero clue who your audiance is was i the only one who was expecting alucard to jump out of a ship and start killin nazis and crusaders im not sure how i should feel about this i only playeda demo of rage and i thought it was decent but this trailer itreally has me questioning what rage 2 is going to be like not in a good way either this isnt doom 2 fuck off andrew wk ready to die yessss this is such campy wonderful goodness cant wait to see the gameplay crimson fucker seal of approval glad they are making a sequel isnt this just a mad max skin of fallout tho xd where is starfield where is tes 6 where is fallout new vegas 2 hey bud a little info for you bethesda softworks is not bethesda game studios the studio making this and bgs are most likely not even located in the same state lol someone seriously choose this over doom 2 what the fuck is happening hellsing ultimate abridged anyone im getting a coop vibe from this the trailer looks ridiculous lets hope for the gameplay to be better so your telling me we get a rage 2 but not a prey 2 you canned prey but you are ok with bringing back a old ip for a new game ok bethesda ok just watched a trailer for a trailer screw you bethesda this looks awful andrew wk i approve people will bitch and complain about anything the trailer literally says gameplay tomorrow so cool your tits and wait to critize the gameplay not the announcement you fucking idiots and those complaining uhhhhhhhhhh why is it not elder scrollssssss let me remind you skyrim came out a year after rage so if history repeats itself ill see you all next year seems terrible just like the first one bad idea why trailer so gay and childish ironically a game no one wants or seems to care about this will lose money ill go back to playing splatoon this looks like people who never grew up and think their edgy im embarrassed for bethesda and the folks they hired to make this fuck yes i want this game in my mouth looks like another generic pile of shit game all my yes i loved the first game just had a very anticlimatic ending at least this will fix that d fuck yesssssss finally i loved the original too bad they fucked up the endgame and it lacked alot but i still loved it hopefully they keep the coop in this one fuck bethesda im disappointed rage 1 was total shit where the fuck is star field oh what a day what a lovely day pretty darn cool reminds me of tony hawk american wasteland not in a good way that trailer was more splatoon and needed to be more mad max trailerish no idea who thought that would be good lol my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined rage was a very meh game what the fuck is this wheres rage 2 cool but gay this first rage was a little lack lusterbut ill give it a second chance its actually real im excited now oh come on waste your resources on a new tes not some another random postapoc game amazing how much hair product still available during the post apocalypse cringe 2 at least i was enjoying it for the first few seconds i dont get why these who know hardly anything about this game giving it so much hate what trash is this mad max rip off give us elder scrolls christ any trailer with andrew w k in it is okay by me bah mediocre the worst music i love that song dafaq is this shit looks and feels nothing like rage fucking hell this trailer is trash oh my god i just internally cringed the entire way through too bad this game is going to be bad so no doom 2 then if all bethesda has is rage and some new creation club update this year at e3 my heart wont be able to handle the disappointment i really really hope this is not representative of the tone of the actual game this trailer makes me rage looks like a lgbt ad wth give us true gameplay not this what a horrible trailer fire the marketing team jesus christ this trailer is fucking awful bethesda i love you but you know what im waiting for yeah it starts with a t and yeah it ends with he elder scrolls vi dont worry take your time but you know that im gonna be around here waiting love you okwhat the hell was that everyone calm your tits and lets just wait for the gameplay trailer once that happens we can actually judge it but what about doom i see ugly white people name this song where is the announcement for elder scrolls 6 sooooo rage 2 i was waiting for skyrim 6 i liked the first rage it definitely was not perfect there was room for improvement but there was a lot to like about it i have faith in id software to make it better i am glad the leak turned out to be true on this one i thought we would never get answers to that non ending for the first game i got excited to come home and watch the trailer then i took an arrow in the knee can i order doom 5 instead i hate it when trailers tell the whole story moments later they didnt show us anything dislike miss me with that gay shit its about damn time im sorry but this looks like shit rage 2 could be an amazing game were gonna have to wait and see rage 1 was a total mess but the concept was cool its almost like if burning man attendees breeded with the infield nascar fans i like it ummm this is rage hell yes thank you id rather have fallout 5 its almost like if burning man attendees breeded with infield nascar fans i like it what is the song the hell with all these pansies in the comments this looks awesome the first game rocked i hope the final game doesnt reflect this ridiculous trailer looks like something made by millenials on crack i thought this was going to be something shown at e3 maybe theyre making room for other big titles to show exciting yeah do you remember rage 1 yeah i cant remember it probably too learned nothing from that oh what a day what a lovely day fortnite mad max rage 2 maybe there will be settlements like fallout 4 cringe festa its gonna flop if it comes out this year music andrew wk ready played to dies irae makes it ten times better im calling it that theyre using rage just for a battle royal focused thing where the fuck is fallout 5 at new elder scrolls game looks good d so like is this for gay pride cringe galore hope this is a rpg with fps elements the fuck is this shit i need to know who the blue haired goddess of death is i think my heart went pitterpatter w t f as a trailerno see above for everything else 1st one was unplayable and they made a 2nd one that looks like cringey madmax ive waited so long such a shame fallout 5 confirmed passthe ending from the first one ruined any chance of picking up a sequel what are they doing just start on elder scrolls trilogy again im ready cringefelt like a mad max homage done by a fanboy which is a shame because im sure this is not indicative of the game itself that song and live action combo was justin poor taste i think i have cancer now cant hit the dislike botton enough garbage simply garbage cringe excited looks cheap real life actors whats next hand puppets it looks like a damn rated 13 teletubbie fest cringe i got instant hellsing abridged flashbacks as soon as i heard the music this is pure cap seriously why did they invest in bringing this game out of all games i feel bad because i know how developer worked hard but this game cmon still better than suicide squad todd poops his pants for breakfast you guys couldnt wait for e3 hmmmmm another bad bethesda e3 there is a lot of vining babys here huh i guess 10 years of sucking wont come to a close fuck you todd ohh no finally after many years this makes me think rage 2 will be a battleroyale game walmart confirmed starfield elder scrolls 6 rage 2 you bet your ass my ass isnt hyped for e3 makes me want to go play borderlands again a company spent money on this seriously well show the game play tomorrow but we need a video with with maniacs running around for today worst music ive heard in my entire life um did fury road and fortnite just have a baby too weird cant really have a grasp in the game that said i did love rage so im hyped what kind of sjw hipster cringefest is this this trailer looks like shit the one thing missing was icp song in the background isnt bordelands suposed to be cellshaded uhhhhwhat was that all ingame noncinematic graphics oh i remember the first one me playing it never thought in my life that they would make a second one who asked for this how about you just get busy on tes vi bethesda being that i havent played the first rage im genuinely looking forward to this ignoring the uhodd trailer and the average to straight up terrible reviews of the last one because i mean with a new game comes improvements well most of the time im looking at you ea yessss ive been waiting so many years for this just here to dislike this piece of shit gamethe first one sucked fuck this shit a game nobody asked for who asked for this what is the target demographic of this ad id rather have fallout 5 nice to see the wingsticks made it to rage 2 wtf is thisi kinda like it alright after seeing this this morning i was really pissed but after mattys video i might give it a chance i enjoyed the original rage hopefully this time around they can have a fully fleshed out game oh also the live action bits were cringy af the rest of it pretty good though kinda feels like they might be going for a vibe somewhere between borderlands 1 and sunset overdrive they couldnt have picked a better song andrew wk ready to die for those who are wondering this is america are you ready do tie oh andrew the mad men the absolute mad men well that was not what i wanted from rage 2 and i hate the colerful paint they need to give an epileptic warning jesus fucking christ this tonal shift is horrendous but i still remain hopeful it will hit all the core beats of original rage seems unlikely though considering the change of developer and likely the tech it will also likely end up being open world of fuck im depressing myself this is just an ad for burning man this effectively ruins a great andrew wk song no seriously what the fuck were they thinking hmm seems kinda cringy the game nobody asked for so borderlands without any of the humor or guns rage was fine all you had to do was fix the technical stuff and the story why would you do this why why oh fuck all the cringing pussies in the comments this is awesome damn what a disgusting trailer just me or does the song sound just like andrew wk party hard this is pretty well the most degenerate thing ive seen today i get that some people arent into this trailer and thats fine but the gameplay trailer will be out tomorrow so save your judgement till then on a side note i think this trailer serves its purpose pretty well with an upbeat chaotic song and visuals with some creepy and unsettling bits mixed in all in all for a quick teaser trailer its pretty good i really dont get all the comments saying that this somehow made them cringe partypartyparty i wanna have a party terrible trailer excited to see the game i gotta get my advanced wing sticks ready what a mess of cringeinducing crap soy tantrum 2 excited for rage 2 but what the fuck is with all the pink bethesda your getting pretty damn cringe nowadays wait theres a first game lol chill guys im pretty sure this is just a random crazy trailer to get our attention lets wait until the official gameplay reveal tomorrow to make judgements consider me fucking interested why i wanted fallout 5 or a new elder scrolls you cucks cant wait for nintendo switch gameplay video the first rage was really good in my opinion despite it receiving less then stellar reviews it was originally a new ip from id software on a brand new engine id tech5 which was the last one designed by john carmack before he left to go work on oculus other vr endeavors can only imagine how good it could have been if he stayed to polish the engine up a little bit more kinda wish id would of done the sequel but beggars cant be choosers who asked for this mad max ripoff this looks punk as fuck i love it and with an anarchy sign literally in the title of the game this is the type of character this game really needed to separate itself from too many comparisons to fallout which im sure itll get regardless i hope they keep this aesthetic wow what a huge difference from the original i like this new turn cool this is gay im ready to die tought its was very well made fake when saw this on other channels well then never finished first one andrew wk ready to die what the hell why all the hate wtf did i just watched i have this strong feeling someones behind this conep todd what are you up to bethesda better release fallout new vegas remastered who let the 12 year olds come on here expecting every upload from bethesda to be only fallout of elder scrolls spout cringe when they see something thats different radiant quests linear storylines bad npcs incoming in 3 2 1 the neon colors means its going to have some shitty battle royale mode right as someone who just played through rage 1 im not sure why you decided to make a squeal that game was very underwhelming i liked rage despite its weak story the shooting was fucking brilliant also andrew wk as trailer music helps looking forward to seeing it in action never before have i thought that a game reveal could make borderlands look normal right so if you are bringing back rage that means you intend to bring back prey 2 too or what oh sorry i wanted doom 2which makes me question why im heremake doom 2 happen lol the rumors were true who asked for this luckily this is just the announcement the gameplay should be good i have faith the music doesnt match what the shit is this shit am i the only one here who instantly remembered alucards arrival to london in hellsing abridged when this started oh yessss you better add the arena again fingers crossed this is just a horrible trailer im not saying it wont be a good game but who the hell asked for this lol these leaks are taking the fun out of e3 with that said im definitely picking this up i enjoyed the first one it had flaws but was mostly enjoyable with moments of greatness why the first rate was such a nothing game so basically fallout meets mad max what a piece of shit never asked for this cool a game nobody will ever play lol i live f0r this mess hey bethesda is bill cosby canon in the rage universe that is the real question hey bethesda is bill cosby canon in the rage universe that is the real question hey bethesda is bill cosby canon in the rage universe that is the real question what a shitty music god damn i cant stand the gaming community dont know fuck all about the game and already bitching hate this trailer but cool the game is coming out did this just happen post apocaliptic lgbt world this trailer is garbage who is this supposed to appeal to people who like the first game cause if so it doesnt why is everyone saying its cringeworthy seems pretty standard to me you kids are so butthurt and havent even seen gameplay yet this looks like a amazing mash up of fallout and mad max i am so excited for the reveal tomorrow oh man loved the first one cant wait for the reveal love bethesda noooo should of waited till e3 still hyped though well this looks fun never played rage but ive always got a boner for post apocalyptic games so chances are ill pick it up this would be really cool if i was 13 is this fallout or splatoon junkrat spinoff game we want tes 6 that was the worst trailer to the sequel of one of the best games ive ever seen however fuck yeah wow wtf this things with live action are cringe af ill just wait for the gameplay i really liked the first one but this announce trailer with that pinks all over the screen are just too gay ive been watching it for about 30 times and i cant stop i mean was rage 1 good enough to warrant this hype im not sure what i just watched ive never been left so confused after watching a game trailer like what is it you know what is worse than a cgi trailer a liveaction one this should be a trailer for a game everyone expects to see gameplay from the game that you want to sell who the fck will be rushing to amazon to preorder that sht after such trailer 1010 trailer ign mad max in britain cool this could turn out to be everything fallout 4 wasnt this video needs 2018 eurovision winner i just did rage and now this im sho hyped this trailer sucks but im excited to see what the gameplay is like hell yeah better get ready to die hahaha killing floor saints row 23 humour beyblade crazy anime intro music mixed together what do you get this hype after walmart leak 100 hype after short clip from the trailer leaked 90 hype after bethesda officialy released the trailer 70 hype after i heard that avalanche studios is responsible for this 40 to be continued what the fuck i just saw so many of you commenters are so prissy tentative excitement lets hope that after all these years theyve finally figured out how to write an ending rage 1 more serious story with fun bits sprinkled in comfy aesthetics well designed guns and armor tonally appropriate music rage 2 dude look at these men women with neon hair so punk dude look at these pastel colors and jump cuts so randum xd dude she fuckin flipped off the camera fucking bananas dude dont you love pop punk fightthesystem anarchy marxwasright dude dont worry its the same game it has a wingstick and the buggy hyped cringiest game trailer ive ever seen umm wtf bethesda did you even play your first game this is what being pissed on and being told its rain feels like isnt it i blame walmart for this like the song better as a dark souls meme onlyafro ftw i hope they had a lot more than this for e3 if we dont get some real rpg im going to be really disappointed not skyrim for the dishwasher es6 oh hell ya i loved the first rage game rebought it a few weeks ago too why dont they just do a remake of the original rage like the ending to that one was ass and made no sense im hoping this rage game is at least good its just company excitement people just hope the game isnt as detailed as fallout 4 its a fun game but not the preferable look what battle royal im guessing rage was awesome but nothing to when completed people that hate this trailer dont like the music of this trailer i love it that music is garbage i have never had so much cringe so what if fury road and saints row had a child please fire your marketing team bad trailer i just want more customization then the first so no john goodman im guessing i think this one will focus at comedy they made the burning man event into a game fucking hype looks more like borderlands but anyway gimme gimme a rage at the midnight is that a strogg at 015 brace yourself for a new battle royale game mode i definitely did not see this coming i am surprisednah who cares and i played rage i hope this isnt saints row rage is really underrated imo im ready to die the song fits perfectly the fuck is this garbage i hope this is good you have my interest with andrew wk these graphics are sick man the confrence must be amazing if they are not saving this kind of reveal to e3 wtf so fuckin stupid i count 3 possible maps if not more this game might have charecter customisation or a few charecters to choose from not being the ones you see in the trailer that would be logical if you played the first rage or saw the end if you look close you will see the arks in the background the main mision most likely being saving ark survivers from mutants or bandits or the group known in the first rage game as the authority rage 2 bit cringey there could have been an offspring song and here and nothing would have been different never go full australian never great song choice this sucks rage 2 before an actual quake sequel bethesda you only have bad ideas damn that was disappointing do you think this game will be coming on the switch bethesda crapped again first rage was awesome so im looking forward to this one but does that mean no doom 2 announcement where is alucard everyone can we get a new elder scrolls game or maybe something new like starfield bethesda how about raaaaage 2 no one asked for this ill go with borderlands 3 instead whats the song people hating without seeing the gameplay seems desperate to me that song gave me flashbacks to a certain video about cupcakes im so fucking hyped name of the song please the first game had almost no personality so a postapocalyptic gamesetting in the vein of mad max that treats the whole situation as manic unapologetic unironic fun could could be a great move im looking forward to seeing how this shapes up looks cool and all but i would have preferred the starfield everyone is talking about everyone expecting elder scrolls hahahaha who was responsible for chosing the music been waiting for this sequel for years finally it would be soo great if bethesda shows footage of this at e3 and people in the crowd kinda bummed out and then loghts go dark and u hear the fucking dudes in elder scrolls doing their chanting hears music alucard would be proud im ready for the bugs as fun as rage was it was worth it for the driving alone cant wait to pick this up and wreak havoc at least its not another skyrim i guess why the dislikes im sure this is going to be a blast nothing slows down my ride on the hype train like a live action trailer question is rage 2 from id man there is nothing more exciting to me than a trailer to a video game with absolutely zero gameplay not a bad budget music video my 13 year old will love this interestin now i wait to see the gameplay reveal wow this has to be the worst game trailer i have ever seen rage is the better mad max game r a g e 2 yeeeeaaahhhh thx bethesda why are people so pissed about this looks pretty fucking cool never heard of rage what is this game about trailer wasnt helpful at all wow no gameplay thumbs down this game is fucking awesome thanks bethesda to much childish but if the graphics is like in trailer thats not bad afterall oh cool glad they gave us the trailer for borderlands 3 this reminds me of the total drama island opening for some reason weird i remember playing the og rage 4 year agos and it didnt look this goofy as this so is this going to be like the first game you know where youre doing a mission then all of a sudden youve finished the game you open up the rest of the arks so we can fight the authority aaaaaaaaaaand end credits sooo i love the song it always get me in the mood for senless killing what basically was rage from what i remember i also remember rage being good but way to short shouldve just made a new fallout game centered around raiders cause these are basically raiders from fallout also would probably sell better than rage because everyone has forgotten about rage 1 whos next wet 2 these are some shoes to fill rage was incredible on last gen 720p60fps megatextures semiopen world on 2005 hardware amazing feat perfect song choice yes i dont know about other people but i loved rage and if they can capture what made the first game good plus more then that would be amazing im ready to throw more of those wingsticks c fuke yeah man rage was tits loved the mad max vibe and the split screen hope to see more content in this one though wtf am i watching rage was mediocre noone thought sequel is a good idea there were no expectations and this is still a disappointment what da fck is this rage 1 was a fantastic game perfect scenary the only thing that was awful it was that it wasnt a open world and we had a charge screen but this what da fck is this well that sucked loved rage though and hoping for something nice with the gameplay tomorrow soooo what fallout 4 should have been they literally opened the trailer with andrew dk are bethesda on mass amounts of crack cocaine looks like theyre having a lot of fun with it thats a good sign imo wait what avalanche is making it than who is making just cause 4 id software should i have played the first one to understand things like gameplay story etc witness me play this game why do people hate this trailer i think its badass ill have to see gameplay this is looking a little cartoony im still gonna play the shit out of it th nobody asked for this what this song you better be coming out with something else besides this bullshit rage is good and all but if this is all you got then it looks like its gonna be another disapointing bethesda conference this year soo no starfieldthis fucking sucks bethesda knows they already released nuka world right the first rage game was a muddy brown derivative and uninspiring shooter clinging to the bootstraps of john carmacks tech this trailer alone shows a hell of a lot more charm than the previous game imo damn ducked what game trailers are screaming get ready to die at you fucking fuck this this was a bit cringe wtffffffffff rageeeeeeeeee 2 o i wanted fallout you have no idea how long ive been waiting for this preordering immediately borderlands made in 3d graphics mixed with punk music and madness just make a fucking elder scrolls already what exactly in this trailer screams borderlands somebody explain to me im confused is it just the bright colours or somethin rage was my first m rated game hype im calling it its an mmo or something online only like destiny or division its been too long i remember when my grandma got it for me at christmas she even got the anarchy addition still waiting for starfield please tell me theres not gonna be another preston fucking garvey character please tell me its gonna have lots of proper scripted quests please tell me that if theres a settlement systems i have the option to use in game currency to have a dev created settlement built for me so i dont have to please tell me it will have actual rpg goodness in it please tell me you wont include paid mods please tell me it wont be just another hollow radiant quest ridden clusterfuck with nothing of substance to do rage is good but this trailer is terrible this is what happens when lgbt meets a mad max fan and a game designer this looks really shit am i the only one that thinks this trailer is kinda shit this is a surprise im having a hard time trying to figure out if thats live action or from ingame models curse you 2018 andrew wk whole reason to get it could have had a static image of the title with this song would still get it it looks fanmade tbh this is one of the stupidest game trailer i have ever seen in my life and this is coming from someone who bought the first game at full price when it was brand new i now have zero interest in this game whoever thought that having weird looking actors jump through pink smoke while brandishing weapons and making weird faces was a good idea for a video game commercial should be fired immediately wtf did i just watch this better be 60fps like 360ps3 version and not a slideshow like mad max excuse me wtf was that this looks whacky as hell and i love it this could turn out to be epic what happened to awks songthat was horrible didnt like the style when borderlands did it and i feel the same about this so far raiders arent supposed to be clowns on the side raiding isnt fun or a joke its serious survival kill or be killed i just cant get on board with silliness the game will most likely be great but the trailer is horrible i really hope this is like a titanfall situation where the first one was okay but the second one is amazing ridiculously stupid lmao why not fallout online that andrew wk vibe tho i was confused on why so many ppl was talking down on rage coming back now i see why this is probably the worst cheesiest cringeworthy unappealing trailers i have ever seen for a video game i hope you guys have something to look forward to on e3 what else you guys got for e3 this better not be it im sold based on song selection alone plus im one of the dozens that liked rage i slept on rage but i guess im not sleeping rage 2 since they used my hype song wait people actually care about rage lol love the trailer and i cant wait for this but i got a question for the comments who do you think pulled off the jeans shorts the best this is gonna be awful original idea they said new direction they said same shit different day bethesda i guess that means no new doom this year this commercial is pretty bad i hope they didnt spend much on it not sure but this announcement trailer gives me an odd battle royal vibe tho nobody wants this game sign the company over to somebody who is gonna make a new tes who gives a shit about rage 2 where is elder scrolls 6 damn it to be honest the way doom sold me was some god tier gamer posted an amazing gameplay on youtube i think rage 2 should do that alot of people appreciate watching godly gameplays first one was utter trash so i wont hold my breath for this one you know how you have all been asking for tes or fallout or even a new ip well heres a sequel to a game you have probably never even heard of thats like fallout but shit whoever made this and put bethesdas name in front of it this is not john carmacks game dude so we get to shoot feminazis and junkies awesome does the song have a name i hope they bring out a remaster like they did with dishornered when dishornered 2 was coming out loved the first game but this trailer sux sooo hard that pinky explosion at the back of the head at 011 i think ive seen it in some vox videos as well as somewhere else looking forward to this but still want doom 2 tbh this trailer is horrible terrible trailer tries to be too edgy however its always great to see old ips make comback so as always im excited boooooooo fuckin cringe overload if this is their trailer i cant imagine e3 good luck guys but you lost a fan cd protect red has officially dethroned you is that coop cuz there were a lot of duo groups looks fucking retarded its crazy that all these supposed studios keep coming out with garbage like this instead of innovating and using their brain for once can you guys do anything right anymore jesus trailer sucks but rage was very good game so ill give rage 2 chance to impress me im liking the style of it mad max meets suicide squad and made by the glorious bastards who made mad max the game what a day what a lovely day d plus bet you any money that these were all the villians theyre showing off p too bad it isnt starfield what is the name of the song i hope they improve the game im excited i liked the first one but i needed improvement all i heard is tfs alucard fallout 5 2020 will they never get that live action trailers are always odd skyrim mad max edition looks like someone put borderlands fallout and mad max together and then gayed it up i get a feeling its a battle royale this look like generic crap lootboxes skins and open world multiplayer quest bleh it better not be gay this is insane wtf i love it xd i prefer this to bordalands as much as i loved the first rage this looks stupid no thanks ill pass lol lol nice parody trailer bethesda this is a parody trailer right i would love for people to stop hating on bethesda game studios for working on this game seeing as it wasnt actually them bethesda softworks and bethesda game studios are two separate things bethesda softworks is distributing the game bethesda game studios is not making it i thought that rage was quite good i look forward to what the gameplay is like before i pass judgement what i will say about these early info drops is 1 thanks to walmart screwing up they may not of had to tell the world about this 2 maybe they were planning this to clear room for bigger news at e3 chumbucket better make a cameo that awesome card minigame better be coming back im ready for it man im sure this game will kick ass like the first one did im especially excited to see how the vehicle combat and driving has evolved it was always so much fun to drive around and murder some folks twisted metal style i hope it is not as boring as the first one i loved rage will defo pick this up i loved this game but i never played it full xd wot ill admit i do not like rage one bit but honestly i have hopes for something enjoyable now that its been over half a decade nice trailer thou you just couldnt wait until e3 bethesda on the other hand im excited rage is simply the worst game that ive played rage 2 promises to beat that record people criticizing the game when they havent even seen gameplay for it typical yes the trailer is cringey but thats the point its rage youre going to tell me this game is going to be bad the people behind doom which means it will have the exact same gun play as doom and will probably have a kick ass soundtrack just like doom i will hold my judgment back until i have actually seen gameplay for it which i strongly recommend you all do before casting your judgement its a shame well probably never see a sequel for this game me like 2 days ago lmao we want a new the elder scrolls not this disgusting shit suicide squad the game looks freaking cool dude aeh what happened thought it would be the rage 2 trailerbut wheres the link to rage part one was more mad max and this looks more borderlandish hm i was looking forward to rage 2i really hope the gameplaytrailer will change first impression andnope magenta isnt a lovley color i cringed so hard for the people who are wondering what song this is its ready to die by andrew wk the trailer is lot of bollocks but i look forward to see and play with it cringe please dont suck please fallout 5 or remastered nv3 or next elder scrolls in console that has to be one of the worst videos that i have ever seen seriouslywhoever made this should be fired asap those who approved it fired wowjustwow thx walmart to spoiler us all e3 titles holy shit the mix of crazy visuals and andrew wks song get ready to die makes this amazing i cant wait what an awful trailer looks whack that is they took two very average games that are interesting for a small group of fans wrap it in the wrapper of an instantly forgotten game that was liked by its fewer fans and hope that it will be of interest to the larger public yes cool and now what wow bethesda what a pile of shit 020 when shits about to go down at the gay pride rally no we want more fallout and elder scrolls this trailer made me feel uncomfortable look at it from the bright side at least it isnt some kind of a new skyrim mod that you pay 20 bucks for oh shit i fucked up pls ignore hated the 1st one dont give a damn about a sequel i was hoping for proper fallout by obsidian nobody ask for this but okay the gameplay for this has to blow us away otherwise no one cares rage 2 has finally been announced take my money now bethesda and id software such a shame with the leaks and all what in the fuck did i just watched sunset overragedumb why make a trailer with a live action cast also looks like a unicorn took a shit on it with all those pastel colors all over nothing says gritty post apocalyptic wasteland like pink good call bad choice id bad choice you guys should have waited for e3 now its probably going to suck as much as last year if no one brings up hellsing ultimate abridged i will be very disappointing that wasunderwhelming yessssss im ready for some solid gameplay didnt expect a sequel so its nice to get something i didnt see coming people are criticising this game already yes the first one wasnt great but lets see what they can bring to the table with this one ps the video is very weird sources say avalanche studios is making this one which is strange because id software made the first one havent played rage before so im kinda biased on this one but i really wanted starfield i love the attitude i am looking forwards to it as i like the first one please a couple of suggestions 1 better performance out the door 2 no patch should be necessary to make the game playable and completable 3 i get you are going to have dlc for it but please dont remove parts of the game for it 4 regarding any pc version please bring it drm free to gog all those dislikes are from fan boysgirls or whatever you are i dont discriminate of tes cant wait for this game i still play rage on my xbox one lol rage 2 ride to the borderlands hope its not shlock what a day what a lovely day first game was buggy as shit and totally forgettable hard pass i enjoyed the first one will buy rage 2 for sure but plz be it on id tech 6 and vulkan i hope the gameplay reveal is better than this trailer apart from the mutants this doesnt remind me of rage at all why do you think suicide squad is a good think to take off of pink shit for school girl was this a postapocalyptic gap commercial please do not ruin it oh wow i was not expecting rage to ever get a sequel but im excited i really like rage will see whats new i can already tell theyre going in a bit of a different direction with the mood with just an announcement trailer it is a bit odd seeing so much colour though with all the pink and yellow smoke but ill accept it heres hoping the ending is better though lol i wasnt expecting rage 2 to ever be a thing but i had a good amount of fun with the first one so i think ill be picking this one up too mad max is one of my favorite games so happy to see avalanche developing this this game is perfect for the switch what this announcement means that all other leaks are also true i loved the first rage thanks to the old id sofware if this game will be developed by the ones that developed wolf ii i will wait the reviews before buying it completely lost my trust after wolfenstein ii due to critical bugs no slimulti gpu support and so on i hope to see this on the switch actually cant wait is this a rpg time to get your fucking wingsticks boys hey bethesda dont forget to add me ill eliminate all remaining communists in the wasteland doom meets mad max please wow 23k where is elder scrolls whiners so far 3 pro tip rage 2 isnt even developed by bethesda game studios in all honesty this is the cringiest thing i saw in this month rage 1 was barely a game to begin with to the amount of people who dont understand the difference between a publisher and a developer studio this isnt being made by the bethesda developers its being made by id and avalanche theres the bethesda publisher and then the bethesda dev team two different things people bethesda publisher publishes multiple games however they arent all made by the bethesda devs for example doom 2016 and prey werent made by the bethesda dev team the bethesda dev team made fallout 3 and 4 and the elder scrolls games not id and avalanche this game should has zero effect on either of those games lets hope it has a bit more story and less linear gameplay otherwise im looking forward to this i was smiling ear to ear while watching this lets get the party started party hard looks like walmart called it we should be getting just cause 4 and borderlands 3 announcements soon wasteland and punks mad max vibes for anyone who thinks this is made from bethesda you are wrong its produced by them but its made by avalanche studios anarchiste approve not the game we asked for or wanted this looks abysmal rage 2 on nintendo switch with splatoon 2 crossover characters confirmed d reading the comments makes you realize how spoiled gamers are my god i really hope the people who made this trailer have nothing to do with the actual game when will companies learn that live action video game trailers are the most cringy way they can advertise their game what the song nobody asked for this i know this is a livecinematic trailer but i wonder if the background settings show us what the in game setting is like i want an extended version of that song it makes me feel happy about dying worst shit ive seen from years how they could call it rage next briliang idea to take adult content and make teenagers game last hope its only marketing disaster with this trailer i dont care if the trailer is a teaser of all flash and style a new rage game means more quality sp gunplay cool song hopefully rage 2 will have a much better storyline campaign than the first one looking forward to some gameplay videos before i spend on this title this is not my rage too bad they still have that dumb boomerang gimmick fk yeah ive wanted this for so long not sure if i like the new aesthetic for rage the original was a fairly mediocre game but the world was great if it were up to me i would have focused more on gameplay and story than changing up the feel of the game to much cant really complain though since its early days i guess well find out now that is how you announce your upcoming video game nice to see a sequel to a criminally underrated title music name or this is his own gamemusic i want a doom 2 but this looks cool too the dislikes are for the bad trailer i guess but also from the little kids and the fags that like to use their moms credit card to buy virtual shitty items from shitty companies like ea activision and ubisoft bethesda rockstar games and gearbox interactive are like one of the only normal big gaming companies these days they provide lengthy games that are worth buying because of their high quality unlike the others release games with many micro transactions and bugs thanks walmart drop this song and replace it for something amidst black flag it the dead kennedys and i guarantee you my money nobody asked for this make doom 2 or elder scrolls 6 u fuckers im ecstatic bethesda gave this ip another chance now they have the opportunity to fix so much stupid to announce this so close to e3 unless their hand was forced after the walmart post and the thread that was started because of the box art they shouldve waited to build suspense atleast a bit lol i still cant remember what the first rage was about and this didnt clear that up hellsing abridged anyone im all for a silly comedic postapocalyptic racingshooting game but the way this is presented just seems too obnoxious ill wait until gameplay to judge it though i was alright with the original rage although it was pretty bland that was really good i like the tone and the colors of the trailer that trailer was cringe as fuck but im sure itll be cool i guess idk this is an awesome trailer by the way i hope the game isnt as cringe as this trailer is i feel like this is going to be similar to when bethesda took over fallout 3 i hope its not terribly optimized gamepad on pc was hard work and i hate using the keyboard miss me with that gay shit is there really only one andrew wk song the new apple commercial looks nice absolute cringe horrible whoever greenlit this trailer should be put in the oven nice gameplay os life who asked for this tes 6 looks different than i expected is this bad borderlands andrew wk should be in more games awesome sound looks like theyre giving it a completely new aesthetic i mean at least its not skyrim for the toaster im gonna need someone to explain to me how this isnt mad max with mutants what type of game is rage all i know about it is that its an fps where you have a crazy boomerang so not much borderland is that you this trailer is utterly fucking ridiculous and outrageous i love it so much so fucking hyped wheres my prey dlc where is the switch version i really hope this game is more mad max rather than borderlands but the trailer makes it seem like they are going for borderlands style i remember being hype for rage buuuut never playing it bring me into the fold this time bethesda another zombie game wow how original bethesda surprise mother fuckers i bet you never saw this coming so soon ugh no doom 2 then im surprised this is getting made i thought the first game was pretty shit i didnt get to finish the first game but i enjoyed it it kinda felt like a fallout game minus the rpg aspects plus more intense fighting ill probably buy it once the price goes down oh yeah finally skyrim 61111 wow im honestly stunned this is actually happening after all the anticipation and prolonged development it really sucked to see the first rage be the failure it was its very exciting to see bethesda and id breathe life back into and ip with a lot of potential its just like the evil within 2 last year cringe i hope doom 2 is gonna be announced at e3 this year the concept is very good but no one remember the first rage or has played it so i cant wait for this game whoa asked for this too hype any game laced with social justice is hamstrung by it just make a game you dont have to make a point to add tough female characters or poc its weird inorganic and you can spot it a mile away hard pass from me this only happend because of the walmart leak so thi could be a joke and or it could be relesed butoverall we forced there hand agrred this made me uncomfortable maybe it was all the half naked buff dudes with pink hair or all the close ups of people licking their lips either waycool but gay as hell goddamn not only is this way earlier than expected but its such a treat and andrew wk fits perfectly for this holyshit this drove hype alot for me but i wanna stay skeptical yay the wingstick still here i prefer borderlands 3 the first game was largely underestimated because of the poor optimization of the megatexture technology and crumpled ending other than that it was a great madmaxinspired game i really enjoyed it really hope they will do it the right way this time nobody is going to buy to this yes been hoping this game would get a proper sequel for years after the first games really disappointing and sudden ending live action trailer for a video game man when will they learn of all the bethesdaid software ips this was the last id expect a sequel to considering how pretty much everyone forgot about the first rage this is a bethesda game or a ubisoft game nice to see theres other colors to the rage universe besides brown and grey if this was released at e3 itd be overshadowed by bigger games showing it now was the right decision jesus this is pure cringe i looks like it has nothing to do with original rage need ken jeong at the end of this video gay what is this garbage lmao is this the worst reveal trailer ever or whatdidnt want dont need and if the game is like the trailer well enough said now elder scrollsstarfield please bring wet 2 too that was fucking sick rage is fucking trash was i the only one that was expecting fallout 4 2 coolest thing about rage was the fact jesse pinkman played it imagine if it was something like quake 5 instead of this so there making another game about that fallout reject and there not making another elder scrolls some fucking joke really i really hope it will be good game but trailer with live action is stupid what the fresh hell is thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissss oh boiii familyfriendly post apocalypse for millennial kids well we all didnt know this game was coming out xd am i the only one who enjoyed rage dont get me wrong i didnt finish it but i enjoyed it for the most part coop confirmed for a game we didnt know we wanted a sequel for confirmed stop fucking around and give us elder scrolls 6 already mad max 2 or nevermind is rage 2 this is basically mad max what is this firrrrrrrre wtf wasnt this a joke first well thatsinteresting just a reminder to get new pc why are people mad this is a teaser announcement it says gameplay tomorrow quit complaining about no gameplay wtf is that who asked for this wtf did i just watch but i hope it this time a bit more like borderlands with awesome coop cant wait after a pretty run of the mill mediocre slog that the first game was you guys better bring it for the sequel i love people that are saying the first one was bad rage was nominated for best shooter that year for a reason do me a favor and actually play the game or just go turn your brain off on fortnite im sure 75 percent of people complaining are 12 years old sorry tfs beat you to the punch that songs already used theirs was much more epic rage was the best bethesda game i hope rage 2 will be at least as good as the first but no one wanted it are you so creatively bankrupt you cant come up with a new franchise someone will actually be excited for this trailer was kinda underwhelming wtf was that bullshit soooooo youre going full on borderlands now underrated game imo ill be picking up rage 2 whats up whit the pink and yellow color i hope its just for this trailer because looks gay af i mean im not against them but the first rage was darker as 7 years for the sequel we except the same quality or better but after looking at this trailer im scared looks dumb people wanted this edgy fallout or borderlands fallout nobody wants this game bgs loved rage 1 even though i was only one of my steam friends who had it i believe this isnt the huge reveal bethesda is planning for this year they announced this before the e3 to lower the expectations for whatever is planned i seriously believe they are going to announce the elder scrolls vi even though they have said countless times that they havent even started on that which is hard to believe these guys made mad max so theres hope but tbh i dont think any one asked for this so it has to be very good if its going to succeed rage is an ip that was put forth on the market purely because it had john carmacks tech backing it thats it bethesda thought carmacks name would be all you needed to make a profitable title and what the market received was a boring uninspired aimless directionless soulless ip that had zero creativity rage is an exercise in tedium and thats why you see everybody saying nobody cares i cant wait i loved the first rage first rage was a mess but i definitely think it had potential and a second game has a lot of potential as well looking forward to seeing how this turns out this is a great fun trailer people need to get those sticks out their butts and back on a bethesda hype train i bored terrible trailer i love how the gaming community has a liberal whiny side so this basically confirms the whole wallmart leak good to know what releases to expect ahead of time d who asked for is wtf is this i didnt play the first one but this looks fun ive been waiting so long for this using ready to die by andrew w k oh bethesda you lovely bunch but why tho im loving it it looks like its going to have a lot of funny times what gamers need to understand is its the developers who make the games and its gonna take more than 23 years to produce so they have a right to make what they wanna make lol imagine making something you hate what would the outcome be the first game was very weak i hope rage 2 is better so it seems like their changinf the tone of the game but that wasnt the issue with it for me at least it was just way too freaking short and felt a bit empty there was tons i loved about it but only habing a few hours of gameplay was awful madre mia wily se ven tan genial pero no parece rage xd oh wow im so hyped after watching this said no one ever guys you all seem to be forgetting the important reveal here if rage 2 is real then that means the leaks are very likely real and that means borderlands 3 is it bad that thats the big takeaway i get from another games reveal and basically the most exciting thing about it i dont like this tonal shift if this is indicative of the final game rage wasnt overly serious with the npcs you could talk to and the gameshow it had the right amount of humour we have enough far gone colourful wacky shit and far too few games that take themselves seriously live action is also never a good idea i miss really grim fucking shit even doom 2016 as good as it was was a complete tonal shift away from grisly hell with a metal soundtrack to chibi enemies and dubstep metal please lauch a 4k patch for xbox one x i only ask this song be on the in game radio looking forward to seeing gameplay but this trailer doesnt really do anything for me then again live action trailers for games never do nobody asked for this i thought the autoplay had started hellsing abridged ep 8 i was disappointed underwhelmed im not sure what wasnt a fan of first one get ready to blunder well that was fuckin gay might be a good game though this is going to end up like mass effect andromeda miley cyrus keeps getting crazier what is this pink shit yay look at all the sjw antifa hahahahahha im laughing my ass off right now what a big mistake this will be again i love it this looks sick honestly though id love to see a sequel to madmax from bethesda themselvesthat would be incredible yiiisss loved the first one still hoping a doom sequel is teased for release next yearnot a fan of ragefuck elder scrolls 6and fuck star field oh my god some of the comments here are so stupid this game is not developed instead of fallout tes or doom nobody said you wont get new tes or fallout this game is developed by external studio tes and fallout is developed by bethesda themselves and there is chance they announce doom 2 as well because thats developed by id software i never thought id see the day when this would happen but im so happy it finally did i really enjoyed the first rage and always thought that it deserved a sequel glad to see that bethesda and id decided that it did too if this trailer is any indication of games tone i think its going to be great the first rage was pretty campy and silly but presented itself in a more serious tone i hope for this game they fully embrace the crazy and dont bother trying to be too serious fuck the haters im hyped wow i am starting to see weird stuff after some cocain if this teaser is what we can look forward too in the rage series youre fuuuuuuuuucked because this is terrible i at least had hopes for something different but nope we just get borderlands 5 smh rage was a great awesome game but if rage2 is going to be a coop thing i wouldnt ever buy it and the teaser sure as hell looks like some coop garbage finally id said that they would make rage 2 after doom was finished and they keep theyre word im so happy looks extremely stupid and fun i love it btw what is the songs name does not seem to be darude sandstorm im actually happy but about this i didnt think this game would ever come really didnt seem like it met sales expectations but im glad theyre giving this game another go round this trailer may be cringe but the game itself may be actually good bethesda fans ok can we please get some new rpg news we lived through last years crap so es6 bethesda lol nah here is rage 2 for the 10 people who enjoined the first one is it wrong that i unironically like this the music is very catchy and its a good somewhat colorful departure from the first games serious tone i actually look forward to the gameplay reveal tomorrow bruhwhy please give us john goodman for this one too i thought he did pretty well in the first game someone at bethesda watched hellsing ultimate abridged wheres alucard lol what kind of players are they trying to appeal to with this kind of marketing trailer transgender meth heads maybe nobody asked for this you would have been better off making a new franchise that was fucking terrible holy shit dont ever do this to doom love it already glad they waited for updated tech also sarah better make another appearance and not as some throw away literally nobody asked for this this will fail when its released what a terrible trailer so this is what a liberal sjw feminist dystopia looks like im personally excited for this i thought rage had such a cool concept so i cant wait to see what they can pull off with this one why do post apocalypse survivors look like they belong in a pride parade imagine complaining to bethesda that they do the same boring franchises fallout and elder scrolls but when they do something else than the same old you loose your shit incredible im so getting this when it comes out loved the first one so much man fuck you haters lol i cant wait to play this because itll be a fun trip rather then the serious skyrim bullshit cant wait for the mrmattyplays indepth analysis holy shit i didnt think it would happen but im glad it did i actually loved the first game and i was hyped when the leak came out im definitely getting this i know im the minority but i actually had fun playing rage on last gen everyone is complaining how nobody asked for this game but forgot that they got a kick ass doom reboot when nobody asked for that the main reason for rage 2 is to prove to the developers that they can make a good game with this ip all i ask is that you dont judge now and wait until we actually see some gamplay because alot of live action trailers usually suck anyways contrary to popular belief this game did have fans fans who have wanted a sequel for a while i loved rage so much and wanted a sequel so badly that i thought and hoped the trailer for wolfenstein the new order was for a rage 2 id software doom quake rage noooooo yyyyyyyy tomorrow i loved thebfirst game i hope the 2nd is as good what a bullshit game who wants to play this no one just cancel this and start developing something like wolfenstein 3 or idk so with rage ii bethesda can you get ride of the mass killing raider ghoul only in your next fallout game seriously fallout 4 was already a rage ii still you can add some rage vehicule gameplay in the next fallout with larger area so it look less like a theme park with artificial interesting spot every 10 steps i think most of the fallout 4 players can agree that their best experience was when they entered the glowing sea the first time the next fallout game should embrace his rpg and survival style back and drop the mass shooting style now that you have rage ii please show us starfeild good god this comment section is full of idiots totally a rumor thanks walmart leak to all my special snowflakes humor comes in many forms sarcasm is one of those forms i did a sarcasm yes ive been waiting for this wow so pink and so edgy if this came out immediately after rage 2 id be doubtful but after id released works such as wolfenstine the new order and doom 2016 and are using the op theme from hellsing ultimate abridged to express the tone theyre going for i think this could work this might be the worst trailer i have ever seen in my life the comments section is absolute cancer they reveal a game early and this series has a large fan base yet its give us tes vi or we didnt ask for this good job idiots ungreatful people man when borderlands and far cry combine into one this clip is an insult to andrew we wanted a new elders scrolls not this shit even les announce on be3 so more room for starfeeld where is kenshiro not another battle royale in the market not you bethesda cringe horrible trailer did andrew wk make the music for this new starfield game looks like shit so far im excited i re purchased rage one a few months back because of the fond memories i had while playing this game was great and i understand it went through a lot of developmental pressures and wasnt fully realized because of that either way you guys did good and i could tell there was some passion there for the game and even now im this trailer i get that same feeling again developmental pressures aside i see the passion good luck guys i hope you get all the resources you need im excited to play this game and even more excited for gameplay reveal did an intern make this good use of andrew wk is ready to die playing while slightly off beat with the action or is that just me called it i should buy rage and play through it so what exactly is gonna be shown at e3 now i enjoyed rage despite its numerous flawsthiswell see im very confused and i like it so the game leaks are real just cause 4 baby well this is surely not a kids game i dunno who or what happened but that was less than a minute long but twas the best 53 seconds of my life was expecting a bethesda game studios reveal flashbacks of hellsing ultimate abriged elder scrolls 6 will cone 2020 what song in the trailer please i for one am really interested in this game props to bethesda for giving this franchise a second try another id game hell yeah rage was an awesome game that fell a little flat but the gameplay was great im glad id has hopes for their newest ip oh there it is the new elder scrolls weve been waiting for 7 years sooo the cover looked somewhat like cory graves am i the only one thinking that i liked the first game but this trailer is pretty shit a little disappointed but theres still hope thanks walmart for the leak this looks promising riaders broke out of mojave wasteland so you took the survival of rage and turned it into a modded fallout 4 borderlands hybridok this trailer is so great wacky yet batshit crazy at the same time truly unique mercenaries 2 all over again leak could not be contained how about a new fallout neat i guess i hope this game became an even bigger open world looter than the first and it looks more crazy but i always thought it would be awesome in 3rd person but thats just me im excited either way looks like a mobile game commercial if e3 wasnt so close this trailer would piss me of even more wow they used andrew wk damn those 90s00s feelings are back now i love bethesda even more wtf with the dislikes it looks awesome first rage was underrated as hell it looks amazing till this day like moving concept art gunplay is fantastic as usual with id games and overall game was really fun now lets take new id tech 6 engine which is amazing add avalanches ability to create cool open world and their experience with post apo mad max and result is rage 2 is gonna be awesome why are we getting this mediocre ip instead of a new fallout or tes but where is fallout 5 come on i dont want this im excited for this to me rages only fault was the ending it had great lore great atmosphere and great gameplay i hope this will greatly expand upon it and maybe add some more colour where is starfield that was about as exciting as a beige dodge stratus so fallout with only wasteland raiders they said the wal mart leak was fake does this mean it was all true this is it ladies and gents a return of one of the best fps games ever so bring on the insanity bring on the explosions and bring on the rage i got hyped for about 5 seconds before i got aids so excited i had so much fun playing the coop story with a friend and the single player hope that theres gonna be a coop component even on rage2 bethesda really needs to start indicating whats bgs and softworks better for people that dont know this is an id game with help from avalanche so imagine doom meets just cause 3 bgs still hasnt revealed their title yet why does the music sound like a anime opening no thanks i dont think anyone asked this either o party party party i wanna have a party i need to have a party you better have a party new apb mmo cool why whats the name of the song now if only we had brink 2 announced who asked for this this sjw thing has gone too far seriously where are the sjw elements in this how is there something im not seeing why not wait for e3 im sure the games gonna be fun and all but that trailer was absolutely horrible and cringey that sssssucked bethesda releases great games but this trailer was pretty lame i wanna se actual gameplay that cgi is amazing cant wait for the day models like that are playable cringe af what an awful trailer vr u ready ive been waiting so long for this im so excited song name andrew wk ready to die would be cool if this was like a new fmv sega cd type game lol i cant tell which part is real and which part is gameplay hope the gameplay makes up for the ass trailer and music i feel really good about this well we will see tomorrow wont we i love youuuu bethesda 3 i have gay friends but this is a lgbt rage the first one have an amazing dark pos apocalyptic world so funny that hurts i think they want the boderlands train hyped its like everyone having fun and cosplaying with some madmax madness no please do not be a joke with purple rocket launchers powered by walmart this being rumoured being done by the mad max team will make it worth checking out at least the new mad max movie looks incredible e3 hasnt come out and youre already announcing so early mad max on acid no thanks besides bethesda games are buggy as fuck does this have mega textures hopefully this game has a vision and they arent just ripping off borderlands punk theme for the sake of easy advertising looks like maybe theres going to be unique weapons and armor if thats the case then i expect stats are going to be randomly generated and the objects are going to be color coded to indicate rarity per industry standard thatd be the trendy thing to do and they could easily add micro transactions to make more money not ready to die lets hope this time the game doesnt suck as badly and hard as the first one i liked it better when it was leaked fallout meets madmax and my chemical romance cliff bleszinski is this you wow this might be the cringiest thing ive seen all day what sucks is i already hate this game based on this ad and i havent even seen gameplayfor all i know the game could be amazing but thisthis is bad i didnt even remember the first one im getting a mad max vibe with this game fury road 2 do a victory screech reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee me is sooo happyme doesnt want to die nowme wants to live to play this game rage 1 was good but i wouldnt spend more than 15 for what its worth the more i watch it the more i like it people in the comments say this trailer is cringyi dont see anything cringy here ffs bethestda studios knows how to rage their players they used ready to die for the teaser music i am officially on board enjoyed the first title despite the plot pacing issues megatexture streaming problems and general poor stability it had a lot of potential and im excited to see a continuation of the universe hopefully with performance and variety to boot this time im excited i loved the first game so who is making it id software thank you bethesda whos the developer of this game andrew wk for the win what is there to reveal about the gameplay it will be just another shooter its all really logical i guess reading the comments its apparent that the fans of the first one mostly hate this trailer but as rage 1 was such a mediocre game that most people did not care about it and never asked for a sequel bethesda did this and totally changed the tone for the sequel so in the end it will probably be good for the game because love or hate it this already looks more memorable than the first rage first on walmart i get wet thinking about how im gonna party hard playing this also the soundtrack seems like itll be as good as madden 03s whos this singer anyway wow i really didnt expect rage to ever get a sequel gotta say id and bethsda nice left hook praying for multiplayer whoever made this shitty trailer and think is a good idea to put a very edgy obnoxious music deserved to get fire from their job please have an actual plot this time around well i dont want rage 2 i want soming else so now im going to bitch about not getting what i want ill keep my mind open but this trailer is cringe seems to be good if its not like a 1st person shooter but a rpg like fallout and tes ill play for sure but i was expecting a new fallout soooo theyre pulling a prey and making a sequel that is nothing like the originalawesome s im readyto die unfortunately i cant say this trailer really grabbed me the game looks like a hybrid of fallout 3 borderlands and mad max whle forgetting that those 3 games already exist eh maybe the gameplay reveal will pique my interest i never played the first game but if rage 2 does peak my interest maybe i could have some fun another horrible final again this feels like a borderlands ripoff lmao anyone know the name of the song please great so e3 is going to be nothing but rage gameplay instead of big surprise announcements please have rpg mechanics trailer is mixed and i hope sequel realistically improves first game problems as they could in tomorrow gameplay trailer hopefully i can buy tons of useless mods for this game on the creation club 3 bethesda im a little excited but i was hoping for doom ii but in a different approach but its better than not having an id software game at all id software makes the most awesome games in the gaming community too much cringe oh cool i cant wait for triggered 2 fuck you bethesda eat my shit the more i see this the more i hate ea and activision for abandoning single player games they should not be considered game publishers anymore people should just ignore them im excited for this wingsticks r back bitch hell yea welp looks like i have another thing on my wishlist to playjust orderthis and this so thats what happened to the other half of fallout 4 someone should create a copy pasta that can be sent to commenters with 3000 iqs who dont know the difference between bethesda softworks and bethesda game studios who the fuck asked for this game this is so cringey i hope this is not the tone of the game rage 1 was great a solid fps with some exploration elements the tone was serious but with somes funny things from time to time please dont turn this into borderland i had fun with the first one my only gripe was that the story was very poorly done and it ended on a very fuck you for wanting the third act of the story cliffhanger beside that i had a lot of fun in rage 1 ill have to go back and play it through again before this comes out i loved the first rage get over it who keeps replaying it cuz of the music and the color skim looking forward to playing this on launch wish people learned the difference between bethesda and bethesda game studios looking forward to that starfield reveal at e3 from bgs btw so there will be a lot of people pretending that they loved the first game and now just like nier 1 the first game will rise in price a lot since people will probably want it lol i already have it for many years finally after i finished madmax i was really hoping for a similar game im still waiting on a minecraft 2 if fallout and mad max had a baby hellsing abridged anyone ehh we will see i guess im just happy about this announcement because this is probably one of the 2 games bethesda said they would be releasing before elder scrolls 6 and that means we are just a little closer to elder scrolls 6 fallout raiders on overdose jet with junk cars the musical trailer coming soon to nickelodeon who tf made this give us the best elder scrolls 6 please im dying to have it on my ps4 this strikes me as fake i actually hope its fake i dont recall anyone asking for this game lol this trailer perfectly demonstrates how europeans see americans hellsing ultimate abridged anyone everyones bitching about oh the sequel no one asked for make fallout 5 or elder scrolls 6 and to you geniuses i saywrong developer fucktards this is id software not bethesda game studios miss me with that dumb shit oh and idthe hell took so damn long lol i guess theyre saving brink 2 for e3 wow they really wanted to fit in with the mad max universe and the world lets out a collective meh despite the kick ass music borderlands from bethesda why does this like far cry 3 with rage style xdd fallout fat and gender acceptance where is skyrim ultimate edition this reminds me i want to see an aaa zeno clash game wwwooooooooooo lets kill some shit mother fuckers this isnt starfield why cool i guessbut who asked for this lol fuck yeah never thought id get to see a rage 2 so happy to see this cringiest trailer ever why didnt you save this for e3 ummmm ummm letz be honest guys nobody ask for thisbut if it reveals a good game is welcome so that website what posted in their shop by mistake rage 2 was right this makes me really not want to play this game fallout on acid with cars but borderlands 3 is coming out literally who asked for this sequel nobody wheres halflife 3 fuck you activision i am excited for this meh most would prefer a new tes hum i can see that the dislike ratio is from people that still dont understand the difference between bgs and bethesda softworks well anyway im anxious to see the developer responsible for the sequel and the gameplay meh idk why people are excited for this the first one was mehhhh 8 years weve waitedand im ready to go through hours and hours of throwing that boomerang all over the place what bethesdayou funked up fallout 4we have no faith in you what is the point of live action video game trailers they always seem so stupid to me pls dont tell us that you used id software for that i want doom 2 not this lovend the first one hope this will be good i love rage 2 and im so existed but this trailer is terrible hyped 3 cringed when seeing thisshakes head bethesda you can do better than this looking forward to it the first game was really good d inb4 people crying in the comments that its not insert series sequel name here 1 ive waited 8 years for this fuck off 2 bethesda is a publisher this coming out effects nothing outside of there being no doom 2 this year your precious fallout or elder shits is safe they arent the same devs go piss and moan somewhere else rip bethesda its a shitnothing morejust like the first rage game kiss me you fool being made by avalanche studios the guys that gave us just cause and mad max a fitting match ill save my like or dislike until i see the gameplay trailer i am a little curious if that mess of aesthetics and the general feeling of trying too hard to be cool are on purpose or just bad conceptual choices so colorful so badass ugh they should go back to the elder scrolls or fallout fallout 3 and skyrim those are two games that are worthy hell even rage 1 looks better than this stupid forced shit it should be called rainbow apocalypse the ultimate badass millenial edition aiming at watch dogs 2s spot as the most embarrassing and tonedeaf product in the history of video games eh i feel like theyre gonna make this like doom with no story or a really bad one like wolfenstein if thats the case they should have just made doom 2 first one failed hope this one fails also with id tech 6 vulkan and good open mad max worldwide gunplays id software must have thanks bethesta the best videogames company did cliffy b already abandon radical heights to make a borderlands knockoff this is very disappointing aww yeah love andrew wk awesome choice of music really hey bethesda if it works it works but i hope its better than the first yeah more boring fps anybody who uses the word cringe to describe anything in this comment section will be marked down as an inthecloset homosexual by the fbi be warned this trailer is more edgy then my name so is nobody gonna say something about keeganmichale key the first was cool this looks cool is that a andrew wk song wowthat was an awful trailer the sequel no one asked for where the fuck is elder scrolls vi this is a fucking fun trailer to be fair d hope they fulfill the titles potential this time around thanks walmart so im fine with rage 2 being anmounced but ive read that id software is not developing it primarily but avalanche studios from the just cause series kind of disappointed by that but im optimistic hoping for impressive gameplay tomorrow i hope its not like the first game where it ends like a piece of anticlimactic shit excellent walking simulator alucard 2018 hopefully its not terrible like the first game and please be open world wasnt expecting a trailer so soon but damn im excited i just hope they keep the serious tone of 1 what the hell are they thinking did we ask for this never played rage but remember it will be way more different than ids one this song is andrew wk ready to die what got some mike diva vibes from this this new naruto opening looks really good tone shift much i mean im totally on board but still was not expecting this looking forward to the gameplay reveal but why i never asked for this but im still very pleasantly surprised hope its good thank you bethesda been waiting for this game for quit some time ready to die andrew wk for anyone wondering really highly disappointed havent heard this song since that mlp videoah i mean oh sheet walmart leaks were true what theeer fuuuuuck im going to go watch mad max fury road in preparation for this cringe just fyi the game is being made by avalanche mad max and just cause not id like the previous one was dear bethesda i have one true wish for this e3 please announce you are changing either the name of bethesda softworks or bethesda game studios so we can stop the cascade of fallout 5 and es6 wishes every time you announce a new game that you are publishing but not making thank you for your consideration does anybody want this wicked bethesda first time a teaser trailer has ever turned me off of purchasing or preordering a game from you congratz rage 1 sucked ass but doom 3 did too and idsoft really breathed life back into that franchise so im optimistic rage was an okay game i had fun with it it was like bethesdas attempt at madmax felt like a game they made but forgot to finish a great tech demo maybe great visuals great gun play john goodman but no real story to tie it all together from this teaser it looks like they sprayed it with a thick coat of borderlands if anyone can do this ip justice it is modern day bethesda at this point im not entirely certain if they could do any wrong way to go bethesda you and andrew wk have gotten me way more hyped for this then i would have thought possible now bring on the game play trailer anybody else here because of eso what the mad max game should have been cool just hope its not all shoot all the things the last game was intense dark and sometimes down right scaryplus it had an awesome card game wow looks like a total change of tone from the first game i think i speak for a lot of people when i say this what are id not involved with all these pair shots are we gonna have a campaign co op also andrew wk for hype master could be good to get a new one in this series i loved the gunplay in rage and if bethesda goes into this making a game instead of a tech demo like last time i think this could be fantastic also love the song choice for this trailer man i wanted a another doom game not the tone i expected but one i can enjoy rageeeeeee hell yeah i hope theres still going to be a different bgs game i honestly loved the first one i cant wait to see what you guys are going to do with this one honestly if this trailer wasnt live action i dont think it would be as cringey i actually quite enjoy the sadistic crazy and dark humorlike vibe of this trailer what gay shit is this are the first 4 seconds in engine cause theyre awesome i thought rage was serious game about post apocalypse and terror of this world isnt it huh who knew punk rock goes well with mad max you know the rules no game no hype thats an odd looking elder scrolls what the shit is this fuck shows absolutely nothing so i guess well wait until tomorrow probably using shitty creation engine and looks like its from 2006 i havent seen something this retarded in a while developed in association with avalanche studios ok now im listening seems theyve gone down the saints row road with rage not sure if im a fan but again its just a reveal trailer tomorrow will be a better understanding this game looks dumb all of the potential for bethesda to work on great projects around starfield fallout and elder scrolls and this is what they waste their time on disappointed its not doom ii but ill give it a chance go shove this fucking trailer up ur fucking arse stop wasting my time with your live action bullcrap and show me gameplay will there be a remaster on the first with all respect and love for the first ragethis trailer looks like a promovid for a another battleroyal game or borderlands 3wrong choicemy dear friends this is not rage boom rage 2 cant wait if fallout 34 were inspired by mad max 13 rage 2 is just fury road oh nice bethesdas about to make their next big mistake wow look at the dislikes compared to likes oo strange cause this was an awesome random trailer where the fuck is starfeild worldwide engine showoff tomorrow wow the new fallout looks very colorful xd never got to played the first one maybe just the intro part of the game so i dont know what usually goes down so cant wait bravo bethesda awesome positive trailer you are last fortress of single player game idk man i really just dont known why on earth there is so many dislikes finally lock this one at 60fps bethesda and i swear to fucking god fuck u pete hines and fuck u bethesda sort ur fucking prioritises out guys because i cant be fucked to wait another 510 years for u to pull ur fingers out ur asss and start developing ur next elder scrolls title literally ruined my day u fuck tards it had to be this bloody song i always snicker whenever this plays during something vicious idk first one wasnt all too great not fallout or elder scrolls nobody cares dont buy it hope they can remaster the 1st one ive forgotten the whole story lol it was an awesome game next gen will be amazing what a piece of shit trailer as long as zenimax does not force flagship bethesda game studios to release another broken unfinished game that will never be patched i will support these minor releases me at the beginning of the year im gonna save up for something i really need bethesda heres our super cool game that we found you craving in your dreams this is why i go poor every year i love it the gameplay and graphics was awesome for its time but the story was honestly so lacking and forced so i hope they can elaborate on it more and not rely on the gameplay to make this game good because its a awesome concept that feels super mad max vibes did anyone ask for a rage sequel i enjoyed the first rage it wasnt game of the year material in any way but a nice bit of fun to waste a few hours on will play this one as well they should remake the franchise using the same name instead of making a sequel just like prey i really hope that this game turns to be good but rage was really a bad game the story wasnt appealing at all and we had borderlands too so when for nintendo switch what this is extremely surprisingi actually really liked the first one despite the lack of story and exploration but thats what sequels are for right hope this turns out amazing doom thats it i know rage 2 will be awesome the first was okay then doom came out and that was fantastic so i can see rage 2 being amazing to not interested give us doom 2 already now if borderlands 3 gets announced at e3 its gonna be hard to choose the game nobody asked for this looks shitwhat have you done to the tone time to go for a walk i think a very enthusiastic walk zenimax exec hey these weirdo really love playing nukaworld as raiders maybe we should make a gamer were your already a raider from the start todd howard we already have that its called rage and it was shitty game zenimax exec release a sequel todd howard what zenimax execrelease a sequel no one wanted this that was genuinely terrible who even does the marketing for these games i guess bethesda has something really special for us at e3 totally getting the dlc of the first game at the steam summer sale and then its time for a second playthrough i hoped they fixed the problem from the last title cuz i can some potential in rage i hope its not about finding our son man i never thought i would say this but i am really longing for some grimdark shooter that takes itself completely serious right now no fucking way a game no one asked for cool trailer though tumblr will this one have an ending remember how back in the day we got hot females like loosum hagarthat shit is not gonna fly today everyone looks like a tranny calling it now boys i am ok with all the weird pink and yellow all over but i thought rage was some sort of mad ma inspire stuff not neon color inspired dammmmmm did not expect the series to continue but thanks to bethesda for working on this project this is the bethesda project they were working on not a new fallout this if its like mad max you can count me in if no ones going to say it then i will we didnt ask for this at all yes this was my favorite game growing up i remember i had one of those old box tvs that were so old they didnt have hdmi ports and were super staticky and made that ear splitting noise every time you turned it on w a built in vhs player and id just sit there all day playing rage on my ps3 i was so disappointed that everyone forgot about this game so quickly and im so damn happy theyre making another one i just hope that the trailer isnt anything like the game because honestly this looks fvkin wack its been a long time best game video click now skgamesports seems to be going for a different vibe than the firstmight be alright but goddamn that song is annoying mhhh dunno how to feel about this one rage was rather mediocre all in all bethesda needs to fire their promotional team nobody fucking asked for this bethesda we wanted id to make a doom sequel as it was left on a cliffhanger so was this supposed to be the starfield game that was in development fucking try hards at least its not skyrim again why is this game being made the first one was generic and was slightly above average oh and this trailer is horrible 110 wont be buying this pile is it just me or the vibrant colors and music would rather fit a tony hawk game than rage just my opinion p i loved the first one so much i cant wait for rage 2 to come out i liked rage a lot but really never expected a sequel if the tone of the trailer is similar to the games tone this is going to rock thank you bethesda is it made by id though if so im hyped but why rage 2 rise of the tumblrinas fuck this wow that was a really stupid announcement trailer well well well i leave for a day and the catholics are crusading while the nazis are invading alucard rage 1 was awesome short yes but the weapons were cool the ammo types were awesome just my oppinion i loved the game and im super hyped and happy too many females not interested this does look good but wheres our fallout what a shit trailer this needs less suicide squad and more fury road are the textures going to be so big that pirates refuse to pirate it if a video game announcement drops in the woods and no one cares or wanted a sequel did it really drop at all will immortan joe be dlc the first rage was awful someone at id software pulled some thick strings for a redo what did i just see compare the atmospheric rage 1 trailer to this obnoxious garbage trailer for rage 2 link to rage 1 trailer httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcdlphzclnq please say the shotgun is the exact same i loved the rage shotgun it was perfection not quite a space rpg and i dont know if rage is an rpg but thats cool i guess holy shit worst reveal trailer ever hope your still an ark survivor who asked for this ready to die at dayone raise your hand if u saw somebody in this trailer who wasnt white crickets omg rage is back i pray the parcouring boomerang dudes from the first one return the first one was such a letdown i wont judge until theres actual gameplay revealed but i dont see why they made a sequel hang on is this being developed by id or bethesda i mean i know its being published by bethesda but is the developer the same team that made rage or the same team that made fallout 4 why why rage 2 i was expecting a new quake with the stroggs because of the new champion in qc strogg i still have the rage 1 poster on my wall i hope the ending is not as disapointing as rage 1 andrew wk fits this game fucking perfect lmao hope id will be able to deliver the same high quality gameplay as doom 2016 so the pack from nuka world not again loved rrage 1 beaten it with fist only hardcore mode wtf good times this is america white version fuck this shit im really happy that bethesda can take a risk because they have faith in the developers its very rare and people dont appreciate it enough also this gives me hope for a sequel of the new prey not gonna lie but if its like original im not buyin it best of luck competing with borderlands 3 boys buying both for sure great choice of music oh what a game what a lovely game there are rumours that this is being developed by avalanche studios httpswccftechcomrage2trueopenworldfpsexperience developers of the just cause series and mad max game that would be something considering that one of the other games which wallmart leaked was just cause 4 now i just want to know if the game engine is id tech 6 this looks a lot like borderlands with more smoke than usual i dont know how to not be excited hell yeah cant wait the first game was really shitty and nobody cared about it there is absolutely no need to make a sequel good job bethesda bethesda turned into gearbox this looks terrible the biggest question no one is asking is why wasnt starfield on the wal mart leak mad max but pink was probably the board room pitch this looks horrible who the hell would want to play this dumb shit that was undeniably terrible and also a massive departure from the tone of the previous game but i guess making everything completely ridiculous is all the rage ugh these days i really hope thats just a dumb marketing thing and that the game itself wont be like that but hey gameplay reveal coming tommorow so well see soon enough hopefully its better than this cant wait to spend my 50 cents on this crap the fuck did i just witness looks like the first game was remastered by the ymca gaymeplay reveal tomorrow thanks wal martwell i guess we got our fallout spinoff huh hmm well give me starfield and a oblivionfallout 3 remaster at e3 and i will be satisfied doom rebooted quake rebooted rage sequel the unholy trinity is complete waiting is over now pls be good meth max wtf bro nobody wants this shit elder scrolls 6 should be your priority lmao you people are fucked wasting your time on a fucking fallout shooter lmao skyrim sequel is all we want lol wtf go to hell bugthesda after shitout 3 and 4 i am not going to buy a single game with your logo on it or your parent company zenimax looks like fun and it sounds like a lot of people here are joyless cunts so its gayge 2 now are our racing certificates still valid i never had rage on the screen but that trailer looks like fun does it have black humour like borderlands or like fallout cant wait for the gameplaytrailer still hoping for starfield or any other bethesda game softworks work on e3 though holy shit since this is a major title does this mean tesvi is next is this prerendered or played by actors some of them look so damn realistic i never was so unexited about a game ill give it a chance i really liked the 1st game im sort of weary about the game direction from the trailer i hope they dont go down the road of the last mad max film just confirmed that id is not making this game thats a disappointment they made one rage in 2011 it was a new ip we wait years to get a doom reboot and thats it theyre only gonna do doom sequels and abandon the rage ip i hope avalanche studios makes a good game thats faithful to what rage was and the lore it built up the box art looks horrendous as well did anybody ask for a rage 2 im curious for people saying that its cringe and cheesy its how its supposed to be a lot of live action trailers are like that is this a id software game great now i must play rage 1 soo it was true pure garbagethats no one needs rage 1 was a graphics showcase not more so why a sequel if its not better than the first one im gonna rage cant wait the first had some great bits but was overall meh that moment when you realize the dude from destroy build destroy made the song in this trailer am i one of the only people that really enjoyed the first one only gonna get it if its semi or open world i dont fuck with linear games really i dont like spending money on games that last 2 days lol god of war the exception but thats sort of like a mini semi open game i still hold the prediction its gonna be a live service mmolite shooter i cried after watching this as it is a masterpiece i fuckin loved rage this is gonna be so much fun this looks pretty awful the original game was pretty forgettable too hopefully the gameplay reveal is more promising wellholy shitdidnt expect that just fucking gameplay footage thank you for wasting my mobile data well what a nice thing to wake up to if andrew wk is part of the soundtrack then its a buy from me partyhard ragecountsaspartying been wanting a sequel sine i finished rage when it released such a great game please add more coop shenanigans to rage 2 oh fuck yeah this song in a rage trailer awesome rage was not bad but not really my favourite game but nowstfu bethesda you got me d psa bethesda softworks is not bethesda game studios you triggered fucks mad max special edition paid mods incoming boring give us doom 2 get ready to dye your hair i cant wait to buy bethesda points for micro dlcs im going to be very cautiously optimistic about this i think everyone should just wait until tomorrows actual trailer to form an opinion on this game but ill be honest this teaser has me worried about the tone and style of the game seems way too punk for me does someone knows the name of that song its amazing battle royale with boomerang i hope not all the people in the comments are like noooooooooo elder scrolls 6 but seriously do your research this is being developed by avalanche not bethesda game studios who make the elder scrolls also if they are announcing rage now then that means they have something huge for e3 bethesda softworks is just the publisher people also avalanche made mad max and just cause 3 imagine a post apocalypse headed up by bethesda vehicle combat from mad max and the gun play and destruction from just cause in one game that sounds awesome to me dont forget to add a multiplayer with no anticheat that was the gayest thing ive seen all year are you sure this wasnt just eurovision im ready to get my rage on well holy shit im excited also good song choice wtf did i just watch this is sick competition for borderlands 3 im curious to see how it turns out but the first one seemed rushed played the first rage wasnt very impressed seeings it was only worth 1 play through and a short one at that even with the the anarchy edition not to mention the ending was a huge slap in the face and shortly after that my 360 broke my campaign disc leaving me with that asstastic multiplayer that was all but dead when i played itnot sure who to look at for what should have been an amazing new ip but id and bethesdont sure wont be taking my money unless major improvements are made to this one im talking mad max level improvements i want a reason to want to come back the the game after every mission i want a decent crafting system that gives me upgrades and makes me feel like a bad ass not like im always overpowered even on nightmare difficulty never did play ultra nightmare because my disc broke on me and i didnt get the scorcher dlcso only time will tell if rage 2 will be a major improvement or a meh improvement over its first entry this looks good dumbest trailer ever like omg hopefully gameplay reveal is better than this crap rage 1 bland with no style rage 2 cringeworthy but stylish this trailer is revolting looks so cheap and shitty and so cringeworthy like a smosh video at least it has style id rather have a gameplay trailer over this gay shit already goes above cyberpunk 2077 on my e3 must sees only the big ones a tes or fallout announcement will be bigger woo someone heard that people like ranges of colours other than shades of brown why rage was an utter wank stain the first one was decent but nothing special ill probably check this one out if i can rent it or when the price goes down total madness gachimuchi from the postapocalypse whats that symbol when glitchingcut to a nother scene like in 007 i have faith in id software if its them making this because of how they redeemed themselves with the recent doom hyped for rage2 however this video was trash its like it was directed by anarki from quake champions the worst fucking thing in the universe tim willits done lost his mind i will say that the glimpse at the robot things as well as the mutants was actually good a few nuggets of gold in a field of manure space exploration rpg codename starfield meh looks pretty gay tbh yes delighted thanks bethesda rage feminized no thanks well doom 2 reboot will not be announced soon sniffsince its the same studio i like how when this was leaked earlier it was universally hated and championed as cringe now its getting positive reception despite looking like suicide squads afterbirth at least show some gameplay instead of whatever this is no one wanted this cancer what a shitty trailer hope the game is better than this cheesy crap live action trailers for games are pointless cant wait to give this a miss bethesdas marketing guy has got to be doing acid right now live action trailers for video games should die in a fire excitement level 9000 hell yes thank you i thought this franchise was over loved the first game this is awesome i dont mind it the trailer looks fun but the hope for starfield lingers oh brilliant maybe youll finish making rage 1 now this one might manage to sell even less then the last wolfenstein game now all we need is brink 2 ps if you hate on my btw i fucking hated brink hey besthdesda umm fuck you if this is really developed just by avalanche studios mad maxjust cause and not by id itself im pretty disappointed and shocked about this choice also those colors doesnt fit the feel of first game im sceptical at the moment im trying my best not to get too hyped i just really hope id software make it better than rage 1 theyre going for the anarchy watch dogs 2 look a for anarchy boys and girls yaaaaaay yeaaah im just gonnapass up on this no thanks looks good but if they put anything related to loot boxes im out this teaser is dog shit hopefully the gameplay tomorrow makes up for it so happy for sequel going to go out and buy rage 1 do another play through 2009 called and they want their shitty concept back no one asked for this where is tes6 also good luck having this game survive when we know borderlands 3 is coming out ok rage was good game but nothing super great so i was not super hyped for 2 but then you must just bang into room with andrew wk and ready to die eh bethesda thanks for instant orgasm and now i am ready to buy this thing i hate you what song is it the new mad max looks great im just constantly thinking about a salty thats why we cant have good things xd didnt expected or asked this happen hmm im not sure why but i feel so excited now sigh this is a terrible trailer game that nobody wanted but we are getting in any way woohoo i guess hey bethesda is bill cosby canon in the rage universe that is the real question u already know what game im getting i knew our speculations were right now hopefully starfield its looks so cringe pokes bethesda with a stick is it safe is it going to bite me in the ass oh im not falling for that again rage was okey it lacked to much content to be a full game and it honestly just felt like a bad version of fallout ready to burn my keyboard hey bethesda have you hear aboutallout new vegas is a postapocalyptic action roleplaying video game the fourth major installment in the fallout video game series the game was developed by obsidian entertainment and published by bethesda softworks it was announced in april 2009 and released for microsoft windows playstation 3 and xbox 360 on october 19 2010 the game is set in a postapocalyptic open world environment that encompasses a region consisting of parts of nevada california and arizona it is set in a world that deviated onto an alternate timeline thanks to atomic age technology which eventually led to its devastation by a nuclear apocalypse in the year 2077 in an event referred to as the great war this war was caused by a major international conflict between the united states and china over natural resources the main story of new vegas takes place in the year 2281 four years after the events of fallout 3 it is not a direct sequel but it does mark the re real ending this time because the ending of the first game was just a big joke no hype at all remember when bethesda said that they werent a studio that was just going to make fallout and elder scrolls apparently those who disliked this did i dont know how i felt about that yup this is going in my next cringe compilation the comment section in a nutshell well i didnt want it so therefor no one wants it because i am the voice of reason now id software please make elderscrolls 6 bethesda you have my attention to me the original was actually fun man i havent played rage in years time to make a video on it talk about rage 2 lol andrew w k sold it for me fuckin tight meteor man dies in infinity war upvoted for andrew wk the game better measure up or im coming back to downvote sexual contact consistent condom use reduces the risk of hiv transmission by approximately 80 over the long term111 when condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected the rate of hiv infection is less than 1 per year112 there is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection113 application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir a reverse transcriptase inhibitor immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40 among african women114 by contrast use of the spermicide nonoxynol9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation115 circumcision in subsaharan africa reduces the acquisition of hiv by heterosexual men by between 38 and 66 over 24 months116 due to these studies both the world health organization and unaids recommended male circumcision in 2007 as a method of preventing

in an inability to move1 this can occur over a few hours to a few days13 the weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head neck and diaphragm1 many but not all people fully recover1 in those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die1 another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs13 these people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks1 in up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms1 years after recovery postpolio syndrome may occur with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection2 poliovirus is u rage is my favourite postapocalytic game i wait rage 2 and i buy it very quickly the first rage was a good game that went under the radar for the most part i think too many people thought it was like borderlands when in all reality it was like mad max awesome trailer looks like they are having a go at borderlands is this borderlands 3 ah shit this makes me want to play the first game again we need first person driving this time thanks a lot bethesda i love the first game i wouldve been amazed by this trailer if walmart didnt fucking leak it im afraid theyll ruin it by making it open world like every other game super fucking corny please be open world i dont remember rage 1 being this quirky why are they changing the style of the game all the sudden i also remember the ending being really bad but the game was good this is made by id doom and avalanche just cause this game could be truly nuts looks cringy lets hope this wont be as terrible as fallout 4 interesting it doesnt have to be about people asking for it its likely about the developers feeling they didnt really deliver the first time around and that they could do better with a sequel and updated tech fucking consumers this is definitely the bethesda game everyone wanted rage 2 shit i thought that was a commercial for the sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras but will it be an actual game this time because the last one had about a whopping total of 4 hours of gameplay across 2 discs a story that was so truncated and rushed it felt like the whole thing was part of a tutorial and an ending that felt more like a finale to a like fifth of a normal game than a true ending by the time the credits started rolling the original rage felt like it was just starting despite the fact the gameplay was awesome and the world was great and cool the original rage was essentially just an extended tech demo really hoping this one will provide more than that this could be rendered inengine but waste money on live action is game development 2018 btw song name wait this isnt skyrim for the amazon echo fuck yea there were texture streamaing problems in the trailer too hopefully better than the first which underdelivered on its promises on every level its not a new fallout but it should scratch my mutant killing dune buggy driving raider slaughtering mad max post apocalyptic itch so im cool with it and i liked the gore and mutant designs in the first one 038 the authority mutant program apparently succeeded well they technically did as they were the final enemies in rage 1 and they got leaked thank you i really enjoyed the first rage and had hope that another one would be made thanks for not giving up on it because theres a lot of potential there gunplay and visuals were on point in the first game so i hope the open world and story can rise up and match them this time its nice to see everyone hyped for a sequel of a game nobody actually remembers hahah cant wait for the gameplay though im telling you what if this is a falloutmadmax open world style of game man i thought we were over prerendered and live action trailers i have crippling depression fuck yes everyone who is sceptical about this i feel you but hold judgement for the gameplay reveal tomorrow someone described rage as mad max on lsd cant agree more cant wait to see whats been cooking drops the starfield flag dang it it feels like watch dogs story first game wasnt good so the style of the second game changes a lot and seems like it will be interesting game sry for eng xd oh hel yeah fallout and doom fans crying here first rage have potential cant wait this 3 time again for some mutant madness no clue what rage is but it seems to suit my inner crazy definetly gonna check it our finally people looking like me in games loved the first rage back in 2012 it genuinely did have some serious promise and potential hopefully they flesh out the rpg elements more without turning it into a fallout reskin my hype for this game has been a rollercoaster was hyped when it leaked hype killed by teaser and now im back on board looking forward to seeing some gameplay seriously where the fuck is the next elder scrollsthe first rage wasnt even that good i mean sure it has its loyal fans but the general consensus was that the game was meh the elder scrolls that was a shit trailer im assuming bethesda didnt want me to cringe at it im actually looking forward to this if they give us an open world where you can have dooms game play and a wolfensteins style story we may have a game of the year on our hands it also seems to know how to differentiate itself from other post apocalyptic games with what looks like a more upbeat style while my experience with rage is limited i do know a lot of people say it had a hard time identifying itself but by the looks of things the developers figured out what they wanted this time tbh the only thing i remembered from playing the first game was how satisfying the wingstick was and how disappointing the ending was and i watched 6 times no sorry its now 7 times i would much rather have a fallout game or elder scrolls 6 id rather would buy a very laggy version of skyrim on ps2 then play this this is really giving me the vibe that they may have embraced a less edgy and grimdark tone and more of a fun jovial one i feel like if thats the case itll definitely fix one of the things i felt dragged the original down excited to see the gameplay scrabble is more violent than this bgmready to die andrew wk looking forward to seeing loosum hagar is glorious 4k trailer was terrible couldnt even finish it lol i dont know but i loved rage and this trailer is awesome i am so excited for this game i am waiting gameplay now please bethesda i love you i trust you but first games multiplayer is very bad please dont do this again just do single player single player is always better ok but who is making it id software fuck yeah porn i mean rage yes these people that are rushing the developers to do a new es game sure want a gr wildlands or a the division give these guys time to do a good game ffs hopefully this time with a real open world love me some andrew w k i think they used this song for one of the old hit man game trailers as well rage 1 was an awful game lets hope you guys bring a new take to a good idea no thanks we already live in this dystopian kind of world we dont need a game about it im interested in this but this announce trailer was fucking shit first rage was somethin for me it was dark but this one is this for kids first rage was a fun game but the story wasnt there hopefully this one will have a stronger story well somebody is a fan of hellsing abridged bethesda makes the best games tfs alucard hehehehehehehehe i think bethesda is becoming my favourite thirdparty developer of alltime its like bethesda wanted to copy borderlands but tried too hard and just made a much cringier suicide squad game instead this looks cringy af also the first rage was pretty shit the triler is shit but i like a new rage where is id software edgelord the game andrew wk ready to die looks fun to check out im pretty sure the games are going to be released in waves rage 2 being the first wave thanks walmart for ruining the surprise as bethesda said dude but i must say its as if bethesda has something against the elder scrolls series or they just dont know how much of a success skyrim was rage is better than borderlands someone just needet to say that i ser the title and think woah this will be probably announced to switch in the next 4 months ok good i was hoping for another shitty borderlands loot game what the fuck i cant believe we are getting a sequel im so excited for this me and everyone else in the comment section when we found out rage 2 is coming 000 054 k cool sooo starfield reveal next please did you just confirm borderlands 3 with this trailer this is one of the worst trailers ive seen what the fuck is this shit so evil why would you gives use a teaser for a trailer the next day now i cant wait for tomorrow the sequel nobody asked for dats awesome hype my dicks now a punk first one was average in every way and the lore wasnt interesting either so i dont know why anyone would look forward to this dont ruin my favourite game series the first rage was made by idsoft and all the terrain textures was hand painted not some stock images shitty and cringey trailer cant wait to see gameplay is it me or this doesnt feel like rage at all random elder scrolls 6 comment all these people who do nothing but beg for fallout 5 and skyr1m 2 are the reason we cant have nice things from bethesda also do your research before you look like a fool asking the wrong developers for a game to be rushed did anyone actually want this so basicallyfallout spinoff raiders the game this is what elder scrolls died for i find it funny that last month i found rage in a box pulled it out and thought i wonder if they ever will make a rage 2 i guess this answers my question thank you oh what a day what a lovely day god i love bethesda one of the few companies still making games instead of money squeezing products wow this sure was painful to watch that looks awful have doom inspired gameplay btw it has been about 6 years since the last one so i thought it was trashed i liked the first rage ill try this out music now this shouldve been nukaworld i want a fallout 5 nothing of this game if we can get rage2 then we can also get a sequel to commander keen its here literally no one wants a rage sequel cringe fest i for one loved the first part and i am hyped for the second but please do better this time im actually exited to see what they changed as lots of people werent expecting this and the first had lots of development issues i prefer fallout yes please but no loot boxs honestly i still dont get why their making rage 2 the sales where ok i guess selling over 2 million copies back in 2010 so did this game take 8 years to make i wonder what they are going to do everyone in the commentsyou spin me right around baby right around like an wreckin ball baby the retarded visual style aka suicide squad is terrible please tell me it wont be in the game iv been waiting on this for a while nowfinally getting a new rage this is being published by bethesda softworks not being made by bethesda game studios jesus christ people dont know the basic difference given bethesdas track record im just gonna skip this tbh fallout 4 without mods was awful skyrim was fun but buggy as hell havent played doom yet out of all things to make another entry for series wise why rage that noise is the sound of john carmack screaming been waiting for this since 2012 i need tes6 not this shit props for andrew wk but play the same song over your actual gameplay trailer and you might just sell me this time its no secret im a fucking nerd for the id software universe and for the most part they never disappoint however what the fuck is this shit yeah its just a teaser but this is damn cringe worthy dont know if id or bethesda is to blame but yeah new rage looks weak i own the full comic series the novel and the original game anarchy edition im gonna call it now ten bucks says its all new bs not continuing from the last ones ending and lieutenant nicholas raine wont even be in the game they need to just hire my ass on to the team what the hell is this i loved the first one even though it felt unfinished i cant wait for this hopefully its not infused with microtransactions that song i got cupcakes hd flashbacks rage was a fun game that had a ton of atmosphere one of my favorite single player fps games of last gen this trailer is obnoxious as hell i hope this is not indicative of how the game will play compare this with the atmospheric original rage trailer httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcdlphzclnq woooooo the first one was soooo underated cringe please let this be a cyber punk freak version of borderlands 2 why therere ponies on my mind i am excite the first was a really good shooter but the actual game was a letdown in a lot of ways the coopsolo challenges which were essentially shooting galleries were amazing though looking forward to seeing the progress and developments made given the other games that have been released under the bethesda umbrella which all contribute to improving aspects of the other games made under them should be gooooooooood what a fine morning to be scrolling through the comment section i like the marketing i think its super slick how they just say gameplay reveal tomorow really goes with the theme of the game i want more announcements from you bethesda ummmm k maybe its just me but i think bethesda is about to butcher what would have been a great game too early to tell but this teaser is cringe worthy honestly since the leak ive been pissed as fuck because i thought starfield was actually rage 2 untili noticed it said bethesda softworks and not game studio almost had me worried there todd i liked the first one but this trailer looks cheaply made this is the game i didnt know i needed this doesnt have me excited at all hopefully game play is better good to hear andrew wk is still with bethesda well this looks awsome they shouldnt be making rage 2 ive been waiting long enough give us despacito 2 already anybody else think the thumbnail looks like ivar the boneless i truly hope this one has a better ending would be interested in seeing kentucky in fallout or elder scrolls getting very complicating aweeeeeeeeee im so excited for some more bethesda post apocalypse pff rage sucks never heard of the first game xd yes i knew it was coming before any leak or teaser sooner or later rage was going to come and this is a collaboration with avalanche studiosmassive open world confirmed with epic explosions that song was annoying as hell but at least tomorrow we get to see what it actually looks like especially since it runs on idtech 6 which means ill easily be able to run it at max settings 60 fps if i do end up buying it making a sequel to a game 7 years after the originals release isnt the best idea imo not to mention rage was just a lame version of boarderlands lol holy crapthis means the other leaks are true next month rage 2 battle royale this awesome but i was hoping for a bethesda game studios announcement but this is awesome fallout5 nope aggretsuko will love this game remember when game reveals were suprises at e3 like fallout doom gow lou2 horizon0d anyway yes i am raging haha i show myself out and switch the pc off omg thank you bethesda i loved the first game i am hyped to see what direction you guys are going this time the song is called ready to die by andrew wk this trailer sucks looks like a fanmade thing this one must be a lot better then the fist one this is just a appetisers this isnt whats going to knock yall out of youre seats so get ready a bit on the cringy side i get the feeling that rage 2 might not take itself too seriously from this trailer give us brink 2 rage is mad max meets fallout calling it now rage 2 is gonna pull a thor ragnarok and knock it out of the park now that theyve ditched the serious tone of the previous entry if the trailer is any indication of the games tone that is i just dont get why make a sequel to an avg game which just people didnt really like looks typical bethesda not necessarily bad but not original hopefully it plays different than doom like how wolfenstein and doom feel different even though they look the same in trailers i dont know what i just saw but okay sure wrong game we wanted elder scrolls 6 hmm look at that gunbash melee combat i hope its one button skyrim melee was too hard for my feeble brain thank god fallout 4 was nice enough to grant us the press this button to melee dont worry about power attacks or directional swings we took that hard stuff out for you we could have had starfield you better not fuck it up this time video game trailers need more andrew wk you have my attention yes rage i cant wait i liked rage i hope it gets a switch release seeing as i now drive trucks for a living and switch has really come in a pinch no gameplay dont care an announcement of an announcement come back tomorrow everyone we got trolled you have my attention rage 2 fury road hell yeah so they are likely working on the next elder scrolls even if its years away im certain they are looking at a doom sequel and theres probably plans for a new wolfestein at some point so getting a rage inbetween sounds fair to me that game had one of the best most immersive intros with the comet piano music and just a good bye i also liked rage 1 a flawed game that lacked an ending of value but hopefully this game can be something great please announce 2 more things today mad max meets fallout now if borderlands 3 would just show up i would be the hapliest man on earth alright hopefully they can give it more of a personality than the original game and an actual story with actual progression nice trailer beth but i remember the first rage game nobody asked for this but still happy that is coming forget elder scrolls and fallout we got this fucking gem back interesting i just hope its a single player game for the most part and not br itll be funny if bgs was making this instead of id holy shit is that a mf cupcakes reference yes bethesda yes thank you our prayers have been answered hahaha there was no need for actors in this trailer lol made it look dumb as fck but i know the game is gonna be awesome so its cool i hated the first rage game but im hopeful to see what this is like because apparently this is one of the two big projects before tes 6 that is going to showcase what tes 6 will be like its actually real i want fallout 5 why not just wait for e3 you guys got a panel for a reason rage was my shiiiit boii i got so invested in the universe and atmosphere and now my body is ready for round 2 babbyyyy was i the only one who thought of hellsing ultimate abridged oh shit something that isnt a skyrim remastered for another console is always suprising holy fuck im excited now when this gets released can we please get a rage one remaster so we can play that one again well we saw what happened when the saints row series tried to become colorfuller when leaks are real all i want is for headshots to actually be headshots cant tell you how many times i shot enemies in the head and they just shrug it off beam narrative branch priority brick regime mass comfortable port guideline wtf bethesda you keep from developing the next elder scrolls and inatead you make this im dissapointed man this is awful holy hell no way ive waited can you recognize what inspired this radical shift in tonal shift thats right fury road wing sticks at the ready better be better than the first rage am i the only one who thinks that this teaser looks awesome so we can expect rage 2 to end abruptly and feel as unfinished as the 1st rage was amazing badass and fun the story was alright not anything mind blowing but it was still really fun idk why people hating on it lol cant wait for rage 2 literally no one asked for this it just works 038 ghaul from destiny 2 confirmed this is why you cant have good things pete hines 2018 2018 bethesda softworks llc a zenimax media company developed in association with avalanche studios trading as fatalist entertainment ab im worried now fckn finally hey who sings it garou d this trailer is cringe central but i guess nobody else thinks so judging by all the hype on here which is weird to me since im pretty sure nobody actually cared about the original at all who is the dev though i wanna play doom5 or a new dishonerd glad this game is finally baaaack i really enjoyed the first rage but this trailer isnt reminding me of the parts of it that i liked i get the impression theyre trying to get a little too silly with the sequel ill wait to see gameplay and hope that looks a little better why bethesda we all wanted rocket league 2 anyone remember smile hd im angry i want skyrim vacuum cleaner special edition time to break out my wing stick in tf2 no fuckin way oh yeah oh what a day what a lovely day what a load of crap borderlands ripoffwhere is tes6 i absolutely love this i am very happy with the mood theyre aiming for and hopefully rage2 is not going to try being another serious shit cookie cutter game and theyll have fun with it instead cant wait for the gameplay reveal d fortnite 2 looks sick thanks walmart really wanted starfield instead anyone up for some carnage i hope its actual open world worst announcement trailer ever still waiting for e3 2018 i have never cringed this much from a game trailer before finally a game i can wait for fuck yeah thanks i loved the first game it was too short by the time you got everything the game was over with no after play it would be nice to see this games little more open and immersive like fallout or tes dont end it so quickly when youre excited for a release for an interesting rpg ie starfield but all you get is a generic linear shooter this isnt the post apocalyptic shooter we wanted come on why no fallout new vegas remaster the 1st rage was trash mad max on acid is that even possible rage 1 had some seriously cool moments and fun gameplay but it was way too short for the price and the ending was atrocious hopefully rage 2 will be a better overall product though i still think a healthy dose of scepticism is advised fuck yes that was really lame that song though i love bethesda i never asked for this guess walmart kinda forced your hands then guys that was ok gameplay pls i dont know anything about rage but is it just mad max i really hope they now they gonna use very cheese fmv cutscenes mad max punk version i really dont like the punkish art style but everyone seems to disagree i do this will be the real fallout 4 yes thanks bethesda i love rage cant wait to play the sequel i hope its longer than the first one the game that no one asked for edit the game most people didnt ask for edit 2 doom 4 was greatmost people didnt ask for that yes finallygameplay will be reveal tomorrow eh ill wait for the gameplay footage the last game was pretty forgettable well cats out of the bag lets run with it looks like they decided to capitalize on the popularity of this genre reignited by mad mad fury road even the trailer seems suspiciously colorful anyone think about hellsing abridged when they saw this looks gay as fuck no thanks the new mad max looks cool one of my favorite games the game nobody asked for someone should create a copy pasta that can be sent to commenters with 3000 iqs who dont know the difference between bethesda softworks and bethesda game studios why didnt you just drop the gameplay today would have been better than something that tells us very little so fallout 4 on drugs cool damn my chemical romance made a new music video no gameplay why even release a trailer lol people want this over a new elder scrolls wtf im glad this ip got a second chance i thought the first had a lot of potential how much rage for rage i liked it this is the worst trailer ive ever seen thanks for the surge commercial ok cool so wheres es6 im pumped for the sequel since i loved the first game but this trailer was just awful what oh what were they thinking top 10 anime intros so walmart did fucked it up cant wait to play borderlai mean rage 2 this game is going to fucking rule pleaseturning a post apocalyotic theme into a bright punkish fest no thanksshow more brutalitymore gore and darknessmore mutations not a punkish chick or fat dude that says absolutely nothing interesting whats up with all the pink and yellow why this looks like something ubisoft would do for a trailer lol but still dont get why this game needed a sequel unless you actually make it open world with a better story and no lackluster ending then i might be interested nice cant believe we are getting rage 2 hope its out this year really diggin the mad max vibe here wow this trailer is garbage im pretty excited to see the gameplay trailer this looks like a super punky mad max i really loved the first game and hoped for a sequel but this goofy ass cringe trailer just killed the whole thing for me its like the instagram feed from a load of chartered accountants at burning man literally nothing amazing why is this coming back literally no one asked for this no thanks oh god this song just reminds me of cupcakes by misterdavey oo awesome trailer with good music tho andrew wk is always welcome where is tes 6 reeeeeeeeee rage 2 rage of the sjw they chose the suicide squad route eh no one wanted this its about time oh no now what will they show us on their showcase besides more paid mods and probably something about skyrim again andrew wk makes everything 100 times better oh boy a sequel nobody wanted to a game nobody played where the fuck is elder scrolls 6 oh fuck rage color run this reminds me of ads for xbox360ps3 games dislikes by entitled fallouttes manchildren i dunno anything about this game but theres a 9999 chance im gonna buy it unless theres microtransactions andor loot boxes i see disciples and raiders teamed up and took over the world loved the gameplay of rage 1 im definitely looking forward to this game trailers somehow always boil games down to there worst aspects to make the whole thing look like crap the game no one asked for i thought this was brink 2 for a second wheres the video games white people with guns this is fine i can already tell that this comment section will be filled with people that can already tell that the comment section will be filled with where is fallout 5 or elder scrolls 6 i really liked the first one just barely missed the mark this could be good looks mad maxish and given the recent doom and wolfenstein success and rages vehicular combat aswell this has potential to be awesome what kind of mad max is this i dont know what to make of this wait this isnt skyrim someone remind me what rage 1 was about its been so long a trailer for another trailer can we stop this stuff please on a side note looks cool hopefully itll be a good successor maybe rage 2 wont end without an ending like the original eww no the first one was so awful mad max on steroidslsd fallout5 to everyone who says nobody wanted this i want doom whaa whaa skyrim 6 whaa whaa rage is shit no one wants it let bethesda and id software make the games they want and uf they want to please the og fans than let them lets rage it up yall im super excited to try this i never played the first rage imconfused i really hope we still get starfield im ready to be bored i hope this flops stupid all cool and hype seller i will keep my hype for tomorrow please this time make a solid game with a better ending especially that i dont buy much games but rage was decent to me mad max was ok but i never finished it i think if got the talent to make this one shine i love the kind of games that dont give a fuck and this looks like it will be one of those games this looks like im gonna have a great fucking time im always concerned when a trailer for a game uses real life actors for promotion fingers crossed the gameplay reveal doesnt suck i saw leaks but its actually happening what well wtf hope gameplay will be better than this when your whole dev team is on drugs already watched it 20 times want more much more love it i have no idea what type of game this is supposed to be i didnt play the first game this seems to be almost completely different than the first game i liked the first game but the energy in this in this trailer is next level if they roll with that theyve got a hit on their hands awesome hope the team didnt contain sjws its proly going to be a coop oriented fpsrpg game a la borderlands gimmie what you got what in the mad max is this the first rage was good but it was clearly rushed out the door by id you could see the missing content i hope avalanche studios or idwhoever is doing it pulls off a machine games here like wolfenstein it all depends on if they had the time to polish it came for rage 2 stayed for the andrew wk music skyrim apocalypse edition looks great wow that is just terrible one of the worst trailers ive ever seen in my fucking life im sorry but this trailer is just horrible looking forward to see gameplay though oh god not this again xd rage against the mutts this thing is dead before it even started homo sjws the game first i thought it was fallout 5 unless the game reveal is way better just not interested didnt play the first one and to be honest the trailer looks like a bunch of games ive avoided mixed with fallout looks like pvp maybe as well i just hope they deliver a good game and dont go to far into the this is the posttrump america predictable theme joke no thanks lets hope its better than the first rage i thought fallout 4 was released already oh well i expect the same amount of roleplaying none i never played rage but i hope this is really good looks cringy yeah uh so not made by id software i take it i most certainly did not expect rage to come back im not complaining nice to hear andrew wk i was hoping for a sequel im really happy that there will be one but imo this trailer is really bad hahaha dont know what kind of audience youre targeting this already smell to battle royale xd did anyone actually want this the first rage was alright i guess just leak the damn gameplay video it will suck like the first one didi what the fak is this gay hit rage was an awsome game what did you do bathesda ok guyz we need to do splatoon 3 now but mr todd we are not nintendo i dont care do it with skyrim but sir its impossible skyrim franchise is busy with a battle royale edition so use an old franchise and change all it work for pray eh cool trailer but who exactly is asking for this gameplay or beat it do i feel a full coop story game with customized everything the new mad max movie looks great can you believe i used to be a professional hockey player ok yes please damn it i thpugh it was going to be brink 2 what have you got planned for e3 if youre releasing everything beforehand give us elder scrolls 6 and a fallout new vegas remake right fucking now fuck rage wolfenstein and eso i want bethesda games studios or obsidian content not shit from your other devs are we finally gonna get the mad max esche game we deserve this one hopes so todd howard playable character or bust i see you bethesda bout damn time too i barely remember rage 2 mate what all ive been listening to this week is andrew wk and ive been wondering about all these leaks this is fate a perfect way to sum up the where is tes6 people great now gimme doom 2 best use of an andrew wk song for a game teaser ever something witty from a bethesda youtuber hurr durr wheres my brink 2 ive seen dog shit on my shoes with more appeal than this instead of making rage 2 u should make a new elder scrolls or fallout dumb bethesda fans who dont know the difference between a publisher and a developer so this game is about the postapocalyptic bloody orgy that will start right after feminists and other leftists will smash white people and patriarchy because all personages in this trailer look like a bunch of ugly social justice warriors edge is my true colour few weeks later borderlands 3 got annouced shit trailer but im exited for the gameplay tomorrow releasing the same day as borderlands 3 this is an ouch i liked the song and the trailer was ok but i will just wait for starfield now watch as this game gets released and gets a ton of negative reviews and is then forgotten in a week another rage is the last thing i want from bethesda i really dont understand the hype did you people even play all 3 hours of the first shitty game who asked for this oh great a shitty sequel to a shitty game no one gives a fuck about when i first played rage on the 360 i had a ton of fun i was so disappointed that there wasnt even a whisper of a sequel then i found out wal mart leaked it and what happened in my brain was like this trailer what a letdown what is this the pleb version of mad max i dont get the anarchy aspect but alright so discount fallout is back yipee also if they are revealing this already what are they going to be announcing during e3 mark my fking words the gameplay reveal is going to be insane and jawdroping not surprised but very excited for the game really stupid trailer but ive been waiting for rage 2 for 6 years now so heres hoping that the gameplay looks good after 6 years everyone starfield bethesda rage 2 im surprised they decided to revisit rage i wonder how development of the first game went down is this made same team as the first if so did dooms and wolfenstein success play a role here i also wonder why not just make a new ip rather than developed a sequel to rage this trailer is actually pretty tight i didnt play rage one so hopefully this game is good walmart told us last week old news game of the year ma boyssss rage is back you know what i am intrigued show me what you got tomorrow bethesda softworks it feels good to see a trailer that is advertising the pure fun aspect of the game i never played the first rage but ill definitely be keeping my eyes on this one if its as ballstothewall crazy as this trailer have never played rage but it looks interesting by this trailer lol you know the drill people act surprised act surprised neat im fucking happy because a rage sequel is coming i just hope that this trailer wont really have a negative impact on the reception of the game and on the sales because while i get the intention behind this video and what kind of feelings it wants to achieve the last 1520 seconds of it are way too cringey especially with those badly acted freakouts like the guy who sticks out his tounge my dick a lil hard right now rage 2 definitely didnt see that coming wonder if its up for pre order yet i loved rage 1 this is awesome d it seems that the second one going to be more colorful than the first one what is this game mad max fallout crossover by the looks of things the whole instagram thing was cool the catholics are crusading while the nazis are invading would you look at that rage 2 might actually be worth playing i fucking knee it love the vibes this trailer gives off when that song started playing all i could think of was hellsing fallout 5 rage 2 so glad theyre making a sequel such a brilliant game even if it did have a weak story should have go for tes6 would have prevent you from promoting gun violence and gun uses sometimes i doubt youre even an ally bethesda i have no hype for this one and less and less of support for you either coz the first one was so successful right i should like this but i just cant stand it single player game is not dead no mention of id software the game nobody asked for should have released this at 514 pm 012 unsubscribed besides this is only the second mashup of excessive of pink and andrew wk p nice rage is one of my favourites ever the robots near 006 look like droids from star wars overall i loved rage and was wondering when a sequel would drop for next gen now current gen wingsticks were always fun to use and dead city was a bit horrifying looking forward to this hopefully the gameplay trailer will be whack wow so the legend is true take ma money already 3 better than call of duty infinity warfare trailer i have high hopes pretends to be suprised andrew wk good taste i was hoping for gameplay but i am satisfied by that awesome punk song bethesda are you sure you are familiar with the meaning of the word trailer this new borderlands looks lit i hope its open world game gameplay video tomorrow unless walmart decides to spoil that too it back boys rage is back i have waited so long for this you can tell from this its gonna be destiny in mad max world why i think that well look at these random dudes jumping and working together and shooting stuff it screams pve and coop on a larger scale compared to the first one finally awesome thanks bethesda softworks this is basically mad max meets far cry blood dragon the tiny clips of gameplay in there looked pretty cool do i hear battle royale first one was forgettable not sure why this is hyped just get that tes out in a new engine please i didnt think this game would ever get a sequel really enjoyed the first one but i hope this one improves upon its prequel damn i didnt know they were releasing part 2 for nuka world waiting on all the rage 2 trailer confirms starfield videos id software rage is my favourite game of all time whoa this is crazy alot of people are pissed i guess you can say im feeling a bit ofrage pretty cringe worthy bethesda i love you guys and i like rage but this is a bad trailer announcement or not looking forward to the gameplay reveal though big rage fan but god that was cringe worthy the liberal feminism was strong so is bethesda game studios the developers or is it another company owned by bethesda pink and yellowlil pump and friends yess finally i just want to say a huge fuck you to walmart for spoiling the surprise at e3 i would have freaked out so hard cringey the song is called ready to die by andrew wk okay now they have my attention fuk yeah i loved rage so underrated mr matty plays was right i cant wait hoping to hear some vr news soon wow the new mad max trailer looks awesome announcement and gameplay trailers just before e3 bethesda you absolute madmen omg thats why pink is all over the place you made game for gay population and music omg gay as much as it can be only reason i know this song is because of helsing ultimate abridged i honestly hope loosum hagar makes a returncameo thank you i want to be a black man just like young yeah predicted with the guy prediction of bethesda telling it t hope with a better ending and true open world i bet feminist and sjw are gonna ruin this super cringy doesnt have a coherent theme not a fan of this trailer at all its sorta suicide squad but more childish and cringy another one no one interesting rage in a world where everyone is waiting for fallout tes this is a lot more colourful than what i was expecting from rage but then again i find the fact that the game got a sequel to begin with quite surprising hopefully theres an actual story this time not like the first which should have been called side mission the game i hope that itll be better than the first game well that was obnoxious and terrible man the new fallout looks great dear bethesda no one wanted this never played rage but wanted to way back when was it good i didnt know theres a new mad max game hype boys um im not sure how to feel about this what the fuck this tonal shift is fucking dogshit what are you doing did you watch the newest mad max and just think haha wacky colours and a song from 2006 thatll get the crowd going punk as fuck play on 2x speed for extra rage whoa this is andrew wk from the cartoonnetwork show the first rage wasnt awesome but it was good as long as the havent stuffed it to the tits with lootboxes then ill check it out whats my motivation tho just make sure to communicate that it isnt trying to be bodrelands or mad max after so long its finally here hell yeah the first one was ok at best no idea why this is so hyped rev up those fryers caude i am sure ready for some carnage you guys see walmart canada bethesda release the trailer who cares if it isnt finished do it finally and please make better ending in watch dogs 2 there was a trailer that had a spaceship maybe it was rage not starfeild maybe we can go to space looks like mad max and harley quinn have a baby so the walmart leak was true borderlands 3 and splinter cell are coming wohoooo a sequel to a game no one liked and everyone forgot cant wait rage was hugely underrated that is awful cant wait they got a lot of hair dye so no starfield then is it just meor someone else too got the battle royale vibe outta this teaser first game was a true gem for madmax lovers i have high hopes for this this is the most cringiest shit ive ever seen in my life i didnt ask for this thats one less game to be revealed at e3 but wheres vallenwood love it love it love it so far the best trailer this year no doubt i saw on the site name avalanche studios soooooooooooooo wtf never even heard of rage one lol unlike all the spoiled children who bitch about everything under the sun i would like to thank you bethesda for publishing this game i was a big fan of the the first game and i believe if done the right way this sequal could be really good i see theyre going full comedy this time if the ending is garbage i will shit in my own mouth out ofrage wtf is this trailer d please dont turn rage in to this thanks butwhy wow theyre doing the gameplay reveal tomorrow i expected them to save it for e3 pretty terrible trailer imo but still excited for the game haha andrew wk soundtrack d love it bethesda walmart working on this game with todd whos laughing now i hate the game after watching this stupid video im down just hope its good i cant belive my eyes is it going to run on id tech 6 fimmion is supposed to be the herald of the end times he was going to explain why algot the northerner was so white now it looks like he wrecked up the place and we didnt even get a f2p online card game to explain it and what about cicero and the daedric lego wheres that game bethesda i want to know how cicero managed to go back in time and wipe out the dwemer with cleverly placed blocks of daedric lego i am filled with intense anger perhaps evenfury yeah i am furious reminds me of the switch from watch dogs 1 to 2 the first was gritty and took itself fairly seriously and the second was a self aware little bit more lighthearted game with a lot of colors lol mad max style love it this looks very bad still waiting for cyberpunk 2070 looks interesting to say the least im kind of about this no lie punk mad max vibes all over the place loved it just loved it the leaks may have spoilt a big e3 announcement but no harms done everyone is taking about rage 2 atm be happy bethesda just i feel like if this is an intro of a disney show seems to be cool anyway man this fallout brink looks good hell yeah ive been waiting years for this game the doom teaser fight like hell was good this sucks ass what a lame reveal and they even spent money for this garbage hip a rage got a sequel one of the biggest disappointment of the last gen got a sequel i never asked for this i think nobody asked for this tmobile is really outdoing themselves this year nice indiahipsterpostapokalypse cant wait need a vegan coffee now d is this skyrim mad max version sjws infesting everything looked gay as fuck can anyone confirm the platforms that rage 2 will be on if its on id tech 6 then i hope it will be on switch finally characters looks like bunch of womens right clowns we see on street protesting i hope the game play trailer is good because based off this i have no desire to play this game definitely getting a mad max vibe from this but wheres my generic fantasy open world rpg or my brown and grey post apocalyptic rpg i dont want something fun and colourful fuck yes hopefully this upbeat shit is dropped for the game i want some dark postapocalyptic themes psa bethesda softworks publishes titles developed by multiple studios including id software tango gameworks arkane studios machine games etc betheda game studios is simply one of those development studios therefore bsw bgs the moral of the story here is a rage 2 announcement does not preclude a subsequent announcement by bethesda game studios at a later date like e3 starfield or whatever bgs is developing will likely be the major showcase surprise at their e3 conference entirely separate from this rage 2 announcement which is likely developed by id software furthermore its highly unlikely probably impossible that bgs will be announcing either elder scrolls 6 or an inhouse numbered fallout sequel all signs point to a brandnew ip likely starfield this studio has essentially spent the last 20 years developing nothing but es fallout titles theyre allowed to branch out and find some artistic fulfillment through other avenues quit the whining wow that was cringy it seems to have taken some inspiration from mad max fury road or is that just me i like this how do you do fellow kids we in the 90s boiz avalanche studios id software are developers welcome to madness i am so confused on so many levels when time travel is a one way trip its about damn time looks interesting cant wait for more videos cant wait for the 1 hour analysis from mrmatty id software yay lets make a sequel to a shitty game and release in the same year of borderlands 3 that is a very similiar game that probably is going to be much better who asked for this i hope im dreaming because that was awful whats the song nice also fuck walmart what the actual fuck this look sounds like mad max fucked a care bear awful because of the leaks just yesterday i ordered a copy of rage for the xbox 360 and im going to enjoy the game on xbox one s till the sequel comes thank you bethesda you make great games and publish great games too my 4yr old daughter could have made a better commercial wow that was terrible i really want tes 6 i dont know why but i just do nice all aboard the hype train the music thank you wow i didnt know bethesda was making anime now yes bethesda i also like the pack this is gonna be so fucking good wtf weird ass trailer hoping the gameplay will not be weird does this remind anyone of that rick and morty episode where they visit a post apocalypse town and summer marries that raider guy what about starfield waiting for this like thousands of years finally nobody asked for this wheres tes6 doom2 a remake of morrowind would be far better but the first game tanked super hard mad max rip off never played the first but still hyped for rage 2 oh i didnt see this coming at all nooneaskedforthis amazing trailer just came out and theyre already at 580 comments i think people are a little excited about this finally i never really got into rage 1 but this already looks very promising im certainly ready to die after seeing this atrocity im in the history hell yeah i thought for sure all the tweets were referring to the crossing im not disappointed to see rage 2 is real though keep the good gunplay and make the story missions not suck and you might get gold here rage had a ton of potential that was not utilized skyrim on toaster e3 2018 rage one of my favourite games im hyped this looks awful borderlands fury road why is this trailer so pink yeah but does it blend directed by george miller this looks cool lol im not sure about it though shut up and take my money ok we have seen a lot of disgusting shit now let us wait for some gameplay this could be enjoyable this is going to be a battleroyal game isnt it mad max 2 looks pretty cool hopefully the pc versions works better than the original on launch did someone inject mad max with an extra dose of crazy dont let us down never played the first rage but i guess ill give it a try to get ready for rage 2 who is developing this hellsing abridge ultimate anyone lol looks interesting doom 2 please bethesda any chance i can have a copy of this game early its just that i dont want to wait wow fallout 3 remastered looks great and now comes with pink how to say this this was not good or needed or wanted but i guess when people like it ah yes the game everyone wanted mad max bethesda edition if this is done well it will be better than the doom reboot and im fuckin ready im excited is the new movie called rage based of this franchise a sequel to a fps game with rich story we want the borderlands audience but today is the 14th if maynot the 15thso whats coming tomorrow who the hell wanted this edit wow so many salty assholes getting annoyed over asking a question get a life mate totally was not expecting this probably should have just saved this for e3 commencing hype engines my game will be better what were you thinking bethesda this trailer is ugly the tone is all over the place and hurts my eyes to watch my erection its harder than finding a nonglitchy game by bethesda i did not know how much i wanted this to happen but now im elated to see it the actual what so damn loud jesus christ not the game for me i guess so rage 2 is looking like itll be a very very different beast from the original next elder scrolls fallout needs to be years from now theyre still working with an engine from morrowind they need to create new one so the next title isnt fucking broken i can already tell that this comment section will be filled with comments like where is tes 6 reeeeeeeeee based im genuinely wondering why there are so many dislikes can someone tell me why is this skyrim alright im down for the silly route bring it so does this mean no doom ii i have a bad feeling about this c han very skeptical solo this new fallout looks weird the future looks diverse this is actually a sick trailer lets hope bethesda isnt going to shit all over this game and break the lore in many ways and fuck up the game so that modders have to fix bethesdas faults scaringawayfromthegame campaign successful this is america watch it be some multiplayer games as a service garbage with humor so out of touch that it makes borderlands seem like having somewhat decent writing in comparsion hmm you know how to rise my hype levels i give you that pllsss be a 3rd person and 1st person im fuck ing bored of those they used an andrew wk song i cant ill just stick with elder scrolls better late than never i cannot wait wow a sequel for the most mediocre fps of all time rage 2 fallout 4 sooooo walmart was correct cringe walmarts announcement was better and cheaper stop it get some help will there be vodka and adidas so i can go squat in a coner somewhere im glad i have notifications on i might be missing something from the first game but some of the enemies look like strogg what holly shit love the andrew wk because the first one was soo good p what is this hellsing 008 matty matheson pure cringefest i what oh they borderlandsd it i want starfield this looks wackier than fallout i gues that walmart leak was right and now i want to pre order the game did anybody really want a rage 2 just asking finally after all these years okay this is a major rebrand the first rage was hella serious im liking this new direction andrew wk ftw wow this was pretty awful why would you think hiring actors to stand around and do a terrible job of looking menacing wearing lowlevel generic post apocalypse cosplay would be a good idea the only thing of value in this video are the 5 or so total seconds of ingame screenshots we got to see why is it so bright only available at walmart please dont be shit please be the game rage 1 shouldve been definitely ready to die after having to endure this trailer you guys are really going gay semen spurts over the face pink crayons and all a surprise to be sure but a welcome one i did only 1 play through of rage and it was alright im still waiting for brink 2 loved the first one for the small amount of time the game was relevant i pray to god that this is not the tone for the whole game cringe overload so bethesda went from expansive rpgs with massive worlds to making cringey post apocalyptic games yes this is the only game bethesda is making they can only make one game at a time like last year they only released one game and only by themselves no other developers really hope it does not disappoint like the first game whats with all the hot pink tho rage thats a game i have seen or played since who rememberd the pinkie song gameplay tomorrow hype nice trailer and all that but what about a new elder scroll game hell yeah i love rage you better not mess this up wait a reveal tomorrow not e3 huh well i think if kids use their head that means this will not be a main reveal at e3 anyway im gonna go buy this its been to long the hype is rage was awesome hell yeahh glad id got nothing to do with this one hello mrmattyplays early gameplay tomorrow d this this trailer was dog shit no rage is an under rated game i never heard of it until i played it at a friends house and i liked it yes the story wasnt the best but the overall game play wasnt bad i hope rage 2 can improve on the story and gsme mechanics to make this a better game than the first was all aboard the hype train chooochoooo lets go boys thank god well see gameplay tomorrow this shows nothing about the game where is the elder scrolls 6 not hyped hope other studio has a gud gaem who else thought of borderlands when they watched this trailer not the game i expected but its the game i need i really wanted it to be fallout still im not mad so what about starfield did bethesda acquire idsoftware this aint no place for no hero what a surprise this is literally a dream come true meh wanted doom 2 yeah yeah yeahbut seriously wheres elder scrolls 6 i guess well see if this works tmrw why tho the first one wasnt even that good without the music this would be super cringe but i liked it this hyper as hell i love it omg the graphics they really take it up a notch looks so real please dont ef up the second half of the game again looking good so far cant wait for tomorrow yay rage 2 cant wait my dreams have come true this will be awesome neat bethesda s marketing division clearly doesnt understand their audience if they think ppl will respond positively to this that being said ill withhold judgement till i see the actual game da fook did i jus watch im open to it but the first game was bad wow the lighting was bad whats with this live action trash also too much suicide squad not enough mad max oh boy i sure do love the color magenta so nuka world with cars gotcha bethesda is there any chance this is gonna be open world like skyrim and fallout i really like those games instead of the linear mission games this is why we cant have nice things this is like if the apocalypse was raped to death in a gay bar during holi thank you walmart no no no no gameplay is what we need i hope it continues where the first left off i hope this isnt their big game for e3 if so just give me a fallout for switch and ill be happy if not bethesdas e3 disappoints again im very hopeful for this rage was a mixed bag for me because the story was formulaic and a silent protagonist just made it feel lifeless but it had potential hopefully this time around they can add a lot more character and personality to it judging by this theyre going full suicide squadmad max so that might spice things up enough literally the worst trailer ive ever seen this looks pretty dope so thats what andrew w k brain looks like thank you thought ill never see a sequel wtf is this when bethesda hypes up stuff and its just rage gosh dangit bethesda open world please and good texture loading please borderlands much has a very strong psycho vibe from the people featured in the video conductor of the poop train meat bicycle xd rage 2 hell yeah lets go im so confused the first rage was a really straight faced post apocalyptic tale minus launching yourself from the atv to land through basketball hoops for an achievement with basically no hint of levity i wanna know what event took place that all of a sudden everyone is that special brand of happycrazy that infected watch dogs 2 with surprisingly good results and basically all of sunset overdrive im also getting slight bulletstorm vibes i guess this is probably something to thank walmart for its like mad max but on lsd mixed with bath salts hooray the long anticipated sequel to the game that over three people cared about this looks super good but it isnt gonna take my attention away from elder scrolls 6 im still waiting for that reveal mmmkay ill ride along for the hype im going to be pissed if it doesnt explain that cliffhanger anyone played rage 1 whats with the pink rage was pretty goodso im totally down with a rage 2 bring it on what the fuck went wrong omg the song playing in this trailer after watching hellsing ultimate abridged ep 8 makes it so much better already bethesda softworks and game studios are two different things children research not what i was expecting but 200 okay with this shut up and take my money punk well that looks horribly unappealing the only thing kinda good about the first rage was that it had two cute girl in it sure they only were featured for like 5 minutes but hey they still looked and acted cute which gave nice break from rages overall ugly world but now they for some reason decided to make rage 2 and make literally everything including the girls ugly as sin this looks like fallout and borderlands had a badass baby oh wow i wasnt expecting it to kick this much ass cant wait to play it i mean im not against this like at all but who asked for this anyway sure itll be ok wheres id software was anyone really asking for rage 2 though bethesda so its obvious there will not be korean subtitles this was the next bethesda rpg i was waiting for fallout meets mad max didnt work last time doubt itll work now tho ive never played rage so i dont know much about it but i have one thing to say what the fuck id software is it you okay didnt ask for this but always willing to see a franchise getuhm pulled up from the dumpster not too sure about this trailer though ahhh yeahhhh wingstick and the fatboy revolvers coming up cool lets wait and see if this is any good what the fuck did i just watch i must smoke ton of weed first before i watched gameplay tommorow xbox one digital preorder soon why wait for the e3 when you can just announce it a month earlier pathetic far cry watch dogs 2 the fuck is this shit we want fallout 5 now thats a way to hype kick ass trailer and at the very end gameplay reveal tomorrow glad it wasnt just trailer wait until e3 i guess i have to play rage now first impressions are everything and so far im having doubts about this edit lmao all yall hating im early just want to tell you have a nice day fallout on lsd the game lol this just looks like borderlands but with fewer jokes this trailer was a waste of money should be given to the devs the list of walmart is confirmed skyrim for the ps vita when but whos making it im still holding hope for doom 2 wouldve wanted rage 2 in 201314 but doom it was insanely good and i wanted a sequel for that wayyyy before rage cool fallout on lsd gameplay reveal tomorrow wtf was the point of this trailer looks as if mad max and claptrap had a baby yeah i watched fist of the north star too ahh ragegood times heres a list of people who stole this video and are profiting off of it 1 mkiceandfire 2 mathchief 3 izuniy whyyyyyyyyy funding this and not new vegas 2 or an es spinoff makes absolutely zero sense i like the song does anyone know the name of it yeah ill pass on this it is happening first rage was really underrated hope this one get what deserves looking forward ive been waiting so long for this now im excited i guess im going to install the first one that i never finished and then we have to wait another day god damnit i hope that gets leaked tonight wellthat was a waste of time well this looks interesting you made a sequel to a game with the worst ending in history well lets see if you did it right this time awesome i cant believe its happening bethesda is my favourite publisher this gen keep those single player goodies coming good deal i quite liked the first one is this going to be using mega textures it was pretty awesome tech but it had some issues on launch at least looks sweet keep up the good works bethesda we need tes 6 moment of silence im gay have a nice day omg i loved the first one so much get ready to die lol the song is ready to die by andrew wk if anyone is curious love it guys heres to a big year for all at bethesda oh hell yeah let do this who asked for this cant wait to see the gameplay loved rage that looks cool nice woodkidiron reference at 018 why didnt they reveal it at e3 never announce a game with a cinematic trailer guess the leak was real i enjoyed the first one so im okay with this wait someone actually played rage why tho time to play the first rage again it aint no half life thr wait nevermind forgot this was bethesda not valve so its going all out saint row can i make a book about fallout you guys can get all the money out of it i

features for rage 2 hell yeah hype for tomorrow i love this gme so much this was the first game i ever played and beat by myself and you guys are making a second one btw beshesda i loved the building part of fallout 4 so please dont take it out of the next game this actually looks cool i myself havent played the first rage but i think ill skip it and play this one instead so hyped if this doesnt end up on trending ill kill myself thanks walmart didnt say who the developer is no i want fallout 4 2 finally i hope bgs has a big game at e3 besides this rage 1 was so underrated glad bethesda bring this back never been so early righteous im perfectly happy this because i actually enjoyed the first game tho it was bland at times i enjoyed the gameplay mechanics and combat i am ok with waiting for another elder scrolls title because i want that to be one of the most amazing experiences to be played since oblivion i guess it happened oh bethesda notmypostapocalypticgame jk yes yes and much more fuck yes wow im intrigued at least until tomorrow now im waiting another day for the gameplay reveal is that andrew wk i hear well if you can make your own cac take my money 9 like v waiting for the trailer xd leaks have to ruin everything also first so instead of working on doom 5 they are doing this who wanted skyrim 6 instead cool top 100 bitches hey this isnt elder scrolls vi fucking what omg the rumers are true pogchamp we are ready we are rage out it looksinterest first this was unexpected lol first holy shit im actually damn hyped fallout 5 rage 1 wasnt perfect but this trailer put a smile on my face the apocalypse has never been so fabulous lmao saw the teaser on instagram looks rather interesting pretty sure nobody really wants this tbh e ta bom fallout 5 i knew it it just works wow nice bethesda everyone already knew this was coming since 2011 baybee first first first can you please put wolfenstein youngblood on game pass why can i not find the song anywhere the fk is the soundtrack its better then most of the shit thats ever been released whats the song used in this i cant wait for doom 2 so im getting this will it have local splitscreen like the first one whats this good damn song its so god kappa thats what a dope trailer is like looks like farcry saints row doom and dishonored had a foursome this looks pretty dope shit choice of music so which is it borderland x crysis metro x mad max doom x just cause monster hunter x saints row looks like doom far cry and borderlands had a threeway which resulted in rage 2 cant wait for this on game pass this is for me ono of the best game trailers in a lot of years i dont like the neon color at all i hope i can turn it of producer from doom enternal but she say lets talk the track is dope what is it called mad max on steroidsopen world doomill pass on this one bethesda woah anyone notice the progress booster i bet thatll give us more exps and skill points so its safe to say this is better than boarderlands this is the bulletstrom sequel we dont deserve wow never played first one think this may have made my mind up on the second what is rage 2 rage 2 is a game everyone will torrent and less will actually buy it i was gonna say you know theres gonna be doom dlc but its right there at the end get deluxe edition and get the bfg fuck yeah i love doom and this looks amazing speaking of doom though when are we getting more doom eternal stuff far cry on lsd i love how they dont even acknowledge the failure that is the first game and just summarize the whole thing in 2 sentences so we dont have to play it so basically everything every other open world game claims to be look sick baby 10 was alright this looks amazing am i the only one annoyed by this shitty banners covering all the awesome gameplay just what we wanted looks awesome i appreciate the straightupness of this trailer so borderlands without celshading this game looks great hopefully it doesnt take a hot steamy fallout 76 on itself this is what video games is about over the top mechanics that dont exists in real world total fun and destruction mismatching weapons and skills dope i dont own a ps4 or know the rage games but i want my own ps4 and rage 2 just for that crazy looking motherfucker on the box what is rage 2 a knockoff borderlands holy balls its out in less than two weeks where did time die days gone dissapointed me time to shine boy is the audio designer still high now i understand why people are waiting for this than getting fc new dawn looks like borderlands but actually good well shit im sold people arent rational bethesda trailer is good but im still mad about what you turned fallout into not buy squat until i get a classic fallout game that scores decently and doesnt reach into my wallet at every opportunity i really really hope the story delivers plus the ending better be amazing because of the last time am i right anyway looks badass and fun cant wait this game will die under the shadow of borderlands 3 looks really good just hope its not too far from the first one which i loved so much thats actually looks pretty interesting this game can not come out fast enough this what i thought the first one was gonna be like finally its here looks fun imo would it be accurate to say this is similar to borderlands fallout who are you rage 2 i am you but slightly better just cause 4 also by avalanche had awesome trailers that turned out to be a complete and total lie turns out the reviewers and youtube influencers were given a version of the game that was significantly different ie had way better graphics and performance than what was released in the consumer version thanks but ill wait until i see gameplay by real consumers i will never trust avalanche again all that text took away from showing the gameplay man im so glad i pre ordered digital deluxe edition on announcement day just want to know is those superpowers all you got or you will get more man this looks good looks excellentreally enjoyed the first rage and loved mad max by avalanchedefinitely picking this up in two weeksat least i have the awesome days gone to enjoy until then oh avalanche the ones that made mad max looks like a childrens game man all the previews for this game are saying its fantastic i think its safe to be hyped finally super hype i was kind of disappointing in the game when i saw the first trailer but this trailer makes the game looks amazing it looks more like the first game show me what to kill and where is my exact reaction after seeing this trailer if the first game was thor 2011 then this game is thor ragnarok for the lack of a better analogy the marketing team for this game are absolute mad lads bethesda i swear to god if you ruin this or doom eternal the community will bury you did that buffalo just laugh at me i feel like weve seen everything this game has to offer it still looks fun though that was one of the dopest trailers ive ever seen it was just so good waitdid you guys literally change the story werent we waking up people at the end of rage 1 not my type of game but i understand why many people would love it looks really fun enjoy gamers what is rage 2 another fucking mega game made by the king of game devs id ftw pumped for this so much i feel like the setting for rage 2 is like what los angeles would be like during an apocalypse one of the most anticipated game of 2019please dont fuck it up like just cause 4 im sue and my first call is crunch bites down now i have to choose between this and borderlands 3 dammit its going to be a no for me dawg dont just cause 3 this game i dare ya wow im impressed looks and seems fun to play and explore looking forward to buying rage 2 and doom eternal if it has id accosiated with it its a buy ign 610 to much shooting and driving not enough water its awesome what is rage got my collectors edition preordered convoys from mad max are back nice doom finally made a son name rage 2 this is the pc trailer btw ps4 pro doesnt look good at all italian gameplay on my channel d what is rage 2 rage 2 is unfortunately not coming to steam rage 1 is my fav game since it came out cant wait anyone else feel theyre trying a little too hard wow they turned the dial all the way up to ten since the first one this looks very simular to borderlands ive been wondering what rage 2 was for a very long time lol this is not interesting without coop yeaaah first rage was the knock off of borderlands and second rage doing the same thing i can see thats actually a really good trailer you will succeed where anthem failed it looked good until borderlands stole its thunder doom eternal looks amazing oh wait looks like doom and far cry went to a motel and had a baby this is a witty comment anyone who says otherwise will be outwitted to the point of being outwitted cheats time 047 its amazing how the tecnology evolves after an asteroid hit the earth loosum was john goodmans characters daughter in rage 1 she was much younger and prettier in the first game oof that driving is as bad as borderlands 1 embarrassing i just really want it to be completely open world they had such a great world yet theres nothing to explore and or see and the story was trash very doom guyish behaviorsmashing every button that is glowing at him i like it i see id software is continuing their war against those of us with color vision seriously what is it with this super lens flare acid trip technicolor bullshit art style if it gets any more intense theyll have to start slapping seizure warnings on the screenshots i was excited about this game but no amount of fun gameplay is worth the migraine that focusing on this laser light show would produce im glad games seem to be colourful again could this be the end of the great brownening i played the original rage game and was impressed by the look but was ultimately left wanting more so im excited for this new one as long as they dont over magnify the first person view like all of the farcry games so theres a game show where you shoot people and money comes out of them like a firstperson smash tv the new smash tv looks cool the masks look like mojo from the xmen post apocalyptic twitter followers is the name of my new band this dude is left handed bet hell be in the next lefty video is this borderlands 3 gameplay bulletstorm was great i though you said it literally sucked ass i played the original rage it was underwhelming cool concepts poor execution this new look intrigues me though might be checking this out fake gameplay 1103 wait right there that street is emptier than beggars pockets rage really had tons of details everywhere guy fieri as master blaster who runs flavor town wait a second loosum wasnt she the girl who originally taught you how to use wingsticks in the first one rage 2 is just borderlands with tighter combat graphics upgrade and better car combat wow what cynical design design by committee it looks like it doesnt have an ounce of its own identity thats just sad lmao why does the guy in the thumbnail looks like johnny haliday what is with that mayor npcs mouth its barely moving when she speaks like many who played rage i hope this actually has a story gameplay and doesnt cause depression from how boring it is looks like a non cell shaded borderlands graphics and models are awful that explosion in the mayors office looks absolutely terriblethe textures and animation itself looked so terrible cant mess with these ps2 looking games that are basically mashups of other decent at best games or games that once were gems just results in this graphics matter not if the game brings everything new to the table not when it plays as shitty as it looks and takes from other shitty no skill games cool chris redfield in rage 2 when the character grabs the pen to sign something he does it with his left hand onto the list you go sir oh no its gone badly for the judge dredd guard well definitely with his buddys poor cpr technique lock your elbows damn it the arena reminds me of the saints row 3 arenas wingsticksjust wingsticks no fancy super power require thats all i need to kill them all and how i finished rage the 1st game id say big boss is pretty quick you cant do tactical espionage action by being slow the chick that teaches you to throw a wingstick is the mayor hope this sells better than rage did the problem was borderlands and rage were close in release date and gameplay too close i loved the first rage and i am so excited for this new one looking forward to any gameplay posted andy whats she saying are you guys commentating with earplugs in or are you not allowed to let us hear the audio as one of the few people that did play the original rage im glad they are maintaining the mad maxy feel but still trying to find their own idea id kind of like to read one of these postapocalyptic contracts the party of the first part skull lord the destroyer and the party of the second part the wanderer no one has heard of do hereby racing mutants shooting and cocktail sausages sounds like a fun friday night the only thing i remember from the original rage is all the car racingbattling spent hours trying to get all the car upgrades if you break the contract the lawyers will come to enforce the terms of course lawyers in this reality are massive roided up guys in suits with assault weaponry instead of briefcases the game show bit reminds me of professor genkis stuff in sains row the third just with more red 1022 thatd be a good design for the new showdown of the week trophy 1508 like all big bosses its slow tell that to the untold victims of naked snake obviously this game looks amazing but that conversation animation on loosum hagar lol is so well done the shifting of the body weight and the hand movements seem very natural super impressed i think loosum hagar was the very minor character who was in all the promotional material because a she was hot and b she used wingsticks which the devs clearly wanted you to love despite them being very eh its a bit weird to see her return in a more important less fanservicey role i think that woman was crying over the fiericor like the rancor keeper in jedi im really looking forward to this even though rage didnt get huge critical success i always really enjoyed the game i liked the world it gave us and the aesthetics and always did hope for more so im pretty psyched id um double check that drinking blood to stay young assessment andy scientists areeerily less dismissive of it than youd hope legit dont care after fo76 i wont ever again play something that requires the bethesda launcher you know this game looks pretty solid i think ill get it ah man i like the playthrough guys but the talkingcouldnt follow nothing in the game crocodiles those are allig next time mister farrant next time its alligators andy loosum hagar is the person who first gives you wingsticks in rage 1 and wellsprings is the first big settlement 005 is when i said borderlands wannabe 040 is when andy said borderlandsy lol what took you so long no bullet sponges so id say its already better than ragecry 2 dawn i not only played the original rage i loved it but all i remember is loving the game and that ingame card game i played the original rage always thought of it as a very obscure bethesda game because i never knew anyone who played it this is the first time i hear about rage 2 and im loving it i thought biff too haha loosums grown up thats badass looking forward to playing this game for free two years from now on ps plusgame pass great video but if it is bethesda launcher only they can keep it the driving in mad max was fantastic it had the speed and weightiness that made handbrake turns so satisfying it was similar to driver and to me that it the best style for a game like this i dont like when games like gta v rage 2 sleeping dogs etc opt for a less physics based more arcade style wouldnt it be better if everyone was just sliding around like a cheesy 70s chase movie smashing into one another nojust me then i have to admit the trailer song got meway more hype for this then i expected lol am guessing she is a relative of the guy who saved you in the first rage hagar clan just a guess this game looks like doom but without all the zombie stuff and all postapocalipty looks great maybe ill get this 1532 love that star wars reference after the apocalypse the survivors will be cockroaches and facebook and kirby of course kirby will survive the entire universe when death comes at the end to put the chairs on the tables and close the store he will find that pink ball still here long after the works of mortals and gods have turned to dust oh come on more racing i hated that part of rage 1 i agree mike what is the point of a trophy you cant drink out of it may just be me but this seems a bit too borderlandsynot a fan of the weird glitchy effect either but it still looks like it could be pretty good fun might have to check it out loosum hagar was the one who taught you how to throw a wing stick in the first game i really hope there are voice recording or video messages from the past of the first rage game and that they have john goodman voice acting dan hagar again sooo looking forward to this sequel who runs flavor town guy fieri or whatever runs the winner lounge i dont think this games is going to be ground breaking but its deffinetly going to scratch an ich most of us didnt know we had it looks like a funrun and gun type of game rage is awesome if you didnt play it youre a fake gamer i playedfinished rage mayor hagar huh perhaps its a continuation of the final fight universe and they just lost a g somewhere along the apocalypse its all the rage this is why i love outside xbox mayor clayton has a tower now im now picturing phoenix wright running around the wasteland drawing up contracts and shouting objection every time someone breaks the contract you guys should so do a video on the top 7 or 10 ingame radio stations that should be real my moneys on los santos rock radio from gtav radio new vegas from fallout new vegas and sagittarius fm from sleeping dogs i dont remember the mayor in the first rage but the first guy you met in that game was named hagar voiced by john goodman so i assume theres some relation people always talk about how post apocalyptic game shows are always so brutal and sure theyre rough but none of them are as savage as pat sajak on wheel of fortune thems just facts the madame in the club scene really reminded me of margaret thatcher shudders looks similar to the new obsidian outer worlds game i am disappointed that there are no mutant cocktail weiners protagonist wins a murder show then they decide to send one monster to take them down at least have him be digesting a time bomb first mad maxs rage electric boogaloo they put an awful lot of effort into neon just saying your society may function better if you maybe had different priorities visual representation of a company rolling up its previous games corpse in a carpet and stuffing it in the boot of a car the whole game is basically top 100 life hacks you wish you knew earlier i dig the use of colors but that glitch visual effect is very hard on the eyes you did meet someone at the start with the last name hagar bethesda obviously doesnt know what a beta is they just picked up the word somewhere and it sounded cool yay 520 anyone else notice the protagonist is a lefty maybe id saw the video you guys did on left handed protagonists and decided to add another to the list 708 upon learning that bo selecta had survived the apocalypse the last vestiges of humanity grew envious of all those who perished disappointing to hear the driving doesnt feel that good could just be that mike has high standards for driving games though hold on at 519 the ragedude signed the thing with his left hand making him a lefty just like doomguylink is this the beggining ofan inetrconnected leftyverse rage 1 was great but i think most peoples prob with it was that it wasnt a crazy mad max road brawl it was more of a terror shooter all of the places in 1 had some of the best atmospheric horror ive ever experienced in gaming even compared to true scare games as andy said that area is laid exactly out like sanctuary in borderlands 2 borderlands and judge dredd i like all of those words for anyone whos played the first one loosum hagar is the girl who teaches you how to throw a wingstick when i saw the neon signs i was hoping you could recreate the music videos for keep your eyes peeled and if i had a tail its in that place where i put that thing that time i beat the original rage game i have it as one of ten people who played the original rage i can confirm that the current mayor of wellsprings is not the same one as the original and i do not recognise her from the original but i remember the names of few of the characters i suddenly feel compelled to go outside and fire up the grill i dont know why its my birthday i really like the mix of post apocalyptic and cyberpunk i could listen to any of the oxcrew talk about anything for hours on end if there ever comes a time where you lot finally manage to make a podcastcommentary like thing i will be present and accounted for is there a character creater in this game i dont remember one in the first rage game but just curious i preordered rage the first one because it looked flipping awesome it wasnt this looks even better they wont get me this time yes yes yes i cant fleeeping wait i loved the original rage 1 was great found a great glitch in that one too been looking forward to this for ages note to self never go on a bit if i ever meet andy or he will consider booting me out of a window i feel like this is sanctuaryfromborderlands2 ripoff your think theyd stop mentioing their relationship with a racist regime but no they were acknowledging it at the rumble the original rage was a bit of a disappointment 90 racing for car parts 10 story with a crappy ending thats just my opinion though im hoping that rage 2 has a lot more to it andy does have practical skills in real life guitar playing singing cooking rock climbing video editing making love to 9 beautiful women in 4 days talented guy is andy ive heard that drinking young blood wont restore your youth however if you have an organ transplant it is possible that you will take on some personality traits of the original owner i gotta say im not really impressed so far it feels lacking of something and a game that is maybe fun for only a couple of hours itsnot borderlands just ad much as my novel isnt god of war but better now i am very intrigued it has improved a lot never played rage rage 2 looks like it has potential but i probably wont play it either not enough time anymore as a fellow beard grower i can corroborate andy sometimes a breeze through the beard is quite pleasant as much as i love your channel i cannot watch any of this gameplay until the game comes out on my preorder rage was without a shadow of a doubt the most influential post apocalyptic eutopia of barron wastelands i love you guys put please understand i am avoiding all rage 2 spoliers and gameplay off to tenpenny i mean clayton tower definitely clayton loosen hagar is the daughter of dan hagar the guy who rescues you at the start of rage hes also voiced by john goodman imagine if mike had several pints of beer in real life he could end up at a birmingham car show with a hangover bet hes glad hes never done that bro this look like a bulletstorm doom and far cry hybrid played the first rage and completed it can remember any of the characters name just the confusion and disappointment about the ending the fact that brutal game shows always pop up in the post apocalypse shows that they must lie somewhere on the hierarchy of basic human needs 1 air 2 water 3 food 4 company 5 the price is right i actually think rage was the game with the most wasted potential i ever played i hope rage 2 is as good and lives up to its possibilities become a famous race driver and cause a copious amount of chaos clearly this is the story of one mike channell so this is what it would be like if mike and andy commentated esports i approve cant wait looks amazing so interesting day one purchase for me i think i remember loosum shes the chick who teaches you how to use the wingstick in the first one i think at least kinda want some cocktail sausages now if im not mistaken wellspring was a location from the first game wasnt it i wonder if this game will reuse a lot of the original locations is ellen ok and is she coming back this games reminds me of arkham knight when youre so early theres not even any comments so rage 2 has cocktail sausages do they have little chunks of cheese and pineapple on a stick then ill be interested whooot im looking forward to rage 2 a street fighter and double dragon clone these three are great live awesome chemistry i play sor on mame so i think it was an arcade machine sor 2 is the best side scroller beat them up final fight for snes had haggar and cody whoever has axel is bogarting the health powerups mike is this the type of game where you can hit each other hits player everyone yeah james and this is gonna suck stfu james lol i just got streets of rage still play this i cant believe i hadnt found this yet ps final fight doesnt hold a candle to streets i may go play this now no soup for you tiger electronics rgb mod im very late to see this but what system were u playing on ryanhorror movies are suppose to be fun how fucking stupid horror movies are made to scare us not tickle our damn funny bone yeah your thinking of comedys like that bitch president obama was that was a fucking joke come to america and lead our country because you dont even need to be a citizen or hold any american values now thats a funny fucking joke i bet ryan voted for his ass good playthrough my sisters favorite star trek captain is also picard i like him and kirk myself i would say metallica is before iron maiden only because they introduced me to speed metal but barely because iron maiden introduced me to heavy metal both are awesome bands tho are the see through lights in the bar transperincies like the snes or are they a different special effects because as far as i know the snes was the only console of the 16 bit generation that could do those effects not even the turbografx and the mighty neogeo could do them unless they put a special chip in the cartridge i think the atari jaguar could do them but im not too sure it was a 16 bit system i mean it had a 16 bit cpu but its graphics processors were a mixture of 32 and 64 bit chips so i guess it was a 16 bit system with up to 64 bit power so does it count or not so i guess i have two questions after babbling on lol streets of rage 4 were have you been all my lifei love playing old stuff tooonly game is red dead 2 that gets me botherd these days i use to love this game specially beating up the crackheads with gray mohawks and yellow jackets this is my favorite game i got this on wii play it all the time and the soundtrack is sick i bought the sega console with mk instead of this one still happy with the sega i bought this on my 3ds and its a badass version yall should really play its in 3d same game but its just nastalgia upgrade and overload please try it it has og version and and japanese american versions and alt game play great best beaten up of 16 bit era there was an arcade machines of that in fact very rare using a hardware adaptation that was called megaplay that was almost a genesis hardware i talk with some retrogamers here in brazil that even have pics of it great live congratulations guys one of my alltime favorites id take this over 90 of new games any day 1010 game if you havent played it get on it how come they dont mention ytv vidio top 10 talking about start trek next generation these dudes are nerds love you guys lol one of the best games ive ever played on the sega genesis period at 34 is that ultimate warrior hey james i think you should do more the big rigs trucker guy that was fuckin funny millenials will never get how this was so great playing on phones cmon gimme a break this was the shit i actually beat this game as a kid hey james i was playing streets of rage 2 for the ps3 before and i kind a liked it as good as turtles in time is this game is 10 times better best beat em up ever made with final fight a close second i feel like if i knew mike matei in real life id hate his guts his personality is just so grating sometimes bare knuckle is the original japanese title sor 1 has 3 selectable characters adam axel and blaze do the mike james what the fuck is a facebook cartridge aha i hadnt seen this lets see the anger no cinemassacre without the nerd barbon the bartender tell jimmy jensen monkeeeyyyy cheeeeeessseeeee 4206 james rolfe is reminded of who now boll paul man you gotta get nathan for this game itd be so epic dont worry bud i also think that its like boo and do base ball are the best things in this entire game would absolutely love to see mike and james play mario 3 i have a great retro game for you james and mike would love it too dossun ganseki battle for the a snes if you hate it i will eat a shoe on camera as far as any of us know this is the only time james and ryan have met there is a cheat i think its eaither this one or the third onebut u pick skate at the begining and then die dont hit anybdyand then u come back like turbo charge i love these guys i watch them all the time love there vids great music intro to this game you guys should play sor3 thats the best one x when the enemy throw you like them guys with the mohawk haircuts you can press all the buttons at the sametime and land on your feet guys lol only 100k views u can tell james didnt play much genesis in his life he sucks at this game anybody else see someone play a favored game from their past really poorly and feel like they have to play it cinemassacre i love how james tells mike he cant cheat when choosing movies and mike basically responds if i cant cheat by choosing a bunch i guess my favourite is this other bunch 1240 i think axel and blaze were fucking amazing soundtrack the music is awesome a sega mega drive game that isnt being slammed immediately because its not contra unreal there was a sor coin op but it was called bare knuckle i used to sneak into the students union to play it after id finished school maybe it it wasnt available in the us it seems unlikely they wouldnt have released it there i dont know some of the best video game music ever streets of rage 1 and 2 3 aww man i wouldve beaten that game on super hard mode yep number 2 was good 1 was cool i really mind that 1 but number 3 was in the bin for me ryan has good taste in fighting gamessoul calibur 2 would have to be my favorite now that i think about it its also a weird case where the quality of the game may even supersede my love for itwhich is massive streets of rage remake is out and its awesome my friend and i used to slam a 30case down and beat it on the mania difficulty setting noise complaints ensued i had no idea james was such a big fan of ghost holy shit this just made my day just so happens to be my birthday so fuck yeah i like the music iceferno has the best remix to the stage 1 track go straight james going in for the beat down on ryan at 334 final flight games sucked i thought this was august 20th 2016 turned out it was august 20th 2015 rofl james sucks at this game and probably sucks at all co op games reason to follow i hate how you cant see blazes health bar stupid camera rad eurodancehouse soundtrack is axl james axl is sucking ass if you take requests and its probably a bit late but rocket knight adventures for genesismegadrive is awesome also one of the few animal mascot games from the 90s that was just as original as sonic and in some ways better at times sequels were crap though and rka and the character were created by contra alien wars creator it plays like contra gradius and the music like sor is just as memorable masanouri the musician who worked on this also worked on symphony of the night suikoden i love final fight although streets of rage 2 is the best side scrolling beat em up of its generation by far what happened squaresoft james playstation happened wow seriously apparently final fantasy went to shit on psone said no one ever its funny that you mentioned super mario rpg at the end james i bought it today and play it right now its great and chrono trigger is also great you both should play final 79 on the ps one they were the best ones in my opinion and i played 16 too and their really great no question but not as beautiful and remarkable as 79 i love how the last boss just breaks out a damn tommy gun lol thats real fair 938 there is an arcade machine of street of rage 2 but it is identical and made after the console it is called sega megaplay and i dont think it was released in the us only europe and japan you can play it with mame play streets of rage 3 this game is hard i remember the codes to this you guys should play the forest i would have said ultimate warrior lol my favorite movies seems to be forrest gump im a huge fan of its a mad mad mad mad world so great in its entirety can u live stream a tiger electronics watch game im sorry but i would be so angry to play this game with james cause he is doing so bad in this one play more games with james please on streams i think many people would love to see him more often hey everyone what are some modern beat em ups that are good on any platform like maybe some that came out somewhat recently in the last ten years lol zanjeef max is actually the best in the game i played this as a kid i really hope i can play it again sometime i love how james and mike hate emulation yet they are using a steam product which is less accurate with recreating the game than an emulator does fucking finally streets of rage 2 has been ignored for far too long by avgn james and mike play mondays this game was my life as a child skater is my preferred character streets of rage 1 had 3 characters blaze axel adam this game is so monotone at least final fight have bonus stages and some variety but this is just hit enemies the same thing over and over by the way nice live stream guys d ryan schott is such a pain in the ass isnt that mrs tits from action 52 what game had the fuckin kangaroo with boxing gloves in it i loved playing as that friggin kangaroo streets of rage remake is awesome and has been out for a while i never realized this was out on steam does anyone play this streets of rage 3 ryu rule one get the knife 2 get the knife an 3 get the knife for everyone wondering how there are so many enemies on screen its the blast processing sorry i thought there was but the game i was thinking it was is just a game alot like it my bad there was an arcade version fun fact if you time your hits correctly with axel and blaze you can keep the basic enemies in a permanent stun and perform an infinite combo omg yes the occulus rift is so fun to play with vr is getting so awesome now anyone ever play the streets of rage 2 hack where you play as the ninja turtles look it up if not its awesome loved the original sor i never played this one guys i love your channel i dont play new video games so seeing this makes all the feels and warm fuzzies come out sad i missed this live cause this is one of my favorite games ever damn dungeon fighter stole a lot from this game or maybe they meant to that game is as close as one can get to a remake and its one of the most meticulous rpgs around does the steam version allow you to change the music i would love to use new instrumental versions of the tunes in this game there is must be an extra live in very left of the screen in the corner hello nerd greetings from brazil d if you do an amiga video id love to see you do dungeon master that games one of my alltime favorites oh my favourite trilogy on the sega genesis memories so many good times hey james if you would like to i got some old horror movies in vhs and the boxes are in great conditions give me a sign if you are curious about the titles and i could give them away to you i dont care much about them was selling them on the web anyway why did beat em up genre died i love it so much specially street of rage and violet storm please discuss it james and mickey why didnt you save the kangaroo elvis was a racist godjust seing how they dont push up and jump to cancel enemy throws really triggers melet alone dying so much to enemies play the game on hardest difficulty and the only character you have a chance with is axel youll be using the grand upper attack every 2 seconds best game on mega drive streets of rage 2 i fucken love streets of rage james and mike play streets if rage remake it must be done dudes best beatemup game ever ship level track is my favorite too such an awesome fun game i wish theyd make more awesome beatemups like this the warriors by rockstar games has a beatemup minigame thats tons of fun by the way best side scrolling beat em up of all time sega created streets of rage solely because capcomwould notbring final fight to the genesis i think i would say the ps1 would be my favourite console its definitely that or snes i loved this game growing up samwell tarly is knowledgeable speaking of hot video game characters ive always wanted to fuck chun li from street fighter 010123 this guy looks like the second hokage i think from naruto i dont know really i havent watched that in ages thank you sega for the ps3 collection my sega broke years ago lol such a bad ass game i remeber that one boss u fight who starts off in a wheel chair then mid fight stands up and goes agesheet one of my fave games no more aqua teen hunger force last episode aired not long ago 813 i thought electra used sai and didnt dress like black canary lol seems more fun then double dragon neon was shit this was posted aug 20 thats like a week ago when do they make these lives duuuuuude even if you never do an episode on landstalker do yourself a favor and play that i like mikes taste in consoles i think the best console ever was the snes and at second second place is the ps2 its just amazing cant believe i missed this live btw the best sega master system game is by far ghouls n ghosts it was way better than the nes one wish they tried it edit doubt they will though its about 90 damn wish i saved my copy my all time favorite genisis game please live stream cadillacs and dinosaurs make more james rolfe and mike matei videos please will they ever admit this is a million times better than final fight im happy my old man got me a geniuses instead of snes i still got a snes later in college but glad i missed the role playing games that make you grind for points sonic forever dudes get bashed in the head with a lead pipe and get up without missing a beat then a knee to the stomach kills them videogamelogic hadnoideatheextraschannelexisted lovethisgame i would love to see how the super nintendo is superior than sega genesis in all genera you compare wow that was an awful gameplay of this game lol man why is it that whenever you guys finally give the genesis some attention you end up talking about nintendo more than anything loli love you guys but god damn get a genesis fanboy in there who can relate to some of our nostalgia moments to counterweigh all the snes propaganda hahahyes the battlelines are still drawn on this argument for some people hey james and mike please make a street fighter v beta live stream more pls doesnt matter what game bc i was just listening to you guys do qa while i played my own game multi tasking streets of rage the best beat em up to grace us ever jayce and wheeled warriors has an awesome theme though lol james being a bit weirded out by just doing raw live footage with no editing james revive the nerd mike stay fucky ryan you seem nice is it just me or is the sound of this version crap because my ps3 version sounds just like the original this does not normal difficulty seriously and you were both killed even before the shiva lol for those fans who liked the music it was yuzo koshiros tracks there are a lot of good remakes of them in a sor remake version of the game actually gecko yamori made those tracks really great for shiva theme search max man title its not that obvious and for general boss themes never return alive have fun the music in this game is so good stream hercs adventures sega saturn in 3p make sure to pick up a multitap beforehand axel was always the most fun to play asbut lady sexy blaze she will always be my heart in street of rage3 why would you guys stretch the image to 169 when thrown by enemy i think u can hold up to land on feet this brings back memories great game this is a good game but how is this different than the james mike plays videos you missed the hidden 1up at the bottom left at the beginning i remember being at magfest when yuzo koshiro music composer for this game was there during a panel with him when people could line up and ask questions a guy walks up dressed as axel guy dressed as axel want to hear a joke koshiro sure axel blasstapunchheh koshiro and his translator talk suddenly the translator lady has an oh shit look on her face translator that is koshirosans voice axel turns and walks away 0mgy0u finaly play itthe best beat em up side sr0ller ever the snes has a terrible library of shootem ups streets of rage 2 is handsdown the best beatem up ever and still as much fun today as 20 years ago plus the graphics and music still look good mike mentions a documentary about elvis but i dont want to rewatch the whole thing just to catch the name so i ask here does anyone remember the name of that docu genesis does what nintendont james joins the darkside i was always a nintendo fanboy with the original nes but what sega came out with genesis i had to get that one and the original streets of rage was one of the reasons i chose to change companies give guitar guy a home is there a chatango is this using only youtube comments chrono trigger is the best game ever period what is your favorite horror movie star wars arcade game in the sit down cockpit ftw deckard mofucking cain lol mike knows james favorite movie how romantic one of my favorite games ever the music is absolutely amazing too it was called bare knuckle in japan and streets of rage outside of japan i gotta agree on diablo 2 for best dungeon crawler hell one of the best games in general pretty sure streets of rage had 3 characters blaze axel and adam yuzo koshiro probably the greatest video game music composer of the 16bit era possibly ever as well great to hear youre going to play amiga games some day theres a lot to choose from damn they missed the extra life behind the mailboxtrashcan in the very beginning yep this is legitimately the best coop beat em up for the sega genesis this and gunstar heroes for sure some of the best memories of my childhood the music is amazing too thumbs all the way up max is the man for this game completed with him he does a slide attack which pretty much kicks everyones arse one of the best games ever youre playing all distorted old games are 43 not 169 adjust the game settings in the emulator before running the game i would ask if you could play mad max when it comes out or at least the nes version from 1990greetings from czech rep btw i just knew which turtle each of you were going to pick before you said it awesome or mega drive consol weird that the game gear was the same name in europe and the usa mighty final fight plz if you want to get into a collection vhs is the cheapest and easiest to buy you can buy it in bulk pretty much anywhere soundtrack on this classic kicks ass finally one of my all time favourite games and james is on the couch too what a nerdgasm so many frustrating things about this though all the elevator stages picking up a weapon a bunch of times and losing both of them being able to hit each other and the robotsthe ing robots still a classic though shame on the last level i got to a point as a kid where i could beat this solo on the hardest difficulty with no continues i didnt play much elsethis and sonic couldnt imagine the hours id have to put in to do that now and the sheer frustration just adding ryan great guy to pick for the channel really knows his stuff about pc gaming yes to swkotor and definitely to diablo ii greatest game ever please please please pleaaaaaaaaase never stream a 43 game in 169 ever again i said you that you should of played streets of rage was that because i said it 242 james eats both apples horrible teammate love the midi music in this game some of my favorite right up there with megaman 2 and ducktales hehe i also love the muffled midi voices street fighter is another good example always liked to equate the goofy midi stuff they say with something in english for instance it sounds like blaze says nicole coldcuts when she does her flip lol would love to know what other people think it would be cool to play the remake v5 on the pc where do yall live stream on twitch too bad i didnt watch this live because i would have been able to give a lot of pointers playing a sega genesis game on steam using an xbox controller lol welcome to the future marty one of the best sega games ever can you pls use twitch like everyone else so ppl will know when you go live would be awesome mike how many tuna tacos have you destroyed with that mace of erection5 in your pants this week sadlyi cant watch the live stream sor 2 best 16bit beat em up ever period also some of the best 16bit music ever too i liked final fight but the snes couldnt pull it off where as the megacd version proved the megadrive could of done final fight better than the snes oo axel is grabbing blazes boobs 2843 when is bored james 1500 the fight against jet seems similar to the fight against baxter from the snes gameturtles in time even the environment has a familiar look you missed the 1up hidden at the beginning bottom left and the one outside the truck in stage 2 elvis thats the way it is is one of my all time favourites suspicious minds is the one streets of rage 3 is very difficult but thats sega of americas fault they upped the difficulty and did a bunch of other things to it to make it less enjoyable than streets of rage 2 if sor3 came out in america unaltered i think it would have been the best game in the trilogy when i was in highschool and people were going on and on about dragonforce i could not understand why one of my favorite sega saturn game was the most popular thing of the day play dragonforce guys what about kabuki quantum fighter ist a fucking awesome nes titlei played it as a kid and still remember love u guys greets from germany ps have u this game in your library my favorite game of all times sor 2 yuzo koshiros music is absolutely amazing its like boo yo 80s pc game maniac mansion regarding the streets of rage remake comment you mentioned in the video theres a homebrew game that came out in 2011 for the pc i think it was ported to other platforms but am not sure if youre interested i can message you the download link this is probably the best gamemusic of the entire 16bit generation and that boss is clearly ultimate warrior not macho man lol u guys rock watch u all the time u bring back my past and all them times i was sitting on the edge of my couch gripping my controller to the point of breaking my figures and seeing u guys get in those situations makes ur heart race and the nostalgia makes my figures twitch streets of rage remake has been out a couple of years now i can email you the game if you want in fact im pretty sure i did once asking for a james and mike review because im not sure if you can find

about thats like castlevania when theyre talking about oculus the dark hall or somethingedit its odallus the dark call how is it you are ok with playing classic games on steam but not an emulator you realize it is the same thing right going by what mike always said if ryan would have finished the game it wouldnt have counted because he used an emulator anyone over here played the remake 3446 more like the ultimate warrior was owning you because he doe not look like at all as the late great macho man randy savage oh yeah show how much james and mike and ryan and all of the viewers know about wrestling and its superstars how do i get a notification that theres going to be a live stream by cinemassacre you guys should announce when youre live streaming woah so my genesis pack was really rare i had no idea whats the name of remix artist i prefer the nes and ps1 even though i collect for snesgenesis the most also play bare knuckle 3 instead of sotr3 this game is so much better than final fight heh favorite 16bit games ever made you guys are really bad at this kind of games dont even know all the basic moves like falling on foot without suffering damage after a throw i got a copy of streets of rage that came with a gamegear i bought off ebay years ago never really played it much also got a copy of final fight guy on the snes i bought way back in the day at blockbuster when is

not on hardest you get gang banged to shit on that mode ohhhhhh fck yeah live stream with james mike and ryan 3 stretchovision rip aspect ratio the streets of rage remake is already out that aspect ratio is blasphemous 43 or die oregon trail love this on 3ds this out run space harrier and fantasy zone ii are all great on 3ds you havent lived until youve played space harrier in 3d just like the guy on the right my genesis came with streets of rage 2 this game was badass i also got a voucher with my system to get sonic 2 mailed to me for maybe a few dollars shipping then i got mortal kombat 2 and jurassic park and holy smokes shit got real you missed the extra guy in the beginning fuckerslol im kidding guys whats the game they mentioned when they were taking about occulus something about being like castlevania top gun wasnt on the tiger hand helds it was on konami and they made 2 of them which i have both of they did make an after burner and i have the portable one as well as the tabletop one with the control stick ryan you son of a bitch damn streets of rage u know if you get the entire city wanting to kick your ass maybe you have it coming xbox controllers sucks on 2d games and this dotemu games sucks balls generations is a great movie oh my almost all sounds are from beyond oasis hey man been looking at your godzillathon and just found you havent done godzilla 2014 why there an extra life behind the mailbox in the foreground at the very start of level 1 streets of rage 2 was in the arcade sega had mega play machines that were just like the nintendo play choice 10 yeah james about time its funny that james doesnt watch tv live because thats the same way i watch streams so awesome to see you playing this i know this game from my childhood like the back of my hand soundtrack is amazing cinemassacre extras you guys should play final fight sometime hey james how was it doing a live stream also i live this game d one of genesiss best and most balanced my friends and i invested countless hours in sor2 my favorite beatem up ever rpgmmo well thats a different way to say that loved this game when i was a teen this was amazing to see one of my favorite games of all time thanks guys why you dont start your own twitch page my friends dont seem to like these livestream segments or even the james and mike mondays because they dont like their unscripted nature but fuck that noise more content should never be a bad thing so long as it does not interfere with their normal projects scary how bad they are at this james seems like he is out of the loop with gaming and technology these days haha yes james is fucking awesome fucking ghost rules i could see hanging with him listening to metal playing video games drinking awesome beer and cursing like sailors haha play double dragon advance on gba finally streets of rage 2 loved it live and thanks for reading out some of my questions how do i know when and where to watch these when theyre actually live ryan is wrong it was called streets of rage here in the pal regions just like in the us ntsc final fantasy v is my favourite not sure if its localized though nobody used maxs atomic drop strongest move in the game these are alot of fun welcome james ah man i missed it i wanted to say hi streets of rage 2 is by far the best its better than part 1 and better than part 3 part 3 was a bit too over the top i played part 2 so much i think i can beat it even now after all these years i am curious to know how to you do your livestream setup wow james and ryan are finally sitting down together live streaming awesome combo of people you should play rage of street remake v5 insted you can get this and 2 on the 3ds it looks pretty cool in 3d if youre into 3d games mike hasnt played the dark forcesjedi knight games holy shit get on it one more swedish fan here my all time favorite game classicsfromthe90s i was like no love for kotor or dark forces ryan saved the day whats bootsys real name hearing them talk about the oculus is painful haha again elgato man super easy allows you to stream right from its software and you can connect anything to it that has at least composite video so you can play the actual cartridges on it or use them through the retron that mike has onto the elgato you guys should do a street fighter live stream but more towards marvel vs capcom 2 or street fighter third strike but any fighter like soul caliber 2 itll still be rad search for bomber games street of rage remake profit you guys should get the syndicate wars patch from streets of rage online on the pc makes the game so much fun playing as a hanzou makes the game so epic you should play bare knuckle 3 for mike and james mondays sometime since the western streets of rage 3 was edited and censored a fair bit sorry nerd biased nintendo fanboy sor2 is the best beat em up ever made one of my favorite games ever and my favorite genesis game also one of the best soundtracks ever great memories beating the hell out of everyone in this game and i oddly never played streets of rage 1 the american way of naming things this is no pc its a steam one of my favourite games ever do base ball the guy with the jetpack is such a fucking bitch this is my favorite game on the sega genesis the whole series is great my only wish is to have a foursome with these guys i would slay them hell fucking yeah classic bring on the onslaught of thugs and memories yes james i want to motorboat his ass yeah why does james look anorexic in this video is it the camera doing that reeeeally awesome live stream i couldnt watch cause here in brazil it was too early or too late i dont know thank you guys for the years of good work when u going to play five nights at freddys omg this game is so incredible good and the music i dont know who this james fellow is but its nice to see mike use his popularity to help his friends get exposure i hate how when people are talking about yuzo koshiros work they always quote the streets of rage series and only that actually yuzo koshiro did a better work in plenty of other games sonic 1 game gear how do you not quote this etrian odyssey i know its not a well known series of games but the etrian odyssey musics are just awesome i even consider etrian odyssey iii having a better ost than final fantasy iiivi ys i and ys ii the ys series is well known for the great musics tokitowa etc he worked on a lot of games and streets of rage have decent music thats all the musics of streets of rage are so overrated i just dont understand and i say that as a huge fan of yuzo koshiros work and video game music in general 355 which song are they talking about here i hope this isnt just an hours of mike talking about how he thinks the super nintendo is better like all the other genesis videos great stream as always nice to see james on this one you should really check out war of the monsters on the ps2 i think you three of all people are going to love it cheers from greece james and ryan playing together my world is complete also my favourite game from my childhood lmao i was just playing this i know you use the framemeister but how do you get a genesis looking crystal clear like this on an hdtv very nice stream id love to see what systems you could hook up in the future would have never guessed he was a ghost fan it was a great stream mike even have read my channel name and a comment at some point the steam version is literally the original genesis version set up on an emulator theres not much reason other than conveniences sake to buy the game on steam if you dont want to set up an emulator sweet now i need to go get me streets of rage from steam too this just makes me want to play through streets of rage again amiga its a great system i loved mine good fun 2 player game to play goof troop for snes love that game loving these live streams one thing though mike is it possible to amp up the quality on the facecam you need to start a twitch the super nintendo doesnt have a beat em up that can hold a candle to streets of rage 2 streets of rage 3 is so much better best game on the sega and that soundtrack i dunno know hard it would be for you guys to do it but you should stream some intellivision or some other very old system figure out how to do it and get the three of you together to do it that brings back good memories lmao james takes both chickens over and over james is such a prick to play co op with just takes everything i would lose my mind lol id enjoy chillin with the raphael from the old cartoon show because of the sarcasm hes a brooding overly emotional piece of shit in all other versions though so screw the rest of them i got the genesis with streets of rage 2 as well back in the early 90s i still have it but i dont think it works anymore dammit you guys should also play castlevania symphony of the night on sega saturn if you havecan find a copy those jiggle physics hey what time do you stream gmt i fucking love ghost the new album is awesome gamesack steaming too tho i may be one of the few people who prefers sor 1 i really hate the scratchy voices in 2 and everyone always spams the special moves good choice for a beatem ups live stream also you should do a live stream episode of the angery video game nerd streets of rage 1 actually has 3 playable characters you forgot adam not many ladies cosplay blaze they should awesome stream guys ryan looks like a chubby version of the penguin from the show gotham loved the live stream as far as streets of rage i do like the sequel although the original did have its charm i remember playing the arcade version in walmart enterance wish they would bring arcade games like that back rather than the junk they have now rage play super mario maker when it comes out yeah you guys should definitely play streets of rage remake its the full sor package all three games in one with even more of everything that made the original games great this was a disappointing lp died before they could make it to mr x yay for jayames mike have you ever been to graceland theres actually a streets of rage fan remake just google sor remake you guys should check out combines elements and stages from all 3 games and all the characters along with some options like turning off damage between players the one with the rollerskates is my favorite hahaha damn i missed it next time wtf youtube im high as fuck smoking a beer its no narc are you guys gonna post vids of the conventions you were at this past summer of course im at work during this of course im at work during this hey guys love the cinemassacre crew dam it i missed the stream oh hai its the best game ever cool its 640am in the morning over herehmm im 13 i have all the nintendo consoles james on a livestream finally

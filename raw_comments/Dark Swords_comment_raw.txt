a before after video inaccurate no one who dark sword spams can edit a video so well bahahahaha fuckin disconnected the last guy and r1 spams the whole time fuckin beautiful loved the vid ah the days before the dark sword nerf 030 the parry king has come all these guys are hating on oroboro but they all seem to know his track record pretty well which leads me to believe all these haters like watching his vids once again you haters are being outplayed by this guy if it is entertaining then it is entertaining stop crying and bitching every time someone plays the game in a way you the self proclaimed gods of ds dont like lmao ily brandon hey guys i have a new action rpg it is really addictive lets play its available for android now httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomzonmobshadowofdeathfightinggames and a silver knight shield lol parry the world baby oroboro even r1 spams better than anyone praise the obobo 90 of dark souls player so how much hatemail did you get for this what u playing on ps4 too none of them heard of a parry the artorias set is a joke he fight with the abyss and oro used the dark sword intentional noobs just dont know how to parry the third hit damn he parried the fuck out of you xd quality video well ive played every dark souls game and bloodborne and i have used many different builds through the years one day i decided to be a dick and make a build with this sword pve got too easy and boring so i went to pvp the butthurt from people was hilarious especially people using the dark sword too guess they werent prepared for someone with skill to stoop to their level ahh the memories i used to have an unupgraded derp sword in the inventory just to swap to it after killing a masher and swinging r1 wildly over his corpse to mock him so true haha but when i use the dark sword i like to use the weapon art a lot that edit at 210 was on fucking point though this sword being nerf so badly and totally rubbish now even with 10 thanks software i remember rekking someone with a 0 dark sword with carthus flame arc then i swore to never use this devil of a weapon again ahh the dark sword perfect weapon when youre fresh out of a bloodborne playthrough with the blade of mercy i know im a year late but lmfao hahahha fucking brilliant hahahahahaha i know its dark sword and r1 spam but its funny to see the progress and the skill you obtained in the future but still hilarious video lmao lame ass pvp skills bud id own u every time plus ps4 sux he hates the darksword because you have to spam in dark souls 1 he used the darkmoon buff with power within on the fucking falcion he killer people in 3 hites even worse the problem with the pve is that it never punished you for r1 spam thats why you see it often enough to be anoying i pissed myself not laughing just seeing how skilled this beast is xdddddd thats bull shit xdddd i hate oro ironically still one of my favorites 5 months old and i still die at that ending sometimes the dumbest strategy is the smartest strategy i used the dark sword for some time and damn does it shred but people can still get around it dont spam with this weapon it is even more effective if you know how to use it noice video by the way the sad thing is most of us were like this at some point the fucking parry disconnect at the end got me i always wondered about the hate on meta weapons if theres a weapon that can do tons of damage and stun enemies why would people not use it dark sword wasnt a problem for me tbh not that i used them xp you dont see this kind of skill anymore amazing vid totally made my day lol the end killed me oro in his natural bottom tier element heeey if u guyz nd suls gold i know a super gd glith u cn use to get them fst its onlin here httpstwittercom0b19e01b8743c0321status779267811063410688 njy dark swords 3 i think this video made everyone want to use the dark sword thinking they could do the same thing but it ends the same way this video does xd why do u even have a shield lol really lol lolololol that ending classic love the edit loved the video but most of all loved how it finished xd gratttttzzzzz r1 for the win pretty much all i see these days sadly wow this is the single most skilled montage i think ive ever seen not even a single r2 was thrown that day its hilarious how many people look exactly like that weapon shield and armor look exactly the same oh man the true definition of skill in the diccionary r1 or rb spam that ending was amazing this is disgusting so we can all blame oroboro for this fucking shit can we pure cancer although im a little late commenting on this video this is why poise is not working as intended miyazaki great video btw shit i need to learn how to quit out that fast the same fucking thing you did in dark souls 1 you just swapped the falchion for the dark sword and now broad sword 3 the dark sword needs a buff asap you always get outplayed by op weapons like the wooden hammer the torch the r1s do near to no damage only stuns your opponent for one attack fromsoft plz fix this awful weapon new challenge everytime you hear stop in the song take 1 shot of whiskey pretty much although no one uses it postnerf anymore the few that do are the ones that legitimately used it before his name is orobo brandon that rage quit was to fast to quick thank god that fucker was nerfed this is pain to watch dark swords 3 prepare to spam edition that bit at the end was priceless really the whole video was priceless its literally what i pictured everyone who used the dark sword then was like kids out there like do you even r1 bruh i love the end just the fake rage quit its perfect dark swords 3 prepare to spam edition aka prepare to no poise edition that ending though thats what your dumbass gets the guy at 157 deserved to get r1 spammed honestly people who spam the gotthards rolling l1 are just as bad though its so easy to parry that ending was the best3 ive gave up on ds3 pvp i play offline now if i wanna pvp i got to ds1 or ds2 i think the worst part is that they use the artorias set as if to disgrace the game even more the real dark souls experience the official cancer sword of dark souls out fucking played what a superb demon yeah i am deleting my bkh build after this thanks this comment section is full of plebs who cant beat a basic weapon yall should git gud i cant stop that r1 spam seriously though that hurt to watch but i bet it hurt to play like that even more the dark sword is like oroboros builds cancerous and broken as shit was this supposed to explain how the darksword is broken cuz i am no closer to answering that question after watching this video the tryhard and the butthurtanyone ending is me when i get invaded next to a bonfire r1 r1 r1 r1 the true 4 hit combo its dark souls man parry king got parried ooooh just parry and i hate dark sword users lmao when that cringy effect came 117 the irony in that username out fucking played at the end i didnt know low tier god played dark souls and soon poise will fade and only dark swords remain i cant stop watching this the skill is real lol all the straight swords have the same moveset damn these are some top tier strats i better take notes now is that spelled with a capital r or lower case r the worst part about dark souls 3 is the fact that the dark sword and estoc were some of my favorite weapons in dark souls now ill just feel scummy if i try to use them oh lord this is amazing this video sums up all dark souls 3 pvp has to offer lol the end this was so good the only counter to r1 spam r2 spam this is a masterpiece found soneone that fuck up your shitty skill f12 quit lel nice oro that rappresent nicely the 89 of dark souls 23 community fucking greatness hits the nail on the head for the most cancerous noob weapon and the people that use it only thing i hate more than dark sword r1 spammers is cool kids who think its fun to invade sl like 40 or something with end game gear these kinds of people are a plague upon the dark souls community haha flux pavilion this is some old shit m8 noob cosplay almost complete still needs invisi roll ring and black knight shield hitlerpeople than heals when you drink all at first momentmiyazaki dark sword hue hue hue i push dark sword users shit in with my simple caestus and my trusty old gundyrs halberd if im getting ganked just charge at them most of them are too scrub to actually dodge the attack its remarkably hard to dodge that finishing hit that being said when its a two on one dark sword fest its a complete nightmare ive had ganks where i show up to a sunbro and a host who then gets a darkmoon through concord with the host and the darkmoon using dark sword needless to say there really wasnt anything i could do weapon needs a severe damage nerf asap your mom is shit r2 covered in cobwebs the way to not be called a noob for using overpowered weapons is duel wielding broken ladles i hate this so bad i can hardly bare to watch it oroboro is best dueler 4 eva dudes this was clearly a piss take hes obviously making fun of r1 and parry spamming with the classic disconnect at the end sadly it is also rather effective lighten up yall that tune with this vid haha the ending killed me lol xd i cant stop laughing at the r1 trades are people that determined to click r1 when the introductory cinematic for dark souls 1 mentioned gwyn and his mighty bolts they were actually dark swords im confused is this oroboro complaining about a noskillrequired spamthesamemove build have to admit that the dark sword is made to do the r1 spam i really like the appearance of the sword and also its fluid moveset but sadly i feel shame to use it since it is considered to be too op which i totally agree i wish they nerf it in some way so i can use it without getting mad at thank you for explaining how op this sword is and hopefully bandai namko will do somethign about it so whats so special about the dark sword that so many people use it everyone who spams r1 except obobobo shall get invaded by smough and ornstein then the ceastus parry was discovered sadly this tactic still works because noobs dont releize you can counter the r1 spam with l2 spam if you have a proper parry weapon its like straight sword hollows but with a cooler looking sword less op than your dmb sellswords i craii everytiem buff it with dmb and its even dirtier xddd this is funny thanks for creating every fucking build in this game oroboro pls feiend me on ps pls btw my ds3 name is poop i find myself doing this too everyone is using this piece of trash weapon so im going to punish them 1 by 1 until they stop wait is parrying considered to be spam heres an adept guide to counter dark swords what youll need hornet ring shield preferably small a brain l2 button strategy when a dork sword user sees easy pickings a very known fact is that all cognitive functions shut off and all they know how to do is press r1 and square when the dark sword user approaches be ready to press your l2 lure the dork sword user into false security by letting it hit you twice after the second initial hit press your l2 button you should see the player character of your opponents arm twist behind its back and the character be stunned for about 2 seconds in this time walk up to him and press r1 this should cleave off about half to all the users health if it only cleaves off half then stay calm you can go to the persons back to initiate another critical which should to just as much damage if they decide to use an orange flask looking item known as the estus flask washing pole dark sword will be no problem from software need to nerf the following weapons dark sword estoc and dragon slayer great axe comment if you agree this weapon disgusts me the irony is that if someone can do that like the end of the video they should have the skills to be a legit pvper i guess the one thing that makes this sword even is that is very easy to parry that ending where you quit i do that shit all the time before i die or get parried it works this is way better than dagger quick step now thats how we should play let me gues the r1 song realy cool edited the video nice cuts perfect to the beat the name of the song in the description would be the final touch what if someone used this weapon and didnt only r1 spam well someones being facetious welcome to the video of why you fucking parry brought to you by peeve new and exciting stuff ill never look at pvp the same way youve shown me the error of my ways ooooooooooooo that highspeed menu quit at the end there umnmmmmm literally the weapon used by every fucking casual in existence remember folks ironically using the dark sword is still using the dark sword git gud a good ol fugs combo usually sorts out the dark swords i play on pc but that looked all too familiar to me i think you have a doppelganger or 500 playing on steam watching this gave me stage 4 cancer well this video does highlight some of the big flaws with ds3 like there really should not be a longer recovery time on parries r1 maching into someones shield should drain your stamina much faster then theirs consecutively using r1 should increase its stamina cost for each swing and so forth lol dark sword users are so trash power up the bass cannon that rage quit tho xd you have to be skilled to do dark souls pvp hey oroboro big fan and had idea and wanted to if you can make it happen gwyndolyn build great scythecorvian scythe maybe spear life hunt scythe great heavy soul spear homing crystal soulmass like i said its an idea so tweak it as need be keep up the awesome work this is little different from how you normally play lol at the end thats how all my opponents end up wow ur so gud how to git gud next vid jesus you really pulled up the best of your skill havent you i cant stop from great gatsby incomparable movie the sheer irony of this video is refreshing git gud and learn to parry the dark sword is fine hypocrite the video q all the angry people in the comment make me want to use this sword lmao its at the point where onlyafro is trying to fix the pvp community just let that sink in the meta that oroboro is creating is too cancerous for the father of the father of giants r1 mash souls d this would explain why i keep seeing dark sword users in pvp constantly damn dat skill dark sword needs to be buffed imo someone with a fugs did a trade with me and he ended up doing slightly more damage than me seemed a bit unfair dark swords 1 prepare to zwei edition dark swords 2 scholar of the first hex dark swords 3 dark swords reloaded lol those intentionally bad editing skills lol that is just the most accurate representation i have ever seen especially the ending i feel you bro everytime i see someone using this i can only imagine the amount of fun those kids have when they smash r1 till their finger bleeds im not sure whats worse how fucked the dark sword is or how shit 90 of the players oro invades are hey at least they took out poise right bestmoveeverfromsoft its so ironic when oro makes fun of r1 spams i love whenever i meet a dark sword user in dark souls 3 its a guaranted win for me that ending i spit out all my coffee over my phone gg man that moment when youre fucking someone up and they pull out the dark sword c fucking cancer love the satire in this it makes me wanna not play this game anymore may the largest health bar win just use thrust attacks againt the dark sword not much more you can do the ending says it all eh dark sword is trash literally the easiest parry ever hi oro maybe you can direct me to the right video if youve commented elsewhere but is this vid summing up how you feel about pvp at present what about zweihander dude i thought this video was hilarious keep it up oro i thought they said cancer was not contagious this is the funniest shit ive seen in a long while wat weapob iz he usin in th vido an wat attak is thiz ahhh the good ol not use a fucking ridiculous weapon tactic games broke in favor of str weapons and the pvp is grossly indulging new players to feel accomplished with little skill cant complain about the pve though and people say you cant spam in the souls games literally a spot on dark sword user inpersination lol how come some of your dark souls 3 videos the text is all english and other times its all what looks like japanese the end haha perfect last guy obviously a hacker when they poise break do you have to left stick into them to do the critical had another player do that bs coward move of disconnecting before he died i laughed so hard cause he also thought he was good wot is that infusion the average scrub wow you are hypocritical you run around with spin to win weapons and fume knight greatsword before nerf those are way less skilled than the dark sword once comboparry kills your opponent r1r1r1r1r1r1guy diesr1r1r1r1r1internal monologuer1r1r1r1r1r1r1 fucking gold dark swords 3 is the best game next to estocs adventure hahahahhaa the fucking other artorias with the dark swordsilver knight shield lmao the rage quit at the end subbed i still dont get what the big deal is i havent found dark swords nor estocs to be that bad at all as long as you use a weapon that can out reach them halberds glaives washing pole lothric long spear ugss like the astora gs or profaned gs just outreach andor outhyper armor them dont be a predictable idiot dont just run into their attacks and let them spam on you dont panic roll just git gud idk what else to say if you dont suck there are plenty of ways to counter any given weapon in the game whats funny is it works both ways the reactions of streamers ive seen lose to a dark sword user who actually uses the r2 sometimes or swings only twice so the parry on the 3rd hit whiffs hilarious outplayed by guts at the end lol that ending you know it kills me to see one of my favorite weapons in dark souls 1 is now a spammy drakesword 30 seeing how most people play this game this is the most fun pvp video ive seen more than 150 weapons weapon arts magic and everything but no big shield and dark sword for days i used heavy dark sword but i used l1s a lot i despise the scum that slander dark sword with r1 build they must all parrish also lovely l1 animation heed my word r1 dark sworders i will hunt you down and chop off that finger you use for r1 spam i swear to god every time i invade i either get a chugger a dark sword user a estoc spammer or a rage quitter or a dishonorable peace of shit that kills you while youre in bow animation for a fair duel so which is worse darkmoon buffed sharp infused estoc or dark sword omg the fucking end was great doesnt change much from that darkmoon scimitar spam eh so oro youre telling me you cant stop god i want to face oro so bad even though i might get rekt the ending totally makes it haha so how is this any different from your dmb falchion lol that ending dark swords 3 prepare your anus edition those first two fights caused me physical pain to watch r1 spam is a plague on the dark souls community miyazaki fix it that ending xd so whats so broken about the dark sword is it just impossible to parry cuz i like never dont get parried if i accidentally throw out more than one r1 with every other weapon thats why i never understood how r1 spam was ever a viable strat do you coach pls teach me how to git gud at dark swrods 3 i keep loosing to some hacker invader called yellowfinger obororo help pls two girls one cup is cleaner than this shit i still fail to see why the dark sword in particular is op everyone whines about it but i dont die to it any more than any other straight sword wow this is a pretty good montage cool weapon too this is the best video youve made oroboro damn you could tell oro got killed by a dark sword and made this out of pure buttfrustration oh look darksouls 3 in a nutshell you nailed the hell outta it oro i dont really know if i should like it or dislike hm mother fuckers cant parry lol dark sword users i dare you lol that ending made me cringe i dont know whether to laugh or cry to be honest i always have a sunlight sword in my possession to counter the r1 spamming plague whenever i see someone using an estoc or a dark sword i like to show them how boring they are by doing exactly what they are doing omg oro quit the game xd that ending was pure mlg beautifully hilarious xd i like the part where he pressed r1 xd oroboro i thought you were good at pvp qq stop using op weapons and spam attacks dont gang plz i wanna see actual skill and just pure whip ass not dishonorable cheap shit man its the whole reason i subbed to you d lol oroboro taking shots at r1 spamming that is rich kappa gr8 b8 m8 i cant believe it r1boro maked a video about the r1 spamand my english is very potato d i love this so much oh it feels so bad to watch this video haha i hope wooti kills you for this sit down yall story time before today i had never used a dark sword or any straight sword in ds3 pvp before i was in the mood for a cosplay though so i gave a darkwraith cosplay a whirl dark set dark hand iron flesh to mimic their stupid poise and an uninfused dark sword 9 at 4040 str and dex my first two duels were against lone hosts the first soundly beat me i got parried like a scrub the second barely beat me again with a parry after that i got summoned into a fight club i went 50 only one person i think the second was able to come close to beating me when you have even the slightest semblance of skill and dont just mash like an idiot people just melt anyway by the time my sixth opponent stepped up to the meat grinder i decided nah all of you deserve better than this i waved goodbye and honorably offered myself to the only truly unpatchable meta in dark souls gravity oro you fucking scum bag lol that ending though i love you so much this is one major issue in dks3 i keep encountering i can feel the tumors already he doing a dead on impression of dark sword r1 mashers lmfao too much skill that last guy was obviously hacking god these players are trash 120 really please tell me thats gonna get patched at least are there anymore hiding inside rockwalls exploit spots oroboro i hope one day we meat in the game i want to test my metal against you haha if that comes i will say gg in advance told eveyone ds3 would have flaws and super op weapons and shit but na i dunno jack shit aparently those interested in this video

to press r1 edition that was awesome oroboro i love how brandon gave up with the r1 overlays halfway through out skilled out monuvered fukc yeah xd unsubbed yep best pvp in the series right here i would like to personally thank obobobo ever since that stream all im invaded by is dark sword r1 spammers no buff what are you casul great stuff from software announced that poise is working as intended so theres going to be no counter to this sort of play no matter how buff you are youre going to get slapped around like this at every turn enjoy the new meta guys isnt sunlight straight sword better in brightest day in blackest night no dark sword shall escape my sight let those who worship dark swords might beware my power the parrys might this vdeo gave me cancer at which place is he at 214 this my friends this is a comical genius in action im sure itll be nerfed to the ground the question is when from dansgame oroboro making fun of the r1 spam ahahahahahah dark souls 3 r1 simulator 2016 i cant stop laughing from that ending funniest shit ive seen by you in a minute carthus straight sword dark moon blade new oro meta haha good pvp video glad to finally see some real skill nowadays the fuckin ending omg i love you man xd am i the only one who doesnt spam the dark sword and use r2s and weapon arts like i dont even use the weapon anymore cause of the stigma best pvp video ever true display of skill r1 mastery for our eyes lmao the end was the best omg that quit to dashboard at the end priceless when i first got the dark sword i used it all the damn time still do but it made me sad as hell when i found out people hate on dark sword users also whats your endurance level this is top tier playing right here guys cream de la cream the highest possible level of dark souls gaming perfection it gets no better people not even jesus could play dark souls better than this the irony here is that this video isnt actually ironic uninstall that ending though why is dark sword so scummy can someone explain to me please oro you should make a video where you use any weapon of your choice but you cant hit r1 not even to riposte worthless undead unfit even to be ash its so easy to parry but people just dont get it this was hilairious you are a terrible human being perfect song dark sword is easy as fuck to parry whats your problem it was worth the pain oro so much stun v this is the best thing ive ever seen in my life w atching this live was even better lmao oroboro you rage quit at the end lol im surprise you didnt do it to me brandon but that parry tho hey oro did u know that u can combine lorains greatsword and lothrics straight sword into a single sword when u place all the lord items on their thrones parry spammer obobobo pogchamp this sword is a crazy wepon i like how only 1 person even tried to parry the community is brain dead lol man that ending out fucking played dark sword is the new falchion i hope this is satire because the proliferation of this dark sword is broken op crap is getting on my nerves because it most definitely is not you also cannot be stun locked with a dark sword everyone in this video that dies to the r1 spam is just a pvp noob you can roll after the first hit and roll completely out of the attacks you get hit once or twice at the most if youre doing it right you can also parry the living daylights out of this type of play i like your stuff oroboro and watch you on twitch sometimes as well but even if this video is just a joke most people that see this will believe that you are pointing out that the dark sword is broken and op and the proliferation of the lie will continue i guess thats what you want though right makes pvp a lot easier when you run into dark sword r1 spammers lol lmao that ending gg brandon your vida a great why oro why i have no problem with people who play like that its a legit way to play a game and not the most effective straitswords katanas estoc cant do shit agains weapons with hyperarmor and i use just a flamberge not some fume ugs just trade and spammer will die after eating a couple of counter hits these players are not a problem at all actually i have less respect for parry kings with caestus and big axe what a boring opponents the description xd oro but spam is that you favorite stratege always og ds1 oroboro strat right here nice to see youre going back to your roots lmao people so upset by this weapon just parry maybe isnt that hard lmao oh my god from please fix poise need more hornet ring that ring swap thought 225 w8 you get banned for rage quitting right lol this is lame but chasing someone with your washing pole and repeatedly do a charging strike isnt gg fam xd i still cant wrap my head around how and why laggy bs fishy ds1 pvp still remains the most fun to play that sword just needs to be fucked into the ground its literally on every shitter paired with the fallen knight set if only poise was actually a thing in this game other players wouldnt have to deal with this bullshit this is how people plays nowdays but i have perseverance perseverance erryday oroboro sadly this is me and i wanna git gud but i suck and dont know how but still i love you and your videos and content 3 so keep up the good work lf someone to give me a crystal sage rapier lol gt is imaaccid3nt lol the ending good fucking video and i love you oroboro complete scumbag youre welcome for the dislike the following video can be with whips hahahaha you piece of shit brandon never change i used to be an r1 spammer like you then i took a parry to the knee montage parodies are back this is beyond beautiful you could say brandon sold his souls i prefer the any other weapon how disguting that skilled parry i still prefer anri straight sword with 40 luck 60 faith lightning blade deep protection and sacred oath works quite well with lingering dragon crest ring 2 gets about 750 ar tho the damage is split coulda fucking sworn they said they increased the stamina cost on the dark sword cough new falchion oh its the darksword and it doesnt have to be buffed by dmb thats good to know never gonna play online again that rage quit at the end lol its seems to me someone had a bad day at the office god that ending was priceless that ending lol and everyone thought mlg videos were dead thats why we need poise in this fucking gamefrom software fucked up pvp oro will never be the parry king only the r1 king the king of scrubs no oro no why you run i really want dark souls 3 but it costs money fuck weird to think obobo would ever complain about r1s he forgets his roots i used to just use a straight sword but i got bored of doing that so ive tried using a bunch of different stuff just to stay interested that last parry at the endhacker confirmed he couldnt have possibly parried such a high level strategy we need more videos like this just showing how stupid people look when they claim to be good when using tactics like this its just like the people that think theyre good when the entire match they spammed parry with their 1shot build litearlly dark sword and parry is all this shitty game has become dark swords arent that strong all you have to do is git gud redditors actually believe this i love the hello oroboro does also dat dark sword meta its gotta go but i guess they just cant stop parry lol this gave me fucking cancer the r1 is the most op weapon in the game i think the only thing more broken in this game than the dark sword is small shield parries you should seriously not be able to successfully land a parry every time without fail after facetanking two hits and parrying before the third fucking dumb shit fuck if only poise existed so heavy weapons could make dorksword users sit the fuck down yes i love this omg i died with the rage quit at the end its like dks1 all over again the r1 spam king is back cancer of the community dark sword users lol i love that exit at the end this song has thoroughly reminded me of the great gatsby wonderful video let me touch you with my sword bro its not gay man were bros lol magnificently disgusting wish i was this good this weapon is cancer lol more proof that ds 3 has some serious balance issues for pvp between this weapon greatshield meta and the estoc poise being useless now and magic being too slow to hit shit i am only doing pve and doing my pvp in ds 21 spam that r1 it takes mad skill edit also ds 3 seems to have had a hacker problem from day 1 i was about to say before the video even started that all oroboro is capable of doing is r1 spamming and buffing in pvp this video just proves my point not the buffing bit though please dont make people think this weapon is actually viable omg that endingfinesse that ending seriously i loved every bit of soul you lost playing like this p cant beat em join emright brandon my only problem with the dark sword is the endurence cost i have to get 30 endurence to be able to gives around 15 r1 attacks thats embarrassing my how the mighty have fallen to using scrub builds disliked unsub reported for false advertising and changing meta kappa will oros arsenal return whenever someone does this to me i run away across the map pull out my pharis black bow hawk ring feathered arrows and obscuring ring then i shoot them in the face while they try to summon a phantom to gank with hahahahaha the skill hahaahahha nice video oroboro d and where did poise go not only the dark sword every straight sword in this game needs a serious nerfdown either they need to consume more stamina per swing or get their rations scaled down because what the actual fuck from also the estoc because its still as broken as my pride was when i had to crush shit with my hands to unclog a toilet true story the ending xd xd eh i like the carthus curved sword better its just as spammable but has ridiculous range for catching people rolling away and an actual fun moveset this is why the game needs real poise and in the end oro could never truly become one of them hes too pure for this darks souls 3 pvp in a nutshell r1 spams for days i dont get it whats so bad about dark swords i hate these people so much i see you played ssx oro you did the same thing in ds1 and now you are doing a troll video abaut this i blinked and almost missed the ending i hope players start playing like this cos easy when for the competence spacers and publishers this is your build brandon r1 for days who else was at the stream dark sword is pure cancer the wya u landed that r1 was insane then that next r1 holy shit man ur really good this is pvp gotta love the lack of poise did they remove the 2 hit and then parry trick lol i have been seeing that tactic with the dark sword through all pvp playthroughs it puzzles were they being serious or trolling all long swords are broken but good god the dark sword is the worst did you at least say you were sorry at the end of every win havent you received any hatemail so far this is so fucking perfect disconnected from the host its a shame that the dark sword is associated with casuls and scrubs lets try to cleanse the dark sword of this stigma i have to say the song is good d people play like this and then get bored of pvp go on reddit then complain about how linear dark souls 3 pvp or how overpowered weapons and gear are whenever they get outplayed i dont understand the appeal to such a boooring playstyle r2 what are you casual i liked the part where u pressed r1 this build shouldve used the ring that increases damage by r1 spamming its funny cause it works also what weapon was the host at 210 using people with dark sword builds are what made me good at parrying lol pure skill the dark sword is the hardest weapon in the game to use bad ass challenge run this video is dark sword users in a nutshell i was using that sword before it became so infamous in ds3 but never like that i think ill stick to lothrics holy sword now even if i only hit for 130 an r1 at sl 120 why is it that everyone uses the black knight shield again drake sword users dont invade you need 3 summons and need to be a blue sentinel also they use the shield of want spot the difference a b c d e f g h i j k l m n dark sword q r s t u v w x y z now that oro has made a video it will finally get buffed then people will realize the sunsword has the same ar and a buff reminds me of when i first played pvp in a souls game i was that guy in dark souls 2 you know that guy resonant weapon santiers full havel affinity 2 avelyns i thought i was the shit until i found out i was just shit oh lord xd this video is amazing ragequit at the end just beautiful the only way to fix this is to reimplement poise every other souls game would not let this shit slide minus falchion because they had a bigger weapon and enough armor to take the hits omg i was in this video that fucking ending perfect representation of every dark souls cancer ever oro this video was so cancerous i actually cant tell if i should like or dislike it this video physically hurts me good job though oro the meta in its purest form that ending literally 90 of the community does that shit lol more infuriating then the actual sword that ending though xd thia sword need to be nerfed make it cost more stam something based obus god i hope this helps all the r1 junkies see the error of their ways that rage quit at the end fucking killed me pure fucking gold lol lol love this is total r1 mash some times let them hit you twice and then parry its that easy trust me host of embers relentlessswords hides in the corner so the lore is once artorias got corrupted he succumbed to popular pvp trends and used a dark sword forever condemning himself to the abyss hahaha every dark souls 3 player ever in pvp thats a noob the dark sword is peaceful its users kind dmb dark sword gotthard tb fuck them all i love it when oroboro hollows the fuck out and becomes what he hates dont nerf the dark sword nerf brandon lol you joined the dark side but the havelyn brotherhood will hunt you down saw the title saw the first minute saw the memes didnt realize that this wasnt an onlyafro video until the end obobobo is afro confirmed oro i dont have the game yet wanna tell me why the dark sword is so hated its meta as hell just r1s low stamina costs or something but trust me i remember how smart you are and how you can make everyone look so stupid like this but not everyone though right oros on ps4 fuck i dont criticize your use of the dark sword despite how clearly overpowered it is but the combat logging is the behavior of a petulant child are you really making these videos now am i gonna have to come spank you again wait youre on ps4 thats it im done playing run awayyyyyyyy hes a beast i like the part where you press r1 i havent played dark souls 3 yet but from what i see this dark sword looks like a new drake sword such a shame its one of the if not the best looking 1h sword imo atleast ds3 requires no skill at all at least in ds2 you can punish those heavy weapons or r1 spammings any way you could help me git gud im a filthy casul and need help brandon please keep being who you are you beautiful sumbitch how deep is your r1 embedded into your controller after this video bobobobo the meme sword has reached another level even tho immersion had been broken many times durkng this amazing memetage legit cannot wait for this to get patched and deleted from the game not even falchion is this obnoxious and r1 spammy i saw the title and saw the dark sword all i thought was noooooooooooo wait its actually that easy to win with this sword that ending lol r110 d that ending xd r1 only button confirmed this was one of my favorite weapons in dark souls 1 and it sucked now its come back and its good and i cant even use it without people trying to burn me at the cross for using an op weapon only scrubs use fair and balanced feature in the game s r1spam is the best spam extremely high quality pvp content here folks get it while its dark needs more wubs wubs for a moment there i thought i was watching an onlyafro video at least it wasnt an estoc fucks sake fromsoft bring back poise from dark souls 1 and this is why we need poise back that ending just made the video hilarious shit d since when did this channel turn into onlyafro best song for this sempi lol not much different than your previous souls builds have you gotten any hate mail in ds3 seems like balanced and skillful gameplay as always the worst thing about this shit weapon is its ridiculous phantom range dark swords 3 scholar of the second sin sick montage bro nice reaction time at the end to avoid the riposte if you look closely you can see he only pressed r1 what sword is that the edgetorias armor makes it perfect i wish the dark sword wasnt a spam r1 weapon i use it because it was the coolest looking sword in ds1 with a silly spin now its a meme fantastic video btw the rage quit i only have 1 hand and an index finger so am i ok to r1 spam thats why we need poise please from 007 to 015 is the perfect example of poise in this game obobobo with those mlg editing skills wooti pull the plug i am proud to have watched this masterpiece come together poise who wants that the end is best when they onehand the dark sword and hit the parry just right i lost it at that parry spam pure skill lmaoo all oroboro does is spam r1 what a dweeb how to find r1 i have mouse the ending is legendary i dont really get this isnt there a systems in ds3 that after 2 hits recieved you can dodge away as you get priority in recovery to prevent stunlock r1 so the sword isnt op people are just bad players those r1 are pretty hilarious on your channel wtf you let your 3 year old cousin play gank souls 3 i can parry after second hit oro or does the dead angle stop me on the upside thanks for putting this out it ensures a handy supply of complete retards without a single original bone in their body who will try it perfect for parrying practice enjoyed the music nice vid would not mind a match with ya but pls leave dark sword at home or being it xd the end is too good accurate representation of dark sword users my girlfriend was upset by how hard i laughed at the end the first weapon i used in pvp was the dark sword with a full darkwraith cosplay ya know i always went for the 12 combo then mixed in some battle arts r2s stuff until i fought my first draksword user who showed me that if you r1 spam with it the next few fights i just spammed r1 until they died i felt dirty now im a clean man sure would be nice if we have some poise oroboro are you tired of people comparing to this cancer to how you played dark souls yet its took soo many invasions yesterday for someone to party him it was funny one of your best videos keep it up filthy casual r1 spammer 3 you didnt even try with this video did you i laughed as soon as i heard flux pavilion lol this is what happens in dark souls when there is no more poise turn it back on please i guess i can see why theres hate for the dark sword ive used it exclusively cus it scaled with faith for my build and i only swing 12 times at most because im not an idiot who loves swords in their chest i mostly just parry and roll punish am i not cancer yet guis ttthat disconnect was the best gg3 r1r1r1r1r1 wow exactly 114 dark sword users watched this video was waiting for this xd r2 is an ancient civilization waiting to be rediscovered that rage quit lol i think my iq just dropped 10 points aaaahhhh i love the ending haha ha hahahah out fucking played that killed me what is r1 ive played ds3 for a few hundred hours now but i still dont get what is r1 supposed to be worst souls game yet didnt you do the same thing in ds1 with the falchion lol thats some top tier shit and the speed you quit the game after that parry at the end impressive you should do an estoc vs dark sword with peeve that rage quit at the end lol with the fading of the first flame r2 has long been forgotten only ashes remain lol there was someone with the exact same weapon and shield as him out fucking played hahahaha oh my god thats the funniest shit ever that lens flare effect is the cherry on this video 103 perfectly fitting music nice guts cosplay that last clip 109 hours played and i just recently picked this up easy mode unlocked the bit at the end the end of this video is fcking amazing please from make poise a thing please become ultrapro combine dark sword with avelyn xd usd a dark sword and a estoc is super meta lol slash poke and repeat compared to your normal darkmoon blade buffed katana running r1s this is actually some pretty quality content the age of spam im so glad i got to witness this live after i got over the initial shock of see said dank sword and understood what was happening of course you just went full hollow never go full hollow i love that little save quit at then end lol pretty damn accurate sadly needs more proper bow to make it seem like youre really pleased with yourself the sad thing is i loved this weapon in dark souls for its cool looking uppercut r2 and was looking forward to using it on a strength build i actually use the dark sword without the mindless r1 spam that r1 spam its beautiful more like parry parry parry parry parry parry pro tip for coming up vs short sword r1 unlock this is like all my invasions 3 its a good thing i adapted to this meta the skill in this video was amazing so is it worth it to have a dark sword switch or should we all just git gud this made me cry tt i dont get why people complain about a weapon in the fucking game if you lose to someone who only presses r1 then you fucking suck at pvp and shouldnt be doing it if you get hit twice and they swing a third time you can parry it 100 of the time if you just spam parry its funny because your build in ds1 have the same mechanics awesome montage how can this many people not no how to parry its really not that hard people was this the oroboro version of a dark souls 3 challenge run pvp r1 only speed run no estus despite my just cheesing people with a 10 halberd this is officially worse than the halberd meta nerf that edit xd nice video m8 1010 would r1 again the hosts name at 118 is relentlessswords no closeup on the name this is why onlyafro is the superior strain of cancer the r1 challenge beat ds3 only pressing r1 no moving rolling etc etc etc allowed only r1 wow absolutely no skill ur so salty to delte ur shite chanel holy fuck oro this shit is so good d fucking gold this is part of the problem brandon not the solution i cant stop laughing hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha this was too good glad that i was watching this shit live that moment when you can quit the game faster than yami can ringswap so oro whats the dealio with poise is it just not turned on there has to be a fucking explanation for this shit dunno what it is but i am sorta sensing a subtle ongoing pattern in this video i never can get myself to use r1 more than twice i assume they are better than 90 of people are heheh only arti have rights to use the dark sword not gonna lie this video is exactly how i feel when i spam r1 with dark sword fucking unstoppable thnk u from for great balanced pvp i love to fight dark sword users they are all sooooo bad what shield is that i love this ironic touch nice parody bro keep up the good work i dont want poise back talkin ahh that ending lol bearer of the dark sword seek r1 spam longer more powerful spam seek the stunlock for that is the only way lest you actually resort to a skillbased weapon save us 108 update or dlc lol that ending though a true representation of how people play now since the dark sword is too good and doesnt give much of a window to punish it it really needs a nerf even if it is just slowing it down to be the slowest swinging straight sword out there it would help it not be op well atleast they let me practice my parrying skills is the parry open for dark sworda broken much lensflare very wow atorias without his great sword be like r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 that ending this video is a mandatory multiple time in a row watch my friend loves this weapon he uses the whole move set and wont stop bitching about the r1 spam they need to nerf it i want to hear his tears and sadness the baked snake here this turned out great music is perfect for it orobobro is this the day on which obobobo finally becomes a obobobo confirmed for iron pineapples successor why i stopped pvp before i really started imbalance is way to much coupled with the complete lack of skill by players im punished for being good while idiots just spam one button and win ive actually kind if gone off the games they need a reboot and look at removing the rolling mechanic as well theres nothing worse than to be killed with the r1 spam the lack of set up parries is disturbing lol that lens flare every time i heard dark sword is op i imagine they were the kind of person who spams r1 themselves while theyre getting attacked hoping to get in an attack or trade like 90 of the people in the video basically just confirm it dark sword is op on complete shitters amazing the only way this could be better is with more mlg and monster logos thank you oro artorias with a dark sword much kek top lel why do people like this game so much lol oroboro you invaded me and my friends yesterday sorry for the 1v3 wow nice job brandon now people are going to copy this bui oh wait teach me haha oh a fucking lucky parry im ragequiting 3 r1 mash 3 at least if they can do it with a whip full artorias and a dark squord pretty average i would say x oroboro this stream yesterday was cash money keep up that swagger yo the ending had me crying thanks for the cancer holy shit that end though xddd hahahahahahaha okay this was awesome oroboro is deliberately playing bad and showing that even the dumbest noob alive with zero skill or combat sense can still murder people using this overused and completely asinine playstyle with the fucking dark sword it is overpowered that thing deals more damage than my 10 heavy cathedral greatsword at 40 strength but swings like a regular straight sword just goes to show what this game has degraded into and that casuals dont get punished for being bad nearly as much as they should also lol at the end that invader using the exact build and playstyle as you except you are only doing it for lulz and he was probably being totally serious thats fucking gold its like 1 vengarl havel with a greatsword in one hand and a greatshield in the other from ds2 meeting another cant wait to see all the nooby shits that use dark sword to watch this video so they can realize what an embarrassment they are as a gamer great now youre encouraging them guy named relentlessswords gets killed by a relentless sword justice refined dank sword 10 scales higher with dex so 3040 strdex and 40 faith use lightning blade or dmb if youve gotten it and its ar jumps to 700 love it haha brandon joined the cancer for a day oroboro are you bored or something lol is this really the meta in pvp cmon guys youre making me sad whats his name that weapon i want to get off mr bones wild ride watching this live was way better i really hoped you would have put the one where the guy was hiding on the broken staircase before the dungeon it pains me to watch this nice video dude sad about the bland radio music inflicting your video that stamina usage though its good to know youre still capable of shitposting thats just fucking beautiful and disgusting at the same time thank you for that i think the ending was absolutely brilliant btw omg my eyes i cant o they hurt sooooooooooo much wow not one havel monster with his great shield and dark sword guess i am just lucky lol this is the only dark souls 3 video that matters right now whoaa look at the skillz you forgot to use a great shield tsk tsk behold the average dark sword user lmfao disconnect during parry thats my signature trick used to do it all the time in bloodborne when poise says im your friend then bolts at any sign of danger dark swords 3 only r1s remain i love how everyone uses that exact build in pvp oh look at me im artorias but im not gud enough to use his sword oh look dark souls 1 brandon is back this made me laugh way too much this makes me wonder are the dark sword users the new havels for you and what i mean by that is in dark souls 2 every time you faced some adorable guy wielding full havels and an greatsword most of the time you knew it was gonna be a funny easy little fight oh yeah i remember artorias having a dark sword he was using it in sifs 3rd endind when you are an experimented player i think you can win a pvp battle without a noob weapon ho shit that ending lol this was a perfect display of pvp especially the last clip most people spam and a few parry that shit lmfao oro that stream last night gave me a tumor this is the reason why i gave up playing ds3 pvp i cant stop hitting r1 i think you forgot to accidentally kick first video i thumb up from obo you should have used darkmoonblade this perfectly sums up the majority of pvp right now dark souls 3 r1 edition nice video reminds me of when the red iron twinblades were unbeatable faith magic was king and a broken santiers spear made you a god xd i know this video was made as a joke though why not go out and disprove the stigma instead of feeding it i mean youve got the skills to be good with the dark sword so why not show them off oroboro next time pad modded for dark sword has only r1 button five r1 buttons ornstein smough and artorias dark sword gank squad please cancer10 thumbs up that pointing down gesture is so funny the power of irony is high my son that ending fucking destroyed me 1010 because there is never enough r1s instead of hearing i cant stop i keep hearing i pressed r it somehow makes it better the ending lmao this sword is more broken than the estoc seriously at least an estoc is easy to dodge and parry and you can at least survive a hit from an estoc this sword is always so stupidly strong so has anyone else just given up on ds3 really feels like fs doesnt care anymore i trusted you bobo of course it had to be with full artorias armour too classic oroboro confirmed new memelord cant stop laughing at the end lol rage quits when paired xd simply beautiful the stamina game is too real holy shit this guy should join faze dark souls 13 weapon level of cancer dark souls 1 darkmoon falcon dark souls 2 chaos blade and dark souls 3 dark blade it just keep getting fucking worse the song cant stop by infected mushroom should be in your next video regardless of context fucking hell do people not know where the l2 button is the out fucking played text made me lose my shit xd why oro would you join them in this buffoonery dark sword deals more damage than my fume ultra greatsword10 with a pure str build feelsbadman ds3 pvp in a nutshell well yeah do you even vaati bro he clearly replaced his greatsword with a dark sword of the darkwraiths he was fighting through the abyss because he realized their r1 spam was faster and more skillful its right there in the lore casul the editing is off the charts obobobo i hope you didnt actually quit out at the end video joke or not id be kinda peeved but damn man this weapon was my personal baby in dark souls 1 and they had to ruin it like this used to be decently hard to get and i had this great setup using the 2h moveset where id do a nohornet backstab into 2hr2 to catch their knockdown wakeup frames and now its just this overpowered garbage holy shit ive never seen such an large amount of skill youve even surpassed yami tamashi man but seriously this video is quite cancerous but in a fun and entertainig way d poise is working as intended from software im too lazy to even farm for a dark sword my soul it hurts from witnessing this godlike strength dark souls 3 is probably the best game in the franchise very similar to demons souls awesome like skyrim without real dragons ign 420 oh look finally a good funny video by oroboro oroboro let me sing you the song of my people r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 i didnt think you would actually make a video out of this not a single r2 was pressed that day at least he isnt using the cheesy as fuck gottard swords i need to git gud now that i see my dark sword r1 competition i love your stuff man but this video gave me a tumor thanks bloodborne the armor was a nice touch i have trouble with this build so i press r1 repeatedly correct i cant seem to do it i mean after the 3rd r1 my body just automatically rockets itself towards the nearest tub of bleach i dont get it why do people bitch about this weapon lol this video is perfect good job obobobo you gotta winner build please i laughed my ass off watching this you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a filthy casual this is so good the ending was fantastic damn that r1 spamming skill and i love that fairplay by rage quite after getting parried you da best obobo holy shit did you see the way he pressed r1 holy crap you are amazing brandon please link to your mugen build fucking flux pavillion that takes me back cancerous vid oro gj can we now get some good ones like dancing in the moonlight or oros arsenal funny that your best uploads are on the worst souls game aswel dark sword op no counter i dont know if i can handle this weapon im not that skilled could you stop please these fights like when a puppy attacks its own reflection smacks its face gets pissed then keeps doing it over and over go get an ct scan brandon this gameplay may have given you a tumor please make more videos without your voice in them the problem with scrub sword and estoc is how difficult they are to setup parry using shield block parry i think it has something to do with latency because some other weapons are doable this way these two are just too fast while the dark sword is bad it isnt as broken as the estoc 0155 that sync with the music i remember when artorias set always meant a kid with trainer probably with infinite hp and random unupgraded weapons dark swords is the best noob weapon never and bestock too i think he cant stop its funny how everyone is laughing at the ending and im just here like cool anyways nice vid oro except for the ya know dick sword finally a look through one of the pros point of views ive been wondering how to pull this off shouldve had an estoc in the left hand i need a shower that disconnect sit down son i think its about time we talked about that dark sword the ending was the best thing ive ever seen brandon april fools was last month brandon brandon the legendary r1 bloodboner build that fuckin ending though i dont think ive ever laughed that hard at one of your videos brandon 10 out of friggin 10 ahhhh a visit from your old friend the r1 you have come a long way since 99 skittles and the dmb falchion spam days still thanks for enduring the torment to give us a silly video that ending was priceless t i think you channeled afro for a bit there the problem with the dark sword is that people only use r1 i use the dark sword too but in a fair fight i never spam r1 cant wait for straight swords nerfs their damage speed and stamina consumption are ridiculous i havent played dark souls 3 but whats so broken about the dark sword we need more of this cosplay pls that rage quit at the end xd god i hate the dark sword its such a noob weapon lost my shit at the end xd you know i never thought brandon had any skill but this this is just the ebst performance any souls player ever had what a god lol i remember the part at 213 on the stream some random invader who also looked 100 identical to you probably rings and all so this is what lvl387 pvp looks like people act like hyper armour doesnt poop on the dark sword hahaha hilarious video bro this great lol that ending thoughgood shit smart gameplay that ending sure paid off that lens flare effect at 104 cracked me the fuck up it pained me to watch this as much as im sure it pained you to make this your entire mindset while gathering these clips must have been the things i do for youtube are you gonna be ok oro is this to show off how dumb the weapon is or how dumb people are i feel like scum just watching this best oros arsenal ever brandon i have spoken with god and he has abandoned us does onlyafro know you jacked his video style only with more skill on show obviously now imagine this shit with poise not even the good old darkmoon falchion could be as disgusting as this i sincerely hope that from doesnt bring poise back hyperarmor is awesome as it is right now that was great d work as intended come on obobo you basically created this meta back in dark souls 1 oh this would have hurt to make lol if only you couldve added the audio of you mashing the r1 button haha mfw dark souls has finally adapted the combat system of skyrim hahahha love that ending kappa description reminds me of all of the people who are using full ornstein armor only to be using washing pole and caestus without a doubt the most popular pvp weapon followed closely by the estoc at least with the estoc i can do the backward slash and the heavy slash in addition to the pokes every person in pvp has only ever heard of the r1 button xd i really do not understand the people who whine about ds3 pvp being bad its much better than ds1 and demons souls and at least on par with ds2 pvp if poise actually worked it would definitely be the best pvp in any game oh my god lol i just couldnt stop laughing the ending made me fukin giggle at the office so hard d d 223 i am hunk1990 you only show when you parry me and when i parry u i still love u oro god damn oro how much endurance did you have hahaha is the pvp good i still havent been able to play ds3 brandon how many times did you get parried while doing this video that r1 spamming was ridiculous now all you need is a havel shield to top it off this was better than i thought it was gonna be haha will inferno ever hope to be as funny as oro just close your eyes and it will all be over soon the darksword r1 isnt op its the l2 of the shield thats op you know the one that completely freezes you in place and then takes 23 of your health there isnt anything you can do to stop it oro i love your videos but i think this one gave me a little bit of cancer it at least made me laugh i cant stand those dark sword ass hats why is this the meta oh that ending my fucking sides are in orbit r1 to win oh nice its the toyota song in the backround i want more lens flares i know you cant stop according to the song but we need you to stop i need to take a shower after watching this video good to see you have had enough of the disase of straight swords too dark sword in particular thats muh build the ending was so perfect though masterful were you invading in the crucification woods today because i got attacked by you cancer dislike for spaming r1 and quitting from the game fgt lol that ending xd lmfaooooo the ending though now those viewing the video may think the dark sword and its ilk take no skill which is true however wielding and using them anyway carries a massive benefit they almost always result in instantaneous hate messages from whoever invades you most of which with exceptionally colorful insights thats about the only value youll get from them though first sacred flame glitching now this turning into abit of a pathetic scumbag on pvp arent you that last clip thats the fucking best xd does the dark sword remind anyone of a certain sword from drakenguard whats the difference between this and the broadsword why is this better lmao that ending hey oro how do you and all the other guys make builds so quickly i wan to make videos too but every time i get an idea someone makes a video on it and i cant make builds fast enough this games pvp is actual trashits litterally bloodborne wearing dark souls skinweakest attack in the game can stun a max poise havel monster and stunlock is insanethe netcoding is pure shit and phantom range is assturn back on poise nerf the shit out of dark blade and fix the netcoding and i might just play pvpuntil then im sticking to softs iron keep bridge pvp one of two things need to happen rapiersstraight swords need nerfed poise needs to exist forever wishing for a world with nerfed straight swords and katanas no detectable difference from your normal gameplays kappa this is basically my experience of other players in the game they really need to add poise back into the game so like in dark souls 2 we can actually roll out of r1 spam how can you go from getting almost perfect pvp with 2 to then bad net code for bloodborne and then shit pvp in 3 maybe they are getting lazy but im hoping they still care enough to patch the games problems you should have used dmb on it too haha not enough r1s i used the dark sword before it was a meme im such a rebel oro to get more skills you must buff your dark sword with dark moon blade to make dank sword in a game where poise doesnt fucking matter what so ever its really no surprise a weapon with decent damage output can rank up such idiotic numbers due to speed alone im looking at you every rapier ever a game where total and utter monotony senseless aggressiveness and predictable tactics are in general the more viable and more easily conducted playstyle that literally any idiot could adopt and practise with minimal backlash despite the overwhelming negative karma well played well played now lets just sit back relax and wait for from to nerf the shit out of almost all straight swords my bet is that theyll leave the sunlight straight sword alone on that regard for some reason and then well just have to deal with whatever garbage meta that we ourselves come up with next anyone up for betting on what the next meta will be im calling halbersspears i bet you havent been able to wash the filth away from your hands by playing like that quality content obo i love the dark sword i had no idea it was considered a cheese weapon as soon as a dark wraith dropped one on my first play through i finished the game with it working as intended i do love how the first darkwraith i ever fought dropped me the dark sword and since i had no idea about dark sword being as op as they were no online mode to get wrecked by them qq damn you fps i figured why not never used it in ds1 so ill main it for a little while here i then found out and promptly bought a crescent axe to cleanse myself from the cheesep that ending lmfao brandon what have you become i really hope straight swords get a nerf the spam is too toxic pls teach me how to r1 like you the dark sword isnt the problem here the problem is the lack of poise shout out to the fact the every try hard with a dark sword tends to be artorias is weapon for u fucking or1br1o spamer like the straight sword hitboxes are fucked to oblivion oh my god the fucking dashboard ragequit bless your fucking channel this made me feel dirty just from reading the title screen i only use my refined dark sword 10 forscience but seriously i liked it until i saw 80 of the playerbase using it and spamming r1 theres something fundamentally wrong with artorias spamming the dark sword if they activated the poise system this would be much less of a problem but until it is activated all you have is hyperarmor to deal with these spammy quick weapons but these spammy quick weapons do nearly as much damage as the slow ones you should use an estoc in your offhand the way the creators intended the game to be played still waiting for the patch which says poise is back i used a dark sword before people found out how good it was and it helped me through my first play so much mostly because i was like i wanted to use this in ds1 but it kind of sucked but now i can use it and it doesnt suck this is the best fucking most cancerous incredible asinine amazing piece of shit next level trash thing i hate how much i love it and i love how much hate man you got this up fast this games roll invincibility makes me just as sick as this fucking sword does why the fuck people keep rolling into the r1 spam i mean dark sword is actually easy as fuck to counter just learn how to spacing and use hyper armor profaned ugs r2roll catch r1 combo easy 3shot dark sword users dark sword is literally the most cancerous thing next to the estoc until fromsoft stops playing silly buggers with us and does something about the poise in this game straight swords and rapiers are fucking op as my dick on a friday night oh god i can already feel the incoming memes what have you done oroboro what have you done fuck that sword lollollol that skillquit though another dark sword storm is incoming i love how youre wearing the noob armor set every scrub is wearing that armor i swear to god i see ur videos u with out this sword u dont have honor that first invasion was just aids xd i dont understand what makes the dark sword so differentop from any other straightsword i havent seen it in game yet so i dont have anything to compare it to is it the scaling damage or moves et i think i have cancer now thanks thumbs down for the shitty 2011 edm inside the mind of a noob r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 dodge nope r1 block nope r1 me go face yup r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 50010 i just came from all the r1 spam people need to parry dark sword into oblivion so dark souls 3 kind of sucks no triple buff 010 whats that armour chest piece at 217 r1 sword casual can be happy real talk though the stream for this was amazing loved the chat and peeve trying to make lore for this buildsituation lmao the thing you did at the end of the video almost killed me lol so this is the video you mentioned in yukas chat step 1 equip caestus in offhand step 2 spam ltl2 while the dark sword wielding scrub tries to stunlock you with rbr1 spam step 3 enjoy a pretty much free riposte that probably oneshots them if you have hornet ring equipped works against

a twist from pls nerf button pressing omfg that ending had me in tears the end 3 xd yep this is the pvp they created for us holy shit that ending i died oro always has the best fucking fashion goddamn i imagine everyone halfass cosplaying artorias is some 12 year old thinking he looks so cool lmfaooo funny ass video ahead still cant believe im seeing this on trash players i got a guy down to 10 health and then he did this like 4 times and killed me from basically full healthwhy is it really that good hey oro what was the combo you used in this video it seemed powerful but i cant tell what buttons you used for it great now everyone is gonna use the dark sword so this is an average dark souls pvper cosplay build then i love the souls series to death but after battlefield 1 comes out im done with this cancerous pvp the sad thing is you actually see a lot of people unironically playing like this and they think they are mlg that rage quit was soo fast daym xd dem skills whoa id better write this all down r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 and uh let me check this last part r1 love the ending love it can i copy your build back to the roots oh sheet is this shades back to dark souls 1 falchion r1 spams muh derk sword is best girl tho brando who hurt u oh look its dark souls 1 oroboro r1 spam like the good old days kappa i didnt know you are playing on ps4 do you pvp with viewers ohh hey you play on ps4 are you planning on doing subscriber duels or something of that sort this needs a trigger warning my jimmies were rustled without my consent shame on your cow and shame on your family to dark sword r1 spammers maximum butthurt in full effect now all you need to do is put dmb on it and have the havels shield to go with it and you would complete the build 40 endurance ring of favor2 spam dat r2 15 times before your meter runs out 1010 works every time that camera cut mid swing was godlike hey oroboro have you found yourself missing ds 2 pvp i bought scholar of the first sin just to play its pvp dammit ive been playing this wrong the whole time the only ive found worse is some type of katana step attack where the hit you repeatedly in a short time and stunlock rare but annoying can oroboro be a boss in darksouls honestly just name the boss parry king i rest my case it seriously killed me a little on the inside to play like this please obobobo i bet you loved every moment of it that rage quit at the end was amazing xd ive seen a number of ugly metas come and go but thisthis is the worst one yet why do i say that because of its sheer simplicity dark sword r1 spam victory lmao brandon dont give them any more pro tips lol i cant stop lol this is the complete opposite of oros play style but g mother fucking g i cant wait to check back on the video when all irony is lost in the comment section battles are won with a simple r1 and this is why i hate ds3 pvp d must of taken years to develop this strategy wish i had the skills for things like this your on a whole new level prays the oroboro this shit is fucked this build is a bigger joke than donald trump brandon have you tried the astora greatsword its a really good weapon for infusions using it on my pyro build infused with chaos it has c c a a scaling that end though top 10 soulsborne video of alltime right here nice rtor1as cosplay yeah this is why im changing my mason weapon to lothric sword i was okay with the cancer up until you closed the game when you got parried xd but its so true i stumbled upon the dark sword my first playthrough and holy fuck i used it got bored of the r1 spam so fast switched to any other build lol lol that ending you got skills brandon i use a dark sword but i dont play like this i fucking hate people who use this especially in duels its phantom range is absurd theres nothing wrong with using efficient moves brandon 2013 knight artorias dislikes this video of this cheap imposter this is gr8 and dank and all but now make the same type of vid with 2hd black knight halberd intermittent r2 presses im guessing the overhead isnt r1 cuz you can parry it in my experience where the move has crazy shadow range and hitbox on the sides will you make an oros arsenal of dark swordestochavels greatshieldsacred flame glitch if so please like to save an oro scrubscriber because this shit was cancerous to watch during live stream the ending so beutifull so pure its all dark swords and jr parry kings ceastus spamming that attack speed though that combat log i died i be the original creator of the dark swords joke 215 you even found another invader who was doing the exact same thing unless you staged that everything else was funny but that depressed me a little this is the worst video i have ever made it seriously killed me a little on the inside to play like this i hope you guys enjoyed this extremely skill based montage from my very original never before seen build with the dark sword aha you actually did the parry quit i stopped watching the stream before i got eye cancer haha haha the end tho i know ur were doing it for the video but i never seen anyone close application that fast i never watched ur streams in a long time how can you make fun of dark sword when you had almost a 1 hour long video of you spamming l1 with the farron greatsword lmfao this skill brings tears to my eyes many people dont get the irony i guess ahahaha holy shit its like the falchion r1 spam on methgood music though lol that was disgusting but ill always forgive the parry king but please never again wait this is call of duty they need to delete that weapon my life in 230 the ending had me in tears hahaha the dark sword is balanced peeve new falchion r1 for dayssss i was waiting for this after peeve talked about it on stream the new drake sword

surprisingly charming despite the shrieking will watch more say hi meghan beep beep im going to enjoy this meghan is hilarious clobbering and slobbering haha she sounds a bit like a young male anime character spoken by a woman introduce yourself meghan beep beep says she doesnt play video games knows what hammerfell is 2 years late but its actually pronounced skeetmeter and a 1000 dark souls i laughed harder than ive ever laughed when she said that you both pronounced scimitar wrong its pronounced simitar i dont know anything about meghan but she sounds like and reminds me of brittagillian jacobs from community except she isnt the worst theres only 2 genders in the world men and objects ive always said simmitar also i really enjoy this friend of yours shes a trip xd also also how could you be such a meanie and not tell her about the bonfire up the stairs behind the knight that killed her im still stuck at high rotheric and i was worried about spoilers but something tells me you guys didnt get that far so is meghan his little sister she sums up every part of dark souls in this video its glorious i get to touch stacy now oooooooooo god did she managed to git gud megan sounds cute i dont even know meghan but i love her you killed the younglings clearly anakin had the right idea all along marriage material i need to find me a meghan filthy fucking casul she sounds a lot like ellie

wizards wand you guys should play bio shock 1 or 2 w shes not stupid and she did a thing a lot of us would have done when we were babby naive soul scrubs or she made the casul scum mistake unredeemable filth stop playing games i like this is the first time ive seen such a low energy channel and i love it 1433 when you stick it in the wrong hole this video is godtier please more of this out of all the beginnings if the darks souls series which one is the hardest how is this channel not more popular this is legit the funniest video on youtube i watch this at least once a day i kept giggling about the 3d glasses eyes thanks meghan and marcus xd i would love more of this i would watch this everyday for as long as you made them meghans commentary is amazing 76 out of 10 you heard it here first lmaooo i apologize for not subscribing to you sooner please forgive my unworthy soul i need more of this shes hilarious meghan is precious lmfao this is so great i love meghan meghan is the best i want more meghan damn i couldnt even beat the first boss sober im too casual for dark souls also im really enjoying your channel i dont typically watch youtubers but this is really entertaining best channel on youtube dot com how does this video only have 300 views this is possibly the best video to ever have existed the c in scimitar is silent dood please make this a playthrough go back to dying light i recommend the farron greatsword if you wanna kill some mimics greatswords have nice range and the farron greatsword has that nice swing attack when you do a light left attack that way you can escape the mimics when they wanna eat you the astora straight sword is the best its a cool sword i use it to buff up my pyro spells soooooo cant i just offhand it with fugz thanks the location butthis is your first dark souls right use a ring of favor thanks bro how did you get this far in ds3 when youre that terrible at dodging attacks that mimic chest nearly wrecked you wait this setup is bad tho holy fuck this guy had autism 1733 ar how many swings was that 44 vitality what the fuck level 139 looks power still fat armour and weapon actually i seem to prefer the astoras straight sword it has better base damage maybe this one has better escalated but with enough level and with an affinity stone im invincible even in pvp crap i think i sold it i dont have the attributes for it yet he literally ripped off leafyisheres intro what is this armor this guy sounds like a grown up version of shin chan haha try ring of favor 3 over life ring any day you lost all credibility with the life ring seriously praise the sun your rings are shit dude its good cause it was solaires praise the sun this is well wow its an ok sword with a bad buff why do you sound constipated use two battel axe it 300 attack really sunlight straight sword best one handed weapon not really its only use is its buff ability but since thats a weapon skill it doesnt have stance so not very useful against invaders who hide behind shields forcing you to rely on slowass kicking and the broadsword ends up much stronger than it anyway and unlike sunlight it doesnt require twinkling titanite and even then sunlight is pretty much equal with an astora 10 when maxed out besides im damn sure silver knight straight sword would be the absolute best if fromsoft got off their asses and put it in the fucking game what armor is that those rings are cringe this is great i wanted a good one handed sword because i like using the shield i need a darksouls3 buddy for ps4 why a life ring why not the ring of favor it gives health equip load and stamina i think i have this sword and anris both 528 dmg magic dmg is gud i use black knight sword 5 301199 and lloyds swrd ring for 560 damage one of the oddest builds ive ever seen to be very honest ring of favor dex ring str ring carthus milkring boom dps is crazy those rings suck silly goose you saw the stack how many times did you hit the silver night would someone please tell me what one handed sword is better than the dark sword right now i have a refined gem in it making it the refined dark sword 207272 damage i also have the uchigatana maxed out to see if it had better stats and it did not any good for a quality build this is embarrassing good video bud i needed this what armor is he using the amount you saw was probably the dmg stack lol a 10 uchigatana with hollow infusion out damages this weapon even a normal 10 uchigatana out damages this sword not to mention that ring setup is just bad man that silver knight will end up raping you bro nice intro though cheers the pontiff rings are useless unless you can get off 5 consecutive hits without running out of stamina thats when those effects kick in youre better off using attack boosting rings getting lightning or darkmoon blade with a quality faith build and then using the swords skill then buffing with the darkmoon blade or lightning blade using the priestess ring increases faith by 5 hunters ring increases dex by 5 and knights ring increases str by 5 that way you can put 15 points into other stats like vigor endurance or even vitality if you want then put on any attack boosting ring like flynns ring if youre under 30 weight etc stats needed with those rings for 40 40 dex str 35 dex and str increased to 40 by rings and 25 faith increased to thirty for lightning or darkmoon blade remember use oath of sunlight first to increase all damage by 10 then buff with miracle darkmoon blade will have more of an effect generally because more people have more ligh it casts the sacred oath miracle you obtain that by trading 10 sunlight medals to warriors of sunlight covenant so if i attack constantly and dont miss i will kill stuff thanks for the tip im trying to find the name of that sword it looks like wing tip at the end like hermes sandals anyone know the name that sword is down that cliff wtf y would you use any of those rings wat about flynns loyds sword chloranthy any other besides the ones you had thanx man got my sub si you can one hand every weapon in this game what armor set is that this sword bufed with cristal magic and sacred oath at 40 dex and 40 strenght does has almost 700 damage stats its insane for a regular one handed sword there is no best of even one of bestanything in a souls gameits all preference you kind of speak like macho man randy savage this is a really funny weapon review i dont think he understands stack damage and or has little souls experience hence the fat roll lol might be a good sword for my holy knight build it is a very good sword but my 1st play through was a dex build and one of the meanest longs words imo is lothric knight sword especially that 110 crit it is fierce my dex is at 40 at with a hornet ring it repostes about 13001400 dmg and it still has a weapon art unlike the oath longsword weapon arts are severely underused i get people calling me a hacker for the weapon art r1 shield break how do you know the damage of your nth attack the number gets bigger yes but thats the total amount of hit points you removed in one set of strikes if you hit twice the second number you see is the sum of the two strikes not the damage of the second strike man love that intro song idfc by blackbear right life ring really vezo have you tried the heavy infused dark sword and if so what is your opinion of it i am thinking of doing some black knight glaiveshenanigans for my next playthrough i wish dark souls looked this good on xbox one the life and estus righ seems really unnessesary if you have the right setup u ouldnt need to use those 2 rings or just dont get hit also what is your body armor looks great this and the dark sword are soo good wonder if i can use carthus flame to temporarily ehance it not sure about the rings basically you have to spam attacks which is a huge invite for a parry and the end of your duel lol when i was playing dyinglight then i joined vezo and i didnt even he was youtuber vezo i was wondering if you can add me on ps4 its tornadoq and the other one is camoxblazefury the first one is for multiplayer and the other one is for

whats name intro song do this again but vs titan cool beast youtuber cool its just swords and force waves congratulations super wow cool and like hello wonderful people whats up guys rehv here today we analyze a really underrated weapon class the straight swords often overlooked in favour of overpowered hyper armor weapons and meta dominating scythes a proper straight sword play can really make this underrated gem work follow me on twitch httpswwwtwitchtvrehvion soulstuber discord httpsdiscordggy8jajq2 support me httpsgooglouzrdx follow me on twitter here httpstwittercomrehvion squirre ss have been great cfrom day one you get it late lol outro was a nice touch you need that pig shield for permanent cosplay since it matches your avatar 639645 haha thats great very noice music syncs to

dark souls on xbox one hmu gt is xamp2knightxx can someone tell me why i take far more damage than all youtuber on walk through even with higher resistance in everything an armor piece in every slot and none of either of our rings provide a defensive difference im only on the regular new game most notably the fighting cow boy hes 20 ranks lower with far less resistance but takes way less damage i realy like your style of duel i hope you will not invade me 745 i seeeee what you did there you cheeky dude how do you make it to always be the one who stays on the leader cause i always fall in spite of im breaking the r1r2 buttons this classical music choice is really good nice taste ss has been meta since launch loool i always think the fallen knight set with the grass crest shield and iss is a meme something that people dont do anymore and then i still see people doing it and most of the time it doesnt seem like theyre doing it ironically was invading the other day and found a phantom dualwielding dark swords it went from funny to sad to beautiful and then back to sad i see the wonderful people spam in chat finally got to you rehv 3 620 yeah theres definitely something wrong with the pale shade its a shade but not a bloodshade thats whats wrong even the npc uses hacks 603 what infusion was that at the very end the end made me lol i cant tell if pink floyd or the pokemon mystery dungeon soundtrack is playing lol the broken broken ss at the end i dont man straight swords are ok but i would take any ultragreat hammers or axes rolling attack over say something like gothard twin swords roll attack any day 018 i really wonder where is that oof sound coming from love the ending i got so excited that i actually got invaded by you n central irithyl bonfire area but sadly i didnt make the cut in this clip was a long fight and managed to finish ur estus i think fighting you was tough perhaps even the toughestgood job finishing that blue too ps im daredevilfcb on ps4i was the one who caught ur run and killed u at the 3 pontiff knights area in that back corner just after the bonfire shortly after i seeded the area of course p huge fan and been a subscriber for months now love ur videos and i learn alot from them refinded mail breaker at 4040 does more riposte damage than dagger with same also longer and can be used as a weapon also looks nice the weapon art for lks is so simple yet for some reason always such an effective bamboozle what staightswords are good no way hammers are the best you know youre casul is when you use broken straight sword i mean its literally fucking broken its even in the name broken straight sword this channel needs more curved swords damn it dude you beat me to the punch made a broken broken chaos straight sword video i

to blow up it makes me sad to think that as ds3 slowly dies so will the regularity of rehvion uploads and thats just depressing was that intro a result of two other youtubers performing the fusion dance you now face zeroskillz this video is cool and all but straight swords will always be outclassed by meta weapons like maces and the warpick the absolute madman lol gg rehv nice job on those backstabs fromsoft can still push straight swords further we wont be done until they give us an iron filing from a straight sword as a weapon took 63 tongues yesterday 778 on fire hmm passieve wouldnt work whit me but words are words and i see what ya doing anyways gg and pooor suckkas 638 i heard that pantera im broken sarcasm if i ever heard it i actually prefer axes cuz axes like strength builds

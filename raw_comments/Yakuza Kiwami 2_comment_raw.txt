dislike for skip the cut scenes of the past played this on ps2 uff the nostalgias the real game starts like half an hour later i think you sucks at these kind of game holy crap the graphics anyone know the song at the beginning club flaskback i cant differentiate between cutscenes and game the boy will become ryuji goda miss him too miss the jingweon mafia police lady i feel shenmue vibes 2019 and a game with no voice dialogs lol modern japanese games looks all the same ps2 enhanced looking some terrible emotional parts in the beginning ps2 engine repetitive objectives they are stuck in 2004 whats this subtitle slang crap ya fella gtfo those guys are yakuza not boys in the hood i thought i was tripping when i heard korean but no i was not the best character out of all of this kiwami bob i still havent played the yakuza series but i will do so sometime this year just another game in my backlogprobably wont get a ps5 until two years after it launches can anyone tell me the name of the piano play at 1255 please mmm what is this 3210 why are they all silent is this weird part will be on pc may 9 this game needs simple mods like 1st person camera and no gpsmap minimum is this free for ps plus i fuckin lovee all the series of this game plzz bring this game on pc is this open world the graphics look much better but i didnt like the new hud at all the original one is much better whos the guy who got shot at the beginning he was speaking korean hyped haruka is a whore i freaking hate her as a character the walkthrough is like watching a yakuza anime rofl ty 5 armed men against 1 bare hands and they dont shot rofl from the looks of it kiwami and the song of life have pretty similar combat systems i am an xbox player have been for years but thus game is making me wanna get a ps4 i was a huge fan of sleeping dogs and dont know much about the yakuza series but deffo wanna play this game im new to yakuza so might be an obvious question is this the exact same game as yakuza 2 except its a remake im thinking of getting either this or yakuza 6 on ps4 is that an av actress on the thumbnail damn they used real actor to replace jiro kawara kiryu is totally pervertminded when dating the hostesses quite opposite of himself in the main story and for someone whos doing the host club story after beating the main story like me this is quite refreshing like exactly like the one i played on ps3 trip down memory lane they removed the piano theme during cemetery roaming any chance of freeroam with car or motor aww wheres that music that plays while your visiting the cemetery in the beginning httpsyoutubecg2bait55ik here is the ending credit song lol this game makes me feel like there are thugs everywhere in japan zacky chan really thanks for uploading but is part 12 the last part of the walkthrough this game is actually very good it just sega havent step up their marketing strats i am watching a movie or game ive been looking forward to this ever since i watch the trailer and it doesnt disappoint where sega icon sokiryu only has one battle style i just clicked because of the thumbnail i dont even play yakuza or have a ps4 3 days left i cant wait looks awesome seems that kiwami 2 has a lot of content to offer i cant wait thank god this looks good on the base ps4 cuz yakuza 6 looked ass on base ps4 damn i wanted to see more of the past tht kiryu was remembering shirrako back at it again with more games that i would like to play but dont have the time i was really waiting for this gameplay you are best feel the heat this game is suppose to be english titled right how did you manage to get the game way too early the game actually releases on august 28 breathe breathe o my gosh its finally here eeeeee sugoi that ending i swear to god god all of this was fucking heartwrenching 44750 please someone give me the name of this beautiful soundtrack cant believe i just watched 5 hours of cutscenes and it felt like a fkin movie played yakuza kiwami 1 and want to buy this one definetly will 10 10 wheres the bomb defusal scene kiryu the real gentleman on that date whats the music 44046 man just how much death does haruka grow up seeing up close and personal how the fuck is she not traumatized by it also did kiryu seriously just go fuck it and start making out with kaoru as the timer was ticking down im dying 44143 when mom finds the poop sock holy shit chono and mutoh is it just me or is this one not as good 44143 if yall came here just for the meme i remembered playing this game on the ps2 when i was younger during the kansai mission i grinded for the money but found out that there was another way without paying the guy at the mahjong parlor left kansai and the date from the restaurant kept calling kiryu because he never showed up to the date such a memories im done with yakuza 1 when i was a little kid bought ps2 time to continue the journey 4430 intensive police work in progress 31838 lol chauvinists are funny sometimes i swear comedy aside you can find punks like that in every nation unfortunately 31700 just markin where i stopped i gotta say the ending really moved me i didnt want to even finish the last 3 minutes it was so hard to watch but im glad i went back and finished it when haruka said teradasan that made me think if kiryu was still alive and there he is just came after playing yakuza 1 on pc its good but worse than the others just when i thought i was out they pull me back in at least for once he managed to save someone i played yakuza 0 and kiwami everyone dear to him died at least someone lived this time what a fucking great ending ready for yakuza 3 yeah boy man i wish there were more games like this this game i rhibk is ok but i would prfer the older versikon but lo like the way thay they have put the majimas campsings in the ganes i was waiting for this movie thanks 44402 that is the true face of a man who is wondering what and how the fuck he got himself into his current situation the final chapter is just black screen to the end commenting where i left off 132826 is it just me or sometimes the video will cut to a different scene in the middle of something btw there is a huge chunk of story missing after the battle in osaka castle around 140700 ive been so confused and had to switch to another video to get it covered kiryu as a yaoi voice actor im so done xddd holy crap this is a long video fix blackscreen from 155403 dude how can you even uploading this long thank you for uploading this i can get the enjoyment of the game without playing the game whats up with the random black screens how sandbox is this game you better bring part before the end of this month you hear one more video before beddammit its a 17hr videolet me get a snack and juicelol mack doing the shenmue series yakuza series is one of the best japanese games ive ever played anything from the yakuza series is definitely worth a buy i think the bugs are exclusive to the pc port hopefully itll get patched its ya ku za and it does look interesting to play is this similar to sleeping dogs mack sega just release a game called judgementits similar to thie game but instead of being yakuza ur an ex yakuza turned pi detective in search of serial killerplease check itnout i think youll like it yakuza 0 has great story telling and many epic moments can be found there unnecessary content with real actors oh man i respect your opinion but i think you are wrong here it may be a bad thing too you but for yakuza fans thats was super fun and pretty awesome just because in yakuza 0 all we had was some cards with a picture on it to collect now we have like a full interactive minigame with real girls oh man it was such a high evolution of that system also its a japanese game they dont need to change their wierd culture for us not to mention that on kiwami 1 there was a kid minigame where girls fights each other in bugs outfits so how it can be a bad thing if you dont want the extra content you can skip it and only 30hours come on there is so muuuch fun content on that game this game worth every pennyalso it was my first yakuza on ps2 what a great memories and now playing it again with this astonishing quality something to worth if you really wanna enjoy this first start with yakuza 0 the best for mesuch a great story and gameplay the majimas saga chapters are way better if you know the entire plot of makoto since yakuza 0 yakuza 0 is in my opinion better to be honest there is a lock on button so you can stay facing an enemy while you attack its not just manually angling yourselves towards them though i and i think most people play that way nah i aint reading all that bullshit wake me up when this game gets good and has english speaking voices why should i be forced to be a weeb just to play a game sir davos is that you i kinda pass the whole gta thing now im too jaded though i cant wait till you do the ff7 remake the story started a bit boring because you did not play the previous 2 games i dare you to play 0 and kiwami mac plz do it i am so glad he didnt shit talk this game because usually hes not a fan of japanese games but this is the greatest series of all time and if he bashed it i would have literally dropped the bomb on his house the sex minigames have to be in this game this is finally a game that isnt made by puritan americans or brits made for adults not kids kids can fuck off i mean for gods sake you are playing a criminal from the japanese underworld hostesses and prostitutes are part of the culture glad you enjoyed it yakuza 0 is one of my favourite games of all time so seeing more people like the series is great yakuza 0 masterpiecemajjme stole the show on this one yakuza k1 not badi dont get the same feeling on this one so i just rush on the story yakuza k2 its great i love the new engine but i truly hate the thugs on this oneeven with lucky soda yakuza 36 sega pc port please small tidbit about the naughty stuffs the story is set in red light districts controlled by yakuza factions so sex trades are to be expected the series never really shied away from the raunchier side of that part of japanese culture in fact it embraces it dude you have to play and review yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 in that order this is the third game in the series chronologically and its fun to see some context to the events in this game and yakuza 0 offers an absurd amount of content for the price it has yakuza series is a masterpiece man for the fans and its developer to bother remade every old installation speaking of japanese games im surprised mac never reviewed nioh is anybody here recommend that game because i kind of want to get into japanese games now shit look at the detail in that shop im impressed i never tried yakuza series before but this maybe this is more like sleeping dogs 2god i miss sleeping dogs game i just finished this game i have to say i would give this game 1010 there is not many game that would make me this much excited this game is like a god for me mack if you liked this youd love sleeping dogsa chinese theme yakuza game your fov physically hurts to watch lmao always great to see a newcomer loving their experience with my favorite series though this is clearly a game you play with a controller it has stupid pointless mini games there are naughty bits that have no point being in here damn you almost earned yourself a sub so close better luck next time playing on mouse and kbare you retarded this really reminds ofwhats that other game i played years ago it was nice gamewatchdogs hot dogs down dogs street dogs or something like thatsame yakuza story with an undercover cop this game is an aaa title as far as i am concerned it has more content than most games youll play and a story as well told as any film for 20 quid its a steal my first yakuza game was 4 and i fell in love with the series i also played yakuza 0 and loved it too it aint so much about the fighting for me but its the storyline its fkn amazing i dont regret my purchases of kiwami and kiwami 2 karaoke is the true end game of yakuza hands down your best review mack your points were very solid and you honestly gave this game a very fair shake i was a little nervous during the review however you certainly made that nervousness go away really quickly im just glad the yakuza games can get more attention on pc absolute master class games these are i highly recommend yakuza 0 as it is the first game game chronologically tied to the main story and is perhaps one of the best games in the last 1015 years for sure it will having you dying in laughter again brilliant and fair review you should review warcube not worth this game is crap a real yakuza plays with a controller love this game surprised and pleased mack enjoyed it terrific fun with an engaging story sega have outlined their focus on pc gaming going forward which is awesome from the perspective of a childhood sega fanboy lets hope they revive some of their great franchises no female option i want a badass female with muscle to fight this game is boring as hell feels looks and plays like a half finished 5 year old game aye glad to see you enjoy a game mack ok this game is a type of game for a different type of gamer lots of scenes to watch but still worth a buy in my opinion 40 fps on high at 1080p on a 2080 fuck that 1234 more fun fact than gta series trolls can assure you that i couldnt stand the game when it was given away free for ps4 it seems like a dreamcast era game or something maybe its just not my cup of tea has mack ever played yakuza 0 how different is this to that i noticed theres more depth to the shops in the video i just bought this shite wtf your review was so great but the game is rancid are we talkin bout the same game paid review guys if you want mack to review yakuza 0 so much than someone buy the game key and send it to him and im sure he will review it hence he reviiewwed this game because someone boight it for him btw mack if your man or any other gender you may wish to pick a attack helicopter or a certain frog springs to mind how about a wab on sekiro interesting era but dark souls mechs less rolling more sword fight looks beautiful reminds me a little of tenchu hey mack if you reading this if you really dug yakuza kiwami 2 you should try yakuza 0 its the prequel to the whole yakuza storyline and this game will make hell of a lot more sense since it pretty much sets the stage for all these eventsspecially the relationship between the main protagonist kiryu and the that whacky dude goro majima the dude with the construction helmet on his head yakuza 0 is like 20 euros or something on steam so its also quite cheap for 30something hour gameand its just clean fun no dlc stores or anything in the way just the game also the combat system is so over the top and hilarious with the heat actions that you will love it hope you like it all the best edit and if you want to have a taste of what the over the top means on those heat action finishing moves just search for yakuza 0 all heat actions here on youtube who ever directed the cutscenes is a goddamn madman genius ahem kkkkkkiiiiyyyyrrrrruuuuchan youre welcome oh nice played 0 got kiwami 1 for free still didnt touch it yet but how about extra games 0 for example there i had lots of fun with the hostess mobster game was epic like ffvii chocobo ranching so are there also big minigames like that some right bastards in this is it better on pc or ps4 i love how each game seemed to improve on the last i decided to check out how much different kiwami 1 was when it was free for ps members and it was an awesome facelift for such an old game now i just want to start the series over with 0 and work my way through it as the only ones i played were 1 and 2 on the ps2 the mix of outrageous humor and somber seriousness is something im a big fan of the most because you wouldnt really think that was anything funny about a game being about the yakuza dont worry about the typical sellout types im honestly ok with long cut scenes as long as theyre done well that doesnt even mean that they have to be perfect they just need to keep my interest and tell a decently interesting story im more than willing to watch cut scenes in a good game as long as the story is decent im definitely not against an interactive movie experience aside from a few of the shouldnt be there bits this game looks absolutely fascinating and 30hrs nice shout out to sega for 1 making a legit game in a time where this is seemingly rare and 2 having the confidence in it to send mack a key they have my props sleeping dogs is better than the yakuza games imo 3rd person kicky punch game stick it up yer arse it whook me in yakuza has become one of my favorit game series it was a real shame that 5 didnt get a physical release i hope there will be a kiwami version that gets a physical now that the series is more popular in the west and the naughty stuff absolutely belongs in there its part what makes yakuza so great and so japanese you didnt mention the different fighting styles unless yk2 is the first kiwami not to have them hurry up and sleep for anyone who needed the translation to the last part real yakuza use gamepad stop being a pansy mack use a controller if its best played that way also play yakuza 0 i absolutely love that game yakuza 0 is easily 910 for me the graphics look a bit outdated but it has a fuck ton of personality the minigames are so much fun too i think i spent a whole day in the disco trying to beat my high score the substories are absolutely amazing funny at times and serious in others 0 to 100 real quick i love it 3 arent you going to complain how this is overly pc and pandering to minorities yakuza 6 judgement and fons paradise city incoming i hope glad you liked it mack as the yakuza games are great fun mac if you like this then get yakuza 0 its really great and has out run space harrier and super hangon in the arcades i used to frequent the part of osaka that you show in the video on a weekly basis and i cannot stress how well they have modelled the locations watching kiryu walk through that don quixote shop and seeing the layout being completely accurate is just so cool its also great to see yakuza 2 has the newer dotonbori bridge there they were building it when i lived there i am so happy that this game met with your approval the yakuza series is amazing uh oh 435 in and mack is still very optimistic hhhmmmm at this point im wondering if the press access has anything to do with it well i finished watching and for me i dont care how many hours it may have im pretty sure id never buy this it just brings me back so many years to some other very stupid games i played like this subtitles really nah if you want to grab my attention at least have some low grade at least b level actors fuck id have helped for free and im a pretty decent voice guy this has the same thing games like stalker had a real tactile world with little details that draw you in so pleased this fantastic series is getting better known been playing them on my playstation there so much fun with a story that sucks you in this might be what it takes to soften you up to like japanese games honestlythey make some really amazing ones original yakuza 1 on ps2 had full english voice acting though i have yakuza zero on steam i thought the story was good but the gameplay wasnt that great do yakuza 0 its so good and set in 1980s japan i love bruce lee plays a japanese game lol why would sega give you a prerelease key for this game you dont know anything about the series so why give your dumbass the chance to play and review it fucking greenhorn they used odin spheres leveling system good stuff you were obviously starving for a game developer to be friendly to you i love your analogy it runs like shit off a shovel you should make it a standard nomenclature on your reviews dont waste your time with kiwami 1 you will regret it if you do ones first yakuza game is their best experience yakuza game theyre highly redundant but each one alone is quite fun they get less and less fun with each installment because of the recycling did i just hear youre shilling with a free copy all good keep up the good work i agree with other comments that yakuza 0 is definitely worth playing you need a bit of patience though as it takes about 10 hours before the game really gets going tbh i bought yakuza 0 on a whim and ended up sinking 80 hours into it at first i wasnt all that into it and then i got into the first big infiltration mission where youre breaking urinals with peoples heads and i was sold this is easily the most fun ive had with a franchise in years like there are better games the witcher 3 but i honestly think i have had more fun than even some of the most beloved modern classics the words the words lipsyncs in time of the developer couldnt help but notice your bike crumbling into dust at 345 lets fire up gofundme and get you a new one man but seriously what was that about i love how they just charged you once they realized they were cleared hot yakuza is like chili con carne or french cassoulet it looks weird and unappealing but once youve tasted it you always come back for more if you mean the jav actress collectible cards yeah it seems a bit odd but the other adult content are pretty fitting for the contextual setting of the game i want to know whats in the photo booths now theres too many yakuza games theyre good but i dont got the time lol mack glad you liked it will you be doing a wab on total war three kingdoms at some point the blonde guy in the picture looks more like kiefer sutherland in lost boys rather than an asian gangster its kind of refreshing to see what someone thinks of this game without having played the previous two games glad you enjoyed it the consistency of your reviews is abhorrent mack get a 1440p monitor ffs i picked up a great korean panel second hand 3 years ago for 130 quid having a 2080 with a 1080p monitor is a crime step out of the dark ages thats so funny they have donki in the game ghost recon reaction sega are doing awesome ports these days for pc you should review the other sega ports you know you are dealing with a developer confident with their game when they give you a press copy you forgot to mention that you can play the arcade port of virtua fighter 2 inside this game once again old games show that they have far more depth than new games if thats the fps ur getting with a 2080 it will run shit on a normal pc right hello good sir review yakuza 0 i think youd enjoy it i clicked on this wondering this isnt macks kind of game oh no he might shit on it boy was i pleasantly surprised 3 im glad you enjoyed it is this coming to steam i highly recommend you play yakuza 0 the combat and mini games are quite good and to all think this is a ps2 game the yakuzas got to you havent they age of empires project celeste can you do a review of httpsforumsprojectcelestecomthreadswhatisnewinprojectceleste3960 age of empires project celeste it is a server made from fans who love age of empires online but it was canceled by developers and now they add a new content dlc new maps campaign for solo and coop the combat looks like shit dumb ai it seems thats why it ports so well to mouse and keyboard you only need to mash left and right youre putting in hard work mack thanks for the constant great content the progression system with food sounds like a fresh fun take on it mack you gotta try those side quests secondary gameplay mission they are obscenely long and great i played the real state mission for 30 hours alone in yakuza 0 before even getting to chapter 6 i had twice the money the game story was talking about in my pocket every step of the way just in case they gave me the option xd worth every penny great review been eyeing these pc versions looks great im sold that ending sold the game for me as well as using a hotpot as a weapon will you ever review a monster hunter game other than world cause i sunk thousands of hours into the franchise but didnt like world well i liked it but got bored fast for some reasons so id like to know what your opinion on the other games from the franchise i am currently playing yakuza 0 and have sunk over 100 hours in the game and having a blast the world is immersive but your character is not believable one minute you could be in a battle fighting for your life the next minute you are either picking up a motorbike and mashing it into the face of a thug or playing a claw machine in the amusement arcade trying to win a cuddly toy so if laughs and fun is what you are after in addition to a well voiced decent main storyline running through it then do yourself a favour and pick up yakuza 0 cheap i think it was about 8 a couple of months back and get a taste of what you are in for thank you mak not my type of game but looks a good un now am off to see if i can find some footage of the naughtybits i didnt get when you were talking about naughty bits you said there is like a sega and capcom are doing a really great job with remastersremakes and ports you should absolutely check out the previous games as well starting with yakuza 0 and yakuza kiwami 1 this and part 6 feature the dragon engine which results in a very low amount of loading screens yakuza 0 has a brilliant story and character design i think you would have been drawn even more into the game if you played the first two games but maybe youll check them out in your free time mate d what the actual frack is going on with pc gaming have we all turned into fish overnight and now need games with an unrealistic fov next thing you know youll be able to see your enemies through walls ffs can you still run a brothel tho yer does seem worth a buy review fade to silence whatever you dodont fill up your stomach coz you wont get the bonuses lol japanese games for the future damn that was one hell of a stiff cone refresh rate at 6992 wtf i pirated yakuza 0 and was bored out of my mind uninstalled it after 15 hours of play thank god i didnt actually buy the damn thing great fight scene a im getting it for sure i just finished yakuza kiwami 1 3 days ago and it is a fantastice game especially the story i recommend it for anyone who hasnt played it yet so maybe they bring us the remaining yakuza games ugh idk just looks like the first kiwami mack you should really try yakuza 0 its one of the best in the series imo 1056 lots of creativity got into the fights and objects you can abuse eh hilarious indeed finish this game two times one time in the ps2 and one time in the ps4has one of the best characters ive ever seen on vinteogames kazama kiryu mack when are you bringing back some of the macks corner videos how about some bitrunner or chiku funny stuff mack ur a legendall the best bruv from a southerner yakuza 0 is the best one btw mack liking a japanese game what the fuck is going on hey mack i think youd like kenshi also the review would be hilarious mac partner with exclusivelygamescom as a reviewer upvote this so mac will see it another game which tells how great of a year 2018 was for gaming little odd reviewing 2 but skipping 0 and 1 they must have some huuuuge testis giving a press key for a console port to you nice sellout review your insincerity is blatantly obvious mack what the hell the first time you like such a game it almost is as bad as the batman you reviewed but just with a decent levelling system the old mack would hate the shit out of it with countless and endless cutscenes boring repetitive fighting scenes console port mack mack mack could you check out the game im not a monster its very different from anything ive seen you review its also currently on sale httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp826600iamnotamonster seen it all before please mack please play yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 youre missing an awesome series from what i hear the yakuza series is pretty good just never got around to playing them 025 no one points out how the knife stabs into the marble floor from being tossed you couldnt do that even if the floor was made of cheese oh god im glad he liked this i was worried since its mak and i love these games also mack you said that you think some the more sexual elements and nudity shoudlnt be int he game but doesnt that add to the realism of the city in which your playing in im new to yakuza series should i start with yakuza 0 and 1 before this one because of the chronological storyline mack you have a 2080 but you play in 1080p ring that damn bell over this one bump that up to 2560x1440 minimum or 4k put that 2080 to work i stopped playing yakuza 0 so should i just keep playing that or move to this he actually liked it wowwwwwww jesus that last fight scene def worth a buy they wot m8 they actually sent him a press key they must really believe in their product d but it looks fun and alive so i might give this one a go then all games and gaming is shit right now and the fucking publishers and developers wargamingnet ea ubisoft activision 2k endless circle of shit half finished games loot boxes real currency for in game currency pay to win its all bollocks right now this looks really fun to play im buying it thanks mack this is a christian channel no lewd subgames allowed whats the problem with the naughty stuff this game is an arcade criminal simulator having kinky sex and stuff is part of japanese culture anyways not including it would hurt the games immersion use it or dont use it but complaining that it is there is almost asking for censorship stop trying to take away game elements you dont enjoy from other people ffs obviously its good its a remaster of a 2006 game back when gaming was at its peak imo i was to busy playing oblivion that year but i might give it a try now there is nothing but shite ive played this year give it a few months after finishing this one and get on yakuza 0 and 1 you know the game is going to be good right about the time when mack says there is some right bastards in this game hey mack did you saw the champions league comebacks from liverpool and spurs what a crazy final will be macks known for telling the truth thats why we trust him if a dev genuinely believed they made a good game theyll give him a key petition to get mack to voice an anime or anime game character asap are yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 as good graphically mostly asking if there is loading screens when entering buildings exactly as you said for me it has no place in the game and im going to emphasize the for me part because well maybe not everyone that plays this game is a prude the naughty bits are 100 optional in pretty much every yakuza game its kind of a tradition of the yakuza games to have naughty bits in them its been done in almost all of them its optional and its pretty tame and softcore which imo is quite refreshing after all this is a very japanese game made by a very japanese company and studio and japan is pretty known for being very easy going when it comes to sex its pretty much part of the japanese culture i dont mind it the naughty bits are more to please the japanese fanbase i personally dont need it in the game but on the other hand i like that the devs do their own thing without looking to much at the pc shite thats going on in the west right now just imagine the shitstorm if ubisoft or ea put in stuff like this in their games im here for the memes i was dead set on getting it anyways but now i am certain i will get itd i really like the way sega is evolving on pc why in the sodding hell you started with kiwami 2 you already have a remake on a first game kiwami 1 and the prequel yakuza 0 same with mass effect played only andromeda and ignored prequel trilogy do you aussies have no brain or your ego is so ginormous that you simply dont give a shit kiwami 2 story is the best to me the interaction and buildup between the female cop is really good but to my amazement she never appear again in all subsequent series a press key off sega hmm so i take it the normal person who hands out the keys is on holiday or they think mack has mellowed hey mack ive recently got back into 7 days to die but i was wondering if you could upload your 7 days to die playthrough you did way back on mackscorner onto the bunker channel i dont really know what happened with mackscorner but i think you made a video saying where you werent able to keep it anymore due to someone else forcing a lawsuit or something id love to watch that playthrough but if you cant then thats fine keep up the great work you do you need to play yakuza 0 yakuza games are excellent played them on ps2 the side activities are gold after that you absolutely need to play yakuza 0 keep in mind it was released before kiwami 2 so the graphics are not as good but the fps is better its also 2 times longer than kiwami 2 why have you not reviewed the best and biggest selling game of the year so far days gone cheaper and better than days gone you have a 2080 and use 1920 x 1080 i dont know what to say i use 4k since my 980 and this is what its just a waste i didnt understand what should not have to be in the game doesnt empty stomach by crapping in an alley 010 well they gave you a key you know what that means they really trust their game im so glad they are releasing these on pc i dont have a console but watching the yakuza games being played and the amount of detail in the game and mainly the side stuff not even the story has interested me to no end ive always been fascinated by the streets of japan the shops and variety of things to be done i will say that the adult type stuff in the game imo is good as well i like a little of the adult type stuff in a game if it has a place and that type of stuff is real in japan so why not definitely on my top 5 travel list irl is this guy like a christian reviewer or something weird how much he harped on about the optional lewd content me thinks i likes this guilt free melee city smashup one of the lead devs who make yakuza series also dumped hard on sjws thats another reason why you should support these guys bought the game of the back of this review cheers mack im no graphics whore but this looks like it came out the same time as sr3 and by the same ppl lol why was the camra so zoomed out did you change the fov or something edf iron rain a while ago i bought yakuza zero on a whim just to try it i absolutely loved it and now have every yakuza game i could get my hands on the kiwami remakes are great especially since they were originally ps2 games the entire series has become one of my all time favorites so much fun hey mack i bought yakuza 0 a while back when they first started porting them over and i showed my girlfriend and she was instantly hooked and started buying all the remakes you should check out yakuza 0 if you liked that one mack stop being an old fart and use a controller but what about the real game the cabaret grand prix is it worth a buy so wheres the sekiro review no 4k monitor with that gfx card 548 youre a badass yakuza those punks just got so scared when they saw you they ran away faster than the speed of light thats all that happened mack dont worry great review mate quick question will you be reviewing blade and sorcery its a vr fantasy hack and slash game on steam and i think youd enjoy it wow my child hood game i played this game to death back in ps2 lmao its about time you played a proper game mack sega are killing it right now plus if there are issues they seem really responsive as i can recall correctly how the hasty patches up kiwami 0 when it had bugs in the beginning after all this is not some ubishit port dont worry mack you will get the hang of it and start stringing combo moves but like you said this is not your type of game same way military shooters are not for me since i cannot stand them does it have dualshock 4 support for pc and in game controller prompts sega does make some amazing ports probably the best just look at shenmue 12 a dreamcast port that plays amazingly well great video mack hopefully the rest come to pc so more people can enjoy the series if sega does bring them over i recommend you play the rest they all are very good and fun games with fantastic stories except for dead souls we dont talk about that thanks for finally reviewing this great series but you should have started at 0 its one of the best oh no it has happened the mackerson has thumbs upped a japanese console port quick to the time machine i must warn young mack before its too late and we are all doomed if ya thought this one was goodyoull love 0 yakuza games are amazing the best one is yakuza 0 mac give it a go the newest one is amazing graphically also think kiwami 2 uses the same engine personally never liked the look of yakuza but fair play mack might pick it up in a sale mack will you be reviewing a plague tale innocence majima is hands down the best character throughout the series aside from kiryu dont forget to play zero and kiwami 1 if you enjoyed this love yakuza bat shit crazy but sometimes thats what makes you smile its just a game and they should make you have fun first have been running through yakuza 0 in prep for this release and i have not been able to finish it fast enough so might get that done before jumping into this at least negatives like the odd poor mini game are something you dont have to play im not sure if its this one but i read somewhere theres a virtua fighter 2 arcade game playable and you can even do local 2 player on it i bought yakuka 0 on the ps4 in a sale a while ago but i thought it was terrible it felt like a game made 1015 yrs earlier terrible controls invisible walls all over the place and it was just very poor indeed would never buy another yakuza game good on sega for giving you a press key if a company doesnt have enough faith in their product to trust giving it to an honest reviewer we should all be skeptical these yakuza games really give you your moneys worth and put a lot of other games at the same and higher price points to shame with the amount of stuff in them i hope you find the time to try out yakuza 0 which is the same type of game but set in the 80s complete with classic arcade games to play and ridiculous disco dancing lol some unnecessary content with real actors i know exactly what you mean but mack that real actor part is what make this game awesome joke aside i just glad it dont get censored in western release i really like this remake video games are shit since 2005 give it up yall ran like shit of a shovel is a good thing who would of thought what he says at the end is go sleep a little and ouch oh no macks been bought by sega hell be working for ign next if you like this game go back and play yakuza 0 on pc never played this series and now i know why d been a fan since the original back on ps2 so glad to see mack likes it yakuza 0 is better you need to review that how many of these yakuza games are there for god sake seems like they bang out a game a month why dont you try other yakuza pc ports hey mack i really think you should give yakuza 0 a try its easily the best story the best side activities and its fucking hilarious also if you give a fuck about the story its at the very start of kiryus story yakuza is a great serie still surprised they actually dared gave you a copy of it d i didnt expect you to try yakuza glad you liked this game i think they have been doing a great job with the remakes mack liking a japanese game and its even a yakuza game i thought id never see the day oo really good game still overshadowed by yakuza 0kiwami1 but really worth that last kill with the boat hahha hey mack hope youre doing well mate keep up the good work and keep your head up youll be alright got was so meh sucks when you get demonetised on videos like this its no different to most video game violence sorry you spent two days working you arse off to bring everyone your video no pay for you now move on to your next review this is why i do my monthly thank you videos without my donators i literally could not do this job first time sega have gifted a code and a reviewer hasnt been a sellout yakuza zero is one of the funniest games ive played mack wheres your thoughts on last episode of game of thrones i remember the first yakuza game it was fun sadly i never played any after the first one youre an oldskool reviewer i like it and yes days gone is a piece of garbage so you dodged a bullet i love this series and knowing that after a decade of nagging we finally be able to play all 7 games of yakuza on ps4 with the remastered collection of yakuza 34 and 5 coming in the beginning of february yakuza is a great series and it is too underrated i have finished yakuza 0 yakuza kiwami 2 and yakuza 6 and am gonna buy yakuza kiwami 2 in my birthday in januari and i love the series and every yakuza for me is at least 95 or 10 of 10 and you say 8 how dumb or high are you ign is a joke they give my game an 8 but tomb raider gets a 9 bakayaroooo yakuza series is the best game ever damn i excited for kiwami 34 and 5 what about the driving trash ive played the first one yakuza kiwami 1 now i need to play this one yakuza kiwami 2 one of the best story to play did you more enjoy sleeping dogs or this gaming mechanics directly from yakuza 6 lets gooo this gets an 8 but fortnite gets 97 yeah sure can we drive cars in the game coming to pc on may 9th 2019 cant wait i remember playing the the first yakuza back on ps2 but just upset i never got a chance to play all the other s absolutely love this game yakuza kiwami 2has the best story out of all six games in my opinion but i do have one problem with it there are no hostess clubs and when i say no hostess clubs im talking about like shine and jewell where you can go there as the customer and date the hostesses the original yakuza 2 had them plus it had the host club adam mini game and being that theres no hostess clubs there is really nothing to spend your money on in yakuza kiwami 2 i have like 8 million dollars and the only things you can spend your money on is vending machine items and restaurantsonly other thing i can think to spend money on is the cabaret club mini game yakuza game is the one of the best game ever made already preorder on steam waiting for the pc version my guy uses a plunger to knock someone senseless and they bring back cabaret clubs its a no brainer im grabbing this right now 036 can anyone tell me the name of the soundtrack that was used here this deserves a 95 an 8 thats what people were complaining about are you tucking kidding me guys an 8 isnt bad the story was dumb i stopped playing halfway through i got yakuza kiwami on plus a couple days ago and can i just say its one of the most charming over the top and bizare games i ever played and can not wait to play the other entries kiryu does look younger in kiwami 2 and older in yakuza6 i took pics and you can tell im in chapter 5 so far is a game of 9 nothing less i just finished yakuza kiwamishould i get this or o i got kiwami 1 from ps plus and its a great game and it needs way more praise im debating on getting this or yakuza 0 which is better can somebody please tell me the name of the song that plays in the background when you enter the restaurant kani douraku if they would just made the world bit more realistic and more big the game would have been amazing but its still a masterpiece how the f do i equip that sunglass i not a fan of the game play in kiwami 2 but can you play shogi my only problem is the new combat system its bad the one from yakuza 0 and 5 is better i dont know if i should get this or yakuza 6 the game play in kiwami 2 does feel a step down in terms of gameplay so i just bought this today and four hours later i finally took a break interactive toilets most slept on game of 2018 i did play the original yakuza 2but it was a 2 discs game and the 2nd disc never worked so i only played the 1st disc now i can play the kiwami 2 and finally beat the game and fully satisfied seeing how kiryu and the cop lady httpsdocsgooglecomformsd1d0ogm3htjbdimjamnwyv4183888bxj4gtjuk5cguviewformeditrequestedtrue if you want more yakuza games to be brought out in the west please fill out the official sega yakuza survey and spread the word i liked the original version but now that its been upgraded its honestly one of the best in the series i liked the first kiwami as well but the majima everywhere feature made me want to commit seppuku thankfully that shits gone which allows you to just muck about and enjoy the game at your own pace instead of being ambushed by that kooky majima every 10 seconds i fought him about 300 times i love the yakuza games it a shame that they are not english dubbed like the originals are especialy i now know who did the english dub for majima i give a hint he a bit of a joker i never played a yakuza game wich is the best one to get on ps4 once i start with yakuza 0 is yakuza 2 next or whats the order should i play the 3 games in on ps4 im disappointed with thisthey removed some mini games like pooljeez how could they remove pool i was crying with laughter during the photography minigame still waiting on this man to crossover into tekken 7 yakuza is one of my fav series dont care about the review i already know its a great game one of the greatest video game series i have ever played and this is coming from one that has 25 years of gaming background hands down which is the best yakuza game and which one should i get first i am a huge open world fan didnt bother to scroll down but you forgot the best improvement the damn running that was my main complaint in 6 this game does not have that issue as far as costume design i like to think of it as a reflection on the new engine and just a reminder that this is an ultimate edition it really is overall my opinion is my opinion but this is a solidcomfy game and im glad theyre remastering these overlooked gems thank you sega and i look forward to yakuza 5kiwami that did not make it overseas the true yakuza 6 ending is kiryu reuniting with kaoru and forming a new life together i am a newbie to the yakuza world so i never played a yakuza game before but i am confused i know that there yakuza 0 6 and kiwami 2 out there but i am confused by the order they were released how can i play kiwami 2 without ever playing yakuza 1 or playing 6 without playing the previous games is there any way i can avoid the odd sexual stuff in yakuza zero like the womens wresting and the soft core videos that kind of stuff isnt my style im fine with odd just not sexual you only mentioned one or two minor drawbacks and gave it an 8 comon this deserves a 9 this game is a 95 wtf pretty low score for such high praise hype for pc version this is far exceeded expectation for a remake of an old game simply amazing i dont like the new combat system from 6 the using weapons and ally assisted heat moves are in yakuza 0 lmao one of the best franchises on playstation i love yakuza i love the mellowdrama in the yakuza series how the hell do you play through even 1 or two of these games and not pronounce majima correctly majeema are you kidding me dude i cant wait for yakuza of the north star this review is awesome yakuza 0 is my favorite ive played a few hours of 6 i still dont know if i like the dragon engine that much yet hmm do ya think the actual yakuza see any profits from this underrated af this game is atleast 95 on 10 will ign give credit to the youtuber who actually wrote by this review its a remake its already packed full of content and youre saying majima didnt get enough of the spotlight this game is at least a 9 oh wait its ign ill just move on best series ever i bought every 1 on ps4 cannot wait for this only three more days until release you can get a better perspective if you have played the original yakuza 2 and then understand what was actually added to this release rather than compare it to the entries that were totally designed for this gen for example there was no controlling majima sections at all in either yakuza 1 or 2 on the ps2 as old head of the series it seems kinda flawed not to compare them the original releases but i get there are tons of new players now also welcome to this incredible series new ally assisted heat move is not new had to scroll down to avoid the video spoiling even more of whats likely all the most hilarious side story content in the first 20 seconds this game doesnt deserve to continue another series this game makes no sense at all its worse than saints row and i wasnt even a fan of that game guys i have finished yakuza0 can i jump to this one directly or i have to play the first part only in japan cant wait for tuesday bros its obviously better than the 810 given in the review damn cant wait this is an 8 and yet that utter piece of garbage madden gets a 9 k a m u r o c h o not kamarucho japanese are really talented this is the panicle of sega i wonder why is it underrated maybe because the aint no english dub cant wait all the games have been great with 5 6 and 0 being my favourites got a few months of busy gaming as still need to start my shenmue hd collection but currently busy with mafia iii this goes to show that they should make the kiwami versions for 3 to 6 since they are gaining international fans from yakuza 0 that should be enough reason to take the kiwami all the way hell why not remake ishin as well only a 8 what a shitty review i think the baseball team minigame from y6 was a bit underrated i would have loved to play that again on this rather play this then shemnue lol japanese games are the best these new ign reviewers are just plain trash the sequel remake oh yes please do whoa this looks awesome so this is a remake of the original yakuza 2 haha i drank so many cheap beers in japan when i was at joy police just to beat the highscore on the toilet went out as a drunken champion im realy confused what type of missions will i be doing in story mode this just looks like alot of minigames ive never played a yakuza game and own a ps4where do i start first off dont come to ign for reviews when it comes to yakuza they dont play the game nearly as long as we fans do they dont explore the world or care about side characters these games are 9s and 10s across the board yet they give trash like destiny call of duty and fortnite high scores do not trust ign this is the best entry in the seriesstory wise and gameplay this is my favorite even in the ps2 days and seeing it remade is a a treat its a shame that critics keep comparing every single entry to yakuza 0 because its the only one they played and didnt experience the series when it first released its the very reason that it took this long for the series to gain traction in the west because back then the comparison is against gta which is just so wrong they keep yearning for the multiple battle styles from yakuza 15 there is no such thing the game is known for its extremely beatuiful narratives and voice acting grounded on mature themes its gameplay is a mix of the whimsy and outrageous japanese culture paired with a solid action rpg element i hope people wont get discouraged to play this game for 10 less youll find yakuza kiwami 2 worth more than the usual 60 mainstream games out there damn another one came out already im only like half way through zero and still need to play kiwami 1 and 6 not enough time im glad they remastered these early ones on ps4 i didnt want to hunt down older ps2 games my only question is are these remakes 0 and 6 uncensored in their us releases dislikes deserved at least a 90 wait so this is a remake of yakuza 2 im kinda wanting to get into this series but i have no clue where to start even though it was a remake of game that is two console generations old yous say that as if the crash trilogy isnt a remake compilation of games that are three console generstions old i started playing yakuza 0 recently and it has absolutely blown me away will definitely be getting this after yakuza kiwami has it released there is no reason to not buy this game except bills other than that no reason its 1 better than yakuza kawami even though you said its a lot better than kawami nice job this game looks fun as hell too ill probably play this way later burnt out on the series right now really enjoyed the first one its better version of gta i wish i can buy it but one major problem is that i cant play this game at home i feel like a new yakuza game comes out every 3 months sooo the negatives were you cant pick up weapons out of battle and the additional content is too small this sounded like at least a 910 the whole video wtf shenmue 1 and 2 hd im looking at you great series 2 is my least favorite one but still a great game kiwami will make this amazing the whole series needs to be added on pc yakuza 0 is the best ps4 exclusive by far review brought to you by the mla format superb series that consistently delivers cant wait please awesome japanese geniuses from sega i humbly ask you to release this game on pc im having a blast with yakuza 0 right now yep another yakuza game that i am gonna get why the guy on the thumbnail looks like an asian john boyega so where do i start if i want to get into these on the ps4 i am buying this game no matter what a turn down for what lol love these games just finished 0 last week if only this wasnt so close to spidey when do they fix their mystery dungeon reviews not sure why complain that he looks the same as he did 10 years ago sure he wears the same suit as always but you can say he just aged well its not uncommon especially for someone fit like kiryu this has to be the most consistent great and just plain sillyonpurpose video game series ever made i really hope this comes to pc as well im loving yakuza 0 right now on the system ign always underrate these games 87 from metacriticcom smh its yakuza 2 but with shinnier graphics and cut content greeeeet going to get this the game looks awesome hi can someone help me please im planning on getting into the series can i play all of them on ps4 is 0 a remake of the 1st one these games are underrated as hell and the devs dont get enough recognition for what they do ahhh i wanna run the cabaret club again probably pick it up around black friday i love this series cant wait to play yakuza 3 4 5 remastered damn these come out fast which should i get zero 6 kiwami 1 2 cant wait to play this game one of the best game series out there its 10 less than most releases more reason to buy it these guys know how to do a remake of a game its 80 i really really liked yakuza zero but i stopped yakuza kiwami after only few hours just buy it it got 80 youre welcome where is part 2 shieeet the details are op af gotta love the yakuza series is this a game or a movie i have yet to finish yakuza 5 on ps3 but it looks so bad slow choppy have only played 4 so far would you guys recommend i play kiwami 1 2 first and hope for a kiwami 5 can someone tell me the list of all yakuza games from the oldest to newest please ps4 or pc the orginal game had a better sound track great gameplay bro you reposting this first you better pin this 359 is which part of the game i

one purchase babyyyy platium this game is going to be hell because i dont like mini games sucks that it runs on the new engine again but eh sega at its purest yes im so hyped this is going to be beautiful kiwami 2 looks like a 0 and 6 hybrid and for that i am erect this tiger scene time index 413 it would be beyond awesome and the best thing ever made in any martialarts game if kiryuchan would really be able to morph into a tiger during combat maybe majima should be able to morph into a well mad dog during combat hahaha august 28th of 2018 will be the best d i hope they will remake 3 as well port it and port the hokuto no ken one as well is this game coming to the west i heard it wasnt but theres an english trailer from playstation so it must be coming holy crap at 336 i love that gane at the arcades that was dope as heck im actually happy that i bought the preowned games of yakuza i wasnt into the game until i played it for the first time 10 days ago the ex wrestlee chono is here love it already i want the thumbnail on a poster hell yeah now they just need to do 34 and 5 with updated visuals walks into playstation hq throws money at passersby fifty hours of majima give it

kiwami 2 looks like its made on the same engine as song of life just finished kiwami my first yakuza game ima need this one to be localized please i will personally fly down to japan myself with a brief case of one million yen walk straight into sega hq and whip open the brief case like kiryu during real estate and politely yet firmly ask for ryu ga gotoku kiwami 2 please to get this game holy moly is this dropping for na i might just buy it online aww man my high school days of playing yakuza on ps2 has jus been elevated man how i wish i had a ps4 console to play this i mean i jus saw an old sega saturn game in this omg so this is basically the most hypest shit ever with some sort of strategy mini game kiryu running a cabaret club old badass japanese men singing the majima anthem great classic arcade games and hilariousbadass heat moves man yakuza 0 and yakuza kiwami were nothing but a big demo compared to this excitement too bad the west has to wait to play this for awhile 036 kyriu never killed a man in his life im buying this for majima and majima only as a person who doesnt understand japanese all i understand from this trailer is that there are lots of mini games and also lots of majima i would love to sing along to that goro majima song holy shit yakuza is the best game series ever of all time majima looks absolutely gorgeous in the new engine he is a beautiful boy so kiryu is running club sunshine you can stick poles in peoples asses and you can have a pissing contest im in my hype levels are fucking exploding the localization cant come soon enough so we get to play as majima again then y o u r e s o p a t h e t i c hi leon i have a question i need 110100109 i need to pay this dude how i get that money fast the rts minigame looks pretty fun that gang managercommander mini game should be a mobile game online one too 049 oh no freaking way i remember her and damn this will be a wild christmas for japan i hope next kiwami is from yakuza kenzan series never manage to play that one as i doesnt have ps3 just finished playing the demo of this and i freaking loved it had to come check out a trailer and see what else is in store definitely gotta get my hands on this but the series has been going on for years do i need to play some other games in the series to follow the story or should i just play the first kiwami and then 2 this is my first time playing yakuza please release stateside are there any plans to release this in the west last time i looked it said there wasnt at this moment in time the series that just keeps on giving ubisoft take notes this is how you do yearly releases its japanese language only when is going to be english this games are my main reason to live right now man i sure wish i knew what the fuck was going on just just in the trailer but in the series in general game looks awesome glad to see the end of the kiryu saga hasnt put an end to these seiyus work as these characters they are too rich in narrative to just end btw kiryu running a cabaret club hes stepping into majima and akiyama territory i would die for you majima i really hope that your rewards for completing nightlife island are the dragon style and slugger style i just feel like going out dressed like majima goro and trolling people by popping out from unexpected places cabaret club dudes why does kiryu never age lol he looks exactly the same in 6 as an old man pushing near 50 as he does here pushing middle age lol tell me its worldwide release 144 anyone else noticed that the blue character icon is taken straight out of the smt game even the way it spins to the left and right is identical cool reference i really hope you can buy an infinite weapons upgrade when not in heat mode for majima the thumb on the look on his face was im so mad at you youre grounded hahaha they have that mumbling guy from the dont laugh series i forget his name hostess club returns oooh noooo god bless you japan you and your bizarre simulators will guide gaming into a whole new level 90s njpw stars for the win how come goro majima went back to his old style what happen to his pony tail me after seeing cabaret club minigame life is pain why does everyone says that yuki is majimas waifu and not makoto 329331 best animation tough nicob needs to react to this after the lets play i hope both the american baseball and akagi the albatrossidk the exact name substories get fixed up or get removed in kiwami 2 both those substories piss me off in yakuza 2 and also i like akosthe earth angel lady new friendship heat action so guys remember how many people were complaining about how bosses in yakuza 6 only had one health bar well the good news is is that kiwami 2 will have bosses that will have multiple health bars how much more japan can you cram into a single trailer getting this day one man i love how something about yakuza gameplay always noticeably increase every game for the better if they release the 2nd kiwami then i can finally say i have played every canon story so far i really hope this doesnt suck as bad as 6 you know your really have to give it to sega the yakuza series has always been amazing i honestly dont know how sega managed to make such a game one moment youre fighting a captain of the highest ranked crime syndicates and the next youre playing a freakin pissing minigames thats true talent i wonder what the game reviews will be on the pissing alone i just got into this series thanks to 0 and kiwami 1 so ill certainly be getting kiwami 2 once it comes out in north america next year i pretty much have to wait on this and skip yakuza 6 for the time being because i wont really be able to understand yakuza 6s story until after kiwami 2 and then i find myself a cheap way to also play 3 through 5 i dont have a ps3 so ill probably have to grab a second hand system for cheap when i have some spare spend on whatever money the question is though is the adam sidequest still a thing it better be shooting smut and pissing games love me some yakuza please tell me they will bring back yuki she was my waifu in zero also did they really add a fucking pissing minigame lol i find it funny that sega actually makes the urinal games this game lol ragdoll k i w a m i combat system look 100 same as 6 which is broker no more hype majima better has bare hand style instead of knife only what i remember fondly in yakuza 2 is kiryu as a host i absolutely loved that sidestory hope to see it make not just a comeback but extended too there are things in this world called the hell is this and this is one of them do you think the dragon style will be manually upgradable this time rather than majima everywhere west west west west west please looking forward to waifu dressup minigame again never stop being weird sega im so happy to see that they actually added virtual on the first game i played as a kid on sega saturn also the original yakuza 2 is my favorite game in the series so i cant wait to play this 344 the hell was that in the middle row on the right this better get localized to the usa like kiwami did i need it waitthis is just remastered yakuza 2 right we still punching tigers tonight right edit wepunchingtigerstonight so does majimas story take place in sotenburi again because that definitely looks like sotenburi also 345 right screen wtf is that cant fucking wait that metal guitar the combat is so updated this is too much or me i cant take it anymore we need this asap that atlus overworld icon though this is a very very safe buy ill be waiting the english version is it just me or do the faces on everyone but the main characters look even more lifeless w the dragon engine just hope they gonna realease in america soon cuz would be pain inda ass to waiting for this damn walks to sega hq throws money at building cries with happiness yknow i much as i loved the dragon of dojima style and y daiki as kaoru this actually seems perfect even with those two admittedly big flaws holy shit virtual on i wish they kept the tiger part a surprise all rise for the anthem of majima which controls is better ryu ga gotoku 6 or ryu ga gotoku kiwami virtua on holy shitttt december needs to come quicker shut the fuck up and take my money game looks incredible thank you everyone who was involved in making this game did they just sing segatas theme but replaced with majima new graphics and heat moves yeah cool looking forward to it run around as majima and take selfies ffffffffffffffffffffffff you can play as majima again in kiwami 2 this is fucking awesome dude looks like the battle gameplay similar to ryu ga gotoku 6 intresting fuck me its like japanese wrestling is becoming part of everything i like with the njpwajpw legends being in this game doesnt yakuza 6 have modern day njpw wrestlers as guest stars too cant wait for this game to come to europe ever since i played yakuza zero and kiwami im huge fan wait what kiryu is taking a pee in the game while we were playing what and idk why people dont like the dragon enginethat shit bout realistic af and not to mention i like the new approach they brought to 6 and this because it makes feel like an actual nextgen game at the sametime i gotta sayafter this dragon engine was introduced in yakuza 6 kiryus design changedchanged in a way where it makes him look older i mean i do understand the fact that hes 40 but still lol just when i thought this series couldnt get any crazier they made a mini game when youre a piss xd like what the actual fuck 100 oh i wouldnt mind that kiryu 345 is that the fuckin yakuza 0 ghost porn in the middle of the right column holy fuck this looks better than kiwami 1 im having a stroke and kiryus banana is in this game i am here for the real life pro wrestlers

people weve thrown money at to be in it angle over everything else these days and also their guaranteed cashbringerinner majima who is quickly obtaining main character status devilleon7 i think kiwami 2 may shape up to be the best yakuza2 was my favourite and seeing all this stuff that i loved from 6 and 2 and zero combined i just think itll be the best one and im so excited i cant wait till we play this dude d yeah fck everything else the real hype for this game is watching kiryu take a piss this trailer in particular is fucking fantastic oh cant wait to play this game i finished yakuza zero and kiwami 1 but i want to ask is kiwami 2 is yakuza 6 bcs ther is a yakuza 6 and i see this have the same graphics so 6 and kiwami 2 are the sameore what majima thats the reason i love yakuza today glad they doing remakes i want them to port the series to pc please i love this series so much so much contentso much hype maybe ill wait instead of importing again woah was he just filming nvm

wait all my fucking yes take my money kiryu chan running a cabaret club omfg yes yes yes im so stoked yoo im super hype for all the mini games especially when kiryu has to run a cabaret club and at 345 it shows one of the substories and kiryu watches a strange tape that has some scary chick awesome just awesome holy fuck this game looks like its going to be amazing if they maintain the last boss theme its going to be perfect they better keep the part where kiryu become a host in the game cant wait for the remade champagne call 043 oh god that thing from rgg 6s underground is back 228 is the hymn to majima i cant fucking wait for this release in the west love the fact that not only virtual on is playable but also a returning vf2 but why not vf4 kiwami 1 teased that in the sega club ingame also i have a feeling that im going to keep on failing the bathroom minigame due to laughter the idea is still redonkulous im so glad they added virtual on and brought back virtua fighter 2 best thumbnail 1010 it makes it look like a yakuza themed sitcom kiryu wont be managing marietta anymore so the most fun shit for me pissing mini game cabaret gp surprised they brought the zero version back fun shit with majima there and the dominatrix helping kiryu by throwing him a riders whip would be hilarious if it was the same chick from the zero substory i would give my right pinky for this game to be released simultaneously in the west i wish i have ps4 now this is looking more like a sequel to 0 than a simple remake of 2 god i love this series important question can we hire goromi at kiryus club 343 so kiryu went to the sotenbori video store and got spooked imma finna nut 227 all arise for majima goros anthem im so fucking pumped man sign me the fuck up yes i can finally punch

cabarete clubthen kiryu 326 you can hear bad fortuned flower if kazuma have cosplay which cosplay do you prefer tom cruise or nicolas cage 328 just think all those drinks he had in yakuza 6 paid off kiryu was really stocking on ammunition for the toilet minigame xd stfu and take my moneyim sold translate the game now any word on how you access majima in kiwami 2 is he part of the story again like

own country to rule over please play this in the japanese version when it comes out 335 i still remember that game xd really loved it when i was 4 but now im 17 trophy unlocked piss battle champion damn i need to play this lmfao yakuza its getting better and better what a time for yakuza fan hell yeah majima cabaret clubs are back also old school wresters we all know the real reason to buy this kiryu pissing simulator clan creator back with gorochan kiryu be reenacting majimas club days what is even happening anymore and did i mention the kiryu pissing simulator i mean wtf this is absurd to the absurd to the vag first 546 i wish she would just sit on my face shouldnt devilleon7 make this video yakuza kuwami 2 ps4 ps2 both great better graphics ps4 definitely wins ps2 original still very good looking game wait youre telling me the ps4 pro cant handle 60 fps i just beat this game at 144 fps on pc wtf are consoles doing one thing i noticed is that if you zoom into first person right before entering a street battle it will zoom you out and the framerate goes berserk smooth in an uncomfortable manner lmao it stays even after the fight until you zoom back in and reset it they should have use temporal anti aliasing it always work on console on ps4 especialy on ps4 pro if the dragon engine does not support the famous temporal solutionit means on the next gen console the aliasing will still exist very nice how more and more japanese devs are porting games to pc hoping to see one day the whole yakuza series on steam but by the look of things its very likely i thought kiwami was good but holy shit kiwami 2 graphics kick the crap out if it not only does the city look more alive and the feel and texture more shiny and realistic but no more loading screens when you enter a building that was a nice touch just wish they would have kept the voice dialogue in substories like they did with 6 discovered this series on pc when they ported yakuza zero now here i am having played through zero kiwami and now in the middle of kiwami 2 and these games are instantly my 2 favorite of all time just right behind unchartedwho knows perhaps ill continue on with yakuza 3 4 5 and 6 and perhaps this will be my most favorite of all time i hope they make a remake of yakuza dead souls because that game really fell short not like the other games poor comparasison where is the comparison i really hope this comes out on pc if not ill just get it on ps4 they either should have made him look younger in kiwami 2 or older in 6 he looks exactly the same for 0 it was super obvious that he was younger i actually prefer yakuza kiwami 1 metal gear solid 3 remaster please i will shill money back to konami just to see a game with less squares when youre shocked at kiryu just entering a shop then you know its gonna be good im actually curious if they will bring out 3 4 and 5 again using this new engine the third game was the first time we ever fully got to appreciate the amount of detail in the yakuza series and it be great to experience them again with the new engine heck id even play yakuza dead souls again aswell with a revamped graphics and control style playing through this now after playing 0 and kiwami and it is truly a sight to behold its one the best looking games i have ever seen and honestly the 30fps is no big deal the gameplay is so damn smooth why cut club adam so proud to be fan of this saga since day 1 every time you said sotenbori the visual was kamurocho smh is this ora ora simulator is there even a difference between the pro and regular ps4 with this game i have the regular ps4 and it looks the same if anything it looks worse but i suspect thats a result of youtube compression lazy video tbh you only googled yakuza 2 ps2 all cutscenes and didnt even bother finding or recording ps2 gameplay best game ever maybe shenmue 3 kiryu has a camo the new character for 7 isnt kiryu or ichiban its totally a new guy kiryu will have a camo no the best game in the series is yakuza 0 and thats not debatable ps2 flowers shits on ps4 flowers how sway how what you want to see starts at 315 looking at the ps2 to ps4 comparison ive gotta say i think the original still looks pretty damn great i know 3 was on ps3 but id still appreciate a kiwami remake a lot soon we will have the whole yakuza series 06 on one console wow it looks awesome hope mgs3 gets a treatment like this a big difference here id say great job i found the boss fights to be underwhelming except for the final final fight with daigo compared to 0 with the lieutenantsnishitani or nishikiyamashiwano from kiwami 1 going fist for fist was amazing i honestly thought kid daigo was harder to fight than dragon of kansai daigo from his size and presence i expected to get my shit kicked with overwhelming strength i had a glimpse of in 0 i had fought him post story majima btw but overall yeah the characters were great i found sawara kaoru and the others introduced to be a good complement to fill the story with the loss of the serena family though sometimes the some scenes were abit frustrating lacking common sense but thats so yakuza lol the fighting style was enjoyable i had a tough time fighting with kiryu in 0 and it was refreshing to see kiwami make a style comeback though i did miss my brawler style lol but thank god for the multiple cutscenes making it feel like a cinematic especially with sub stories which felt natural the best yakuza is 0 guysnot this one bad newsthere are no kiwami 3 4 5only hd version how do i heal myself without meds man i hope sega change their mind and continue remaking the rest of the games like kiwami 1 and 2 soatnboree 630 wow i didnt know that can happen talks about sotenbori while showing footage of kamurocho i prefer ps2 version if konami have any sense theyd schedule a mgs remake and have some of the best studios on earth handle their franchises it would be interesting to see the ubisoft studio that created splinter cell chaos theory make a mgs game from software make a series of castlevania games or have cave and grev make gradius and salamander games when i come onto a comparison video i expect it to show me not tell me about it the best game in the series easily i recommend playing the ps2 version too i thought it was weird that when i put on kiwami the first one and yakuza 6 on my pro kiwami has better graphics yet they used a new supposedly better engine on 6 it wasnt bad in 6 just not as good this is why dark souls remastered was lazy but ragdoll physics can be realistic where the fuck is the ps2 footage you idiot 532 thats not sotenbori thats kamurocho instant copped i will buy this right after zero xd i wanna start yakuza but do i have to play from the beginning or can i start from a certain game now imagine shenmue 3 with this engine and graphicssick this is exactly why im disappointed that ryu ga gotoko studios wont kiwamied the rest of the series i downloaded the demo of ryu ga gotoko 3 remastered and it looks really dated plus it doesnt work even as good as yakuza 0 on ps4 pro if they are too busy with fist of the north star and shin yakuza they should just give it to bluepoint only then i wont feel bad spending 30 for each game nice presentation but definitely wasnt a comparison the only things i see wrong r using the same character as yakuza 6 even though theyre atleast 10 years apart and not being able to switch fighting styles i just got yakuza kiwami for 14 and thats australian dollars thats like 4 american lol now we just need a mass effect trilogy remake this comparison video was unfortunately just a cutscene spoiler for kiwami 2 glad im already on chpt 5 because a first timer like myself would have hated seeing so much too early ive beaten 0 1 36 and watched the y2 recap but i still want the actual game to feel new to me so all this footage was a no no for those who havent played y2 what is the resolution of this game on ps4 pro sponsored by the ps4 pro i fell in love with shadow of the colossus remake it is such a great game and one of the best looking this gen talk about a great remake didnt know why sega cant do this with shenmue 1 and 2 hey man how about ps4 vs ps4 pro is the difference as bad as yakuza 6 looks good howeveri prefer the original ps2 version i like the graphics better on ps2 weird i know but whatever definitely and excellent game cant wait to see what they do next with this engine i dunno man the first kiwami did a good job at remaking the first game too imo comparison barely show any ps2 footage glad i never played the original because this game feels like its completely new to me love the yakuza series i hope they patch all this games when the ps5 comes out so they can run at 60fps resident evil 2 looks to be the best remake when is this coming to steam so i can play it at 60 fps and in 4k one the main reason to own a ps4 this series is soo good you guys should do some pixel counting kind of curious to see what rez the game runs at holy shitttttttttttt love this game series since 2005kiryuchansorry the best in the series i want a friend like hollie who just goes crazy about japanese games lol man what a fantastic game i love the yakuza series why the assassins were just standing and seeing instead of actually hitting should i get this on ps4 or pc what do you guys think remaster its a remake noob i cant believe people compare this to sleeping dogs this is disappointing this is a remake not a remaster 730 played them all except for number 2how do you miss that lol probably free on the ps plus november 2018 monthly release cant wait is this game dub to or only subtitle i would bang holly mmmmmm this game looks easy and very reptative you know what is gone in the present yakuza series fcking boss coffee damn i miss my ps2 cant wait i want to start playing this series but im confused on which to play first hmmmy least favourite in the series but still a good game also i skipped 2 myself and then got it later on after beating 1 3 and 4plus the game that shall not be mentioned is the frame rate better thats literally all i want to know watch a man profoundly confused by the concept of counting from 0 to 6 shenmue is way better that karaoke scene though do you want to unlock all skillsthen the sidequestsarenarts minigameand everything else are mandatory am i the only one who wants a kazama and kashiwagi game showing how much a badass kazama was i started with yakuza 0 im still on it which one should i play next the first kiwami then kiwami 2 and play yakuza 6 last does it matter t h i c c c aww maijma give money to his best bubby kiryuaww that so cute i love maijma so much i havent any of the others but im going to get this one them talking over the karaoke made me pop a vein she loves majima and man do i have to agree with her i love yakuza games cant wait for kiwami 2 sega doing good job but i wonder why capcom stopped making this kind of game like final fight streetwise of course it will be 30 fps with stupid physics i think you messed up the city name its actually kamurocho in this game and kabukicho irl yakuza is one the best game series i think its better than gta better story character development score kiryu kazuma with majima are some of the best gaming character i know yakuza 7 will not have kiryu but i really hope kiryu return in yakuza 8 theres so much more yakuza creators can do nobody threatens my boys but me thats majima alright 30fps trash just wait for pc release 0 and kiwami were so much better who else here has done everything in their power to ignore yakuza 2 i know nothing of the story havent watched any videos on it and ignored those recaps on each yakuza game when can we play the demo no you should honestly play them in release order much more fun that way zero has so many references that theyre lost on someone who starts with it looking forward to a kiwami 4 5 my favorite is akiyama so playing with him in a kiwami style would be amazing hollie how can we make yakuza kiwami 3 4 5 happen i will do anything i can as a fan to make it happen im just excited for the future jo amon fight as well as i am for this game put back all majimas fight styles from 0 yakuza 2 is my favorite in the series at the time it had the best story and gameplay and no holly youre not the only one who was nagging the sega people to remaster the yakuza games d pc for this please hopefully we get a demo here like we did with yakuza 6 seeing majima remember makoto and confess his love for her in the karaoke song really hit me with the feels yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 comes to pc now now every one can play a yakuza y es a nother k iwami u nderrated z ealous a lternative 2 other game titles and genres alike loe this series i didnt like 6s fighting style im worried that k2 is going to be boring too majima is life cant wait for this is that the engine they used for y6 wasnt expecting that i love these games so fun and the story is great on chapter 6 of yakuza 0 so still have yakuza kiwami and 6 to play before this one i love how non pc yakuza games are thicc i miss majima in 6 and 1 and 3 and 4 and 5 and heck we should be able to play as majima in every yakuza game let it be majima everywhere boys my first yakuza was 3 on ps3 really enjoyed it but for some reason i didnt play the others bought yakuza 0 few week ago and just finished it brillant game cant believe i waited so long defo b playing though them all this time round if you bothered to play yakuza 0 youd understand the eyepatch dave this has been my judgemental gamer internet moment for the night i would play all of then if they had made them with a english voice cast there no way i am reading my way through a huge game like that sorry but i am lazy like that stfu im trying to hear the karaoke you crumpet chuggers man cant wait at all kiwami mean ultimate if anyone is wondering okim listeningi laughed so hard dave will yakuza 34 and 5 be remade for ps4 or will they remain on ps3 going from 0 kiwami to 6 its really staggering how big the jump is graphically i know they were originally ps3 games but they still looked really good on ps4 ill have to log into my japanese account and download the demo right now i think im skipping this one this year yakuza kiwami 1 dissapointed me even tho its impressive upgraded cell phone to flip phone waiting for the sony experia with the keyboard wow looks graphically really great on of the very few games from japan worth playing these days for current gen machines for anyone unaware both yakuza zero and kiwami are both 1199 on the psstore till the 4718 perfect time to get them before this comes out gotta love it when hollie is supergeekin over majimachan i only played yakuza 6 so can aomeone explain why you play as the mad dog in this game kiryu is still my favorite character but akiyama is me second i really want to get into the yakuza series all i have heard is good things can anyone advise me on the best starting point for the series please i only have a ps4 if that matters after yakuza 6 i have felt empty when it comes to them video games it was just one of those experiences the only thing that can fix thatis another yakuza cmere bb really cant wait for kiwami 2 ive played 5 0 kiwami and 6 just keep giving me yakuza sega i will buy all of em when i was a kiddo i rented yakuza for the ps2 and had no idea what was going on half the time but still loved it shemnue and the bouncer set me up for that weird style of fighting but nothing could prepare me for the weird world and people of yakuza how tf did i miss the notification for this woo feels early i need this game rn taiko drum master is in kiwami 2 i didnt see that in there where is it how did you play as majima i played the whole main story of kiwami 2 but didnt run into the part where you play as majima i picked up 0 last week during the sale and am excited to start it i love when they hook dave and hollie up for games like this hollies otaku elation contrasted against daves bemusement is brilliant hollie i picked up yakuza 0 everything youve said is true 3 if you hate gameplay than this is the game for you is the game already out they could put 3 fight styles for majima when you just use your fists you use thug when you have a bat you use the slugger style and the bat should bat alot of hp when you go its dragon modor mad god style you whip you the knife another reason not to kill ourselves is this from the yakuza 6 engine or zero and kiwami 1s shame this series is no longer exclusive to ps4 its coming to pc im currently mid way through yakuza zero due to hollies infectious passion for the series and im really enjoying it looking forward to the rest of the series just like gta compared to the yakuza games gta v is like nyquill sorry to correct you but his name isnt pronounced kiru its pronounced keereeyou and you flipped kamurocho and kabukicho i never played any yakuza gamesi am looking forward to this one is it true that yakuza 7 doesnt have kiryu im from new zealand and i just love every single thing about theses yakuza games played yakuza 2 on playstation 2 have been hooked since my favorite would be yakuza 3 or 5 cause they were soo fun to play well all yakuza games were great gotta love it when they sing in english and transition into a music video i think holly flipped the city names kamuorocho is the ingame standin for the actual red light district of tokyo will be buying this game wheres the wonderful friday features hell yes cant wait d first can anyone tell me how to perform the one at 213 446 essence of not the mama what are the requirementspreconditions for the actions from 603 to 623 and also how do you trigger 538 is it just available from the getgo is that just a registered counterattack theres also a post floating around about unlisted moves httpswwwredditcomryakuzagamescommentsbmqgkgpsayakuzakiwami2unlistedexheatmoves but i dont see some of them described here notably essence of fast footwork raging dragon demonic spiral knockout suplex knockout throw and diving upper is the source incorrect or are they newer discoveries the lesson here never screw with kazuma kiryu i want an analytical study on which of these would kill someone oh jesus that microwave one might be the most brutal one ive seen so far that dude looked dead even before they fried his head the mash triangle ones are kinda lame tbh did that old lady just lifted a guy with not much effort one of these days kiryus gonna throw someone in front of a moving bus as a heat action how to do the 120 heat action 512 beats the actual living fuck outta himwhich essence is this how do you do the one where you press square triangle and circle a bunch of times a lot of extreme heat moves are missing 603 best example of kiryus bestiality i know its a bit late but i want to ask is judgement the only game that allows you heat action ex actions multiple enemies cause i played judgement first than started yakuza 0 and kiwanis 2 and find out most of the heat actions are focused on one person 633 don patch swords 421 granny picks up a fully grown man without difficulty typical japanese over the top bullshittery would you believe me if i said you missed a heat move in the coliseum had kiryu and komaki push two guys backto back and then they both kneed the two of them in the face its super rare because ive only seen it once and i think it involves grabbing an npc from behind but im not sure edit found a reused animation not shown in this video that you can usually see very often in yakuza 0 its the suplex into facestomp from friend heatmove everyone the heat moves are unrealistic me what the hell body products does kiryu use to stay so fucking young looking those ally heat actions are impossible to pull off 1041 john wick would be pround of him is anyone here like the sound effect i know fight choreo is fucking good but the sfx is really fucking good beside 1014 my favorite heat action dude you left out lot of the heat actions including the feel the heat ones the editing on 412 got me i thought we were setting up for some kind of mythical ultimate 6man tagteamtakedown finisher and now im a little disappointed that wasnt the case 720 sauce fatality ftw d 713 i love how after being step on guy also smiling while crying was that naito and tanahashi no way 1014 kinda interested to see kiriyu do that on majima d so how do i preform the heat action at 512 whats the exact combination at 712 i thought prodz the youtuber and voice actor was in the game how do you do the move at 0539 kinda wish he did the bat heat action from 0 and kiwami i thought 109 was tuco salamanca from breaking bad maybe not lol i wonder if they can make an anime out of this series 347 i know nothing about japanese but i think that he just told the store clerk to turn the thing on considering what happens nextoof most impressive thing about kiryu hes able to keep that white suit in pristine condition never a speck of dirt or a spot of blood on it perfection toilet plunger one oh my god lol you miss lots of extreme heat moves 1012 how does the body move towards kiryu 345 translation heat this junk up 220 and 433 are my favourite the best how to defense yourself 639 even been so mad that you wanna smack people with leeks how to you do 510 i know in 6 you spam square and the prompts come up i think you forgot some the four sidestepping extreme heat moves 538 all time favorite from 0 cant believe they brought it back my all time favorite im really disappointed they havent brought back the baseball bat heat action from either 1 and 2 or predragon engine i honestly prefer the one from 1 and 2 though tbh yes they brought back all the removed heat actions from 6 633 i came here for this 156 he has the heat from 0 that was my favorite one 828 what is that a popsicle hi how i gett all the heat actions u can do on 6 and the new heat actions with the golf baseball with the double wood weapo and with the bigwood cracher weapon and stuff can you change his clothes are you willing to make a video of the ryuji fightspreferably the final but the first is fine i love a good mirror match i cant be the only one who checked their discord after 2 seconds in awesome mod though you did a great job this mod sucks why cant you steal their bonton jk this is masterclass i love it holy shit this is amazing yay for ryuji ohh thats hot 2129 money money money 2045 sound effect in every yakuza games yayoi sounds a bit like nico robin or ritsuko akagi 10840 wheres majimasan when you need him always need a friend who can speak to his nephews teachers sisters hubbys twin brothers mahjong friend man this game bored me to death kiryu felt like side character jammed as a protagonist in this one never came close to give a fuck about the story and after the brilliant yakuza 0 such a let down great video man thanks so much for uploading i hope your gameplays improved by now you should utilise sidestepping more kiryuu has a baby to take care of stop bothering him finally you can lock on thank you son no one thinks us elders these days now i can read dialogues because i dont have arms to stop the video sorry for reading 1231321 times slower than a normal person but its okay youre waiting for me thank you again i peacocked your mom youre reading the dialogues too slow thanks santos your the only yakuza player i watch for a reason great skill level dont you have a pro then you can record it in 60 fps the other videos have been made private and thanks for bringing the yakuza series back 413 you were meant to get the knife though combat i just straight up bought it from the pawn shop 6 and kiwami 2 would be my favourite if they didnt ruin the combat system best and most thorough kiwami 2 review ive seen bravo its difficult to explain the joy of playing a yakuza game its only because yakuza kiwami was free on psn that i played it and found that i loved it i love watching kamurocho change through the years my second video of yours after sleeping dogs why did youtube recommendations hide you away for so long you have a new subscriber is there any gay option like gay sexkissing or gay parlor or any other gay thing in this game no more kiwamis what i didnt knew this and its very sad i cant help but feel like this ignores how terrible the plot of this game was saying its a great plot the buff men still rip their shirts off is very dismissive of the way that new fans like me felt about zero zero built up this idea that these games had good plots and so far as got me to buy kiwami 1 and kiwami 2 expecting another great story but getting contrived nonsense remember that time the chinese kidnap haruka in 1 and so kiryu heads over and beats them all up and you have a boss fight with sword man what about that other boss two gun man who kills off characters that are barely mentioned again yakuza 2 was hyped up to me as where the series truly got its identity and yet the plot is mind numbing in the way that i feel like i am only expected to pay attention when the buff mens shirts come off and everything else is secondary kaoru bounces between talking like a hardass cop and acting like useless set dressing so frequently that its ridiculous good sequel but yakuza kiwami and yakuza 6 the song of life are the best yakuzas also yakuza 4 your reviews are so on point like a pole up a street thugs ae i definitely prefer kiwami 2s combat system i love throwing people into stuff or off the bridge in sotenbori i remember playing yakuza 2 on playstation 2 picked it up at block buster and it was one of the best gaming decisions i made i like all the kiwami games they seem to be clones if each other which is awesome because the graphics are awesome and the formulas great the storyline reminds me of the out rage movies these games make you want to go to japan too bad my pc is crying while playing this game been with this series since 2006 mein the combat was pared down to emphasize impact sorry dude but thats completely off the mark they couldnt make the combat as complex because they were starting over with a new engine id say john wick is the yankee kiryu best story for kiryu i agree with kiwami style remakes of 3 4 and 5 but for every ryu ga kotoku nerd like myself whod buy it i dont sega would break even on the expenditure that and once i finished kiwami 2 hence all of them inc dead souls spin off i was done there have been a lot released close together and you risk burning the formula as is considering judgement is still a similar style game in concept kiryu is the japanese john wick clicked like and share right then and there i wish they kept the old fighting styles though i loved kiwami 2 is there going to be a third one on pc i was sad there was no different fighting styles but its still fun yakuza 0 the pier soothing sounds i admire kiryu so much as a man i want to be more like him he really is a hooligan with the heart of gold this game was my most anticipated game for 2017 the yakuza series has the best story lines i have ever played in a video game i pirated 0 kiwami and kiwami 2 and could not finish any of them the games are just so damn boring i myself would prefer a yakuza 34 and 5 remaster because i never had a ps3 i want to experience them as they were back then just with the higher resolution now ki whammy bruh as someone who started the franchise with the pc releases i really dislike the fighting aspect in kiwami 2 in comparison to yakuza 0 or even 1 i didnt do every side mission to the fullest in 0 to unlock legend both for kiryu and majima but i know those exist but the characters were already extremely fleshed with their 3 fight styles in kiwami 2 unlocking basic stuff is essential to make the fights at least tolerable it possible pc get 36 series i didnt really care yakuza 35 not got kiwami version i just want play all series the perfect goat talkin about goat too ah yes hostess club manager 2 amazing game second only to hostess club manager zero kiwami storywise was a great game it had lots of content to play around in the only problem i have with the game was the removal of the battle styles which made the game seem so much more boring in yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 i skipped only a very few battles but in kiwami 2 i noticed skipping tons of battles and only due to the fact that the battles felt boringly same all the time even after unlocking new abilities for kiryu im currently playing yakuza 0 i know that im late and im blown awayits easily one of the best game of the generation along with bloodborne ds3witcher 3 the hearts of stone dlc and shadow of the collosus remake y0 is my first yakuza game and i cant decide what to buy nextkiwami 1 and 2 or the brand new ip judgement coz im short of moneyany help will be appreciatedsuggestions hey i dropped a like but havent watched it as ive not cleared it yet but im sure its as good and as informative as your others keep up the good work man recently brought to the pc disables motion blur blessed despite all this the game is unfairly underrated and underappreciated the entire series is a aaa builted masterpiece and goty worthy its one of the true definitive video game franchise out there truely sucks that people compares this to gta and some nowadays even go far to ask if it has battle royale mode which gives me temporary heart cancer i liked 6 well enough but the combat was bit of a let down for me because they had new engine there were only one style whit few moves winch you do over and over again and side quest not so compelling story was solid as f i hold y zero as an best in the series it nailed in mind everything kiwami 2 was better 6 but still suffer under a bit at same problems thou side quests were better i am looking forward to judgement they showed they had at least 2 styles there so it is coming along nicely hopefully they add styles more and more as games come story in typical yakuza fashion is gonna be great as usual i disagree whit you on point y35 rerelease somewhat at least yes i would like to see them in dragon engine but not of the cost of those styles and perhaps other content they would have to do again and i know something would be lost in that mix because yakuza games are developed way too fast look at the time span we got these games and how many we got including fist of t 002 underrated scene why cant i find a gif of this i know i sound weird so i played zero and kiwami using pads its fun but my veins are rooted in mouse and keyboard in kiwami 2 they refined this i feel like that blessed cdpr touch smooth m s controls on my fingers flowing through my body im just happy they did this thanks sega the worst part of kiwami 2 apart from the clearly reduced budget and unvoiced sub stories was that you couldnt watch that drinking an animation directly from the vending machine sure there is a mechanical advantage but why not let us have the option to drink it right then i really hope they change it back the whole ending scene was stupid yakuza 0 is the best in the series i cant really say i agree with your assessment of the dragon engine sure it looks nice but the performance on consoles is pretty bad and the overreliance on physics makes combat a much clunkier affair than in the later ps3 era titles i always jump back and forth between yakuza 0 and kiwami 2 for my favourite in one hand kiwami 2 has the best stuff and was the turning point for the franchise while zero was such an amazing introduction with an original story that filled in many blanks the greatest money shot of all time at 322 kiwami 2 is my favourite yakuza ive just played kiwami and 6 but holy shit the story the world and all the side content is incredible that club mini game best mini game ever this is the game that made really love the franchise waiting for the remasters of the other games and obviously judgement in a few weeks hyperbithero and thegamingbrit are gonna be so mad haha kiwami 2 is basically a true love letter to kiryu as a protagonist since y6 was a goodbye to him and his legacy kiwami 2 was a celebration of his character like you highlighted here in your review it really hammered in why i love kiryu and why he is personally my favourite character of all time its also the main reason this game is fighting for fave spot with yakuza 0 i think it might just be winning though kiwami 2 did make a list of changes that werent received favourably from those who followed the series for a long time or played the classic a particular area from the original game was removed the music when remixing or replacing classic tracks had mixed reception and there were more smaller details that were criticised but playing the original isnt exactly easy when it was only ever localised for playstation 2 its muchimproved optimised playstation 3 rerelease as part of the ryu ga gotoku like a dragon 12 hd collection was released domestically with no english language support with emulation the only alternative i myself remain eager to make my start with the series from the original titles as i want to feel the hype of reaching zero seeing the series reach one of its highest peaks but kiwami 2 certainly has much to offer by itself its original tracks were received well we got more sub stories majima and now its pc port provides the opportunity to yakuza is by far one of my favorite video game series ever playing yakuza 0 was one of the best choices in my life and it also led me to preordering kiwami 12 on pc i havent felt this immersed into a videogame its characters and their numerous stories for quiet a long time the best thing is that there are still 4 games coming out 311 got me a bit confused ps i noticed a certain lack of majima love your videos though keep it up the goat talking about the goat series again kiwami 2 is personally my favorite yakuza game improved systems from 6 a great story with one of the best antagonists in the series bombastic and silly as hell such a fun game bursting with that yakuza charm having already played yakuza 2 on my ps2 back then i really hope the pc release of kiwami 2 will be followed by yakuza 6 which ive never played crossing fingers as hard as i can so wish shenmue3 was made with their engine waiting on a yakuza spinoff starring all my favorite essay boys my only gripe with the game aside from the combat which have been severely streamlined from previous games is the amount of plot twists the game throws at you at the last second for not really a whole lot of reasons im fine with a few twists and turns like what they did in 0 but here it just ended up kinda pissing me off maybe its just me if youve played the game youd know what im talking about i never played the original yakuza 2 so i dont know if the story is all that different if violence isnt solving your problems youre not using enough absolutely love the yakuza games if you have not played them you can begin with any game they all begin with a recap of the previous story like a tv series but if you really want to begin at the beginning yakuza zero is the canonical beginning of the story never clicked so fast on a notification btw keep up the good job first so i recorded thursday but i needed another day to make something extra stupid for this finale i apologize for what youre about to watch its a blade but with fire on it so its better x not as good as 0 and dont feel as much as 1 with nishiki especially side quest that were good were few good to see daisaku kuzes theme in the credits nice kitchen i dint know you have a beautiful voice nico i like that the opening for the ending ep is special im only commenting to make the number of comments precisely 100 turn on captions for when nico sings in the intro bomb timer finishes kuze theme plays now im motivatingly sad to punch kuze in the bloody face nico that intro was the most brilliant thing ever cant way for yakuza 3 p ironically 3 takes place at the start the day after 2 but yeah i do look forward to your playthrough of it currently playing through it on the ps3 then will go through 456 as im to impatient to wait and if i do ill fail my beat 7 games before my college semester endsbut yeah great series looking forward to more dude thank you so much for this time for kingdom hearts i would love to see another yakuza game with kiryu but after 6 they obviously cant or the ending to 6 would be pointless but if they did id hope they bring koaru back and if theyd even remember each other an end to another great series now a part of me wants to look up a lets play of yakuza 3 but another wants to wait for kiwami 3 for nico to do a lets play on it use captions in the intro gotta admit the go ryu being the half brother thing kinda surprised me i was sorta expecting it to be the host dude with the doppleganger from the jingweon wait at 5012 5152 isnt it the unreleased soundtrack from yakuza 0 you can always go back to it i just want to celebrate the name of the very good guy of kamurocho nishida this guy is always following majima in all his weird ideas and never get the reward he deserves but he is still here such a great boy this is my favorite previously on segment of anything ever please consider gravity falls i want a metal gear solid 3 lets play please i havent played yakuza 36 yet but so far yakuzo 0 is still my favorite i felt it was a lot less cheesy than kiwami 12 but i like the new stuff in kiwami 2 kid icarus uprising for next series pls just he needs to see the glory of that voice acting ryuji has to now be one of my favorite antagonist of all time he is such a great villain even with how little screen time he has me when episode 22 releasedi can catch up this series my business nope you wont be able to react to the final episode when it releases how could someone be so unaware how loud and obnoxious they are imo i think there would be more of an impact had terada actually died because by learning that terada had planned his own assassination and actually died just so he could manipulate kiryu into fulfilling his requestdying wish would show how dedicated the jingweon mafia is for revenge overall great game ive only known the yakuza series0 kiwami 2 july of this year yet it makes me feel as if ive known it for a long time alright finally ive finished watching this lp and i doubt that anybody will see this comment but i just want to tell first of all thank you nico for yet another cool and highly enjoyable lp and secondly for some reason i dont know maybe i just have a very dry soul and no heart but i find that i cant hold tears when i see family members and close friends dying or separating against their will but lovers fuck no a lover dying who gives a shit remember the end of kh1 sora and kairi separating eyes roll whatever riku staying behind im crying like a little bitch why is that i wonder probably has something to do with the fact that i havent dated anyone in my life and im 24 lol well anyways does anybody else feels that way please give umineko a try its a fantastic visual novel that ive been hoping to see you check out for years now that was glorious i hope im not being too pushy saying this i truly believe you like 428 shibuya scramble what happened to the kh video you uploaded i mean i watched it but still kinda confusing with you not leaving any messages on community hey nicob i have a question as fan of your channel i love your stuff but recently i saw one of your videos that peaked my interest i believe it was the one that where you reacted to damions video of kingdom hearts union x that video really interested my curiosity but then afterwards when i was going to refresh the page to watch it again it said video is unavailable or some other thing of that natureso tell me where is that new video at nico whats wrong with the latest kingdom hearts video did you get copyright strike or something you know one thing i loved about the credits kuzeeeee uoooooohh 13600 actually nicoyes you can all but one yakuza game will let you play ng on the hardest difficulty the sole exception being dead souls with the dead souls difficulty and as someone who experienced that difficulty first hand it is a literal definition of a rape train to be brutally honest and im talking about the area where you do the fucking tutorial in even worse you dont get any checkpoints you die you go back to where you last saved your game 14812 actually second yakuza game to have an english dub since the very first game the first would actually be fist of the north star lost paradise another game you should keep an eye out for one of your lp while it wasnt anything to write home about id dare say that them dubbing that game is probably what made sega decide to bring back the dubs it also uses the same game engine as yakuza 0 but plays differently even though the dragon engine was a thing by the time this game out the reason why they went wi can you play valkyria chronicles its short kinda i really hope you play hollow knight next i would love if you would watch another anime it is of course completely fine if you want to continue to just play games but if you do want to react to another anime i would personally recommend assassination classroom it is a lot like angel beats in that it is a mix of comedy action and feels but unlike angel beats assassination classroom had an amusing story and very good pacing you should play the professor layton series or doki doki literature club hey nico i dont want to rush you or anything but if and when you can can you play south park the stick of truth trust me it is a game that you are going to love you may have to censer something at the very end of the game tho buts its not that big of a deal literally me and my freinds love your work and i hope that you willl be able to acomplish your work soon like if anyone agrees about the game i mean ng on persona 5 going into merciless is not as cakewalk as youd think ng would be the intro was amazing nico hey mods i know were not at that point yet but please get nico to play dead souls after the 4th game it has its problems but its still a yakuza game worth experiencing also if he ever does get to play dead souls tell him to avoid the installation screen and probably send him the box case without the boxart itd be nice if we could make it a surprise for him i really dont want nico to skip dead souls even if its the weakest yakuza game its still the classy yakuza game we know and love just with shitty gameplay on hardware too weak to handle the game the heck this slipped past my sub box nico singing bakamitai yes we have been blessed so im probably late to help decide the next game but im going to keep my recommendations 1 dust an elysian tail its a relatively short game probably around 10 hours 20 if you go for 100 and its amazingly well done i would say its an indie game with as much effort or maybe more than the likes of undertale but this just kinda went under the radar its a metroidvania game but overall an amazing one 2 tales of berseria to be honest i havent finished this game myself yet but what ive played is absolutely fantastic apparently its a 40 to 60 hours game and probably way more if you want to 100 but still an amazing game through and through and definitely something worth checking out absolutely loved it thanks so much nicob watching your playthrough was an absolute delight and i cant wait to see more stay classy have a happy holiday and a happy new year maybe devil survivor 2 is game you could do in the future its been fun watching you grow and learn through these yakuza playthroughs i really respect the amount of effort you put into this last bakamitai and it was really nice to hear your clear diction while singing on pitch nico theres a horror game that i found out about that is like if you mash up danganronpa with corpse party heres a quick summary you play as a boy who keeps his face covered because of an accident but immediately after he moves into his new home with his dad a murder takes place the boy and some new friends of his try to solve this mystery then uncover something a bit creepy the occult and the paranormal are real nico please play the paper mario series radiant historia for next lp please or pq or kid icarus or ff7 crisis coreplease this opening is the best none can top this even though i know little to nothing about it im ready for xenoblade chronicles 2 any time now will you play dream drop before kh3 is released first off its christmas right now yakuza is a christmas game because they all more or take place during christmas second i thought karou was holding a baby after the credits finally nico play yakuza dead souls after kawami 3 you should play one of the professor layton games its a puzzle game with an absolutely amazing story and unique characters and i think youd really enjoy it i recommend trails in the sky bravely default utawarerumono id love for you to start xenoblade 2 now nico id be able to give you alot of insight on the games japanese names and other tidbits of facts as you play through it itd also give me a reason to play it again as i have still yet to actually finish it and start the dlc as theres alot of sidequests to do you should tackle trails in the sky already that game is basically made for you that was the greatest intro a note on godas death as he said he was fading fast and later said one way or another would have meet death the 1 bullet he took was incredibly close to his heart even if he agreed to not fight and agreed to stay as calm as possible to slow his heart rate to reduce bleeding and went to a hospital it woulda been to late for him as it would been to dangerous to operate im purely going of the wounds entrance and exit wound so obviously he went out the way he wanted he went out fighting to the end and loving every moment the fact that that he fought for 6 minutes after having such a would is a feat of strength that is inhuman it is true a feat of strength only a dragon could have i was going to make fun of nico for replacing scotch with milk then it was shown to be egg nog im currently drinking nog myself so all i can do is raise my bottle and have a cheer with nico i can make fun of you for drinking from a glass though gotta chuck the bottle bitch itd be awesome if you played professor layton or layton vs ace attorney great lets play as usual as for shorter games to wait till kh3 i would like to suggest paper mario marioluigi superstar saga harmoknight detective pikachu or grim fandango i just have to let you know nico with so many games recently i just have to recommend the project x zone series less for the story and gameplay but rather the banter of being a massive crossover game project x zone 2 in particular has characters from phoenix wright xenoblade chronicles and yakuza in this one game ex phoenix and maya will interact with kiryu amd majima ft fiora maybe this will spark the interest xd an amazing finale i think can agree with the people that say ryuji is the best antagonist of the series 0 is still my personal favorite but this game was pretty awesome too kiyo nico ryoma and i read a fanfic it involves a crossover with danganronpa and smash bros ryoma yeah it was cool but the 2nd story still got a waaaaaaaays to go kiyo you should make a fanfic at fanfiction dot com miu yeah and add me to it in a cameo so i can show my bare nake kiyo stabs her ryoma welp mius dead again nico you should totally play no more heroes it would be really funny ryujis eyes when he was telling kaoru to leave is soulcrushing cant we get fanart for these two just doing friendly sibling stuff i refuse to believe that karaoke score was a 100 after all where were the lively interjections being serious though that was great nico one of the best finale intros shoot i forgot to leave suggestions in my last comment gravity rush is pretty short and would fit in with a lot of the games youve played the sequel even has some nier related dlc my other recommendation is drakengard 3 its technical problems aside i feel like its writing humor characters and story would be right up your alley and since youve already played nier youve already gotten a taste of the whole multiverse shit the game and series is about as much as id love for you to do drakengard 1 and 2 i think that 3 would be a much better starting point for you if you even decide to go back and do those two at all fire emblem awakening would be a good game too try out thank you for such a great lp nico as for what comes next maybe layton vs wright well nico i want to suggest you give mystical ninja on n64 a try its a weird japanese 3d adventure platformer which plays kinda similar to ocarina of time its also short i think you could beat it in 10 hours or so i recently played kid icarus uprising and am honestly spooked by the amount of people requesting it were these requests always here and im just now noticing them idk im just startled kiryu got them uwu eyes omg here comes that copyrighted song again i really enjoyed watching the game but i dont know the whole premise for the very last fight was stupid to me i mean come on dont be stupid men who would die just for a bit of pride or some stupid thing beacuse for all they knew it would have blown im probably in the minority here though but it really made me feel less sad and more thinking how streotipicaly manly they are if someone can give me a counter argument i will be happy to see it i want to be proven wrong actually steins gate 0 is the game i want nico to play i would love for the next lp to be a continuation of the to the moon franchise judge eyes is releasing in the summer in yakuza 3 a certain k chan is returning obviously not kiryu because duh he the main protagonist you can order the full japanese version of yakuza 3 remastered right now off of playasia ill be perfectly honest the opening of this whole lp is amazing with the pictures truely the most varied opening segments in your lp repertoire my favorites being pirahna plant licking shadows tears the ohhhhhhhhhh face meme you found in mm and this for your act if anyone who is known for compalations make one of the yakuza kiwami openings this man just recareated the baka mitai cutscene perfectly he deserves at least a million subs by this point its funny i totally thought the explosion with majima was done by nico thats what i expected from nico to do tales of berseria someday would be amazing im sad that ryuuji died i really wanted him to return in future games iiiiiih hes gonna watch the remaining story for khux and hopefully do the classic kingdom minigames so he gets the starlight keyblade i got no idea if you got an xbox 360 but if you do plz play alan wake love that game and would love to watch you play it please play shenmue wait its already ended holy moly its faster than i expected i was kinda hoping itll last 20 episodes longer but alright well then see you guys in yakuza 3 kiwami can you play a game called detroit become human i feel like it is an extremely good game and that you would enjoy the story ooooo yes imma jump on the bandwagon and say play kid icarus uprising i think youll really enjoy it its a lot of fun plus kinda short and also with the amount of voiced scenes you could give your own voice a break if you need it i recommend edit if not kid icarus uprising then bayonetta is a good choice disgaea pc please they cant make cry more than i already did with makoto and her brother 12330 oh fuck me i cant wait for the translation of the yakuza 3 remaster i have the yakuza 3 remaster import form japan but i dont speak japanese i know i dont comment much but kid icarus uprising or bayonetta would be awesome nico please play the legend of heroes trails of cold steel thats a pseudo persona but its unique enough to stand on its own feet also i think that with this games length you will be able to finish the game just before kh 3 comes out random thought is kiryu a virgin i would love to see you do a root letter lp next would be hokuto ga gotoku while y3 isnt released yet where kiryus in a universe where he can kill on a daily basis is there hope for a persona q playthrough or if that is too long how about a small celeste playthrough late comment but persona 3 please i noticed you havent put it one your playlist unless i didnt see it and im wrong but i want to see you play the game that they shoot their heads to summon their personas nico you look like someone from a disney channel movie well if you get too impatient to play another yakuza game there is still fist of the north star lost paradise to play nico that intro was pure gold never change man never change this game was nothing short of fantastic its easy to see why yakuza 2 was so many peoples favorite entry as for what to lp next since everybody else is throwing out their suggestions here are all of mine in no particular order ffvii crisis core for obvious reasons okami because it is a great game that deserves more attention bayonetta 12 the second is better than the first but i still recommend playing both kid icarus uprising because everybody else is suggesting it and i heard good things about it pokmon main series i recommend starting from the ds era and onward pokmon platinum has a soft spot in my heart but in my opinion pokmon black and white have the best story in the series so far heartgold and soulsilver are great remakes of what many consider their favorite entries in the series the 3ds era games are good omega ruby and alpha sapphire being the best loved this play through as well but the time has come again will you do the honors of playing fire emblem awakening my dude nicob well since you asked heres some games you could consider in the future not necessarily for the next lp since i couldnt think of a short enough game to play it to completion before kh3 launches xd but heres some games i think you would like very much paper mario 64 paper mario the thousand year door super paper mario fire emblem path of radience ikes fire emblem lunar silver star story complete megaman x command mission super mario rpg the legend of zelda wind waker rune factory persona 1 and 2 south park stick of truth and fractured but whole finding paradise bayonetta kid icarus uprising kirby games in general octopath traveler golden sun and for now thats abou it if i remember something else il add it later xd im down for kid icarus uprising though i hope fire emblem awakening will get its time one day nico ugh finally u can play yuzkua sing along i been waiting even since i find out there was another yuzkua ya you actually did the scene what a mad lad nothing gets kiryu more aroused than blood loss and the threat of imminent death hes been hanging around majima for too long i get the feeling if you are have fun with this you are sure going to have fun when judge eyes come to west doing mostly the same thing xd why not try bayonetta both entries are pretty short and could help to tide over your stream of content until kh3 of course assuming you havent already played them so what have we learned today kids if you a brother in a yakuza game you a goner motherfucking die oh wow that song at the beginning was epic now that youve finished the game you should check out the full length english version of the majima construction anthem on the playstation youtube channel ps3 lives and works without crashing too guess whos ready for this shit to end god ive seen that ending 3 times twice in my own playthroughs and once here i still tear up when kaoru and ryuji are talking while hes dying and again when kiryu and kaoru are embracing each other so beautiful i too was fearful that she would die after all kiwami kinda taught us every main character dies the music a scattered moment really is so powerful in the context of the final fight and is one of my favourite boss themes ever you said baka mitai needs to be sung naked and yet at the start you had clothes on what the heck nico i dunno how i feel about this haha jokes awesome voice man ive pretty much played the entire series at the same time as you and have platnimed 0 kiwami and kiwami 2 and for the kiwamis at least you can indeed use new game for legend which really does make it a cakewalk i am also keen for a break like you said too much of a good thing but am also keen to see more of the characters i love and your reactions to them as well i dont have any wifiii nicoo plzzzz give me dwld this vidd this was dumb af trails in the sky or mario and luigi super star sagabowsers minions play steins gate 0 el psy congroo ffxv next please wait is kazuma his first name isnt it his last name when they say their full name they say the last name first right im just crazy a real manoughta be stupid at that moment i fell in love to ryuji i see a lot of requests for kid icarus uprising if by chance you do that one i hope you have a bigger 3ds to play it on nico you should do a sunless sea play even if just as oneoff its a great game that deserves your attention i also want to add to what you said about the comment of the day i think it really helps connect everyone learning about other penguins and getting some good conversations going its also good for the newcomers because they are included in the chance of becoming comment of the day and thereby included in the community and the oscar goes to 100 imagine if at the middle of the epic fight kiryu was like no one can defeat the dragon of dogima ever game crashes noooooooooooooooo wadanohara and the great blue sea please every comment ive seen has some sort of hint of nico wanting to play kid icarus uprising lol hey nico you should try digimon cyberslueth it is a good game i think i cried more in this finale of yakuza than nicos other ones also steinsgate next please nicob i love all of ur videos and the into to them like this is the best and funniest into to day thank you so much nicob for these yakuza lets plays its one of my favorite series both as a game and you doing as a lets play i look forward to you playing 3 4 and 5s remasters as well as 6 plus the judgement spin off and potentially fist of the north star lost paradise also keen to see some of the yakuza persona and xenoblade characters as part of the council of voices some day to the moon pleaseeee did you have someone record you doing that for you howd you explain this to them if that was the case play sonic adventure since this is the end lets talk about kiryus moveset if he were to ever be included into smash his gameplay will revolve around the heat gauge taunting blocking or hitting an opponent will build it where as using heat actions using moves that are boosted through the heat gauge or taking hits will reduce it it will use zeros three heat bars and climax is obtained when all three bars is filled up preventing drainage from taking any damage climax heat will expire in 10 seconds and does not boost his stats unlike clouds limit gauge neutral b sidestep a simple sidestep kiryu will hunch over inputting left or right will make him go either way any blocked or whiffed attacks can be cancelled with a sidestep no bars will not have any invicibility frames use one bar to have invincibility frames like any normal dodge would use a second heat bar to immediately act out of the animation up b komakis catlike reflexes instead of using this to recover from a kno i see people recommending kid icarus uprising and i love that suggestion im still hoping for nico to play devil survivor 2 but kid icarus is one of my favorite 3ds games and id love for nico to experience the humor and story in that game my faith in humanity is restored everytime i see someone acknowledging egg nog can we please get a baka mitai nicob version octopath traveler give it a look youll love it oh no nico got into the egg nog the metal gear parallels continue to pile up a dark haired hero and a lighter haired villain with the same nickname face off on a elevated hight bare chested and wounded theres only room for one dragon and one big boss intro appears already know its another good video kid icarus uprising or crash bandicoot insane trilogy i actually thought nico edited in the ending of the majima bomb defusing scene i loved the ruyji fight that was a amazing final battle i also would like nico to play path of radiance its a good game and i think nico would like it also a death counter for the units he loses would be a nice touch since it has permadeath and when she smiled a smile sadder than any frown i felt my heart shatter terada comes out of nowhere shoots karou haha i faked my death again okso ryuuji is always liek i dont want to fight you all weak but he keeps on sending his goons after him and he goes to challenge him right after his henchmen attack and is like i dont wan to fight you like this but in that casestop sending people and just go yourself xd fist of the north star lost paradise it has more kiryu voice its appropriate that this final episode has all the snow due to christmas anyway my suggestion for an lp is either crisis core or spiderman ps4 those 2 games are really good and they are not that long have u ever played forza horizon 4 its basically cars xd its fun tho play it i cant believe there is no ryuji persona 5 joke in here honestly if had to choose a game for nico to play in the future i really hope you decide to play kid icarus uprising itd give more insight on the characters for when you you see the palutenas guidance on smash ultimate besides its a nice short 9 chapter game id think youd enjoy that or hyperdimension neptunia trust me youd love it nico its even got its own anime for you to react to if you want and if you do watch the dub it wont disappoint notices the new two hour long video hmm do i have time for this its midnight i have a christmas party to go to tomorrow followed by a trip to the dentist and last minute shopping before the holidays realizes this is the final yakuza 2 episode yeah i got time starts video goddamn first ocarina of time and kiwami finish at the same time now majoras mask and kiwami 2 weve found the perfect pair one game i would love to see nico lp is either tales of berseria or xenoblade chronicles 2 nico should sing more often imagine the game crashing during the bomb counting down resulting the bomb crashing game 000 hello friends please put on automatic captions for the song you will not be disappointed i love this so much where the doodle is the majima statue i want to recommed and suggest odins sphere for ps4 i thought that was a really cool game and one you might enjoy i also love the intro guess ill throw my own in here have you ever played the time splitters series preferably 2 and 3 that singing is acceptable for a day delay top notch lets play as always i loved this series dude finale was something too just wanted to recommend playing crosscode at any point in the future i think youll like it this last episode makes me want a kiwami ryuji goda penguin plush especially since the last prelude fight scene you know the villains in these games really are something you got keiji shibusawa the all business no bullshit dojima lieutenant from an early age hed seen what the criminal world was like and held no ideals about it or what it could be all that mattered to him was victory hes nearly the opposite of everything kiryu stands for believing that you need to take what you want in life quiet calculated and someone who represents some of the darkest parts of the yakuza world yet still competent and very good at what he does not falling into the same selfindulgent pitfalls kuze and awano did he probably couldve taken over the tojo clan one day without changing a single thing akira nishikiyama the fallen hero and the guy who thoroughly ruined kiryus life i honestly love nishiki and its a shame he wasnt used better he and kiryu once stood together against the world if necessary until he lost everything he was left with no one to fight for but himself a are we ever gonna reach yakuza 4 5 and 6 nicob fist of the north star or are you gonna stop yakuza type for awhile the actual awesomeness aside this ending always gets me kiryu and ryuji fight kiryu and now ive defeated ryuji terada ah you see this whole game has been according to my keikaku kiryu beats up terada and his goons takashima ah but you see that keikaku was all a part of my keikaku ryuji murders his shit kiryu and ryuji fight again but with injuries ryuji dies kaoru and kiryu guess well just fuck until this bomb kills us game and then they died except not really that was a joke terada like i said keikaku bitch simplified butkinda what happens thanks for the lp of yakuza kiwami 2 im so glad kaoru didnt wind up dying but was heartbroken that her whole family was basically wiped i was hoping that ryuji would pull through the ending so the siblings could at least start over in being a family sadly that was not the case i started crying when he sent her down in that elevator their looks held so many feelings in them for the next lp im kind of hoping youll pick fire emblem awakening it was my first game from the series and i think it would be a nice game to start bravely default is another choice i love the combat system of these games and hope you have a chance to check it out i kind of would like to see you return to finding paradise the to the moon sequel it might be a nice break from the long lps youve been doing whatever you wind up doing next though i know ill be ready for your hilarious shenanigans thanks for the continued joy you bring to us honestly you couldve split the video in half then post it on the same day to dodge the copyright strike soy boy nico lets all take a moment and think that majima construction was able to build something much higher then the millennium tower just from searching stuff in the internet id love to see some tits on your channel nico it would really um attract a larger audience in all seriousness trails in the sky is amazing godtier world buildingcharacter interactions and in the style of a traditional jrpg higurashi could also be fun same with kid icarus uprising how aboutdisgaea for the next lp well i said this before but if your feeling that yakuza itch i recommend fist of the north star lost paradise its made by the same studio has both english and japanese audio and the japanese voices are preformed by actors from the yakuza series its great dumb fun i hope you play remember 11 it is a really good visual novel and i think youll love it watch the second season of kingdom hearts x cross can i say something about that gun in the end evil guy fired 13 shots before ryuji stood up i couldnt tell how many he fired after that but at least 3 more not many handguns carry around 16 shots and he might have fired more aww nico has a cute bernie mug on the mug tree its so adorable i honestly expected a ps4 crash screen while nico was singing then nico smashing something in rage nico please for the love of god start persona q1 since its been quite some time since you played persona 5 best bakamitai in this series xd also holy fuck nico is a great singer and one last thing can we just have a series where nico sings video game music that has lyrics like 24 hour cinderella or like for this intro bakamitai xd try either super paper mario or paper mario the thousand year door in hindsight why kaoru asks the question she does in 2511 is haunting coupled with the video message on the laptop this is probably my favorite scene in the game even though the actual ending itself i found too conveniently crafted amazing lets play nico i cant play the game but watching u feels like i am playing it myself oh would you consider the legend of heroes trails series for next lp it has many games but the series has amazing stories im not crying youre crying fck you onions announcer ladies and gentlemen tonight is the moment you have been waiting for the interdimensional baka mitai competition crowd goes bananas announcer on the left we haaaaaveee kiriyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu kazama yuki majima haruka from a basement half dead majima kaoru nishiki from the grave chanting kiriyu kazama kiriyu kazama kiriyu kazama announcer and on the right we haaaaaaaaave nicoooooo b crowd huh who the fuck nothing compared to kiriyu picky penguins chiaki from the grave komeada the p5 crew sora kairi and riku edgewrorth amd phoenix nicob nicob nicob nicobtender cleavage baka mitai happens announcer and the scores are a solid 95 for kiriyu andwait what is this 100 points for nicob this is a new record crowd kiriyu support nico support nicob nicob nicob nicob teander cleavage komeada bagels no matter how epic and cool the game makes ryuji looks hes still the same kid that would steal pants from people i will forever request digimon story cyber sleuth until the end of days okay nicob a lets play i want to see you do if you have not already played this game is a lets play of brutal legend because in my opinion brutal legend is a awesome rpg game that is about rock and roll even though i considered it a short rpg game it would be fun to see you do a lets play of brutal legend if you have not already played the game the best bakamitai okay about a few questions you asked heres how i would answer them kazukis double my only guess is doppelganger theory being a thing the writer was interested in at the time basically people in theory descended from a common ancestor end up with the same genetic combination as each other in other words its possible that kazuki and his doppelganger share a common ancestor well most of humanity does right and by luck they ended up with the exact or very similar gene combinations terada in this case its probably that he couldnt resolve his royalty to both jingweon and kazama so he did genuinely help tojo and jingweon setting up a situation where either can succeed but inwardly wanted kiryu to be triumphant but because he couldnt betray jingweon or kazama he chose this compromise also since the final bomb was for the other guy kazama spared this dud bomb is a symbol of that spared life the bomb ends up sparing kiryu and kaoru just like how kazama spared terada and i would recommend fist of the north star lost paradise it was also made by the rgg studio and it looks amazing i know it probably wont be the next lp but id freak out if i see xenoblade chronicles 2 be the next lp i suggest borderlands 1 its old but its still fun to this day bayonetta gets my vote as well amazing game in all aspects great fun top notch comedy ridiculous cutscenes and coreography for the next game i suggest octopath traveler its a jrpg on the switch thats really good i cant find any major criticism against it i wont go into too much detail as to why you should play it because i think its an experience better suited blind but i do think its right up your alley just wanted to know if youll lets play or livestream spiderman ps4 i really want to see your own experience of this games story and gameplay whats great is that you dont have to be an expert on on spiderman to love it i love this game and the series so much its easily my favorite game alongside smash for 2018 kh3 is so soon though one more month woo games i hope nico plays next steins gate 0 devil survivor 2 smt iv bayonetta kid icarus uprising xenoblade chronicles 2 nicob ends another lp one right after the other what will the next game be just reupload this video without the copyrighted music hey nico i know of a fantastic goofy lp you could play as one of the games to tide you over until kingdom hearts 3 drops katamari damacy its just had a hd rerelease on the switch and is a fun goofy puzzle game about rolling shit up its super japanese has a stellar ost and by the end youll feel like a god xd im joining that kid icarus uprising train come on nico that games humor was made for you if you want a recommendation of what to play in the future i would have to suggest dragon quest 11 i loved the game when i played it and i think you will too however like most jrpgs it is long 1230 i honestly thought that was a nico edit now please play utawarerumono mask of deception 7080 visual novel 3020 gameplay 100 would be great to see you play the characters are fun battles arent too difficult and great waifus not to mention the situations the characters find themselves in at times are funny as hell i will continue requesting this of you till the day i die its that time of the year again where i suggest devil survivor 2 record breaker if you want a short nice game before kingdom hearts 3 then i think bayonetta is perfect kiwami 2 is finished better begin detaching myself to kaoru for the next yakuza game ive given up on steinsgate 0 so kid icarus uprising it is nico arent you going to play yakuza 3 4 and 5 sega is remastering those entries on the ps4 but im not sure when its going to come out in the us trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky trails in the sky the intro is so beautiful i cried thanks for another yakuza lp nico i cant wait to see you try yakuza 3 since im blind on that games plot and 4 since i do know what happens and id like to see your reaction to said story as well as it finally opening the door to you being able to play the yakuza dead souls spinoff as for what you could play next and if youre not adverse to more timetravel after majoras mask might i suggest radiant historia originally released on the ds by atlas and with some folk working on it coming from the smt teams it has a 3ds update that adds more content as well as updated artwork as well as voiceacting which i believe wasnt in the original ds version without going into too many spoilers you play as stocke a black ops soldier thats part of a conflict between two nations over the remains of viable land in a world slowly wasting away during a mission stocke discovers the ability to travel through time though not without its caveats giving him the chance to hey nico i actually have a couple of requests to take into consideration for the next game the first i feel like a lot of fans will be asking for which is steinsgate 0 i remember seeing in my activity feed on steam that you have the game purchased if i remember right that is and after so many actionoriented games some being rather storylight a visual novel would be a rather nice change of pace i was actually introduced to steinsgate through you have played ahead through the next game and withholding my opinions i would very much enjoy seeing your reaction and opinions on the kindasequel the second i know im probably the only person asking this of you but i was wondering if youd be interested in a game called hiveswap this is based in the homestuck universe but i think i remember you one time saying you didnt much care for homestuck which if it just isnt your kind of tea by way of lore or humor then id 100 respect that and move on except there are q im surprised everyone is asking for kid icarus uprising its a great game with some serious control issues my vote for the next lp it would either be kid icarus or some sort of paper mario or professor layton id be down for any of those i think since nicos obviously gonna play kingdom hearts 3 which is like a month away he should play a quick game to pass the time maybe a new unexpected game like omensight but if he doesnt want there there is always disgaea or kid icarus im sure that nico would especially love the disgaea series would like him to experience what a true demon lord really is pointing menacingly to steinsgate 0 nico please play wadanohara and the great blue sea really hoping for bayonetta i feel like im the only one here who wants you to play this next but i really want you to get into the tales series at some point the problem is that vesperia my favorite tales game is getting a release in a few weeks so im unsure if you should start now with another game or wait oh what woes other than that though ive really loved watching you play through this series in general i got into yakuza thanks to you and i dont regret it in the slightest anyways happy holidays and i cant wait to continue watching even more fun content in the future ps if tales is not an option maybe devil survivor 2 its better than the first in my opinion and its not too long im sure youd enjoy it trails in the sky or sg 0 would be great 13438 they look like family aww public challenge for any picky penguin to accept describe this game using only moments from this lp seen in the previously on segment maybe at some point you should try fist of the north star lost paradise its really good i really want you to do an anime reaction to jojos bizarre adventure i am 100 sure you are going to like it it has your sense of humor and a pretty awesome story you could compare it to yakuza as diffrent as it is i really want the next letsplay to be crosscode the combat may be diffrent but it is good and many other aspects shine such as the story and characters feel instresting and i feel the story has good progression a good soundtrack not to mention alot of inspiration from old school zelda and other games like that with puzzles and being top view style plzplay asuras wrath you will not regret it ive seen people suggest a lot of bayonetta a lot of kid icarus some people want visual novels i dont really know what to suggest next i guess if you want a decently lengthed game paper mario is pretty good fairly lighthearted really funny dialogue etc another game that can be short is azure striker gunvolt might be on other systems instead of the switch but im not too sure its kind of like a mega man game but if mega man could only control lightning and was anime ummmm otherwise just pick with what you feel would be cool and could work the best with your busy schedule have a good day mister nico b for an lp i would love to see you play pokemon mystery dungeon explorers of sky as it is what happens when spike chunsoft is allowed to make a pokemon game the story is beautiful and emotional and it also gets somewhat goofy at times it is easily one of my favorite games of all time either that or hyperdimension neptunia rebirth 1 neptunia rebirth 1 is a comedic game that is heavily based on gaming history and filled with references gamer humor pop culture and all sorts of other stuff those are two games i would love to see you do an lp of at some point shit the finale already im only finishing the 21st part and havent even started majors mask yet well seems like someones gonna be watching nicos lp instead of looking for job no regrets congrats for completing 2 games in the row and please sometime try falcom games stillrecommend ys series for first times a good suggestion for another game to play would definitely be final fantasy 7 crisis core please give me that zack fair love i said this yesterday but i would really like to see you play okami it is such a fun and unique game with characters i know youll love but other picky penguins have a point when they say that kid icarus is a fun game the controls take a bit getting use to but it has a natural flow once youve got it and while it is entirely voice acted it is actually really fun and i feel like you would love all the characters and the story the game offers w nicob you need watch jojo if not mistaken kazuma hoe never shows up again 1 love that intro 2 play crisis core thanks for another great lp nico ya got me into this series and playing this game alongside ya was super fun the problems from the ps4 were unfortunate n we had some rocky moments during it but it was still overall super enjoyable i definitely still enjoy yakuza 0 more but this game was a huge step up from kiwami 1 lmao even if it does have some weird headscratchers it was still cohesive enough and characters like kaoruryuji just elevated it i found good enjoyment from it as for the next lp id still have to recommend you play kid icarus uprising sometime its a favorite of mine and i think youd really enjoy it controls take some getting used to but its a super fun beat em up with fantastically charming characters and writing another game i think youd enjoy and would make for a fun lp would be bayonetta fun hack and slash game with similarly fun and badass characters outside of that im along for the ride hope youll consider these recommendations bu i am seeing a lot of kid icarus in the comments which i would not be opposed to i have no idea what the game is about for the longest while i just called him angel sora so it would be cool to know what that game has to offer psychonauts is a game i think would be hilarious for you to play and with psychonauts 2 announced i think it is the perfect time to play it too hey nico have u ever thought of playing digital devil saga i think were long overdue for an anime reaction from nico and i think we all know its time for jojos hoping nico plays these next fire emblem awakeningfates kid icarus uprising disgaea 1 basically any jrpgs like tokyo mirage session trails of tales of etc following your kiwami 2 lp was lots of fun nico if you get an itch for yakuza flavor action before the yakuza 3 remaster and judgement hit the west hokuto ga gotokufist of the north star lost paradise is by the same ryu ga gotoku studio and runs on the 0 and kiwami 1 engine its a bit overpadded according to some but the 1v1 boss fights are some of the coolest the franchise has to offer do kid icarus uprising youll enjoy it its so so funny its the end of the year nicos family comes to visit and he is just like nico hey can you record something for me family oh ok nico damedane family wtf nico i think that the ending had a few too many random twists but was still pretty fun overall im actually wondering for the commentors if they would want to see a boktai the sun is in your hands lp is it time for xenoblade chronicles 2 yet nico brother please water my crops with a kid icarus uprising lets play please play layton youve peaked nico youll never be able to top this intro professor layton and pandoras box please omg that intro hahaha hey it was worth the wait lol i already mention these games in the majora mask finale but here are my recommendations and i hope you have the consuls for them short games both wii games that can be played on the wii u 1 epic mickey platformer game that yes stars mickey mouse note you wont be able to get all the achievements through the first playthrough because you have to make choices in the game this game has 2 routes too the nice route and the mean route 2 super paper mario this deviates from first two paper mario games in that its not a turn based rpg its more of a platformer i never played the first 2 paper mario games but i hope you do play this game at some point its fun with really one of the best stories long games both are turn based jrpgs 1 skies of arcadia legends gamecube game that can be played on the wii the original game was on the sega dreamcast legends adds extra content to it that really adds to the kiryu fighting a bunch of random thugs heavy breathing collapses in front of ryuji kiryu fighting ryuji in a climactic final battle in the freezing cold not even a bruise ohh my god nico this intro was amazing big shoutout wow just wow how much hours did it need you do make that i salute to thee sir for this is art nico play abzu for a one off video its from the same creators of jorney and its a gorgeous game you are going to love it or you can try giving professor layton and the curious village a chance for you to know the characters before you play the crossover with ace attorney if you play it someday that is ill join the chorus and suggest professor layton and the curious village and not just to prime you for the laytonace attorney crossover everyone yakuza kiwami 3 please nico but guys i need a break everyone yakuza kiwami 3 reminder to check out the kh mobile game as the story has updated significantly since the last time you looked at it do i hear pledge of the demon playing over the credits well played sir well played at any rate these two projects have ended pretty close together thats a rarity around here think ill suggest the 3ds remake of mario luigi superstar saga bowsers minions its a somewhat simple rpg with an excellent soundtrack by yoko shimomura it has a lot of personality and the characters are a perfect fit for your kind of content theyre a lot of fun getting all of the small collectibles might require a guide but they are mostly optional if you dont want to bother with getting them all the bowsers minions in the title refers to a secondary story mode added to this version youll want to take it a bit at a time since trying to do all of it in a row will both prove to be tedious and spoil future locations youll be visiting holy crap that ending was amazing d but anyway the only games that i have in mind would be mario and luigi superstar saga if nico has never played that the ml games are actually great with really good storylines and amazing osts made by none other than yoko shimomura herself edit i forgot to say that the 3ds version would be better especially because every boss is buffed steins gate 0 idk i got no ideas other than those two man that final boss fight needs a slowed down it has to be this way amv since it just really fits the mood of the battle and kiryu says the title before the fight anyways as for next game i suggest professor layton vs ace attorney or kid icarus uprising theres been no word on if the yakuza 3 remaster will leave asia though id bet its more than likely considering how well yakuza 6 did but youd still need to jump back to ps3 anyway if you ever do dead souls which would be between 4 and 5 if you need your yakuza but cant wait for 3s remaster theres always the fist of the north star game even if the english version doesnt have the yakuza name its comparable in length to kiwami so it wouldnt be as big a time investment as kiwami 2 or 0 additionally there are some changes in the remaster compared to the original due to contract expirations some of the hostesses have been replaced additionally one of the family crests was changed to bear less resemblance to the japanese imperial flag because the game is getting released elsewhere in asia which have some very bad experiences with that flag because you know imperialism additionally there is some outright cut content answer x answer is a trivia based miniga beautiful stupid intro merry christmas nico best intro of all time woah nicob house kitchen tour welp im sure somebody else have said in the comment but im gonna say it anyway hoping for a trails in the sky playthrough because the details in the game about world building and character development to even the npcs dialouge are fantastic and im really exited what kind of voice nico will give the characters when he decide to play it it may come soon or it wont be but ill keep hoping anyway lol hope you can see this one comment or any other ones with the same thing and consider this underatted gem in one of your lps wheres that golden sun lp asuras wrath a nice short game then you can play kh3 plus dbz lvs of epicness i would like to suggest fire emblem awakening which is my favorite game as a possible playthroughlets play its a great game that got me into the franchise that i would definitely recommend to anyone 13846 it was on this day that kiryu became a nouveau riche i was expecting the screen to crash for the final bakamitai while i love the yakuza games and after playing all the main games i kinda wish they ended kiryus story here as i feel they didnt need to add anymore i do find this story the best out of the series not that the other games storys are bad this is just my personal preference im still looking forward to seeing you play the next yakuza game though as your goofyness always makes me laugh i really have my heart set on stein gate 0 but i have a feeling thats not going to happen so i guess kud icarus uprising i say go for persona 4 dancing all night because persona dancing games and we need more persona dammit plus its the only persona dancing game with a story you can get in on the ps4 as part of the endless night bundle or the evil within because why not and i thought the game was really good or better yet why not until dawn i thought i had witnessed true beauty already but then i saw this intro anyway heres my personal suggestion board steinsgate zero its soo cool sonuvabich trails in the sky really good series but do keep in mind that they are long and the first one can be kinda slow hollow knight beautiful metroidvania with a really good soundtrack and story shovel knight i think you mentioned that you wanted to play it as a stream but it also would be a good short lp professor layton also kinda short and it would be cool for nico to test his bullshit powers celeste really good platformer would also be a good stream game holy sht this intro and the tony award oscar grammy emmy and also all german music and tv prizes goes to the one and only best content creator in the world nicob the intro just gave me life thank you nico thank you so much that intro was everything to me w still keeping my fingers crossed for the disgaea series that intro nico you beautiful man i love you that intro was the most beautiful thing you could add on top of the singing youve been doing in the previous videos i love it so ridiculous and yet so worth it for the holidays hey so fun fact persona 5 dancing in starlight has a yakuza costume pack ren gets a kiryu costume obviously ann gets a majima costume and its actually amazing futaba gets a flourist costume which makes sense haru gets a haruka costume because similar names idk makoto gets a costume based off of majimas brother and most fittingly of all ryuji gets a ryuji costume and if your asking about morgana he didnt get a yakuzabased costume he got a sonic costume instead cant wait for yakuza 3 remaster they say there not making kiwami for 34 and 5 only remasters said it on mms finale gonna say it again just in case devil survivor 2 record breaker septentrion route thats the first one youre gonna have to play because the triangulum is a bit spoilery and exclusive since it is a remake of the original ds version disgaea fire emblem any of the 3ds games except fates youll be doing that game for a while maybe 30 episodes rune factory 4 shin megami tensei iv not apocalypse dont play that yet its a sequel to iv and is spoilery hmmm how about valkyrian chronicles 4 series or escape the prison by crazy games it is short game still just gonna sit here waiting for the skies of arcadia legends lp custom robo lp fragile dreams lp and of course disgaea that intro made me strangely sentimental as excited as i am for new content i will miss yakuza youve done so many great things with these series thank you nico i really hope youre able to do a octopath traveler lets play honestly i think it would be perfect with your multiple voices and its a great rpg to play i really want a 3ds lp next but after three action packed games i think something light and simple would get us ready for kh3 ive got a soft spot for a little game called fantasy life but its not a game for everyone and i dont recomend that nico try to 100 it theres just too much to do if you aim for that even so itd be kind of nice to have something wholesome back on the channel nico plz check the cyber sleuth series2 games only i dont know if you like digimon in general but these games are unique with their own story and characters and it looks like a persona game i rly think you will love these games their story and humor also they dont have english va sooooooo more nico voices for us when i played theses games i kept thinking how nico would love this plz plz plz check them out at least plz does yuta have the same voice actor as all might this intro gave me the hugest take on how dear this series is to you nico welcome to the manly tears club everyone at least 2 of my choices for a new lp are kid icarus or octopath travelercurious to see what you think of them i would like to see a fire emblem awakening lets play that intro awww hell yes and a shotforshot remake we are blessed indeed its an early christmas present for all the picky penguins and its great timing for nico to be able to take a few days off for the holidays hes had such a rough time recently he deserves it happy holidays picky penguins i hope everyone gets to spend time with their loved ones no matter who they are i tried out the demo for fist of the northstar which is similar to yakuza so if anything youre wanting a game similar to yakuza before stuff like it arrives it should be a good pick y try the game fist of the north star lost paradise still waiting for fire emblem awakening kid icarus uprising bayonetta steinsgate 0 so many options all equally hype may nico choose wisely have you ever heard of paper mario i would love to see you play those games they are so funny and goofy that i think you would really love them give them a look if you can any of the disgaea games or persona 3 yeah ima shill kid icarus uprising and trails in the sky again nico please play tales of the abyss i want to play it please im trying to watch the video but i cant get past the intro your singing is amazing nico since kh3 is coming soon what about playing a mario and luigi game on the 3ds since you take 1h per episode it woulnt be too timeconsuming and itd definitely be entertaining for us and you as well and several of these games got an hd remake not that long ago so the experience would be even better too you should play xenoblade chronicles 2 nico pleas play rouge galexy next the music in this game is really nice cant say i was too fond of the story or the game itself admittedly i skipped a lot of the fights and the majima construction stuff but its always a joy to see a game showered with so much love one of my alltime favorite games is starting to head into downfall so this was refreshing and i love the graphics normally im not one for realistic looking games but its clear they didnt try to rely on just looking good theres clear thought going into the city and making all the environments feel real not just look real like all those posters makes me wanna study japanese again anyway thanks for the playthrough for your next game i have no idea but whatever you pick i hope its something thats nice to your schedule a shorter game perhaps ahahaha i knew it oh of course the finally would be nico playing bakamitai honestly i want you to play steinsgate 0 for a long time but nearly everyone here wants kid icarus uprising well theres always next time amirite i can imagine its a real fun game hell i like dork shits theme song nico you should play final fantasy 15 nico can i put a vote for a game called shibuya scramble a visual novel that has plenty of awesome characters for you to voice trails in the skyi really want you to do that one yes its finally over heres hoping we dont get another trashkami lp until this time next year kid icarus tho i throw in a vote for asuras wrath the letter is also one i would vote for nico just a thing be ready to deal with clunkyish combat and slower movement when you get into yakuza 3 because while it is way faster than the og yakuza and yakuza 2 boi if the combat didnt make you want to commit sudoku but hey at least the tiger drop is op as fuck once you get it again yes you will have to learn it again happens every god damn time this was a fun series and im gonna miss everything good about kiryu breaking furniture and the game the off key singing intro the side mission for the stories majima constructionsand most important of alltender clevage my greatest moment of this game is when kiryu fought those tigers my least fav would be moment is the amon fight it felt like he was nerfedyet again you did make kiryu a god as for what game i hoping that you play next im torn between disgaea because it been on the back burn for a long time and they release one for the ps4 fullfil your role as demon lord nixon and twilight princess because im hoping for gonta link i would love to see nico play hyperdimension neptunia i feel like the video game references the meta humor and the general japanese weirdness would be right up his alley the whole scene i was wondering how many bullets does this man have xd nicob great lets play i wonder what kiryus involvement in the next yakuza is going to be can you please play gravity rush remastered on the ps4 if you havent played it before what a great finale so far my favourite finale of the yakuza games x3 hmmm as to kingdom hearts i dunno how relevant its really gonna be for kh 3 now but there has been a bunch of new stuff added to the kingdom hearts x saga id kinda suggest checking that out maybe too it wouldnt be too long either just a one off again of watching some cutscenes again cant wait for the new projects though xenoblade chronicles 2 please i would love to see this and i think you might enjoy it remember the end of yakuza kiwami kiryu i am retiring as chairman and my successor will be terada he is the right man and he will rebuild the tojo clan terada i am going to destroy the tojo clan d i loved every second of this lp and i cant wait for the next and for the kh3 one aswell if i could put up some games that i would love to see you play they would have to be castlevania symphony of the night more of a stream game though legend of mana a truly underrated ps1 game in my eyes any of the star ocean games except 5 as its what might have killed the series radiata stories am overlooked and under appreciated rpg i love to bits odin sphere another great game everyone should play and lastly my gushing of nis games just play any of them there great trinity universe is a great one to pick oh right you also need to play disgaea that is all you should really play hollow knight right now kid icarus uprising and bayonetta seem to be the most requested lps place your bets ladies and gents i think that life is strange would be a good game for you to play nico hackgu its such an awesome series that was an amazing playthrough one again nicob sorry for all the frustration you got from the crashes and all really sorry about that i had a blast watching you play this and also looking at tender cleavage with you was an absolute blast looking forward to more great playthroughs from you nicob pls take a break from yakuza there was barely any break in between the last game and this one and that made me not enjoy it this time nico the only way to sing bakamitai is completely naked me why werent you naked in the opening then ok so about the kazuki doppleganger they kinda did explain that during that event he had plastic surgery done on him youd be surprised how far plastic surgery can go please play kid icarus uprising or ar tonelico im pretty sure how that majima explosion it was only a dream thing was supposed to be interpreted for the player was this the majima thing was actually real the explosion you assume was real then the dream part was the explosion besides the place majima was in looked like it already had some broken windows the millennium tower we see exploding doesnt so the dream explosion was probably just remembering that first explosion finding paradise wont take you that long nico maybe finishing it will take you at least 7 episodes so idk 0 im playing my cards near to my chest and i would recommand steinsgate 0 as your next lp were in december and that makes 2 years that i want you to play it also thank you for having introduced yakuza to my gaming sphere crisis core dang its been a while since the last oneoffunless you count some streams id be interested in what youre planning for those instead of a playthrough how about watching and reacting to jojo id love to see that tales of berseria pls velvetbestwaifu i would say mario and luigi because of the fact that the characters have really fun personalities and something funny happens to bowser and i dont think its that long of a game but i might be long hey nico i know this probably isnt gonna be an option but have you ever considered doing a bioware game like mass effect or dragon age those games are very grindy rpgs and with kingdom hearts 3 coming up i expect you dont want to spend too much time doing one game when its out so probably not i dont even know where you could play it maybe on steam but if you could one day i think it would be really cool ill be okay with whatever you decide though great lp man play fossil fighters can kiryu join the council of voices i would suggest paper mario 1 or mario and luigi superstar saga their both amazing games i would want you to have as a lets play or maybe golden sun oh yeah i forgot about kid icarus uprising id like you to play finding paradise its the sequel of to the moon and i really enjoyed that lp xenoblade chronicles 2 please and thank you ok nico i have some bad news about that appeal you made and are hoping things go well since they are almost running out of time when you appeal the claim and time is running out good chances are at the last minute they will deny the appeal this is common for a lot of people final words you smell niced nice singing nuco you actually get most of your weapons in legend i blazed through the legend difficulty just shooting everything with dragon sp gun it was a cake walk that shot of ryuji looking at kaoru as the elevator goes up gave me chills and the guitar riff right at that moment 4440 sorry nico but kaoru called him kazuma his family name ryuji called him kiryu which is his given name while the lack of a honorific means that kaoru shows some closeness to kiryu it is still somewhat formal i think you got confused because in eastern asian countries the family name is first and given name second translators tend to reverse this for the western audiences so it can get confusing unless youre aware of whats happening kaoru and ryujis reunion was a bit happier than tetsu and makotos granted its still heartbreaking but a bit less so because they were actually able to see and interact with each other for better or worse i feel like its a good time to plug in the pokemon mystery dungeon series the ds versions espcially sky have great stories and funny characters so i totally recomend it still wants higurashi i just realized this ryuji is yu karakami lets look at the facts 1 uses a katana 2 loves someone who he calls a little sister 3 badass honestly i think its about time for you to do another reaction review series in my opinion you should probably do a reaction review of rwby i believe it would be a very nice addition to the channel that is if you havent already watched it hey nicob are you going to play yakuza 3 4 and 5 on the ps3 or are you going to wait for the ps4 ports please play digimon story cyber sleuth nico its an rpg with a fantastic story line and the battle system is very similar to most rpgjrpg titlesit also has a sequel although im not too sure what its like yet i would love to see you play ys viii or dragon quest xi both great games there is a nice short game called beyond good and evil i always play it at least once a year and it is really good but pretty old game will take only 3 or 4 episodes i would assume at least i can finish it in about 4 hours d does anyone know the name of the song where kiryu and kaoru kiss its amazing i need it that intro nicos voice is like an angel me oooh a new intro 30 seconds later me gross sobbing i would be very happy to see you play fate extra as the next lp it should last long enough i think till kingdom hearts comes out or maybe fire emblem awakening it would be the best christmas present ever 3 well the games i really want nico to play are actually games i already know he is going to get to eventually the remainder of the zelda games starting with windwaker xenoblade chronicles 2 those are my top two wishes however these are ridiculously long games and nico has just played so many long games that requires so much work and editing i think nico ought to take it a bit easy and play a smaller less demanding game also since kh3 is around the corner committing to such a massive title may not be the best idea right now i am going to go through a bunch of games i know is being frequently requested and just give my thoughts paper mario thousand year door oh this could be fun this game is a lot of fun really charming fun story fun humour good characters for nico to voice would be fun kid icarus uprising i gotta be honest i have no idea why this game is always recommended unless someone wants nico to destroy his wrist for life i guess the story traaaiiilllls in the skyyyyyyyy bakamitai nicob is the best nicob thank you so much for bringing this wild ride that is this game to the table cant wait to join you in your next lets play play finding paradise but before that you should do the to the moon mini episodes steins gate the new one i just imagine bernie watching nico record the opening and just running around like nico whats wrong nico do you need a belly rub if you ever decide to play a pokemon game you should do the mystery dungeon games or maybe the main games too man this was a rough week for poor kaoru two family members dying in her arms after she finally got to meet them in the span of three days what kind of pansy drinks lowfat eggnog joke can you read homestuck like a visual novel and its technically a video game so yeah like if your with me whats with best girls and their brother dying hey nico still waiting for devil survivor 2 can we get that soon please ps intro 1010 oh my fucking goodness best intro ever oh no ive seen the intro way too much i know the words okay i dont know a lot about guns but fuck takashima had a fucking lot of bullets lol the second time youve finished a yakuza and zelda game back to back noooo nico you never fought the tiger in the colosseum battles its definitely a perfect time for a kid icarus uprising lp its a really fun and funny game with only 9 chapters and not being too long as well with the fact that smash bros already released it can give you more insight on the characters and their personality in palutenas guidance references since some of the guidance spoiled part of uprising super smash bros creator masuhiro sakurai also created uprising so you can tell his work in the game is full of love and ambition including crazy amount of content yakuza 3s remasters doesnt have an official english release yet it will probably release after judgement releases in the west fire emblem awakening come on nico do it holy shit that intro was hilariously stupid i love it so kiryu peacocked that random dudes mom and also ryujis sister nice kiryuchan steins gate 0 it is time that intro was so good i fucking swear nico you never cease to brighten my days this playthrough has been golden ive been excited for this finale for a while now i even got snacks ready for it p i think a fun game that nico could lp would be gravity rush i think the characters and story are right up his alley plus id like what he thinks of it i would recommend a lets play of the vn umineko no naku koro ni or a trails in the sky lets play loved this playthrough this is officially my favorite finale intro it was so fabulous even though you missed the qte getting hit by a steel girder and still fighting like it was nothing is still amazing durability for man like kiryu holy sht kiryu got a gu bang everyone sees the gun in kiryus hand get shot out of his hold by roland no one steals my trademark thing kiryu holy shy roland got agets shot by daddy roland yo nico please fist of the north star lost paradise next if you havent mention it kiryu might have a chance of being one of the characters in tekken 7 season 3 if that game gets a s3 tekkens creator katsuhiro harada noticed that someone had posted a picture of a character that looked like him in yakuza kiwami 2 harada was surprised and amused by this and had some back and forth with sega over the lookalike this means that if were lucky we might have daddy kiryu in tekken 7 some time in 2019 as for recommendations i recommend 2 oneoff visual novel games 428 shibuya scramble and will a wonderful world 428 is about 10 years old this year and was released in japan before danganronpa zero escape and steinsgate it was only recently localized in the west and has flown under the radar of many people even though its a decade old visual novel i think that it stands pretty well with the other popular visual novels weve come to know and love will a wonderful world on the other hand is just over a year old made by an indie team they are both great gam nicothat introwhy arent you the best youtuber ever can you please play hackgu last recode kid icarus come on money also congrats on 100 yakuza episodes can you do the ys series next please so beautiful the begining omg nico come out and sing bakamitai excellent it toke kiryu three games to finally get some the bomb can fuck off kiryu was needing some different kind of action i said this on the zelda video but might as well say it again i highly recommend the trails series it has fantastic world building great story and fantastic characters it is a little slow in the beginning no matter which game you start with but i swear it is fantastic by the end i myself started with cold steel but you can start with trails in the sky the one most people start with although it is quite a bit older and different than cold steel thanks for the lp nico and ill watch whatever it is you decide to play happy holidays yeassssss that opening the beginning was the best intro ive watched i had to replay it again xd man i dont really have much ideas for what you should lp next devils never cry starts playing in the background id reccomend persona q or crisis core fun fact they played slient night techo trance ver in the og versin where the credits rolled effing sad that intro is enough reason that nico sings needs to become a thing id love to see you play the to the moon minisodes as well as its sequel finding paradise optionally also a bird story before fp as that does lead into it but not required low fat eggnog good to see were being healthy hey nico here is i idea for your next lp play tales of zestiria on ps 4 and after you finish the game lp tales of berseria also on ps 4 please and now to demand a full cover of bakamitai and to also prepare to get triggered as an otaku while listening to nicos beautiful voice the next upload will be christmas eve please all i want for this year is for nico to play either disgaea devil survivor 2 or shin megami tensei 4 my picks for the next lp are still fire emblem awakening you can really pick any of the fire emblem games on the 3ds but i think awakening is the best starting point bravely default its a really fun game with a cute artstyle and a unique battle system or of course d i s g a e a because dangit ive been waiting for this one since the kingdom hearts 1 lets play and i will not stop for anyone how about kid icarus uprising for the next lp i think it would be a great game to tide us over until kh3 its super fun charming and has an amazing sense of humor nico doing the dame dame intro i could not hahaha omg intro happens i love this episode it is my favourite kiwami 2 episode now that bakamitai cover tho i have a feeling nico might hold on one of his two usual lps for a bit kh3 is right around the corner and im sure nico wants to play it was soon it launches hes doesnt like doing three lps at once even if the third game is a bit shorter was anyone else staring at kiryus ass the entire lets play no just me okay maybe a fire emblem game recommend fates i do hope nico plays asuras wrath because its basically badass daddy kiryu on a cosmic scale the classic zelda games on nes because those are more widely available thanks to the switch and 3ds rather than us forcing nico to get a gamecube wii or wii u if he doesnt have one and metal gear solid considering ryuji was 12 in 0 if im remembering correctly thatd make him 30 here given that the jingweon massacre happened 26 years ago hed have been 4 at the time he was pretty small for a four year old but it does mean that it makes sense for him to remember the night my earliest memories are of when i was 3 years old and i know there are people who remember even earlier than that i would like to say xc2 but there is literally no chance of that p its long he played the first recently and kh3 is just around the corner we are looking for a short game probably another one id love but for similar reasons it isnt the time for its long would be dragon quest xi that came out recently and was a blast and a perfect introduction to the dq series for a newcomer imo so on that note ive not got any recommendations currently that fit this particular time cause i am under the assumption that a shorter game is what is being looked for seen a few games other people mentioned thatd be interesting like shantae or maybe even slime rancher there is alot of support for kid icarus uprising ive never played that though so i cant recommend it personally fire emblem path of radiance or advance wars would be fun i would love to see hiveswap nico can you check put the legend of heroes games starting with trails in the sky its a really fun game amd the other legend of heroes games are pretty awesome as well hoping you can pick up this trilogy real soon sooooooo im debating whether or not i want to ask you to play disgaea 1 complete 1228 ill be honest i thought you edited that explosion in there please play hyperdimension neptunia nico i have watched you since i found your p4 lets play and i am currently watching your lp on book of shadows so can you please haruka would have wanted it intro song ends aww that was ni heeellloooooo oh jesus fu falls out of chair from jumpscare yes the beginning was excatly what i was hoping for a serious attempt at baka mitai i was waiting for that the entire time the trend of saving best for last in the last episode lp intro continues this is such an masterpiece that im crying with many emotions how are you going to top this one next time sometimes i forget that nico is a really good singer and then i see something like that intro and i remember completely wow i wasnt expecting this lp to end just yet and was expecting at least 1 more episode kind of sad to see it end but also looking forward to something new please let it be steinsgate 0 youre one of those ppl whore like oh this shit would be funny but actually follows through with that thought xd hear me out after the wonderful endings of two wonderful lets plays i came up with a mix between the two yakuza 05 majimas mask kiryu and nishikiyama ride into the forest on nishikis motorcycle they then get attacked by majima wearing a his crazy face or his hanya man mask majima is accompanied by youda and yuki tatl and tael kiryu gets cursed by majima to turn into a teenager making him lose his combat capabilities tachibana is the happy mask salesman who lifts the curse you would be able to find nishikiyama and his bike at serena with yumireina or both and haruka nishiki is reluctant at first but will come to give you a ride shimano bald guy and his family are the gorons the dojima family are the dekus and the residents of kamurocho are the zoras ran out of ideas the mailman would be majimas most loyal member nishida thank you nico for the wonderful and funny lets plays please id highly recommend fire emblem specifically path of raidence fire emblem is a massove series but one i feel you would really love nico the gameplay is simple yet very complex and requires a lot of thought por is one of the most forgiving games in the series right next to 7 i feel like itd be a good introduction for you hell id feel you even might like maniac mode and last but not least who doesnt love a little ike so majora mask is now over and does kiwami 2 what next i was wondering if he could do digimon story cyber sleuth or xenoblade chronicles 2 nico i suggest you to try two game series 1tales of starting with tales of xillia its a wonderful jrpgseries with solid writing and characters i think youll have a lot of fun with it 2senran kagura starting with shinovi versus its hard do describe this one to make it full justice but its 100 worth it its especially will work after what you saw about japan in yakuza games still gonna recommend paper mario and kid icarus uprising p but if you want to play some games for oneoff episodes or some really short series id recommend dead cells into the breach enter the gungeon ftl gris what remains of edith finch minit donut county firewatch a bird story red strings club the first 4 i listed are rougelikes so you dont have to worry about finishing them in one episode whereas the other games will take no longer than about 4 hrs to finish kid icarus uprising on 3ds would be a great lets play how is nico able to top every intro after every playthrough seriously the work that has actually been put into them has been top notch dude oh yeah also this is so sad can we play nicos beautiful singing voice kid icarus uprising is imo the best game on 3ds its made by sakurai who also made smash bros furthermore i recommend jazzpunk as a stream game you should professor layton and the curious village d i wish i could sing like that and score a 100 3 games i would suggest between now and kh3 would be bayonetta kid icarus uprising paper mario theyre all fairly short and hilarioud games that i think are worth playing this was a great game and for the next lp i hope you play kid iqarus uprising but if your tired you should take a break maybe that was the best bokumeti ever kiryu what the majima youre alive i thought you got blown up majima nah the blast hit me so hard i was sent to an alternate dimension where kamurocho was in an zombie apocalypse you were there ryuji was there this cool loan shark guy was helping us you were sniping bitches and blowing their heads off it was awesome kiryu nice try majima i believed you with the whole zombie alternate dimensions but me killing someone get outta here majima so you dont believe me well guess what i went to karaoke with the loan shark guy and he sings bakamitai way better than you can kiryu you take that back majima oh by the way i peacocked your moms tender cleavege last night kiryu time to die for real majima majima bring it on kiryuuu chaan thankfully the lip sync issues arent apparent in yakuza 6 which is weird since 6 came out before kiwami 2 my thought is that they just had less development time on the mouth movements in this game compared to yakuza 6 should there be a bring your majima to work day ah my favourite part of this game ryuji thats right takashima real men should be stupid speaking of which kiryu lets have a halfnaked fistfight to the death on top of this tower instead of seeking medical attention kiryu this seems like an entirely sensible thing to do kaoru what is wrong with you two well thats the end of the second yakuza game kiryu has a girlfriend and a future outside of crime harukas safe and happy and the tojo clan is completely behind him frankly itd be great if the story could end here but alas well have to wait for yakuza 3 to spoil absolutely everything continue the story ahem that was such a beautiful finale intro nico wow i never realized how much thought was put into the tattoos in these gameall these layers giving me a new perspective 00038 i have that same exact shirt this is it the last yakuza game no more after this but really i wish the games ended here 0 1 2 i mean i like the rest but i think this was a good stopping point cause you know celeste please nico i want to see what the hype is all about just play yakuza 3 to see full ending of yakuza 2 oh boy here come the twists and yes ryuji is heralded as one of the best villains in the series the others are outclassed by him they arent horrible but ryuji is just that good i really cant wait for you to reach the rest of the series especially yakuza 4 and 5 muh favourite also cant wait for judge eyesjudgement i got some recommendations for ya its not a long list but its very wordy these are all games i personally enjoy and love from the bottom of my heart im also basing these recommendations on what ive seen you like in my short time watching you i mostly subscribed when you started playing yakuza 0 and been with ya since but ive watched your niernier automata playthrough as well as persona 5 this is for you and anyone else whos interested trails in the sky 1st 2nd 3rd pc andor trails of cold steel 12 ps3 and pc ps4 versions of cold steel 1 2 coming 2019 i know asking to get someone into trails is asking a huge commitment so now the truth is revealed in the most wtf way possible doesnt scale as big as zero escape though i lost half my braincells those days it was worth the wait i am done that intros top notch now for the release of yakuza 3 in the west when it comes out we need a majima construction intro with nico devil survivor 2 love the opening btw if nico is looking for short lps to play before kh3 then i suggest kid icarus uprising and bayonetta both if nico is good that was the best baka mitai i have ever seen yaaaay my employer gets unofficial product placement with the egg nog for the next lets play either kid icarus uprising or asuras wrath sorry i dont have anything constructive or meaningfull to say about the episode itself fantastic game i loved every second of this lp and of this game i cant wait until the yakuza 3 play through hopefully yakuza 3s story will be as fly as they say lets mention trails in the sky again i cant mention it enough and it seems a lot of punguins agree with me here digimon cyber suth like in the last video of mm i would recommend riu and smrpg kiu is a great game with humor that would fit your style very well and smrpg is a great starting point to playing any mario rpg as it set up a lot of the game play and narrative style to come in the paper mario and ml series id be alright with a couple one offs till kh3 comes out cause we all know you will be playing kh3 the day it comes out although i do have a couple recommendations first would be paper mario thousand year door by far one of my favorite paper marios and its a turn based rpg with funny characters and a thrilling story the second would be physconaights a puzzle platformer by double fine with goofy characters a unique character design and perfect timing with the recent news of a sequel coming soon i feel like playing the first could lead to the second if you enjoy it regardless of your choice i cant wait to see your content and i hope you have a great christmas is is tir for the wind wanker he didnt find the boat heat actionmy life will forever be incomplete i mentioned this in your majoras mask finale but ill suggest kid icarus uprising once again either way keep doing what you do your content is always a blast to watch ill continue recommending layton until the day it happens another kiwami finisher heh as for the next lp id like to see a mario rpg game particularly mario and luigi funny moments rather short and overall a fun time if not hopefully kid icarus uprising that intro was beautiful daddy kiryu will be proud that intro is both the most beautiful thing ive ever seen and a good reminder that nico can actually sing pretty well when he tries i just want to see if nico would like fire emblem awakening and play bravely default and persona q and devil survivor 2 for 3ds damn i want him to see so many things every picky penguin and nico should sing baka mitai like do a collab of everyone singing it and mash it together farewelldaddy kiryu until we meet again in yakuza kiwami 3 wow you have a good voice i was not expected that xd 1717 rui i trained her to teleport to your partner well points if you get that reference so sad this is the end what a wild ride so nico fist of the north star game done by the yakuza devs when kid icarus uprising next please in nintendo games we trust welp that was fast i figured wed have 3 more episodes till the finale bayonetta something nice and short you could probably play bayonetta 1 2 before kh3 drops heres a question has nico played final fantasy 15 on the channel once again bravely default persona q fire emblem awakening steinsgate 0 and for anime reactions jojos bizarre adventure if you havent already watch the yakuza ishin video boss fight versus large man dora decay indeed yakuza you will be missed 934 i have been waiting for this moment the entire playthrough great lp really enjoyed it as for a followup game since you have played both nier and nier automata i must recommend playing drakengard 3 you dont have to play the first 2 plus they are kinda old 1 and 2 i mean the game is actually really funny and the story is just asneir as neir i think you would love it and your commentary would honestly be great for it also as a second recommendation i would have to say the hyperdimension neptunia games would be wonderful as well something something higurashi something something not yet fully released on steam but recommend it for a future lp something something get the ps3 sprites voices patches by 07th modding link in the answers to this comment yadda yadda you can mute the voices if you like they explain in the guide also id like to recommend crosscode too its a really fun game reminiscent of secret of mana i think you would love it the main game is completed but theres still some more story postgame to be developed and updated in the future so i would recommend this for a future lp so that you can get the full 100 completed game dont worry ill be sure to warn you now that i think about it i just recommended a vn and a game but only for the future eh theyre good really good so might as well recommend them ahead of time that intro killed me with tears of how sad nico was id still love for you to play xenoblade chronicles 2 one day im not asking for it rn fuck no not with kh3 right around the corner but id just want to say i hope you do lp it cause i dont see anybody in the comment section talking about it not gonna lie i didnt freak out when the bomb exploded cuz i thought nico edited that in to troll us for a second but then he freaks out and i know its serious but i also see kaoru saying it was all a bad dream you do not take a character like goro majima the mad dog just like thateven if it was all in character we found em boys get him we know what your kitchen looks like watch out jk love the intro as a person who is in an acapella group in college i applaud you nicothat and nowwas absolutely fing beautiful im not being sarcastic or making a joke that was legit beautiful i seriously paused the video just to applaud great job man great goddamn job the baka mitai i love and that is now my most intro can you do some video on the japanese demo of judges eye please its a spin off of yakuza games where you curbstomped people as an detective that op is one of the most meta things ive ever seen a gag of a running gag of yakuzas karaoke segments which are gags of real lifekaraoke in yakuza one of the most meta games out there oh my gosh nico finished two series one after another again what are the odds of that steinsgate 0 or devil survivor 2 would be great games for you to lp next though thats just my opinon but i think theyre long enough to tide you over till kh 3 just a suggestion from your freindly neighborhood clown lmao that intro weeb levels are through the roof on that one lol i love it hey nico try playing fire emblem awakening time for my favorite boss in the whole series this comment might not be seen by nico but this man right here is the main reason of why i can always be more comfortable with my awkward side of my personality ive tried to keep hidden for so long to see a 30 year old man acting the way he does online made me smile and laugh so much no offense nico all i have to say is thank you nicob also i have a pretty good himiko and komeda impression if you ever want to hear it hey nico thank you so much for such continuously good content you never disappoint if i were to pick something for you to lp by the by id probably suggest the paper mario series theyre such a fun little series of games and the first especially isnt too long or side quest heavy so i think itd make for a light project not likely drag into the kh3 release besides that seeing you take on like the last of us portal or the bioshock series would be amazing assuming you havent played any of them before anyways i hope you have an amazing holiday and cant wait to see what youll come up with next please consider doing final fantasy vii crisis core for the next lp or just sometime in the near future its really good and you get to learn more about the character zack close up of a flexing bicep near the elbow youtube cleavage detected prepare for demonetization holy shit he really did it 1 his singing voice is amazing as always 2 how fitting that egg nog is for the season 3 i called it or rather i asked for this in episode 2 so thanks 4 kid icarus uprising or custom robo next please 5 heh 6 since this is the end of the lp i just want to say what an awesome one it was and not to forget that tender cleavage i mean umm happy holidays best intro yet haruka daddy i cant believe you were gonna let yourself die on that roof and leave me kiryu sorry haruka you know i didnt mean to leave and will always love you right haruka oh dont worry daddy harukas sss bond level appears kiryu huh haruka holds up a copy of yakuza 3 i know you do bond gauge resets to 0 with the new game kiryu noo nooooooooooooo oh my god that intro was amazing i love it in regards to the big explosion in the beginning of this video kauro was watching the footage of the top of the millinum tower being blown up from the beginning of the game weve see the same clip before in the same game and btw since you like the yakuza games so much youll love jojos bizarre adventure letnicowatchjojo or read it holy crap this lp actually ended shills trails in the sky again its really the perfect lp for nico in every way and its currently on sale the perfect opportunity to grab it top 10 best anime openings so the bomb was fake ok id love for you to go back to to the moon the two dlc stories which take place around christmas btw a bird story and finding paradise are fairly short so itd be easy to get through all of them if necessary theres not enough people playing these games i mentioned this one on the majoras mask finale but i might as well mention it here too to the moons sequel finding paradise is on sale for its 1 year anniversary might be a good time to pick it up and get a very short game out of the way since kh3 is so close i did love kiwami 2 quite a bit there were parts of the story that felt very bs like the whole thing with terada and ryuji wasnt a great villain imo but it was still pretty fun 0 is still my favorite yakuza title as of right now though best intro nico you nailed it that intro was greater than anything i couldve hoped for as i said in the semifinal episode of your majoras mask lp i think youd love the trails and ys games i dont want to spam the same exact comment as last time so ill elaborate a bit more the ys games are action jrpgs that are super fast paced with some amazing music they arent that long either the legend of heroes trails games are excellent jrpgs that thrive on worldbuilding character interactions and writing they are quite long though as for which titles to start out with specifically ys 8 on ps4 switch version is decent too is a good starting point the pc port is not good oath in felghana is another good game to start off with as for trails trails in the sky fc is the first game in that series i hope you at least consider them hope you enjoy your holidays and btw since you like the yakuza games so much youll love jojos bizarre adventure letnicowatchjojo two finales in a row i wonder if one of the next games is going to be short to compensate for the upcoming kingdom hearts 3 great intro also holy crap yakuza 2 ending right after majoras mask and its the 100th episode of yakuza thank you so much nico i wanted this since you started this letsplay the final battle between kiryu and ryuji may be one of my favorite final battles in general opposite to the previous finales the battle here isnt between two people that want to beat each other to death rather the battle is between two men that are aware that one of them may end up dead so they fight with no regrets in an honorable duel to decide who was the strongest dragon the final battle theme being mostly a build up to a melancholic melody is the most appropiate thing to this encounter and it enhances an already solid battle to a legendary status edit oh yeah i forgot to recommend a game for the next lp you know maybe fire emblem path of radiance would be a fine lp nico loves ike in smash so trying out the actual game where he appears could be an interesting to experience to him the game is also one of the easier games in the series so its perfect for a newcomer that is my take now i know why you didnt upload yesterday that intro segment must required a lot of work to get right im glad i got to see these yakuza lps it got me into a series that i ejoyed and now i really want to play the other games luckily i the other games are available on the ps3 so i should be able to enjoy the series until yakuza 6 once again thank you nico for bring another good series into my life and i wish a very enjoyable christmas nico your singing voice is majestic thank you this was a really damn good lets play and i enjoyed every second of it now out of all the new series possible im hoping youll do fire emblem awakening all of the characters are cool in their own quirky ways and you already have the game i couldnt recommend it enough still recommending asuras wrath that intro was indeed a this really shows that we need nico sings back great to see two backtoback finales this games definitely closer to 0 in terms of quality so im looking forward to the other games after some other lps d nico bizzle the dino sizzle the dragon of karaoke insert more titles for nico here please start the layton games i like how nico doesnt drink so he drinks whatever that is what is that milk iced coffee juice that scene with majima disarming the bombs is probably one of my favorite majima scenes now its just too good and the way they just cut to that explosion i was rolling on the floor wasnt even actually concerned whether that was real or not it played like this over the top comedy sketch that had a massive payoff nishida is basically the straight man to majimas insane funny man and then theres also the fact we kinda already know majima is in future games so worst comes to worst majima comes out with a bandaid on his knee so really nothing to worry about there well time to again list good candidate for potential lps or livestream games lets do this kid icarus uprising a 9 chapter game that is a lot of fun disgaea there is a version on nintendo switch shantae riskys revenge pirates curse or half genie hero continuing to the moon been a while va11 halla kids game that was launched on april fools doki doki literature club just because a certain character appeared on nicobs you may also like pokmon mystery dungeon never happening but is a good game he should play just for the nice story hyperdimension neptunia time to stretch out your girl voices nicob steins gate zero would be nice to see the continuation slime rancher cuteness needs to return thank you and good night that intro is what my heaven looks like that was the best intro everrrrrrrr i didnt even watch this entire lp im not caught up on yakuza though i will he eventually i just came for the previously on segments and holy crap i think this might be my new favorite finale segment never apologize for being awesome nico never apologize oh no nico pronunciation tiem my body is not ready kid icarus uprising when fist of the north star ps do americas got talent kid icarus ok this is the last time ill ask i promise bakamitai for the council of voices legend of heroes trails in the sky nico has gained the ultimate power of bakamiti i want nico to do a full cover of baka mitai you should try kid icarus uprising the style and humour should be right up your alley and the perfect game for voices and other shenanigans omg he fucking did it the absolute mad man sang bakamitai best cover on yt thanks so much for the finale of this glorious game i had so much fun replaying it with you you did have a lot of trouble but you pulled through in the end and i thank you for that i would still once again request any shin megami tensei games for future lps as usual until you play one it worked for devil survivor 1 i hope you have a happy xmas with your friends and family suddenly remembers in the final of kiwami nico misheard when terada showed up thought he was shimano instead and said back from the dead assholes i think i count this as half a point in the bullshit meter sure he meant it for shimano buuut kinda funny about this chance of luck anyone else get up and started singing with this beautiful man hey nico gonna say real quick i enjoyed the lp of yakuza kiwami 2 but if you are looking for something short to do next between now and kh3 kid icarus uprising is a really solid game to pick also holy shit nico that opening was the coolest shit ive seen best version of bakamitai right here the intro is perfect and id have it no other way okay wow that opening was worth every second of extra time nico needed to take i bet nishida asks himself everyday why he is working for this guy what am i doing to myself why do i work for majima because the only way to get out is death you leave you die oh yeah right thats it back to work dub dududu duduuuu holy turkey bagel sandwhich scattered moment is an amazing final boss ost i mean just look back at the previous two games in comparison 0 was great but it was to get you pumped to fight shibusawa 1 was good because it was to fight nishiki but after jingu it was meh 2 is amazing because of the emotional impact at the end despite ryuji being the bad guy you get a sense of humanity from him before the fight wanting to see his sister safe both men have been shot both knowing they itch closer and closer to death each second but they still need to finish what they started as soon as that piano starts you dont get that yeah final boss lets go feeling but more of i dont want to do this but i have to guitars and violins have played with the series so far for most osts to get you pumped for all the fights but this isnt one to look forward to but you need to by the time that guitar hits you get into the fight but damn if that ost doesnt have an impact also play professor layton vs phoenix wright it has an awesome story and is way better as an introduction to layton than the first layton game since curious is way too hard and can be a bit bland at time i honestly didnt realize you were so close to the end i guess its because i stopped to do side stuff after the previous chapter so it seemed way longer than it actually was also i kinda saw that opening coming after some comments in earlier episodes but it was still great for a short lp before kh3 comes out next month i recommend either bayonetta or professor layton both are really fun games with bayonetta being a really fun action game that is often incredibly hilarious professor layton on the other hand is a more relaxing game with a really nice story for each game that i think you would greatly enjoy still want kid icarus playthrough i love this playthrough and the opening that was the best possible intro to the finale of this series also play trails in the sky youve been avoiding it for too long i think thats the most weve seen of nicos house this game managed to so the impossible not making the game look as good as pre rendered cutscenes not cutting out loading screens for shops no it did much much better it managed to turn terada into an actually decent character with actual depth nico i want a full cover of you singing baka mitai not gonna lie that was fucking awesome seriously your voice is great what an oscarworthy performance that intro is the best fucking thing ever id like to see tales of berseria as a future lp especially with vesperia hd coming soon give me some hot sweet sexy loving kiwami 2 and less tender clevage nicob you keep going bigger and better with these finale intros xd that intro was beautiful a work of art truly deserving of a score of 100 what a glorious baka mitai my god that intro the best bakimitai happy holidays nico and everyone who sees this comment you know that was a really great yakuza story i do have my gripes on terada still being alive since that felt like complete bs but asides from that the writing is pretty top notch in this game its a super good crime mystery that had some feelsy moments and great characters better utilized its right below 0 for me as one of the better yakuza game plots as for the next lp id still like to recommend kid icarus uprising its a fun beat em up game made by the creator of smash brothers masahiro sakurai and has some shooter elements but its not an fps by any means its very easy to record as its a level by level based game and there isnt much to cut out due to the dialogue that occurs mid level as youre traveling through it its a really short game i believe you could finish it in about 10 to 14 episodes just in time for kingdom hearts 3 i also think youd love kid icaruss sense of humor its cast is very charming and they love to poke fun at classic vi i didnt even watch the whole thing yet and this is already my favorite episode ever i think this is the earliest ive ever been on a video and your comment gets me excited and scared the intro im dying also thanks nico again for doing my baka mitai intro for this lets play i kinda feel like i contributed to this channel for once lol that intro restored my faith in humanity everyone say it with me we want tits we want tits we want tits wow such a great episode definitely watched the whole thing even though it was posted less than a minute ago so we at the end of yakuza kiwami 2 it has been such an adventure going this amazing game one thing i want you to know is about the final boss theme a scattered moment please listen to it more clearly on your own time you had an epic battle of dragons in yakuza 0 which you felt good to take down shibusawa but this particular theme is different you know ryuji was born from a mafia gang which knew nothing of respect his mother murdered by the same group his blood father taken down by the tojo clans dojima family the father he had during his time in the omni alliance keeping secrets from him and then his only family connection his half sister kaoru which he didnt even know separated from him for all these years his past was incredibly sad and yet he had the will to fight one more fight so he could respectfully go out this is a very emotional epic fight in which was not between two dragons i mean it is considering the dialogue before the final fight but rather between yes he did the opening yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaah well this was a really great series and even with all the technical issues it had which thankfully we managed to get through at the same time i hope that all the trivia and tips i gave you throughout this series were useful d but now its time for the final one so the next game in the series is yakuza 3 and as you may know thanks to the yakuza sunset substory its pretty diverse among the fanbase and the way youre playing those games might not exactly help not that they way you lp those games is bad but mostly even though chronological order works really well it does have its jumps in quality and y3 is that one point it was made y4 too on a older engine than even the one that games like yakuza 5 or 0 were created in and it being the first proper game that at the time was made on a nextgen console as in ps3 has some problems with trying to get it right with some aspects of it and ps4 remaster of it doesnt really fix those specific issues like combat feeling r im not crying youre crying i was just watching the last episode of yakuza 0 133213 this scene again from kiwami lol i love how you called this a movie cause the cutscenes are crazy long 130437 the legendary meme 120120 im surprised he lasted that long with 5 shots in his body yakuza kiwami 2 i want it to release on pc xd thank god for these game movie videos i had to rewatch some scenes because i have been interrupted during two of them one because of my dad and the other because i had to call the police for an incident in the neighborhood i also have been spending ungodly amounts of time away from the campaign and doing substory feeding kiryu and spending a lot of time at four shine god i love four shine anyway thanks for posting this video oof it is painful to watch some of this especially during the tutorials on learning new techniques that are supposed to help you in situations like dealing more damage to enemies using firearms he uses it once and then continues to not utilize the skill he just learned and gets wrecked by it its painful to watch him try to brute force his way through even just the training xx cmon man this gus is straight trash at this game lol but thanks for the cut scenes lol 41719 majima knew its the pants stealer all along 120552 does anyone knows the track nane the whole timebar is yellow on my iphone majima is everywhere kiryus voice is damn good n i want to replay everything d stupid korean punch woman 110915 if up to me i kept searching for 500 to 600 thousand yen because we been buying a lot of health drink tips if you want to make an easy money enter the coliseum or find a guy wearing a gold suit at street area theres alot of ads this kid must like money atleast i got fucking hacked yourube app so no fucking money for yoi greddy man toranosuke sengoku looks like sohei dojima thats why i was so confused 103226 my bad that fat guy is modeled after sohei dojima hey theres a retconn in yakuza kiwami 2 ryuji goda is with sohei dojima and kidnaped haruka to set up kiryu kiryu doesnt meet haruka until he gets out of jail after covering for nishiki killing dojima in yakuza 1 and sohei dojima has been dead for 10 years by this time kiryu is out of jail so wtf how can sohei still be alive when kiryu gets out of jail near the end i was like this bomb isnt gonna blow cuz i know damn well majima is gonna come diffuse this bomb and save me next moment i see majima just sitting on a damn bench at 141626 look like hes watching fireworks or something i never screamed so fucking loud before goddamn it lmao blue collar majima is best majima fuckkkinnn helllll that goro majima makoto part was heavy af for me still dont understand how drastically different he was back then when they made the prequel they were sorta inconsistent with that is this it no more yakuza what happend whats the song at 73315 the background ost 102754 is one of my favorite scene ever cuz this is the first time we have ever seen kiryu act this way before and it hurt him knowing wat he done to the girl he has feeling for plus the music was good as well bruh why didnt you feed haruka the ramen 25414 i need to know the name of those girls doing mocaps theyre very cute tho p in yakuza kiwami after 17 years he barely look like he aged in yakuza kiwami 2 1 year passes and the 17 years finally hit him please someome help me find the song that was in the majima massage cutscene that isnt the cutscnes it s full gameplay an ex yakuza and a division four cophellava pair they truly are i just wish we could see kiruys two best buddies akiyama and date fight along with them thanks for the video thank you so much for uploading this you are appreciated returning to one of my favourite franchises this is technically a remake of yakuza 2 which originally released on the ps2 and continues on from yakuza kiwami which i uploaded last year expect long and awesome cutscenes badass fight sequences crazy humor and a mindblowing story about the criminal underworldwhich is what yakuza does best my first yakuza game on ps2 didnt get far because i didnt know what to do lol best game in history of games all yakuza games are so amazing just keep going bro 4020 did you edit that or was that in the game hey willzyyy its me again your favourite sub great to see you back on yakuza man keep them pumping out to us 3 finally bro about tym this series is awesome this is new game or remake yeah road to the yakuza 2 remake and this gameplay is like yakuza 6 back in months ago quality content under 1000 views definitely worth a sub i feel like the main character really doesnt like bicycles wait what am i sitting on your dignity which isnt a lot ayam 3 the only thing that shines back there is the greatness of your poll xd can you tell me please how to put to play during day not always at night are all vending machines usable unlike the other my god what happened to the prices its a robbery to live in kamurocho nowadays please explore the whole map i have many memories with this game the ending to this episode is the saddest in the entire series kiryu play bakamitai 2 i really want to play this game that first 20 seconds was the most overdramatic and overracted shit ive seen today and i could not watch the rest of this shit i honestly wish i could scream this much while recording xd because i dont see anybody else commenting on it the old man told you to beat his high score on virtua fighter 2 which is 3 techinically you could have quit at any time after the pai fight and still completed the substory hmm makes me wonder if takashimas purpose was akin to seras when he sent an assassin to kill kiryu in yk 1 but what bothers me on this one is how the assassin that was situated atop the building knew that sayamas car would park right there within his perimeter it was supposedly a random stop and that ending im just losing my shit over the name ano i laughed so hard i play as lion too did strange resistance woman teach you nothing real question is when full cover of bakamitai crashes yeah i recently had that happen in smt 4 i had been playing for like 10 hours and forgot to save fucking auto saves spoiled us it happened because the dragon engine sucks idk if its been pointed out either in latter episodes or comments or if you noticed it but the ring on 929 looks very similar to the ring in on the guy in the opening cutscene 1536 to the right of the fight wasnt that running morishige i knew he was behind this shit it always comes back to you doesnt it morishige will your tyranny never end at 11251 right when the guy turns to kiryu the game crasher i guess generic guy number 43148 just evolved to game crasher nicos worst nightmare beware him and fear him cause daddy kiryu wont save now nico 253 does nico not remember that one sidequest in yakuza 0 nicos obsession keeps growing and bad end nico nico nico if you havent seen the playstation launch trailer for this please check it out it is all the glory of the yakuza series in 1 video majima is in it ouch sorry about your file loss reminds me of when i had a near 3 hour grinding session in a pokemon romhack and forgot to save because i was so relieved that i could finally go to bed the realization of what happened popped up in my head just after closing the screen i checked hoping that what i thought happened didnt happen and sure enough i went to bed angry at myself though this is very nostalgic because me an my brother used to play this on my dads sega console along with the other games 2844 bro i remember me and my brother would laugh about that a lion kicking you is the best you can hope for half of the video i dont make it a habit to fight the elderly eghh welcome back to more nostalgia with nico b id love to see some fan art of kaoru finding kiryus modeling photos on this special episode of yakuza kiwami 2 nico spends a third of the episode a good amount of his money and all of his patience to beat a rich old mans high score in virtua fighter 2 im going to have to ask you to make the next bakamitai image the application error in the end of this episode sayama dammit kiryu im dying kiryu just another minute gotta drink some tea to heal my wounds sayama mind passing one my way kiryu no way those things cost like 80 yen each ill just drag you across town so your barkeep friend can fix you up instead 5902 yukiko wheres yu when you need em probably fighting shadows while making out with naoto really nico nugget i love nugget i just finished persona 5 a few days go i didnt get the bad ending on valentines day tho i say ann is the best waifu ever nicob x bernie esaki 300 grand time to hit the bank buddy kiryu im not paying that esaki well too bad cant pay cant play and the old man crashes the game i kinda hope nicob sees my comment lol ill have to say it nico youve ruined baka mitai for me since the second video of the lets play not only did you sing it without the feeling the song is meant to portrait sadness and reminisce but you also sing it in the effing larry voice a voice you constantly say its one from the character you really hate talk about irony replaces bakamitai with untitled by simple plan how could this happen to me ive made my mistakes theres nowhere to run but life goes on as my progress faded away im sick of these updates i just want to scream how could this happen to me funny how when nico finally gets to play virtual fighter in yakuza his console gives him the finger informer guy 300 grand cant make it a lick cheaper kiryu im not paying that shit fuck this breaks the fourth wall and crashes the game nico what did i do to you i seriously want him to use 11257 for the photo in the intro sometime soon xddd wait you can retry after a game over in the arcades now awesome now i can simulate getting quarter munched please tell me you are going to do a kingdom hearts 3 lets play virtualon was one of my favorite arcade games since i was a kid i would spend a long time in my arcade just playing the game you should really check it out if you have the time and i dont want to spoil it for you what it is about unless you do know virtualon nico imagined things would slow down he didnt think it would erase it play project x zone 2 next on 3ds plz surely you dont know it but ano means butthole in my language so buttholechan is the king of virtua fighter 21 nicobs save file corrupts nico fuck me nooo monomi i told you to save but noooo nico shuddup monomi not now 10951 youd think the guy with his collar popped and smokin a cig was the yakuza and the guy with slick hair and proper attire was the police ha oh the times have changed this series make me happy with every new epi i love it soo much i mostly giving likes and not comment but i really wanted to say that i love your yakuze serieswalkthrough and watch them all and seen every new episode about those games always make me supper happy and laugh hard thank you nico for making them and thats why you save every opportunity you have rip god the osaka accent is really getting to meya hope it doesnt affect meya wait nicob has a ps2 background does that mean nico is going to play a ps2 game after xenoblade pretty terrible theory but who knows that has got me curious because there are so many ps2 games that are absolutely amazing oh wait but kiwami 1 2 are remakes of ps2 games now i am unsure maybe he will play an actual ps2 game kiryus i never killed anyone count 1732 latest stabbed some guys thorugh the stomach i love this game man when he was carrying kaoru through the city all i could think was im glad majima isnt chasing him down right now for a fight majima kiryuchan kiryu not now majima i have to save this girls life majima thisll be great training to help awaken the dragon within you im not letting you pass until you beat me info broker 300k or go home kiryu well im not paying that file corrupted hours of gameplay lost i sense something elusive man does it feel bad after laughing at nico raging over game the good old nico trying to keep his mental health together after wasting 38 mins of virtua bs wow that was the biggest fuck you ive ever seen a game do the game was just like i see youve gone through the torment of virtua fighter 21 it would be a shame if the game gets corrupted cannot continue using this application the game data for the following application is corrupted delete the application from the ps4 and then insert the disc again oh wow the game got corrupted aint that a knife in the ribs we need nico to play hyperdimension neptunia series since he has gone weeb you shouldve let bakamitai play during what happened at the end of the video i feel like it would have been quite fitting what if kiyo from danganronpa was in the danganronpa universe kiryu does a heat move in the seesaw kiyo did someone say seesaw jumps in the seesaw kiryu ahhh get away from me ah the dreaded blue screen ive seen it a few times myself though in my case i was playing fallout 4 witcher 3 and prey fortunately those games have autosave so i didnt lose too much progress now that i know that yakuza kiwami 2 can do this too and it doesnt have autosave i now know that ifwhen i get this game i should save often just in case something like this happens when you were fighting kage i thought there was a fucking cricket in my room the entire fucking time omg and this is why you should never forget to hard save every time you do something big even if theres an autosave feature present god knows how many times it can screw up your progress that being said baka mitai with kiryu and his precious save file eh eh nico im pretty sure you only had to beat 4 fights in virtua fighter cause the guy mentions beating his 3win streak previously on yakuza kiwami 2 bakamitai showing majima and now back to bakamitai mr chicken next episode will be mr libido show time bakamitai akira karate master nimble years of training kiryu judo skills heavy hitter master daddy round 1 fight favorite quote of the episode yeah dont dont act confident lion alright weve been doing this for twenty four minutesoh god jacky aaaah and this nico is why we save frequently i and my friends know your pain nico damn you were starting to get closer to unlocking the cabaret club saga how the bulls misses us it because if main character shield you can order it right cell 1800 kiryu chan 1318 yeah i dont think this is a good time to be dicking aroundwait can i do that option 2 be an ass and dick i want the next intro picture swap to be that screen that says the data is corrupted my thought about how this game really pull story very intensive and beautifully put lot of intensive main story plot include cool characters and kiryu singing bakamitai 2 americaotaku is the proper term for japanese person who is obsessed with american culture average lifespan of chicken 78 years nuggets age since yakuza zero 18 years now i have to see you play project x zone 2 one day i mean it has so many characters from series you played kiryu and majima akira and kagemaru fiora phoenix etc also as long as kiryu doesnt miss kokichis face we are save the ending xd as bullshit as 90s arcade fighting game ai is nothing will be as traumatizing to me as onslaught in marvel vs capcom 1 the end of the video be like top 10 anime betrayals kiryu looks for stuff ends up breaking shit dont give a fuck thats the way of the daddy random guy oh my god is that woman on your back okay you should get her to a hospital dude but first lets talk about girls kiryu oh man mr libido is that you i knew you were in this game alright lets get to talking kaoru uuuuuuuuuuugh 5 hours later kiryu well that was fun hey you okay kaoru hello shit and here i thought that i was watching yakuza kiwami 2 but it was steins gate all along kiryu does it hurt much kaoru oh no it feels great it was only a fucking bullet you dumb fuck kiryu no need to get bitchy about it they shouldve put kiryu in virtua fighter 21 as a hidden character i have a great tip for virtua fighter read what people say so you only do 4 rounds instead of all of them which is not only super hard but a big time consumer tip you should try getting boost combo speed as quickly as possible the difference in attack speed before and after the upgrades is quite significant also dat ending tho screen turns black and white bakamitai plays in the background well at least you dont have to go through the entire arcade mode for that sidestory you only have to beat the first three rounds and then just quit please make the picture in the next now back to an error screen xd this is so sad majima play 24 hour cinderella welp i guess your game decided to crash and burn xp 4710 nah kiryu doesnt make allowances for old men p i still really want nico to play project x zone this just made me want it more kiryu are you jongka jongka hey buddy think ya could snag me one of them prizes kiryu i can try but then we talk 2 seconds later jongkawhoa nice job buddy kiryuso you are jongka arent you jongka it was if wasnt for those dirty yakuza for putting me in debt and they took my little girl yukiko and if i want to see her again i have to pay five million yen but ya wont have a five million yen on ya kiryu i am sorrybut all im really after is an invitation to the richi tower jongka richi tower ya mean ya need the cherry blossom tile well tell ya what ya get back my baby girl and this tile is all yours kiryu well your girl doesnt get kill by this jongka dont let them hurt yukiko 12 hours later kiryu yukiko was a cat the whole time and hi mrkitty yukiko meow meow meow kiryuno mrkitty no fish yukiko meow meow meow kiryu no just get in my coat pocket mrkitty hi nicob i just love ur lets play and well am on youtube as well and i want to ask with this f that intro was glorious xd what next the waiter from kiwami that kiryu used as a meat shield lol the old mans name is kanematsu kane as okane as in money i cant help but think about osomatsusan kanematsu is a matsuno sibling xd just so you guys know 10 of this episode is main story 20 of this episode is side storie 69 of this episode is nico playing virtua fighter against pai 09 of this episode is nico winning on virtua fighter 01 of this episode is nico actually doing good at virtua fighter overall amazing episode nico 1010 would virtua fighter again nicob is heading for evo nico has an extremely powerful device in his hands capable of playing a console with an extremely high frame rate and amazing graphics what nico does plays a low graphic game from 2006 nico enjoying a fighting game who are you and what you done with the real nico xd the end rip my actual worst nightmare i feel so bad for nico sometimes i wonder if im going overboard by saving in games almost every 10 minutes but things like that make me real paranoid oof the end of the video owch i hate that 3600 lion who are you lion im you but stronger fun fact ano means anus in spanish nicos character profile in virtua fighter literally means anus very nice nicob lets plays viturual fighter 21 phone rings kiryu hello timiyo hey kiryu i asked for bandages fifteen minutes ago what are you doing kiryu yeah just let me beat this game of virtua fighter real quick timiyo what sayama is bleeding out on the couch kiryu its only a shot to the shoulder shell be fine for a couple of minutes sayama in the background coughing blood im dying timiyo kiryu kiryu give me ten minutes to beat kages face in timiyo who the fuck is kage 1 hour later kiryu i got the the bandages wheres sayama timiyo she died fortyfive minutes ago you ass kiryu oh imagine if in virtual fighter 6 the last virtua fighter game was 5 final showdown given how much hes requested in tekken 7 sega makes kiryu a guest character in that wow that sucked at the end hopefully virtual fighter is easier the second time yeah arcade fighting games are hard af to win at they have the computer read your inputs so that they could get your quarters oh my god nugget brilliant kiryu why is there a sega watermark on my photo edit oooof that crash at the end w hey at least you have this video itself to locate the keys and stuff you did before but it doesnt help so much with randomised things or the minigame man that sucks i can relate i had to reinstall one of my games twice just to fix the issue with the game game shows cutscene of phone call happening from the other guys perspective game shows cutscene of detectives trying to figure out who was on the other side of the phone call nico i bet it was the guy from the cutscene earlier in the game ace detective nico always gets his man next episode the photo in bakamitai is just gonna be this videos thumbnail funny you entered ano as your name as that word in spanish means anusass i shed manly tears at the end of this episode not only because nico lost like an hour of ingame progress but also at how beautiful that ps2 theme looks is that actually a theme you can buy on the psn store cause i want my ps4 to make me feel nostalgic too daniel what are those people jumping for miyagi called mantis technique daniel does it work miyagi if do right no can defense daniel where did you learn it miyagi from a french highschooler with an annoying voice daniel he must have been some warrior miyagi yes he was i imagine that after nico finished recording for this episode he headed to his local bar to sing baka mitai for his lost progress nico in his larry voice dame da ne dame yo dame na no yo anta ga suki de suki sugite dore dake tsuyoi osake de mo yugamanai omoide ga baka mitai nico the first choice of overwhelming affluence always gives you 100000 no matter the choice just correcting that small thing ah yes fighting game arcade mode i can feel the memories overtaking me it is a good pain i guess lion is morishiges brother instead of aya its eeh and yukiko finally found her princeher dad rip the file nico played i got no clever or short comment its my birthday and find this a great gift mama hey kaoru is kinda bleeding out can you bring some bandages when you come back kiryu sure casually plays virtua fighter for an hour its been 4 episode and majima not appeared yet i need my majima daily quota damn it it was on this day that this went from a yakuza let play to a virtual fighter lets die gdi nico dont spend all your money on the arcade you need bandages not only is the boss brand of coffee a real thing but so is cc lemon ive had it and let me just say that it tastes like a carbonated lemonade that tastes pretty good i mean i dont live in japan hong kong here but we also have the brand here and its honestly real good the real reason the money isnt flowing anymore is because the japanese had to deal with mr kittys hunger and mr kitty ate everyone out of their wealth man that ending really was sad good job on beating virtua fighter though nico 825 sae is that you i called them freeabus kanematsu youre from kamurocho right kiryu err yeah what about it kanematsu well to tell you the truth i remember a guy with the same name who even looks like you whom used to run a real estate business there and i was one of the kings there i fought him before and he was tough as you kiryu kings wait dont tell me kanematsu yes i was once called the electronic king all thanks to that other kiryu now ive lived in sotenbori rich as hell after he disappeared 20 years ago kiryu oh err good for you lots of project x zone characters here rip sorry for your lost it happens im a victim too nico i want your next intro to be the picture of your save file kiryu singing bakamitai while looking at the picture of the save file 714 ive heard the stories about you being ultimate daddy no as much as i want to claim the title there is another got to live yakuza 0 people get shot in the heart and all over the place and dont die yakuza 2 lady get shot in the shoulder and like instantly on the verge of death and passes out yakuza heres how we deal with guys who fuck around a few moments later newsreporter last night we found several yakuza men dead the suspect is still on the loose kiryu wasnt me nico god i wish theyd make virtua fighter playable in yakuza id play it so much a single finger curls in from the monkey paw my heart started to hurt after the ending put up a virtua fighter death counter after this video nico was found in a bar drinking whiskey and looking at a photo of his broken save file nico doesnt look like he gets the basics of fighting games cant wait to play him in smash ultimate ah boss coffee i remember watching random japanese commercials years ago tommy lee jones ones were hilarious httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvle21qqhlolq seriously watch it if you havent skill acquired essence of not taking allowances from old men or is it the essence of eeehn tamiyo kiryu darling please bring me some bandages asap because the wounds are bad and if they open up it could cause a lot of problems kiryu leave it to daddy kiryu spends the next 40 minutes playing virtual fighter agaisnt an old man kiryu im bac tamiyo what the heck is wrong with you why did you let my daughter die kiryu procedes to regret that decision for his entire life he abandoned the tojo clan and is now a virtual fighter pro player bad end f well look on the bright side at least it didnt corrupt farther in the game and send you back to square one i mean that would mean hours of grinding unlocking items and watching through deep coreshaking another scenario is that it get deleted the latter to me once when i was playing another game called hyper light drifter and gotten to the fourth level of the game and stopped playing it when i went back it was gone i was ticked off im going to miss that game let all have a moment of silence for game data and progress we lost through unforeseen circumstances i thought this was a new lp for a second because of the thumbnail can kiryu throw me into the popcorn machine i think it was hard is because you were insisting in playing if it were virtual fighter 4 when you were playing virtual fighter 2 and you were playing the arcade version that was that slow i think petition for picture of naked dunban to be featured on the next episode of dame dame nico has finally learned that kiryus kneecaps are a thing of legend years of fighting have made them strong enough to shatter chairs with a single tap rip nicos sanity with the virtua fighter substory and the worst part is im pretty sure you only had to beat the 3rd fight in it 11238 kiryu maybe i can make a call to yamanoi calls yamanoi yamanoi hello kiryu its been a while how are you yamanoi pretty good marina and the five billionaires have kept me company all these years working hard and making kamurocho the place to be what do you need kiryu i need 300000 for some information about something important yamanoi allow me to echo something that you said to a cab scammer when you interviewed him this is a real estate firm not a loan company where you can ask for chump change now beat it hangs up kiryu dammit i should have asked for a trade maybe ask to sleep with marina in exchange for the money oh well im not paying that much time to ask kurokawa for help in a trivia note in og 2 the game wont tell you but you can actually go to kurokawa to do the next thing or pay the 300000 wouldnt be fun if kiryu was dio from joe joe bizarre adventure and at the end of the game he revealed that it was me dio hey nico how about streaming the virtua fighter series you can play one after the other to see how much the games changed that would be really fun to watch that end tho top 10 saddest anime deaths i just want that screenshot of the game crashing to be the next picture in next episodes and now back to man that guy wanted his 300 grand so badly he crashed nicos game to get it now thats how you really play hardball also you need to do the karaoke songs as fast as humanly possible one song will probably be the most badass song youll ever hear in the series and the other one is a fucking tearjerker and no its not bakamitai im talking about or your weird renditions of it unfortunately the second one has a certain requirement so youll have to save it for later 1 like1 prayer for nicos lost gameplay that ending was a biiiiiiiiii even with games that has autosave in them i still save manually because of paranoia and this right here its like trusting word to still have your paper automatically saved and then you find out it saved from when youre still in the beginning kiryu during the intro look at this photograph everytime i look it makes me cry the rest of the song is just the journey of his singular manly tear ever think that daddy kiryu is a struggling alcholic dude always has a hideout in a bar of some kind singing sad songs remembering good times with stepdaddy majima i feel your pain at the end there my ps4 do that so many times now it sucksat least now youll remember to save your game lol i wonder where the kermit frogs from mother3 are when you need them lol when the only one able to beat kyriu is sony you know how it is just walking down the street its a beautiful day and some buff yakuza looking fella is running down the street giving a lady with a shoulder wound a piggyback ride and you just really want to talk to him about the weather seeing nico nerd out is pretty awesome when nico approached the couch and kaoru disappeared for a second all i could think of was kaoru kiryukun i dont feel so good what soundtrack plays at 1830 tfw nugget probably went on to become actual nuggets each time i curb stomp someone i gain a new pinstripe to my dragon tattoo so this is what yukiko been doing after the fight games shes running around kamurocho as a cat some old yukiko i guess that ending top 10 anime betrayals i like the comment of the day because they are pretty funny kiryus adventure to save yukiko little did he already know yukiko had already beaten the yakuza with her awful cooking kiryu never killed anyone but that meal certainly did and that nico is why you take 10 seconds to save your game after every mission for the next intro kiryu should look at a picture of the front cover of yakuza kiwami 2 or the data corrupt message definitely sadder than a picture of majima in his cinderella outfit or nugget ok still rip nugget d sees virtua fighter 2 sees pai war flashbacks intensify katakana is just another alphabet they use to spell out foreign words its not really because they think its cool its more like its more convenient for them especially with all the new western words that were introduced to japan back in the day lion what a knucklehead reyn what a bunch of jokers nico what a bunch of bonnits i can safely assume that they are all the same nico is just doing different voices to confuse us we have been lied to our entire lives fellow picky penguins how do escape what fate has in store for us i like the writing in this game a lot more compared to kiwami 1 just for those scenes like with date they give you a great broadened perspective of whats going on kiwami 1 had some scenes like these but they felt kinda lazy imo cause i dont think you noticed in the scene at the start of the game the guy that was shot by kazama and the women with the baby were both speaking korean its why their subtitles were in brackets and did not sound at all like japaneses never imagined seeing nico play an old school fighting game on his channel maybe he should do some mortal kombat next i would love to see that i think the game actually warns you in the beginning that it doesnt autosave the game hasnt crashed on me yet but i do make it a habit to save religiously id be amazed if nico can do a different photo for each episode intro lol can someone explain what han mean whe you address to someone in japan make the picture kiru and nishiki singing the mystery drinks actually have a random effect they can sometimes heal you completely or add random stat buffs play world of final fantasy it has all the fan service like yuna rydia warrior of light and much more in chibi form sorry about that ending nico that was really unfortunate but congratulations on reaching dural i gave up at lion to beat that rich guy all you had to do was win 3 or more rounds which you did so if you want you can win 4 rounds and then just quit and it would still counts though i am not sure if you are allowed to use continues for the completion point all you have to do is play as all characters once you dont have to win any fights btw there is another minigame you can unlock at the sega arcade for that you have to talk to the guy in front of the arcade he has a green triangle above his head and is standing on the left side also if you play some more golf there is a skill book you can earn by playing golf bingo iirc when you read it you can learn how to better use your golfclub in combat and yah lease more yakuza there is a lot of funny sup stories you must play damn thats unlucky xd wait game crashed on you and the moral of the story is always periodically save your game even if its brand new the more you know aoi is a great name yukiko got in all sorts of trouble before the amagi inn huh feels good that koreans are getting into the action for yakuza damn sucks that the game crashed maybe its a problem with the base ps4 version i have a ps4 pro and ive never had it crash in the 50 hours ive put into the game if only kiryu could learn moves from playing virtua fighter i would love to see nico use the heat move essence of eeh nico the guy in virtual fighter takes a drink for that bottle because hes doing the drunken fist fighting style the fighting styles intention is to basically keep your opponent on your toes basically making it hard to predict what you would do next jongkas daughter is named yukiko and we are in japan and she has been kidnapped shes fine she can handle herself all shes gotta do is burn them alive with her persona kiryu the hell yukiko oh you were a bit late i already dealt with the problem myself now if you will excuse me i must go back to my inn kiryu then what was the point in me going to do this goddamnit god damnit i got to the part where nicos game crashed and then windows crashed not saying i blame him or anything but its very definitely unquestionably his fault anyway on to other stuff im rather sad that nico had the whole clan creator thing spoiled so early on maybe try to avoid looking at the cabaret club clan creator stuff in the upgrades menu from now on so you dont run into anything that will spoil the other stuff in those modes takashimas appearance in this game reflects his new voice actor who is different to the one who played him in the original having said that in the original takashima looked like a young man in his twenties or early thirties whereas here he has as bessho so eloquently puts it a wrinkly ass for some reason takashimas original character design pops up somewhere else though i cant honestly tell why they changed it also from last time kiryu yeah i dont like unfair fights kiryu ryuji had to beat up daigo so he tommy lee jones stared in some boss coffee commercials as an alien disguised as tommy lee jones called jones oh my god a new yakuza video yes yees yyaaaaaassss yyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssss ooooohhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaahhh bizzbell then dies that day from orgasming too hard which caused their lungs to explode kiryu solid dragon ryugi liquid dragon with colonel date in support rip my dude next episodes bakamitai kiryu crying at a picture of a save file the office of the kazama family led by kashiwagi was relocated to the top floor of the millennium tower we saw that in the beginning of the game thats why ryuji blew it up nico next to aoi the bar you took kaoru to is an acupuncture clinic where you can unlock skills after doing certain things who would win a very confident martial artist with years of training lion or a 14 year old girl who only enters into the virtua fighter tournament to get back at her dad pai monokuma i will make you feel true despair ending to this video hold my beer as someone who also played virtua fighter 4 i can agree with you on lions voice acting but does kiryu take allowance from old men virtua fighter the worst tekken game ever play crisis core sees intro that has nishikis pic nishiki didnt die he turned into a dragon thats all cries nishiki why why hearing about nicos experiences with virtua fighter actually kinda makes me want to try the series out ive always heard about it and seen references to it in other sega games but the closest i ever got to playing them was a lil bit of virtua quest on the gamecube im curious though whats the best game for newcomers if its a story mission and someone asks for money usually you can say no and do something else to move on i think yeeesss thank you nico this great lets play series has become greater 3 looking cool joker oh damn no sideview well this will make it a lot harder flawless victory remember the old times where cd would not properly load games oh wait laughs sorry nicob i like you very much but please dont hate me is it just me or is kaoru like serious waifu material also you may have loved virtua fighter but im super hyped for some virtualon loved that shit back on the saturn nico the reason you were struggling at vf is because of input reading ai it was and still is a very prominent feature to increase the difficulty back at the arcade days the devs did it to pretty much extort money from players by making ai increasingly cheap as you progress the term snk boss syndrome was born because of this since snk absolutely loves to make extremely cheap bosses im looking at you cvs2 god rugal by making them be able to counter everything you can throw at them at the first frame possible the entire time you were trying to beat virtua fighter i thought you were just going for the required 4 wins but youve won my respect by going for all 10 good on ya nico the most powerful heat action game crash style essence of save corruption the nostalgia boner is skyrocketing xd wow thats a harsh ending dont worry about replaying virtua fighter though youll still advance the quest if you dont beat him you just dont get the 100000 yen i think but its not that big a deal youll make ample money soon enough that moment when you expect some yakuza gameplay but its a camouflaged virtua fighter 21 gameplay i thought you starting a new lp because of that thumbnail today nico learned the bitter truth of arcade games they were more dificult than the console version and they were going to make you suffer like never before and you pay for it thats the idea every climax of yakuza random thug 1 the big secret we have been building up is out kiryu welp lets all rip our shirts off and start decking each other with park benches its nice to see more of the omi alliance the only characters i feel like we really knew up until now were sagawa and terada so i hope well see others that well get to know nugget is actually alive hes just bionic now from the money he got as head boss of the real estate agency after kiryu left you can call him the 6 billion yen mcnugget okay thank god it wasnt just me feeling like virtua fighter was really hard to beat with their ai remember nugget everyone remember that beautiful bird starts crying i can watch nico play virtua fighter all day and realize that its a game within a game man that sucksi know what it feels to have the game stop working after not saving for a while hello kingdom hearts 2 hope it doesnt take to long to get back to that point 4708 old man didnt anyone ever tell you to let the eldery win nico i dont make it habit to show mercy to the elderly kanematsu i challeng you kiryu to virtua fighter 21 kiryu i accpe nicobruns in pushing kiryu away i accept the challenge kiryu what the hell nico he was challenging me nicobgrabs kiryu and pulls him outside a few minutes later nicob this is between us old man kanematsu okay but what happened to kiryu nicob hes busy at the moment in an alleyway kiryuhalf dead damnnicob is the dog of the world back in club sega kanematsu you cant beat me with my turkey power nico oh wait craphis hat fall off revealing he is bald and his beard in ravels nicob jugde well your going down judgekanematsu bring it on btch turkey powers active nicob bullsht plot guessing powers active and thats how everyone died that day nico fighting judge in virtua fighter 21 just a reminder after this game you will have no more references to yakuza 0 until 6 we always have to have the crane game oh boyjust wait until later also i nominate the game crashing as the next baka mitai opening next episode here is a short guide on some combos you can do with the combat in yakuza kiwami 2 involving the charge moves if you havent seen it already httpsmobiletwittercomkhayyaambuttstatus1037023288374034433video1 and now for nico to play a game within a game vs older sounding majima oh no we need more bandages kiryu i think shes bleeding out kiryu ill bring those banages right awaybut first virtua fighter daddy kiryu always has his priorities straight this reminds me of the rage that dark souls 2 gave nico welcome back to this lets play of virtua fighter 21 yakuza whats that lol datesan has a fan a cute fan too the mystery drink has random effects so you wont get the same one every time when youre carrying sayama you can actually see the talkative locals you need to avoid on the minimap theyre the purple blips they wont tell you their moves in virtua fighter because its the arcade version theres no pausing and accessing the command list ive rarely played virtua fighter but pai is my favourite she also appeared in doa 5 i believe that ending thats a twist ending if ive ever seen one in this episode nico spends almost 1 full hour in soiled pants p also i enjoyed this lp within the lp oh and next time you go to the arcade check the bathroom for reasons its pronounced leon i see the people who made virtua fighter are people of taste making their women buff okay i have to say this the intros are reminding me a lot of the nickelback look at this photograph memes some people might tell you to stop because of that that but i say no keep going your intros have often been the best part of your videos and is probably one of the major reasons whyat least for me youre one of the best lpers out there also the evolution of your intros been amazing from you just saying something witty or funny at the end or them having their own endings at the finales to now with your two latest lets plays having video and music incorporated into them even though im sure the former would be less to edit and some people might not care about the extra work that goes into it but i just wanted to let you know at least this penguin appreciates it im pretty sure this is a little to ask kissy to be a comment of the day but this is something that ive been thinking about for at least a little while ill just say it again thank you finally the virtua fighter lp we all wanted rip nugget you were certainly a chicken of justice puts hand on my heart and takes off my glasses fun fact majimas bun gives 560 points in every exp stats the reason why its 560 is because goro his firstname can be written as the number 5 go and 6 roku ro kiryu tamiyo can i get money for bandages tamiyo for bandages here take some kiryu thanks tamiyo use it to play virtual fighter 21 like a boss kaoru her wound reopened im dying where is kiryu 000 seem like nicob dream have come true there nico now you can stop your bitching about about playing not play virtual fighter last game umm nicob you only had last around where you fight the drunk guy the quest for the requirement to complete was based on time in the game congrats on beating it but it was needed for the quest by the end of this lp nico will a virtual fighter god and he wont make allowances for old man bleerrrghhh why does everyone go down after taking a bullet it only takes like a fifth of your health bar 2218 nico there is no virtua fighter 6 the last mainline virtua fighter was virtua fighter 5 final showdown normally if have to play even like 5 minutes again i just stop to much effort who knew the beginning of kiwami 2 was just an elaborate ruse leading into the true new lp virtua fighter 21 yikes that ending was a result of terrible luck guess that bullshit luck has to end sometime i guess id like to imagine a week later where both sotenbori and kamurocho are in flames from the yakuza war and kiryu is just casually playing virtua fighter in the arcade majima damnit kiryu we need your help kiryu i cant man this game is just to good that ending tho nico is one of the few men i think can get away with calling an entire culture cute komian has now stocked wagyu i see as the name would suggest wagyu beef is a japanese specialty the farmers will massage the cow every single day to ensure that its muscles are nice and relaxed removing all tension this allows for the meat to be extra tender when the animal is butchered as a result wagyu beef has become one of the most valuable and reputable cuts of meat youll ever fine seriously i went to a japanese super market the other day and one reasonably sized pack of the stuff costs like 115 bucks canadian as one of the top meats in the world top chefs the world over favour it so you can find it used in recipes far off from the land it originates from its just that good really i say all this but ive never actually had the honor of being able to try wagyu because im a broke jobless young adult but i really do want to try some of it some sometime down the line definitely on my bucket list of things to do when im more well off old school arcade game majima gee i spent a lot of my money stalking and fighting kiryuchan wonder how i can make some money back snaps fingers i know just the thing kiryu walks by a vendor maji buns maji buns come get your maji buns get them while theyre hot and selling now are our limited edition 24 hour cinderella buns complete with a goro majimas greatest hits cd kiryu just walk away kiryu just walk away nicos long quest to play virtua fighter is finally satisfied now he has to find the person who gave him the quest and turn it in nugget we will always remember you cries in the corner you need to play yakuza dead souls someday shit get real yusuke let us beat that rubbish mentality into submission lion i dont make it a habit to fight the elderly yusuke who are you remember animal crossing remember how games would almost never crash so the game would be able to blame you when you didnt save resetti is no where near as annoying as an actual game crash when you thought you have seen all the greatness the world has to offer and then nico vhanges the picture in his intro quack man so far these comment of the day sections are great hope they stick around for a while man that mess at the casino was great the potential applications of the dragon engine are endless xd man that ending that just earned a disheartening oof i know that boss black is featured in one of the earth defense force 41 videos kawara the other detective talking to date in the beginning is actually modeled after his real life va fun fact yakuza kiwami 2 has a lot of the same cinematography to the original game scenes that yakuza kiwami had but some of the characters got new voice actors and they even motion captured some of them to look like their vas now rather than how they looked in the original ps2 game this does lead to some narrative dissonance though like how one character from the omi alliance is supposed to be in his forties but his voice actor is in his mid60s and they didnt bother to make him look younger when they motion captured him for this game its like how saul goodman in better call saul looks older than he does in breaking bad when its supposed to be a prequel its been a while since nicos done a one off game i hope we have a post game sidequests with sayama like we did with haruka but instead of holding her hand we give her a piggyback ride kiryu i gotta get this woman to the hospital but first come on you stupid can fall nagito please sir allow me all the cans fall out of the machine kiryu nnani how the hell did she pass out from getting shot in the arm i cant imagine a shot in the arm would hurt that much and shes a cop youd think shed be tough enough to take a few shots in the arm you know your channel help got me though some really hard times in my life me and everybody here love you and thanks you for entertaining us for all these wonderful years the next picture for bakamitai should be the corruption error after kaoru gets shot kiryu wait a minute i recognize that sniper majima long time no see kiryu chan kiryu what the hell majima why did you try to kill a police officer majima shes a cop whoopsie sorry about that kiryu chan i though you were cheating on goromi kiryu dammit majima majimalater kiryu chan i gotta go finish a substory down the street oh and you might wanna get your cop friend to a doctor i think shes about bleed out in 15 minutes kiryu it never ends hey nico please remember to give ryuzaki the komgets to end of the episode ooh oh dear hearts out to the lost save data oh this going be epic and nicob good luck man my favorite virtua fighter character is got to be jacky and and my favorite line that he says is its like youre moving in slow motion when lion wins a match a voice clip should play in that classic arcade game voice acting i peacocked your mom and then jacky jumps in and goes yeaaaaaaaaaaaah nugget shall forever be remembered in our hearts currently eating nuggets while watching this and in our stomachs nothing will ever top the intro to this series he did it he did the nugget nico you should a have poll to let your viewers choose who should be in the next picture of your bakamitai intro i hope future yakuza games allow you to play fullfledged sonic games im happy to see date again i really like him was not expecting nugget just when things are heating up and nico finally had his fix sony decided that nico would be punished for dissing them in the first episode they were trying to blow up the kazama family office which is in millennium tower im pretty sure anyways by the end of this series nico is gonna be so weeaboo that hell be speaking japanese amid his english every other sentence i bet i hope i wish heres to hoping for even more different intros nugget shouldve been a karaoke companion and we all know it in a news caster voice we inturrupt this lets play of yakuza kiwami to bring you a lets play of virtua fighter 21 thanks for featuring my comment nico top 10 anime battles 10 the entirety of yakuza 9 the entirety of yakuza 2 8 the entirety of yakuza 3 7 the entirety of yakuza 4 6 the entirety of yakuza 5 5 the entirety of yakuza 6 4 the entirety of yakuza 0 3 the entirety of yakuza kiwami 2 the entirety of yakuza kiwami 2 1 any fight against majima you played too much virtua fighter the game felt offended and decided to fuck you over seriously though im in full support of a live stream where you just play virtua fighter 4 we are introduced to a lot of new characters from the start in this game guess to make up for nearly everyone getting killed in the previous game also they need to make a new virtua fighter game something interesting i noticed last episode was that both kiryu and ryuji have the character ryu in their names which translates to dragon in japanese it really shows the amount of work people have put into just naming the characters its really interesting spittake oh my god i cant believe he changed the pic in the intro now if he does that every episode this will be the greatest lets play ever is it sad that i thought nico started a capcom legacy collection lp i called it he took westaboo for granted even though its a term that a japanese would never use oh nico that title confused the fuck out of me for a second nugget lives on in all our hearts and the business that kiryu left and he took over his making a profit off that too in fact i actually heard he made a partnership with multiple chicken restaurants he likes eating there a lot and oh shit his become too intelligent now and is a cannibal oh god no were all doomed ruuunnnn nugget turns into a giant demon lord and kills everything the end 11253 sad titanic flute this will teach you to save your game more frequently please let the bakamitai thing become a couch gag where every time the picture is something different but equally or perhaps progressively stupider as each episode is uploaded time for the first ever question in the series play as kiryu play as daigo or play as majima okay kiryu i need you to lose the fight lose bbut why forget ryuji or you the dragon of old man sounds catchier for the money kiryufor the money oh my god i just laughed so hard because of the bakamitai picture with nugget and my soda came up my nose nugget the best manager makes her glorious return xd its been 3 episodes of it and i still havent gotten over that intro but forget about this game virtual fighter lp when 2704 rumble dr karate you killed my father again dr karate rharrrrr rumble you take that back fight edit please tell me im not the only one who read this in the voices from the episode oh my god he actually listened to us now im hungry for chicken wings at this point nicob is a drug im addicted to his videos i regret nothing nugget you had me at cluck is the picture in the intro going to change every episode oh god y e s sees title the dream has become reality sheds manly tears damn it i forgot about nugget like if you cry every time okay i was not expecting that intro change at all holy fuck i nearly choked on my sandwich sees the opening oh goddammit nugget xddd holy shit ive never been this early also yay he did the nugget edit 33 majimaor nugget fuck i dont know which is my favourite now its justice for all maya all over again it was right there nico right there waiting for you shenran you wish has been granted hell yeah im super hype for this series two siberian tigers with his bare hands while hes wounded if kiryu isnt the ultimate badass i dont know who is remember the events of last year yes no hahaha if only our memories worked like this youngun kiryu is so cute koreaboos would love this game cuz thwre is korean in this this guy doesnt know how to evade just straight button smashing hit hit hit no evasion darn it whats with all the slapping in this game 20 25 fps to my eyes i need it now how were you able to play why dont you show the settings that you are playing with this video is useless if you dont show that not bad what settings were you playing on and what are your specs definitely the best place for yakuza walkthroughs i love the yakuza series i had a ps2 when yakuza 1 and 2 came out but never bought them i have a ps4 now got yakuza kiwami and i loved it havent had a chance to play 0 yet but will play it soon i cant wait to buy kiwami 2 and yakuza 6 i have this game preorderd and ive been debating on if i should watch this or not for the past hour lol came as fast as i could daddys homeand hes never looked this shiny i bought the game but it didnt run properly on my pc so here i am why are they making dojima out to be this great and respectable leader in this game in 0 they made it clear making him the tojo leader would be a foolish decision and only got as far asnhe did because of kazama helping him in 1 he was a shell of his former self after we crippled his influence who only gloats about the glory days and dude was a rapist who kazama said he he drags girls away all the time and tried to rape yumi which is why nishiki killed him the wife and everyone else is trying to say otherwise also while dojima was powerful in the 80s he was just that he was never the tojo clan chairman and has been on the decline since the 80s dude was a defanged puppet the last ten years of his life so why does his wife or son have so much prestige man you really need to learn to shut up during cutscene i love your yakuza playthroughs will you be continuing the series once the remaster collection with the last 3 games in it comes out ironically kiryu is also maybe the most highly respected of the chairmen you know cause he was only chairman for all of an hour im kinda hoping you go through this entire series in order all the way to six itd be great seeing you go through this entire series and grow connected to the characters as i did nicob please dont kill me everyone please dont kill me im sorry i havent watched nicob nicob makes kiwami bob sound like krillin from dbz abridged i like that just the beginning and im already likin this man look at those puddles i just love your reaction to being able to enter shops without loading screens 10650 powering up in the middle of a fight like a saiyan yayoi i couldnt help this bad joke ill leave now 5832 aniki means older brother and in the yakuza their boss is often referred to as aniki it shows their respect and familiarity among yakuza 450 the detectives hairstyle is different compared to the ps2 version 5513 of course theres maimai and chunithm arcade rhythm games in the posters cause sega o 344 in yakuza kiwami 2 game shows a message that this game is fiction at the beginning nicobthis is a work of fiction if you do not realize it then your a dumb idiot in danganronpa v3 game shows a message that this game is fiction at the beginning nico do not realize until the last chapter the it is fiction d 344 this is a work of fiction it is danganronpa v3 all over again near 5256 nico admits he knows the batman arkham games please do a walkthrough of the batman arkham games in future we would love to see you give thugs concussions and scare the shit outta them as the legendary dark knight we are vengeance we are the night we are picky penguins honestly compaird to this yakuza 6 dont look that great ah the best yakuza game story wise before yakuza 0 and still might be the best in that regard best antagonist easily fun times await ok im back i have some time before doing my college homework virtual fighter 5 haves 3 versions base game the f i think thats the name but its the arcade only one and final showdown or fs fs didnt release in 2006 and thats the one thats promoted and probably in the arcade havent discovered photo mode yet oh yes do i look this shiny i almost nuts when i saw kamurocho at night with the dragon engine 3048 dude in the back is grinning his ass off you started kiwami 2 without me d anyway glad i caught you near the beginning get ready for another wild ride also are you planning on playing the rest of the series once youve played one youre attached to them all im glad youre so attached to haruka like the rest of us kiiiiinda want to see you see her in 5 haha 4559 that drift tho a beautiful year for cellphones indeed komaeda and its not just a beautiful year for cellphones its a beautiful hopeful year for bagelshaped cellphones oh boy here we go again monokuma daigo is no long the man he used to be because of me and my despair bolololololo kiryu in that case ill kick your ass you stupid bear monokuma bolololololoooooooh shit 3639 im gonna get a drink walks over and bumps into it after looking at the one next to it kiwami bob for council of voices 2018 daddy kiryu is the god of badass dads the better of the dragon engine games take a look into judge eyes its a spinoff game also set in kamurocho in that game you play as a private detective trying to solve murder cases you can play the demo on the japanese psn remember people play in release order so much yay last words with bernie new yakuza lp im so pumped from watching this everything ive enjoyed from the yakuza series seems to be making a return and i love the way theyve done some new stuff like the hunger system too i even enjoyed watching nico dork out about being able to enter the convenience store without a loading screen xd i lost my shit at 3806 i have no idea whats going on but its nicos vid omg i was freaking dying in the middle of class watching this aniki is a term yakuza sometimes call their superiors they respect in practice its like bro but for yakuza it is a respectful connotation you should check if club debolah is around your fat bastard voice is entering its final form nico this was posted way too early you just recently finished playing kiwami a month ago im still burned out on watching that lp kinda was wanting to see something different but hey thats just me 5648 the guy just rolled out of existence im going to not think too hard about what bernie was doing in that end segment still super cute tho i hope daddy majima makes an appearance 3908 wait you were in front of serena and you didnt even notice kiryu to terada take haruka and get out of here terada stays and gets shot kiryu goddammit terada im wondering nico if the game has a cap at 30fps wouldnt be better to lower the videos framerate at 30fps too and save up file size or do you prefer to keep uploading videos at 60fps because of the current videos quality and not mix them its also a good idea to get the substory finder as soon as possible i see that dark cloud 2 hinting at a special new letsplay please upload yakuza daily i really want to see nico play dragonball fighterz now i almost did a pterodacyl screech and woke up the entire dorm when i saw this on my home page keep it up nico nicob 4655 less an hour in the game already beating thugs feels likehome ps just finished the episode and a horrific thought arrived oh no its yakuza which means 12 principal characters gonna die daigo youre death flag just raised daddy kiryu is back and he is doing what he does best curb stomping people while installing valuable life lessons saw a comparison video for the graphics and gotta be honest that green tint kiwami 2 has is just naaaaasty nico freaking out over being able to enter a shop without a loading screen is the best thing ive experienced all day i have seen the face of god and he is a daddy thank you nico i thought i would have to wait a long time to watch this but thankkkk youuu laawwwwdddd finally ive been waiting for you to play this since its release on august seeing as this is not a spoiler nico should be allowed to know do not get used to this style moving forward the games revert back for 34 and 5 6 is the only one that is set in the dragon engine besides this one i love how every time it says show them your strength nico says it in a sephiroth voice you probably read by now that aniki is a respected form of brother but theres a fun factbrother can be said in a lot of ways i learned this from the anime sister princess where this one guy learns that he has like 12 or 16 i think its 12 and someone else tricked him into think he was related to them as well but anyways everyone had a different way of addressing him as brother because they all loved him it was based on a visual novel game it wasnt made a to make a lot of sense of how one dude didnt know he had 12 sisters from all over the worldsurprisingly it was very sweet and all the sisters got along but yeah theres the classing oniichan and theres aniki and onitan onichamatheres too many to remember so it can really depend on how a person feels about their brother and their mannerism of speaking the early 2000s were a wild time that premise would not fly now yknow when i saw the serena bar at kamurocho i was a bit sad because reina died but then i realized who the fuck is running serena now k amurochos i ndomitable r aging y akoozie u ltrabadass daddy yesssss i am so happy that you can still play the games you want to and be the way we love you d so excited for this play through ahhh get the dropkick yes im serious get it like right now get it yeeeeesss here you are im so fucxing happy right now 3 aniki can mean elder brother or senior aniki is a term of respect basically it means brother im honestly surprised it didnt come up in the past two games omg daddy kiryu ah yessssssssssss aniki means brother it can be used as both literal and kinda like a respected gangster termat least from what i remember i looked at the thumbnail and im like yes yes yeeeeeesssssss thankyou nicoooooo kiryus eyes looks different somehowseems more emotional oh my god nico is playing kiwami 2 i saw this in my feed and gave an instant like and oh my god im so excited been waiting for this and this is why kiryu ran away from being the chairmen they seem to die like flies this was a thing in yakuza 0 too aniki is a way to refer to a senior just to make sure the game doesnt get childishly easy for you even on hard boss fights end with just two or three heat actions try to not upgrade anything damage related unless you have to in order to unlock a move you want the amount of shock that you get from interacting with vending machines and actually walking into a store is fucking beautiful yeah japan thinks english is cool apparently and it puts english in a lot of things its really weird nicob if the game is now running in 30 fps there is no longer a reason to recordeditupload in 60 fps btw you uploaded in 60 fps its abit early but will yakuza 3 have a remake too or will we continue with the og yakuza 3 nico is going back to dad kiryu good cause theres some side missions i bet youll like im not going to spoil the would be rude that was quick lmao idiot burrito you need to see this heat move bringo mob into poppo and let the shopkeeper heat them up what a good time to upload this now i dont have to be board in the icu healing from my surgery thanks nico nico you can only go up to 200 with each stat but once their all up to 200 you can go up to 300 but i suggest you leave your attack power at 200 or youll be pretty overpowered the square charge attack is incredibly useful for breaking enemies guard and stunning them if your in a street fight you can drag enemies into convience stores and do a heat action in there also if your in a street fight if you see a woman walking by you can use a heat action is this using yakuza 6s engine oh yeah grabbing enemies and throwing them is very broken in this game especially in crowds wait nico lives on the east coast okay this lp is all fine and good but nico thats a category 5 hurricane heading your way get out of there good bye magazines hello vending machines ready for another amazing yakuza adventure by nicob i always knew adachi would have been a town thug in 2006 goddammit adachi aniki is another way of saying big brother i dont feel like this is a spoiler to say this but if it is your mods can take down my comment a lot of these changes to the gameplay happened in yakuza 6 the first game to use the dragon engine also kiryus dragon style was changed around in this engine cause they wanted to emphasize the rag doll physics speaking of the dragon style the concept of multiple fighting styles was introduced in the main series in yakuza 0 and isnt in other games before that or after kiwami just to let you know also if you havent heard the upcoming fist of the north star lost paradise was developed by yakuza team same with the newly announced judge eyesproject judge working title which is a spinoff taking place in kamurocho thats all i have to say for now enjoy the game nico i love how the day i beat this game is the day nico begins his lp i know things nico things you wont want to hear because of spoilers things you may not believe please play steins gate 0 after this nico so when you were buying stuff in the vending machine i noticed boss coffee was there that is an actual coffee you can buy in japan which makes me curious how much product placement is in this game and now back to not killing yeah this was the lp i was expecting and i have no problem with that the game itself is very new and that will attract more traffic otherwise i wouldve expected this game to be later thisll be a fun ride as always these games work well with nicos sense of humor btw is this game closer to kiwami or 0 in content nico the club sega sign says chunithum not chunito its actually rhythm arcade game thats sort of like playing the piano the poster actually showed an ongoing promotion last year irl 4735 japanese tumbleweed omg kiryu is back yasssssss ps they talk in korean wow im getting this game cuz of that 5649 ragdoll the flashbang is an amazing melee weapon just saying okay im fine with you playing this but after this play bravely default the subtitles in brackets at the beginning cutscenes were in korean aniki emphasis on the ahniki is like the big bro in charge among a band of guys usually but not necessarily hoodlumsthugs similarly aneki is like the big sis in charge i havent played the game myself yet but i just had to see this first episode from you i probably wont watch anymore till im done with it myself though so good luck with the playthrough nico holy shit i wasnt expecting this so soon i just platinumed this last week but i also had played the original 2 about a year ago so i got some experience to share throughout this journey if the other commenters dont beat me too it its a little premature to ask this i suppose but i was wondering how you plan on tackling the yakuza games after this 3 4 and 5 are getting a remaster on the ps4 and its confirmed were getting them at some point heck the remasters are practically designed for us to begin with but those three are also already available as is and beyond 3 potentially readding the cut content from the localization the only other differences is higher screen resolution and better framerate so if you want to wait out for 3s remaster before playing it just because of the cut content go for it id say but for the other two it depends on how much you care about the graphical differences lol for some odd reason i thought you were going to play the new spiderman game and then i saw this and and got even more happy keep up your good work its nice to see that they kept that fire in that barrel burning in the park aw yeah gimme more of that yakuza it is time i woke up super sleepy then i saw this and im instantly woke you made my day sir and congrats on the patreon you deserve every penny i did not expect you to play this so soon but iam excited bring on the daddy fuck i wanted more i need my daily dose of daddy imagine kiryu in minecraft he would be right at home punching trees he wouldnt even need to make an ax can we get bernie interacting with all the famous nico characters possibly or is that to werid to people i believe aniki is a bit of a generalized nickname its an affectionate term that can mean big bro but not in a familial sense we need an update like this to life you just tiger dropped your fanbase in the best possible way i actually yelled when i saw this notification yes all three of my favorite people have returned yes nico been waiting for you to play this your yakuza lets plays are my favorite btw what are the chances of kiryu majima andor other yakuza characters joining the council of voices if you need a character model kiryu and majima got some in project xzone 2 you could base them of that i guess i thought that you would wait one more lp until you start kiwami 2 but hey im certainly not complaining the battle system and stats system are the yakuza 6 system so yakuza 0s story centers around the empty lot yakuza 1kiwami centers around the millennium tower built on the empty lot i wonder what this story is gonna be about havent finished watching nicos yakuza kiwami one so im skipping through to the end to see bernie 3 3 clearly the main reason i subscribed to this channel im a little burnt out on yakuza tbh but ill still watch hell yeah now were probably gonna see some weirdass substories dojima was a piece of shit but damn his wife is badass daigos also looking pretty cool on another note nicos sheer excitement at being able to walk into stores is so pure so uh we just gonna ignore that ps2 theme its so fucking cool dang yayoi that was kinda hot when she pulled out the sword lol 5905 aniki is a more formal version of big brother shinji called kiryu aniki in the first game if you remember cant talk about yakuza 36 because i didnt own a ps3 or ps4 so i couldnt enjoy them but the original yakuza 2 is easily in my top 5 best of the best games i had the glad of playing in my ps2 back in the day alongside classics like shadow of the colossus metal gear solid 3 gta san andreas and silent hill 2 so yeah the hype is justified the money from nicos patreon is going to the yakuza i just know it nico if you dont know aniki is another word for brother you say the names so weird nico is it meor kiryus eyes are gigantic nicob play forevers end nico the makers of this game are making a new game yes i just finished playing this game myself a couple of days ago and when i noticed you finished your mother 3 playthrough i was really hoping that your next game would be kiwami 2 oof now im behind nico on yakuza kiwami 2 as well shouldve worked harder in staying ahead while i had the time one last thing that guy murdered spoke korean yeeeeeeeees another yakuza game so soon after the other one i was so happy when this came up in my recommended i loved yakuza kiwami 2 but the thing i really hated was that they just used the yakuza 6 kiryu model so he look older then 45 you just got daddyd kid may be my current favorite nicob quote i could see that on a shirt nico glad to see you playing this game it will definitely be a good one that being said i will mention something that may be considered a particular flaw and that this simply on just how powerful you can get in this game what i mean is that the normal character progression any player would go through as they play the game on dealing damage to enemiesincreasing your attack stat acquiring certain battle skills etc will make kiryu simply take down enemies like a hot knife through butter your attacks especially your heat actions will eventually be so overpowered that it makes quick work of anyone in this game including bosses think of how even in your previous two lets plays of this series even when you were making progress on strengthening up kiryu you still had some challenges in fights this game will not really challenge you much even on harder difficulties with regards to main story stuff especially compared to kiwami 1theres a few boss fights that are exceptions i orgasmed a little when i saw this video in my home page honestly its so fun watching nico freaking out about little changes in the game idk why it just makes me giggly best features of this game so far hand holding jacket flutter when fighting and vending machines yakuza 2s story is soo good and the new songs that play with cutscenes im so happy rn i cant wait for daddy kiryu to curb stop bad guys and be the best daddy in the yakuza world 10038 nico just tripped adachi ooooooooh inner fan gurl screaming me yay d around 5900 aniki is another term for big brother or big bro within a blood family it can be used for a younger sibling to address their big brother in an informal manner yet also shows how close they are within yakuza it can be a way for a subordinate to address their boss using the informality that fits with their gangster mafialike air there are a number of other honorifics that subordinates can address to their higher ups in yakuza depending on their position also the informalclose way for one to address an older sister is aneki and there are also all female gangs where aneki is addressed to the leader of the group a sukeban i dont know if anyones said it or if nico cares but the reason the emt offered to write the cause of death as blood loss instead of being shot was to delay any homicide investigation that would probably occur as a result of someone as high profile as their chairman of a yakuza clan being shot in a cemetery 10030 adachi what are you doing here you know this lets play is going to be good when the best part of this episode is nico freaking out about there being no loading screen when he entered the store the mother of the baby in the intro is speaking korean right im either mixing my languages or there are korean characters in this game dude i can see you have yakuza 6 there and it literally says the legend ends ffs oh my daddy kiryus home man i really wish i had clever things to put in the comments nico im so excited that youre playing this i watched your whole yakuza kawaii gameplay and loved it aniki is roughly translated to bro but the meaning is a little different basically gangs call people aniki if theyre someone they respect or on a higher level than them in a way its a more informal way of referring to your boss i want to repeat what one said but nico make sure when you see a chandelier have one bar heat for it you will be upstairs for a special one time heat action dont miss it 2507 anyone up to lead the yakuza who can last through the games sequel 1942 and yeakuza dead souls please do dead souls after you eventually do yakuza 4 please my steins gate 0 dream has died once again why nico why is it just me or does anyone else think kiryus eyes look sadder in this engine the shinespot is a lot smaller the irises darker it gives him a thousandyard stare of a man who has seen it all what some korean to start with interesting edit yup it looks like we might be dealing with korean stuffs the bracketed speech at the beginning was in korean haruka uncle kaz is something wrong kiryu puts a suitcase on the bed no haruka daddys just going out to take care of some business youre in charge for the next few weeks haruka alright ill keep majima hey hey dont leave me behind kiryuchaahtata haruka while twisting majimas arm from behind him not today majima now get out of here majima heh youve gotten better harukasan your grip still needs a bit of wooork kiryu good haruka just like i taught you now then think you can pull it off haruka one way to find out trips majima before slamming a foot on his back like that kiryu not yet honey opens window now haruka punts majima out the window majima see you in the sequel kiryu cha thump aniki means elder brother and is used for one of senior rank in yakuza context its a term of respect 2126 now kiryu punching people in the face isnt a diplomatic way of leading the tojo clan this method may work for you but there are other ways of resolving these issues that come up 2448 soooo are we still saying that kiryu never killed anyone yes yes take all of my yessss also that moment when you spend an entire episode walking in and out of the convenience store looking for the loading screen xdd explore as much as you can this game is unbelievably more open and explorable than 0 and kiwami 1 some buildings you can even go in the interiors and different floors and most of the objects you see there are destructible by running into them nico i knew this would happen butgod i still havent picked up kiwami 2 yet so now im gonna have to resist watching until i play god selfcontrol its painful at least there will be a back log for me to catch up on once i have so theres an upside bernie bizzle the dino sizzle has returned nicos reacting to this the same way i reacted to yakuza 6 when i first played it yes yes yes the time has come so have i the dragon of dojima still alive yes finally daddy is back love the yakuza games specially nicos lets play of them they always makes me laugh 5858 aniki is another way of calling someone your brother but in the context of you are just like super best friends with him and not related its used in japan to refer to someone as your brother even if you are not related by blood at all its more often than not used by people who admire someone and idolize them but in the context of yakuza aniki is a term used for a yakuza of older or senior rank within the family and is said as a title of respect from a lower ranking family member to a higher the dallas cowboy stat is my favorite what the hell nico got a higher star rating on his trophies than me nico circle circle will be your best friend period wow i timed my watching of your yakuza lps perfectly i literally got caught up a day and a half ago its interestingalthough i would say the lighting is better and the fact you can walk into buildings is nicethe overall animation and character detail seems to be much lower then the previous two games today on nicobs playthrough of yakuza kiwami 2 nico gets excited about being able to actually get inside the stores instead of seeing a loading screen and in this episode nico loses his goddamn mind over being able to walk into stores with no loading screens screw the plot screw daddy kiryu its all about the no loading screen convenience stores i will tell you this nico you can break windows from convience stores would you mind playing the two player mini game with icepick i believe thats his name 20 bucks says kiryu ends up daddying for daigo im calling that shit now episode 1 nico fanboying over self opening doors with no loading screens thats rad this is going to be awesome as fuck yesss give me all the yakuza so much hype glad you enjoyed the beginning of this game it only gets better from here on out also if i had one regret about this its that it wasnt named yakuza 2 kiwami instead of yakuza kiwami 2 so that i could make jokes like yakuza 2 extreme 4 you 5512 its actually chunithm a rhythm game who would win a fight between bernie and benny ooooh shiny daddy by the way i watched kill bill vol 2 yesterday and yayoi threatening to kill reminded me of that boss lady in that moviethink her name was o ren or something like remember that scene where she runs on the table and decapitated someones head cause they didnt like the fact she was a japanesechinese american yeah kinda like that awwww yasssss i just finished that game a week ago and i absolutely loved the story i cant for you to see how youll react to it nico guys nico just got enough to hire an editor for council of voices this is cause for celebration nice daddy kiryu is back hello fellow picky penguins id like to let you all know about the secret santa event thats starting right now over on nicos fan deviantart group page if you want to join in follow the link httpswwwdeviantartcomnicofansunitejournalpickypenguinsecretsanta2018763250658 i feel like it should be pointed out that a certain mad dog did not die in the last game and is popular enough to be made playable in the series i never get tired of that segaaa at the beginning alright yakuza 2 kiwami im so glad your playing this game perfect considering if you that the other game your playing also have a badass daddy im sensing a thee between daddies alll of them are badasses roland was a president that kickass kiryu is an exyakuza member that can kickass majima is a head of his own clan that can kickass dhurke was a rebel lawyer that can kickass and dhunban was is a soldier that can kickass they all also had something to protect and suffer some form of tragedy also release the mad dog from his prison woo its yakuza kiwami 2 and were already off to a bang up start funny thing about those vending machines all the drinks inside are parodies of real life drinks that show up in vending machines all over japan like the poseidon power is a knock off of pocari sweat an electrolyte booster its sort of like a fizzy gatorade but its grapefruit flavored and absolutely delicious the vending machines have all sorts of teas water variations and canned coffees but not usually soda and you cant go down two streets without running into a machine its really convenient yes i can finally watch this channel again the awesome thing about the dragon engine is that the developers remade all the 3d models of kamurocho from scratch they made sure that the even the size of a single can is well proportioned so its no wonder that kiwami 2 and 6 looks so good yay bernies back too im so happy yakuza kiwami 2 is your new lp i was really looking forward to this so far it looks really good i enjoyed yakuza zero and yakuza kiwami finally i didnt think well see kiryu this early you go nico the combat in this game feels really fluent also note that even if enemies block your attacks you will still continue with your combo with the next attack ps its best if you focus on increasing stats before you learn new moves since increasing stats will cost relatively less exp the korean voicing were pretty good start the game off with kazama shooting some kids dad what a nice start i was not expecting this to show up this early im fucking hyped japan is stocked whit vendine machine for everything even for clothings and so aniki is an honorable way to address your superior in gangs and such ani brother in a really rigid formal sense whereas oniisan and the like are more endearing aneoneesan for sister it can also be used as a sort of slang like bro or ane for sis its time to curbstomp some bitches and kiryu can now kill someone wow a lot of the stuff in those vending machines are just real drink brands you can actually buy in japan oh and im sure someone else already mentioned this by now but aniki is another way of calling someone big brother its a common way for yakuza and thug types to refer to a higher ranking guy i visited japan earlier this year and yup theres a decent amount of english on products ads signs and the like definitely not on everything though and even with things translated the transit system was still more than a little difficult to navigate holy moly i was not expecting to hear korean right off the bat the mix of korean and japanese my head is definitely going to be spinning anyway hooray more stuff from you to watch ive never played any of the yakuza games so i enjoy the fact that i can watch this and play vicariously through you thank you for always showing me such amazing content one of my favorite things when i started this game was the pure physics running intoeverything let the daddies just keep on coming aniki means big brother literally but its also used between yakuzas and other types of groups to refer to the boss or a higher rank im so excited kiwami 2 is starting so soon its tied for yakuza 0 for my favourite story no grave for shinji apparently hey nico anika means brother i believe but like from a younger sibling to an older wait it was chinese in both zero and kiwami now they added in korean and it doesnt sound bad at all cool i didnt thought we were getting this early more daddy kiryu adventures aniki is an honorable term meaning older brother or superior its pronounced as ahnakey also im surprised your playing this so soon after the previous one should be plenty enjoyable though im so pumped damn i thought its early for nico to play this but fuck yeah 5412 is that the big cone majima was hiding in glad to have you back on the yakuza train nico this time around kiwami 2 runs on the game engine created for yakuza 6 the almighty dragon engine with the power of the dragon engine you can do things in a yakuza game like never before such as walking into shops without a loading screen or climbing over small fences well not all the small fences just like a handful of them in all seriousness its a little janky but it looks pretty and its the fun kind of jank with enemies ragdolling everywhere just the moment you get into a shop hold sprint down and keep walking into the shop displays just trust me its gonna be hilarious what happens next good ol yakuza 2 one of my favorites in the series a lot of other people have more or less said most of the tips i was going to mention so ill say a few misc things instead this is more about yakuza 6 but kiwami 2 is vastly improved over 6s base gameplay seriously its weird playing 6 a few months back and seeing how much of a beta title it was for kiwami 2 in the long run 6 cut a lot of longtime features and even cut 13rd of kamurocho and kiwami 2 readded a lot of missing content and features granted 6 came out in 2016 in japan but still you mentioned how kiryu looked a little pixely this was the case with yakuza 6 and i believe it is the same here but so far dragon engine games have ran at 900p30 fps same base resolution as breath of the wild when it wasnt under heavy load on base ps4 and ps4 pro is 1080p30 fps i have been playing on ps4 pro and it does help a lot and has been a steady 30 fps with no drops or stutters i heard the base ps4s also good ol yakuza 2 one of my favorites in the series a lot of other people have more or less said most of the tips i was going to mention so ill say a few misc things instead this is more about yakuza 6 but kiwami 2 is vastly improved over 6s base gameplay seriously its weird playing 6 a few months back and seeing how much of a beta title it was for kiwami 2 in the long run granted 6 came out in 2016 in japan but still you mentioned how kiryu looked a little pixely this was the case with yakuza 6 and i believe it is the same here but so far dragon engine games have ran at 900p30 fps same base resolution as breath of the wild when it wasnt under heavy load on base ps4 and ps4 pro is 1080p30 fps i have been playing on ps4 pro and it does help a lot i heard the base ps4s also had issues keeping a stable 30 fps at times on the plus side the ps4 version of y3 and probably y4 and y5 will run at 1080p60 fps just like 0 much like kiwami some of the cont from what i know its considered cool and sophisticated to have english on a product in japan yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i just got my friend to start watching the yakuza series were currently on kiwami and now i see this w my day has been made i love just how mindblown he was from just walking into the store without a load screen omg bean paste bun this so reminds me of spirit of justice with the 4th case lol still a no on steinsgate 0 hey at least its kiryus bizarre adventure where everyone cant get enough of their favorite daddy the ultimate mad dog mccree wait was it mad dog linus fuck whats his name again ahhh yes i had a shit day at work today i need this also nicoarent going to overloaded from side quests from both games iam so happy that youre back on feet after a day of youtubes mind boggling practices with their ad payment im looking forward to this love your lets play of kiwami and cant wait to what youre gonna use for the now back to segment on this one but i dont think anything can top you screaming over 24 hour cinderella have fun nico nico since you havent noticed it yet next time you get into the open world walk into stuff seriously i spent hours doing that shit it just feels so damn good just for interests sake yakuza 2 had an opening but it was strangely absent from kiwami 2 for who knows what reason i know ive seen a video on youtube by someone who recreated the opening using the remade k2 cutscenes for what its worth im pretty sure that the omi are supposed to represent this massive reallife yakuza clan operating out of kansai which is bigger than pretty much all the other clans so they are probably going to be a thing in this universe for at least as long as their reallife equivalent happens to exist i think theres also another giant yakuza clan that operates around kabukicho in real life but i dont know how similar they are to the fictional tojo clan daigo kind of has a point you have to admit kiwami 1 didnt really dwell on it that much but between them kiryu and nishiki basically killed off every single competent officer the tojo actually had so now theyve got kashiwagi and yayoi and not a lot else a far cry from their glory day thanks to nico i became a yakuza series fan dude this is gonna be the best i tell you that pd i predict more than 80 episodes you cant pause the game by going to the ps menu in this game i learned that the hard way by going to it in a fight and returning to the game over screen also and this is extremely important press the up button when walking around the map thats all im gonna say what im not prepared for this series yet im happily surprised 5556 can someone please make a meme out of this kick that would be hilarious just for reference nico this game runs silky smooth on my ps4 pro its still 30 fps though which i have no issues with especially with how buttery smooth it feels can we have a shove haruka counter xd so glad you decided to jump into kiwami 2 nico hope youll enjoy it itll be a journey im so glad youre playing this game i myself am on the final chapter and it is really good just a little tip that i found while playing this game youll notice that enemies tend to block which means they dont take damage and they break your combos this can be really annoying during a lot of the harder boss fights the best way i found to counter this is to charge up a light attack hold square and release it during an enemys attack this will stun them long enough to get a combo in without those pesky blocks if you attack while they arent attacking theyll block it hope this helps ps you can charge attacks while blocking just remember to let go of the block button before you attack hell yea im so hyped for this oh hell yeah i stop watching hajime no ippo for this i love bernie always warms my heart to see her damn it nico i was supposed to finish the game before you started i guess ill have to kick up my play through up a notch yes the daddy return i cant wait for nicos reaction to two parts some cultural notes those vending machines where you can see the drinks are like the best thing ever not only can you get cold drinks but you can also get hot coffee and tea and shit too fun fact i went to a ice skating rink in yokohama once and got chicken nuggets and fries from a vending machine there also it had hot dogs aniki is another way to refer to an older brother but in previous games you can actually hear some yakuza members refer to their superiors as aniki so i guess thats a thing why do all lets players suck at tutorials come on just read lol leave a funny comment for your chance to be featured make sure youre subscribed see you tomorrow best game in the series for me i hope they made it justice with the remake this early god damn what more can i say i found your channel through yakuza zero and when ever nico becomes daddy kiryu i am freaking out so lets go on another journey of curbstomping ps cant wait for majima majima majima majima majima kensetsu when you give your job to someone your trust but kiryu terada i have faith that you can bring the tojo clan back from this terada i wont let you down kiryusan one year later terada dead kiryu you had one job man by the way that poster you saw was of a game called chunithm air a rhythm game where you tap the arcade machine to hit notes and wave your arms around to hit air notes this is available only in japan holy shit this is to go even further beyond kiwami so freaking good im so glad im watching this absolutely blind dont think the day you play yakuza kiwami 2 will come so soon i am so going to have fun watching you play o seeing that yakuza 6 near the end of the video make me really hope to see you play it what a coincidence i just bought this today an aniki is something beetween boss and big brother remember shinji he was calling kiryu aniki aaaand now im sad if you google aniki you get results for a late porn star that goes by the same nickname im so ready for this aneeki nico you heard nishiki say that word a lot and that means brother the way the food in the game works reminds me a lot of ff15s cooking system and thats pretty dope sniff he didnt notice giant traffic cone aniki is basically brotherthough in this context think of it as more like broyou have heard this word before when the lower level yakuza refer to people higher up as well though i dont think its the same meaning keep in mind i dont know much japanese but i have watched gurren lagaan which bandies that word arounda lot the one downside to this game is the fact haruka unclezones daddy kiryu also worth noting is that this game is made in the dragon engine the same engine used for yakuza 6 so whenever you finally get to yakuza 6 itll play like this ah a brand new lets play away from alllllll the stab wounds coming from the monado into punching and kicking everything hate the new engine tbh yes nicos back daddy kiryus back and even bernies back im so happy im as happy as nico walking into a store in this game and realising that theres no loading does daigo still saying mada mada in this game nico the most effective way in getting xp this time around is eating thats why it is important to get the stomach upgrades as soon as possible if you want to get the most xp i think you need ps4 pro for 60fps its going to be such a huge downgrade to see nico go from yakuza kiwami 2s graphics down to yakuza 3s even with the remaster coming i dont think they can improve on it all that much you now what time is its mother fucking yakuza time also the return of majima yes aniki elder brother is a term used for a yakuza of older or senior rank within the family and is said as a title of respect from a lower ranking family member to a higher i believe kiryu used that term with nishiki as both a brother within the dojima clan and as a blood brother since they grew up together as orphans kyriu ah finally a christmas where im at peace and i can spend it as a bonus with haruka terada you are the chosen one kyriu nooooooooo majima is laughing in the distance watching nico go gaga over walking into stores without a loading screen tickles me aniki is a japanese term for older brother rip the majima everywhere system the days of nico screaming and running from majimas kirrryuchan will be missed ready for yakuza kiwami excited to see you get back into your videos d daddy kiryu is proud nico oh boy really glad you decided to play this ill be sure to play every episode something ill say now dont go overboard on increasing your attack and defence as the game for me didnt scale with how much exp i got at all making the end very lacklustrer yakuza the game series where fighting feels like actual fighting 1323 daddy no says that in phoenix voice and thus my majoras mask hopes has died once again but oh well yakuza is good too oh shit i knew it would happen but not so soon i really hope that the 3 4 5 remasters come stateside and rgg studios has already said that the spinoff judge eyes in coming to the west next year also this game runs off of yakuza 6s dragon engine combat is more of a mix of 0 and kiwamis styles without giving any spoilers theres a side quest you are going to lose your shit over nico all ill say for now is have fun when it comes pretty sure aniki means big brother or something of that nature yes yes omg this has cum much earlier than i expected oooooooooooooooooooooo waited for it i honestly think its too soon too but i know you will make it entertaining hooray i honestly wasnt expecting this so soon so its a welcome surprise aniki means big brother but for the yakuza is a term used to designate yakuza of older or senior rank within a family used by lower ranking member towards higherranking members its kinda like school students use the term senpai to refer to an upperclassman finally daigo didnt have an intro for his fight originally but now he does 237 funny you say that because theres a new fist of the north star game coming out made by the yakuza devs i never watched the anime but from what i played from the demo it seems like damn good fun i really didnt expect you to get to this so quickly does that mean majoras mask is next afterall anyway this game really does look very different if im not mistaken aniki means brother like someone you respect it seems theyre going with more proper japanese terms this time it makes sense since japanese has so many different words and nuances to things english has only one word for like brother for instance a bit troublesome if the meaning isnt explained though also that game poster you saw at club sega was for chunithm a rhythm game series yes the logo is weird so i am not surprised you couldnt read it at all i was hoping for majoras mask okay so anaki is a way of saying big brother and the way yakuza use it literally just means sir as in respecting your elder sir 5830 only in yakuza kiwami 2 where we see nico becoming excited from a opening door oh yes time for more daddy kiryu kicking ass action think you forgot about the charge attack thank you im so happy right now hell yeah i was waiting for this the sidequests are so much better than kiwami to commemorate this moment httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqoa21biuum0 aniki is something you might have heard in previous games already basically it means something like brother or elder brother and it is a term to adress a higher ranking person who your closer with at least thats my understanding of it correct me if you like camera shows the letter from terada nico i dunno what it says mind translating it for me and then it happens in literally the next scene fun fact just like kiwami this was thrown together while doing yakuza 6 they both use the same engine but you can tell this one got a lot more work put into it since the mouth animations arent reused from the ps2 game lol one of my favourite things about the new engine are the lights and lighting kamurocho is a feast for the eyes especially with its wet roads and such the game looks amazing another thing too you dont have styles but if you notice your charged light attack is the first attack of kiwamis and 0s beast style dont know if you knew this but the reason why this game looks significantly better than the other games is because of the new dragon engine 0 and kiwami were originally ps3 but this is made for the ps4 meaning of course theyre going to make a new engine designed for this game actually nico the japanese write stuff in english because english is considered cool i think i know thats why anime attack names are in english dare i say this older daddy kiryu looks younger oxo ive been waiting for this too bad im going to have to wait to watch it until i beat the game aniki is a term that more or less mean bro or big bro its used in gangs as a term of respect back yakuza 0 awano and shibusawa normally called kuze kuze no aniki more or less my big bro kuze as he was the most senior of the 3 lieutenants nico i dont like playing 2 rpgs at the same time because i know some of you guys are not really into this kind of game so ill try to change it up a bit also nico 6th rpg in a row you motherf nico you always know what to post to make my day better yeah ive been waiting for this nico with the streams what games you planning on doing nani i didnt expect daddy to be home this soon nico you have to at least give a warning god damn it in all seriousness im hyped as fuck to go in blind with nico again with another yakuza game its going to be a great game like the others have been with nicos commentary i have absolutely no issues with all this yakuza content seriously you just made my fuckin day nico lets just hope there isnt a huge grind but its time to stop commenting and get right to the lets play kate crying kiryu whats the matter little girl kate this one eyed man took my baseball bat kiryu ugh him again kate you know him mister kiryu well montage of kiryu and majima fighting yeah the 6 exp points are used to upgrade various stats and abilities welcome nico to the game play of yakuza 6 now i have to watch more frick when i loaded youtube and so this on my recommended i yell no cause my wifi been out and i been using my hotspot so videos are terrible and now im hurt cause i want to watch but loads take forever and looks terrible but i have the to see the true daddy am i the only one hearing korean or a i going crazy hoping spiderman for ps4 or majoras mask is after this one and now back to oh goddamnit everyone is dropping like flies again when it comes out will you play project judge 1709 one year you do not grow that much in one year haruka you growing like a weed drink some coffee yikes i fucking knew it anyways a word of advice smother it just smother it youll know when this advice comes in handyyou will know seeing this on my sud feed made my day z nico getting excited over no loading screen in the konbini is a precious moment so it pains me to say this but i havent played this game yet but if this is using the same combat as yakuza 6 then i have to say yakuza 6 plays like shit imo its painfully slow and unresponsive clunky and downright uncomfortable to fight people in terrible autolock on clunky movement that has way too much momentum and inertia making everything kiryu does feel like you have to massage his balls just to get him to move in the direction you want him to when anything happens youre stuck with your inputs completely being ignored by the game for multiple entire seconds in some cases like when an enemy blocks your attack and this is probably only the case for yakuza 6 but hella boring strategy to fighting super unbalanced damage output for things that you can do you can slave over the shit controls and fight a group of 15 guys for a whole minute or go and pick up a park bench and swing once and win the whole encounter the only thing i like about yakuza 6s game i could understand the korean feels good through all the japanese lol holy cow already i never thought hed do it so soon but its so good to be back onto yakuza majoras mask next then i knew you could not resist dragon engine daddy kiryuu fuck yes some hot tips for future use a do not be afraid to choose other answers in quests besides the right one seriouslyso fucking hilarious and i would hate for you to miss them you usually get to pick the right answer anyway after the wrong one b money is not an issue ever the best minigame is back you will know you willthe choices do matter in the minigame choices though contrary to the other tip cany battle skills you learn through quests you have to buy still komaki comes to mind made that mistake wondering where the hell my skill was but then realizing i still had to buy it with xp lol enjoy your ride nico its going to be reeeeaaaallll good 1312 from the scene that just played i feel like im rereading a certain manga points to those who know it but i hope im wrong i really love seeing nico play these games hey nico satan here i see youre doing kiwami 2 so woot since theres no majima everywhere system in this game i have an idea for the and now back to intros what if you showed the baka mitai clip but its younicob youtuber extraordinare singing and every picture kiryu looks at is a different scenario of meeting majimain a cone popping out the sewer 24 hour cinderella etc ending with the most angelic baka mitai you could muster up andor maybe add patreon subs to sing as well just an idea lol did kiryu completely forget shinji and reina why didnt he visit their graves as of this game in the yakuza series it is now the perfect time to say this clears throat and now back to being a daddy nico quick early heads up between certain chaptersnot every chapter you will unlock something there are 3 of them and its probably best to wait until you get all of them before looking into it man this game looks real pretty the dragon daddys returned with a fuck ton more asses to beat guess whos back back again daddys back oh my god yes im so glad i didnt have to wait long for this lets play i really like how even after kiryu leaves everyone still depends on the guy for advice and yakuza related work and to think he started pretty low in the beginning too im starting to wonder who the real yakuza in these games are edit yayoi is pretty fucking awesome justshe really is a woman who has ties in the yakuza and i love her so nicos playing yakuza again and torna the golden country comes out in two days this is going to be a fun couple of weeks the boys are back in town baby whow a shiny kiryu has appeared hearing the segaaaa theme oh man that brings back memories also it may have just been my phone but did anyone notice the frames dropping or was that just my phone was hoping for laytonace attorney crossover but it will work i guess need the pc version to be available so i cant watch the whole playthrough s to all those whove played this game can i ask do i need to know the first one or whatever because if thats the case im a gonna skip this one because ive not seen anything from the first two yakuza lps which likely wont happen because i refuse to read subtitles for hours on end yo im literally shaking with excitement right now nico yayois name is not pronounced yayoy its pronounced yayoe ah yes the return of daddy nishiki sorry im still stuck on kiwami ive never clicked on a video as fast as i just did daddys back are you guys happy cause im happy very happy more daddy time with kyriu babyhell yeah goddamnit nico im not done with the previous yakuza series im still not over the ending of yakuza kiwami but fuck it i need more yakuza and daddy kiryu so your fan of side mission with cutscenes i glad to say this game will have them in spades for you im hella excited for kiwami 2 yoshi prepared to take my money again i want all the penguins kiryu majima haruka everybody i didnt even know that there was a yakuza 2 is it gonna be baby kiryu is it gonna be baby kiryu nico for gods sake kiryu was like 19 years old in the early 80s daddys home bitches drop kicks a table the korean spoken is so good here mansounds alot better than the chinese dialogue lmao steinsgate 0 is dead i guess well at least i can still look forward to majoras mask oh man here it is hype btw nico the yakuza team is making a new game which is being called project judge right now it is a new ip but it is pretty much a yakuza spinoff from a lawyers point of view it even takes place in kamurocho hope you play sometime after it comes out the demo was incredibly promising glad to see you playing this i usually watch most of your series and i have watched yakuza zero as well and it was amazing unfortunately i missed yakuza kiwami 1 due to studying and such could someone tell me maybe pm me a short summary of what happened like the important events and any memes that happened edit watched a recap now i can finally start watching this god i hope goromi comes back she was sooo hot best hostess in kiwami 1 i am never going to get over kazma and yumi death still hurt me inside i love your yakuza lets play this is gonna be another great lets play by the great nicob this version is actually pretty good i thought itd be too disappointing over the removed content from the original but its great i will get nico to play doki doki literature club someday someday im happy that you back mate did you heard about project judge its yakutsa spinoff where you play as attorney so its pretty much ace attorney investigation 3 everybody wanted but could you do a favor main protagonist looks like grown up john marsh from last case in investigation 2 so made up for him that grow up john marsh voice and headcanon that hes left his movie carier to become an attorney someone get me an ambulance because my adrenaline is fired up yes daddys back baby cant wait to see nicos playthroughreactions it is time for an even more kiwami lp than xenoblade translators note kiwami means extreme daddy kiyru is back and hes ready to fuck shit up so its very ironic to me when nico is complimenting the game for how sharp it is then the video quality just drops thanks youtube aww i was hoping for another xenoblade episode have fun with this game i want to play it myself someday so ill skip this one yush great choice nico let the sslp sail forever surprised he hasnt recognized the guy in the box art and also every time you get a new story mission make sure you read the description that pops up in the upper right corner as kiryu will sometimes say either something badass or funny yes yes yes wait why im so exited for this playthrough like i want to play this myself hes back baby oh damn already i wasnt prepared my only gameplay tip for now is to avoid wasting too much experience on raw stats early on kiryu starts off really gimped in these games especially in 6 and kiwami 2 missing a lot of essential upgrades personally i made a beeline for increased quickstep distance and the basic press triangle on a grounded enemy heat move i also grabbed parry taunt and finishing hold as quickly as i could but thats more personal preference than essentials theyre really fun and useful but you can probably get by without them i wasnt here when the two videos of nicob talked about the channel but now i am and i want to say wow the support is unreal and i am onboard but i cant support you directly through patreon sorry also kiryu looks fatter why didnt he visit reinas grave or that other guy damn i fell like shit that i cant remember his name oh my god this is a great start im going to love this journey wow i thought you would be burned out with yakuza atm not complaining though d just beat this game two days ago and here are a few things you should be aware of 1 this game is ridiculously easy even compared to the other yakuza games i wont explain why at the very start but one of the reasons is that this game encourages you to use weapons more and they are incredibly easy to get due to enemies dropping them like candy hard mode might as well not exist 2 dropkick is pretty broken not tiger drop levels of broken but i beat so many tough bosses in the early game by just charging up with the triangle button waiting for them to attack letting go of the triangle button and smacking them in the face knocking a third of their health bar down keep in mind you have to wait until the enemy attacks before you do it as they can block it easily and youre wide open if it doesnt connect also you have to stand still for the charged attack to be a drop kick 3 they removed a lot of the boring sidequests from the original game but while kiwami 2 has a well well well i havent even finished chapter 3 i can play along this time nico not what i expected and i was kinda hoping for something different but i like yakuza so im not too beaten up about it yay im so excited so kiryu passed the torch to lucas and lucas immediately passed it back holy shit yes nico i feel like this series needs a totally not dead counter for the people kiryu beats up after a relaxing vacation with his daughter the dragon of dojima returns i was gonna sleep till i saw this notification now i am woke were back boiis yes so excited been playing this game ever since it game out and its been fantastic cant wait to see nico experience everything this game has to offer d its official 2018 is the year of the yakuza this is gonna be a wild ride wow it feels like you just finished the 1st onekiwami fuck its yakuza and not crisis core but im playing yakuza right now why nico why i want that blood level higher me when i saw that nico uploaded kiwami 2 nani i didnt expect nico to play this so soon i thought he might wait a bit longer but im not complaining im looking forward to this goddammit youtube how hard is it to notify me on time but steins gate zero another day penguins here comes kiryu cant wait for something cool to return hehe well didnt expect this lp to start so soon hey guys should we warn nico about that one side quest where umyknowhat happened edited my comment so i can enjoy nicos eyes burning and suffering i went from nice to sadistic in one day scuse me i am currently losing my sht across the board in speaking of yakuza i added the tattoo on kiryus back in wwe 2k18 ill reupload him with the tattoo by midnight in case anyones interested 90 sure thats datesan in the 80s scene and on that day datesan discovered the power of his pimp hand prepare your butts for a long post of things to know first things first kiwami 2 does not auto save save manually save often this game and 6 are 30fps as compared to kiwami and 0 which were 60 so good luck landing those tiger drops lol its a bit sad they sacrificed framerate for graphical fidelity buuut what can you do originally 15 were 30fps so it doesnt bother me much but those who only played 0 and kiwami would feel it the most the games look gorgeous and are still amazing despite this so dont let it get you down theres also ragdoll physics now so prepare for some unintentional hilarity most of the following can be applied to yakuza 6 as well the combat is different there arent different fighting styles they kind of rolled all of kiryus styles into one and changed up his animations and whatnot this is also the case with 6 kiryus attacks are meatier have slightly longer windup tracks targets and the contact feels weightier because they add current sg 0 status never well not really but yknow i am sad that its not hououin kyoumas turn but yakuzas good too okay who am i kidding im really sad but i hope daddy kiryu will help with that yes finally youre playing it this lp will be great me seeing this pop up in my feed thats rad the wait was longbut the reward was great fanboy screams yessssssssss this top 2 guess for this new lp yay i was looking forward to this for the games in the dragon engine so far there havent been any intros but there are fanmade ones by a dude named devilleon7 who created one for 6 as well as recreated the original 2s intro in the dragon engine capcom oh shit we what do we do for kawaii 2 kiryu kicks down door make me as shiny as possible unleash the dragon time to kurbstomp and not kill everyone all over again lol honestly this feels way too soon 1 month between yakuza games but i will probably watch anyway cause i enjoy your lps i have never clicked so fast im hype so looking forward to this 550 is that canton or mandarin wow i just bought kiwami 5 minutes ago the dragon of dads returns early 80s played as 19 year old kiryu but yes hes a baby lol yes this was the game that you hope you would play next while i wouldnt have minded majoras mask im excited simply due to the fact by how much better this game is than kiwami 1 not gonna lie i was kind of hoping this wouldnt come so soon there are other games i was wanting to see first like majoras mask and steinsgate 0 as i get burned out on yakuza quite quickly and it really hasnt been more than a few weeks since the last one ended here it is the only yakuza game ive yet to experience outside of the japan exclusive spinoffs and from what ive heard this is the best in the series so i am in for a ride my withdrawals has been sated my prediction was incorrect again again again again again but i was pleasantly surprised a friendly reminder for this lp no matter you may see or hear kiryu has never killed a man if i remember correctly this game is not as long as 0 and just a bit longer than kiwami right anyway excited to see the origins of p5s ryuji dancing in starlight yakuza outfit he dresses the outfit of yakuzas ryuji yeah the engine and gameplay for this title is the same as yakuza 6s whoo daddy kiryu i missed you too bad im likely gonna be missing a ton of your adventure because of the stupid hurricane coming i gasped for like 30 continuous seconds when i saw the notify please help i cant stop coughing the dragon roars once again so yeah quick heads up nico the combat in this game is mostly based in yakuza 6s combat with many of the heat actions from yakuza 2 making a return to be at least faithful to the original in some ways basically that is the reason this game has mixed opinions but its mostly comes down to which style of combat of you liked more the original still holds up if anyone is interested in going back and compare its really good imo ok stay calm people stay calm its happening i think it would be great if nico played shenmue sleeping dogs imo theyre quite similar to yakuza sadly i wont be watching this actively since im not really the biggest fan of the serieshavent watched nicos previous yakuza lets play so id probably miss a lot of what is going on but its still great to have you back nico i just want to thank you nicob for all the content you produce to entertain the picky penguins you really are the best youtuber thank you yeeeeeeeees you got me into it and i played it it was fun yakuza kiwami 2 is on the brand shiny new dragon engine the same engine that yakuza 6 runs on and its still trying to stretch its wings fully so it isnt as refined as the original engine that 0 and kiwami run on infact this is only the second game to even use the dragon engine despite that though its still a reall nice engine and kiwami 2 really shows some good stuff that the engine can do you know i really couldnt contain my excitement when i saw the thumbnail nico youre definitely gonna enjoy this out of all the yakuza games the story and the characters really stand out one of the villains in the game is regarded as arguably the best one of the series so yeah have fun were back boys and girls what what huh how what no anguishing way is this real noooo way take me now daddy heelllllllllllllllllllllllllll fuckinnnnnnnnnnnnnnng yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah thsi is gonna be fucking awesome zetsubou nara ii ya nicob you will understand the meaning of these word in the future because i will bring them up again at a fitting time and dont forget to wear a helmet kids and in this episode we see kiryu pick up the monado and have a battle to the death with dunban everybody do the hustle ah lets see what important characters from the last game die this game grab the tissues penguins alright so quick tip do you dont miss it because i missed this before hand in the first long battle there is a quick time event involving a chandelier not a spoiler but keep the heat up so your not missing anything you can hear both screams of joy and of anguish from the community for the sg dream has died once again but the yakuza dream rises once more im fine with anything tho rn im just happy that i get to see daddy once again and thus nicob and the dragon of dojima return to wreck some shit also congrats on the patreon really made me see how much this community cares about you i just finished crying from laugher over one sidequest i bumped into in my playthrough and now this this day is teuly full of daddy kiryuchaaaaaan holy shit im early better say something clever bagels already yes im just wondering what one mission will look like in hd oh yeah there is an intro in the original yakuza 2 so you can watch that or someone made an remake of the intro and it is awesome so check it out if you wanna check it out kiwami more like kifinally ill see myself out but more importantly daddy kiryu and my baby boy daigo hugest biggest love why tf wasnt daigo in kiwami 1 i know he wasnt an actual character until 2 but you think theyd name drop him in the remake seeing as his dad dying is a major plot point it was expected ill keep hoping for you miitopia this engine is 6s btw which is why it feels different smash bros nicob edition lucas glasses headset nicob smashes with pk xbox one x duck hunt dog duck zapper reticle team bpl bernie picky penguin laser pointer come to play purple young link no pants kokichi intimidates the competition helmetless captain falcon all might is here for a detroit smash debut pit play kid icarus uprising sora play kingdom hearts 3 even though i know you will all but sora get out of here you havent been announced yet roxas im his echo watch out for daddy kiryu or hell ground you literally aw itll be nice to see the adorable child grow up and haruka as well yes i wasnt sure if i was prepared for anything else yakuza kiwami 2 featuring bernie from the nico may cry series we all knew this would happen i am ready for the daddys to return i did not expect this so soon wah i want to watch but i gotta wait till night thank you nicooooo you are definitely on a ride this time 3 did anyone see that reveal trailer of project judge its apparently being developed by the same people who make the yakuza games but you know what the best part is the protagonist is a lawyer who solves court cases you heard that right ace attorney with curbstomping baby yes i knew it this is the only channel where ive ever teared up a little from joy at seeing a new series its a testament to how consistently great your content is i wasnt sure when youd do kiwami 2 but im happy its this soon after the first one shit now i gotta unsub until you beat the game i think i need a new set of underwear because ive never come this early the instant i saw this i just whisper screamed and started shaking from all the pent up hype because i didnt want to wake everyone up lmao this game finally achieved what no game could before the gameplay looks just like the prerendered cutscenes i wish you luck with the patreon d well nico its nice to see you finally play kiwami 2 as many consider yakuza 2 to be one of the best entries in the series and so with that i decided to give you few tips as you might have already noticed kiwami 2 works on a different engine than 0 and kiwami its name being dragon engine currently 6 kiwami 2 and now in development shin yakuza next mainline entry after 6 with new main protag and yakuza spinoff judge eyes slated for 2019 english release were made on it and that brings a lot of changes some good and somequestionable with that being said there are some abilities i believe you should get this time around both substory and encounter finders are not items you can equip while encounter one is gone since you can see enemies on the minimap right from the start substory one now is a ability and i imagine like in two previous games youll want to finish all substories a rather bizarre design choice is your normal walking speed in games made in dragon e hell yeah the game of yakuza is back ahhhhhghhhhhhsjehehexiisjedjfjdksks i was not expecting this but it is very welcome already honestly im both hyped and disappointed ehhhhhhh its daddy kiryu so who gives a shit in kiryu we trust

more daddy kiryu too soon kiryu graces is with his present omg i really wasnt expecting this so soon im not even done with it myself yet but also really excited because this game has been fantastic so far theres already been a bunch of stuff where i immediately thought i cant wait to see nicos reaction looks like yakuza has returned a bit sooner than expected early boi its time dads back to curbstomp shit and i am living we all saw this coming and damn i am fucking excited this is one of the best games in the franchise really hope you enjoy it yes but dude you knida late af lol it came out about half a month ago now wow yassss i was expecting this a bit later on in your lps but im happy its here i love this gameverse so much xd alright you need to calm down with your hype nico i

im so hyped nico so hyped ultranut keep in mind this game takes place 18 years after 0 heh i knew it would be either this or majoras mask so majoras mask is next i am guessing after xenoblade good to

series for well over 10 years now and the fact they got this out so quickly makes me happy i remember waiting for 5 and it was crazy but wow im just glad to see the growth of this series between the localization and fans alike im grateful for this community is there going to be another story trailer for spiderman ps4 my wallet is ready downloading the demo now crazy how goda became the villain i remember when i ran into him in yakuza 0 on a side quest there is demo at ps store when is yakuza 7 coming the best trailer of any yakuza game so far in my opinion shout out to all yakuza fans yeahhh the screenshot so this is a remake of yakuza 2 i waited it and here i thought yakuza was gonna gip me out of this moment goes and relights the candles in his kiryu shrine thank you daddy heard the lord return show me when does anyone relized relized this stick on 380p xd not bad but just let ya guys know comes back to see majima why is this stuck at 360p youtube you sound like tea from yugioh abridged series shit now i have to watch his zelda lets play to get the picture fuccccck 422 yo that scream tho i just love this bois voice overs ahh that fine reunion and after 20 years he still forgot to buy the vinegar xd 2650 oh nico if only you saw her videos aika is all right but i still prefer the other girls over her by a landslide well all the hostess are based on their real life counterparts and voiced by them so theyre arent the professionals including yakuza 0 girls the actresses specialty are making videos i bet yukis gonna get back into the hostess game yeah thats what i thought its subtle but given her attitude it makes sense that aika is ganguro ganguro girls were a bit of a fashion fad in the mid2000s this game does take place in 2006 after all but has since died off it was kinda popular for being kind of a punk rock thing to do since it was very different from what was considered traditional feminine japanese beauty i think also explains why her party stat is so good because ganguro usually are more into partying i am not totally sure what the japanese think of ganguro girls themselves but their influences can be seen in their media it was even speculated that ganguro was a part of the influence of jinx the pokmon funnily enough edit i misheard nico i thought he said ganguro not gyaru given that this game took place in the 2000s i thought thats what they were going for why not put flex seal on your ps4 cant you like permanently equip the fire sword if you use super heat mode since you cant die as long as you have some heat left and then you can taunt to fill it all the way back to full in an instant nico i try to keep everyone looking more or less the same later on in the episode aika kiryu want to go out and get drinks kiryu agrees to goes out for drinks with aika aika hang on let me put on a suit before we go out to drink introducing top hostess kazuko kiryu comes out all dolled up like goromi nico has so much restraint if it were me id be doing up the girls like different characters just imagine the intro with a row of junkos on each side bowing to you yoyo detective yoko is a reference to sukeban deka a story about a delinquent girl who fights crime with of course a yoyo 3007 anyone else expect nico to start singing simple and clean can we just agree how creepy that kidnapper guy was nicob owns a 1080ti plays games in 1080p why didnt nico comment about kiryu cleaning toilets daddys following apollos footsteps im happy majima gets to reunite with living characters kiryu when will you learn that majima is litteraly everywhere anyone else see shoko learning beast style after seeing one of kiryus fights with a bike after that conversation bueno finally put his innate running moshirige ability into use when i watch you play the yakuza series it makes me think about how lively cities in japan like sotembori and kamarocho are the hostess talking about hobbies and where they go in their free time game centres and golf courses you dont really see stuff like that where i come from its really quite boring i suppose that is also why japan is a popular tourists spot as well as the fact that its really quite beautiful there nico can you please bakameitai the majoras mask hug with cremia oh my god that scene was amazing majima returns morishige is the villain i mean of course morishige is the villain its always him just like how hes probably the villain in the council of voices nonary game i laughed so hard at this scene best yakuza moment since the passport to pizza substory nico finishes the last part of the cabaret club minigame nico but seriously whos the last girl i completed everything and still havent fou majima walks in in a pink dress and blonde wig majima hello kiryuchan could i join you guys kiryu majimawhat are you do majima im not majima kiryuchan the names goromichan kiryu nico mother fu and thus nico breaks another ps4 i was so interested in what kuro gyaru meant i ended up pausing the video next thing i know im spending 3 hours on gyaru109wikiacom thats the best site i could find for basic intro stuff there is a wikia with almost the same name gyaruwikiacom but its less up to date and overall has less info i ended up plowing through twitter for street candids from harajuku how have we not seen miracle johnson yet in the into man i really want you to play a dating after this you deliberating over what seems not slimy and which girl you like best and why is really fun to see i recommend katawa should if you ever feel like it havent had any duds yet the moment i heard that i just imagined a hostess dinner thing with normal dialogue but every time the hostess speaks she just opens her mouth and a loud honking noise comes out instead of speech kiryu which sushi do you like the best hostess hoooooonk kiryu oh yeah that ones pretty good hostess hooooooooooonk kiryu slightly flustered no were just friends and coworkers hostess after smiling nicely hoooooonk hearts fly 3001 it missed the chance of calling it i prefer simple and clean right when majima said that person standing right there an ad appeared cliffhangers man 2610 im sorry but aika is more direct than kana holy freaking bottle of champagne 12329 lets settle this fair and square ahhhhhhhhhhhhh roulette flashbacks intensify ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh that was the first thing it came to my mind when i heard that and im bettting she is going to cheat just as hard as we know who dang i thought kiryu was going to say i prefer simple and clean i can already hear the song playing kiryu doctor doctor im feeling sick and i dont know why doctor whats wrong kiryu im always sad and feel like crying but i dont cause im a man i always find myself drinking at 9 in the morning screeching bakamitai and looking at random pictures and feel like crying again doctor wow that sounds serious i believe you may be suffering from kiryu suddenly notices the doctor has an eyepatch doctor from mad dog withdrawal syndrome hahaha kiryu oh shit doctor majima and the treatment is one majima a day to keep the yakuza blues away kiryu im outta here doc majima and at least 5 hours of karaoke daily with your favorite pal i cant believe youre doing cabaret managing like i did following in my footsteps sniff kiryu runs like hell majima chases kiryu in the street majima admit it you missed me kiryu chaaaan winks at gamers playing yakuza kiryu god dammit majima youda majima san its been about 20 yea oh gyaru wait like clover i think they said her design was based on that too crazy pshycho bitchhhhhhh ai was the yakuza 0 hostess with the red dress and the bad voice actress kana stop laughing kiryusan kiryu whos laughing im not laughing kana just for that you going to buy me 400 plates kiryu nani kana the expensive ones kiryu runs away kana kiryusan get back here because kiwami 2 doesnt have majima everywhere system nicos ps4 just decided to create a wholly new experience just like it crashes everywhere system 12244 its running moshirige omg the intro with the zelda guy killed me older yuki is 100 times cuter than younger yuki 12247 oh my god he really is running moshirig a few of these girls are not like the others a few of these girls just doesnt belong sorry that tune ringing in my head automatically when nico said it in 3206 btw ram failure would have similar symptoms to what you are attributing to hard drive issues they tend to be triggered apparently randomly especially when the bad ram module is at the last address in that case it would be triggered when you use up all the ram assuming the os or mmu dont just randomize ram usage heads up yua and shoko just release a video where they perform together you know that kind of video 3012 cue kingdom hearts music shouldve let kiryu fight your ps4 not only would he manage to not break it itd learn some valuable life lessons and start working properly again while the cabaret club stuff in this game was good it just got ten times better now that majima has made the scene heres a classic little nursery rhyme we all love kiryu maji maji majima yes kiryuchan kiryu tryin to ambush me majima no kiryuchan kiyru holding knives majima no kiryuchan kiryu show me your inventory majima ha ha ha so the moshirige looking guy turned out to be evil gee you think you know a guy 10810 nicob is the best at ad libbing in games its like his talent i imagine how used to all of this crap haruka is to seeing this kinda crap id bet majima filled her in everything going on haruka hey uncle majima majima harukachan good to see you little goober what are you doing out here haruka daddy doesnt let me go inside he says it may corrupt me majima how bad could that be im dragging lifeless bodies and you are not even scared haruka i was about to ask about that are they really dead majima of course not i dont think so at least i just stabbed them a few times haruka uncle majima that kills people majima one of them is breathing thats good enough for me haruka oh uncle majima insert laugh track the term gyaru is something like how westernersamericans might call some girls gals since in japanese language there are some differences in how they pronounce the l and r sounds like we do like its derivative the gyaru culture is inspired by western fashion and media that they try to convey through wearing accessories that dazzle or pop out to viewers what and how they wear their clothes in a more independent or free way that some japanese might find as shameless maybe dye their hair blonde for most how they even communicate and in aikas case go to lengths to receive fullbody tans kuro gyaru is literally translated as black gal like kurokuma from danganronpa means black bear in japanese which describes the niche of gyarus who go for the full tan look but i personally dont think this is trying to be demeaningdiscriminating but more trying to find ones selfexpression in bolder ways that some japanese girls probably wouldnt seeing majima come back is awesome but was anyone else wishing yuki wouldve hugged him nico always wishes for more makingout in games but im always wishing to see more hugs are hugs really that hard to animate glad nico has finally defeated the crash everywhere system that bandicoot needed to be taught a lesson and new ps4 taught it as for gyaru culture as far as i know as a white guy thats spent my entire life on the east coast of the us it started out as a fashion style in if memory serves the late 70s but in the 90s was adopted by young women and high school girls and was turned into sort of a counterculture i think similar to how kawaii writing styles started out with gyaru being based on the word gal gyaru typically go against many traits of the ideal japanese woman conservatively dressed with fair skin and ebony hair by dressing flashy commonly getting tans and dying their hair lighter colors but there are many subtypes of gyaru fashion like those who model themselves based on western fashion as well as male gyaru i dont remember the term for it and gyaru who are mothers you never had a 6 person restriction in 0 but yuki did get kidnapped you beat that league by the skin of your teeth i tend to not buy gifts so i had a bit more distance between myself and her and now best girl yuki will become even more best girl in the next cabaret club story event i find nico has a preference when it comes to virtual waifus he seems to go for glamor rich or royalty status in game im having trouble remembering names but when he went out with shoko and said you look like waifu material nicob if you can read this im i crazy or is their more to it then that y u say that and the bus came back 4805 i really wish you said punch people that would have been funny the oil baron you seem like you have waifu potential nicob 2018 if you had goromi on your team you wouldnt have to win by a clutch 1222 spits out drink whats fukawa doing here the best part of the kiryu host club is the champagne call cutscene that pic made me laugh a lot harder than i should stupid old screaming goat be an ass and leave then after all of that happens with majima at four shine from the door kiyru hears a familiar sound cluck cluck cluck nico about to lose cabaret championship oil baron appears and makes it rain making fourshine win by a hair nico insert zelda shocked scientist meme here wow majima sure is looking good for someone who last time we saw him was near death im glad i maxed out my sprint stat oh god buono is running morishige all grown up at 1220 that uniform doesnt it look like touko fukawas uniform i swear kanzaki is going to hurt himself if he keeps on sucking himself off like thisi mean constantly being in that position has to hurt his back what if theres a secret girl and its majima i mean goromichan think about it he she wooed kiryu think of the bank goromi would make best girl top tier waifu thank you nico for the best 18 birthday this video made my boring day full of laughter and im glad to live long enough to see your videos and would watch your videos tell the day i die it would have been so awesome to see kana fight that scum bag masaru kana just curb stomping masaru with kiryu cheering her on kana do you honestly think hostess training is all kiryu teaches us at four shine hurgh german suplex masaru kiryu eating popcorn yeah you tell him kana kana i dont need help cleaning the floor with scum like you grinds masarus face with her shoe kiryu damn kinda wish that was me kana what kiryu what buono isozaki learned his sprint ability from running moshirige one thing that just irks me here in yakuza kiwami 2 spoilers is that you couldnt date yuki herself i mean goddammit i have been waiting for this ship majima you had one job also 20 years to get the damn vinegar also nico didnt notice the churashi reference that yuki was making back in yakuza 0 the yakuza 0 hostesses are yuki ai saki hibiki chika and mana i really love how bold aika is cant say i approve of her alcoholism but bold women are the sexiest 11904 the moment everyone was waiting for d there was a time i questioned how the hell the mad dog of shimano got his own yakuza family then i realized id follow him to the end of the earth just to see him try to paraglide off of it in his hostess costume remember the acronym abm always blame moshirige 041 and he make his epic return to the night life scene and the meme is spreading man its so good seeing the old crew back together it feels like the ultimate love letter to yakuza 0 like alot of other things in this game it just hit me the oil barrons voice actor sound exactly like gary buster holmes thug at 10418 majima jumps out of nowhere and shanks him ya think yer gonna get away stealin my style in this town punk snakeskins my classic look can you play rivers in the desert in the cabaret battle against kirara something id like to point out i had a look at the kanji in koyukis name and its written as this particular ko is the kanji for small so her name is literally small yuki that song why am i not surpised the girl in red you mean ai majima walks in yuki im baaaaaack majima hears a demonic presence ohhhh myyy the handsome hero returned for me i see majima turns with fear after hearing voice m noo no not you nooooooo the figure pounces on majima revealing it to be etsuko e come get me daddy majima granny missed ya majimas scream of terror echoed through club four shine and all of sotenbori majima lord of the night has returned true daddy has come home kiryu what im the true daddy majima oh but did you buy the vinegar kiryu huh vinegar majima aha you didnt so im still the daddy kiryu i dont understand why a vinegar has to do anything with this majima oh if only you knew kiryuchan when you clicked on gag manga i wasnt thinking gags as in jokes i was thinking gags as in weird bondage fetishes for some reason lol another non main story episodeseriouslythis is not going like yakuza 0 went its been more than a week without main story development and i dont think this is cool from now on nico lets say working on the cabaret club is gonna be quite different fist of the north star nuff said i remember that red hostess laugh nico he he he god its in my nightmares something calming about hearing nico not get a pro every lets player ive seen has one granted its their job but i never really looked at it that way more so see others just having a pro and i dont know feel like im missing out but following this channel i no longer feel that way especially after hearing you say its focused more on 4k than fps and not enough games make use of that to get one at that price nor do i have the games that do just hearing someone i watch and whos content i enjoy as opposed to a faceless comment on a forum saying it makes a big difference hey nico the majima everywhere system is in yakuza kiwami 2 you just havent realized yet majima has been hiding in the blue screens i knew that was gonna be todays intro youre real proud of that one id like to nominate a close up of majimas ponytail for the one of the remaining bakamati sessions not majima in all of his glory just the ponytail that baka metai opening was great imagine hiw confused others might be though if they havent watched the majoras mask lp yet omg i swear to god after yesterdays episode of majoras mask i was thinking to myself i really hope nico does a yakuza opening with the old man eventually now i have the bullshit powers nico hahaha that intro picture xd i nearly fell off my chair laughing i want to see kiryu and majima in a club battle who would be the ultimate club manager if the girls had bonding sessions with both of them who would they side with take a shot everytime nico uses the old man from majoras mask as a reaction this part is legitimately one of my favorite surprises of the whole series captain kiryudefender of earth citizenoh nooooo somebody save me im being robbed kiryu never fear nameless citizen number 208 it is i captain kiryu and ive come to save the day all might expression nameless moon 1 oh no its the daddy himself run flees nameless moon 2 im not important enough for speech bwahh flees kiryu oh no you dont go haruka powersactivate mooks 12 are turned into dead ps4s citizen i thought you didnt kill people kiryu i didnt i only see dead ps4s here citizen that powers weird kiryu welcome to japan nameless now identified as foreign but wont ever be heard from again but will probably spawn thousands of clones citizen away quick steps through everything out of there citizen mutters nameless am i well lets see if the legendary daddy is prepared to face with the vile takes off mask to reveal a woman mommy its funny as hell that some of the customers calls the obatarian and school mistress bijin which means like hottie d majima needs to be a hostess dlc gyaru is a sort of japanese vocalisation of gal or girl another fashion thing of note would be ganguro girlsganguro fashion it was a fashion trend that i believe was more popular around the 90s that basically was focused on going against traditional japanese beauty standards eg pale skin so girls had tanned skin and pale concealer lips and really gaudy makeup and hair and nails there are still some girls who are into the trend nowadays but its mostly not as popular anymore i think its kinda regarded as a bit of a flashy delinquent type look sometimes though okay that intro just killed me xd interesting enough the creator of yakuza toshihiro nagoshi had a quite of bit of interesting history when trying to make yakuza a reality apparently the franchise came into mind for him when he went out drinking one night at a red light district this idea came inbetween the time sega had offically discontinued the dreamcast and announced itself as a thirdparty company morale took a plummet at sega as many of its employees were unsure of segas future but nagoshi was optimistic in the potential being a thrid party company could bring he pitched the idea of yakuza many times to the higher ups but it kept getting rejected because of how yakuzas gamplay nature was about hurting other people which at the time was a big no no for sega nagoshi eventually manage to finally to get yakuza greenlighted after he swore to the company that if yakuza was a financial flop he would leave sega and the gaming scene all together yakuza was a success which leaded to a very interesting take majima take that you bastardcurb stomps larry 32342 larry32342 no dudedies yuki majima majimaoh hey yuki i have the vinegar you asked me to get yuki about time kiryuv so you were yukis former boss huh majima majimav thats right anyway yuki what were you planning on making with the vinegar yuki i forgot since it took you so fricking lonh majima majima oops youda anyway who wants to go to chuckecheese kiryumajimanicopersona5 me majimav hey wait a minute where did you come from nicop5 the future kiryu that makes sense majima yeah it does yukio it doesnt youda lets go nicop5majimakiryu yay yuki how is he from the future when the picture intro was going on i wasnt really paying attention but when i heard it the first thing i thought was he did not went back he did those ce errors happen quite a bit for me randomly on different games but the blue corrupt screen has only happened a few times on overwatch that scream in the bakamitai caught me off guard im going to loop that a few times the best character has finally joined up go go majima go while checking out techinn fugu kiryu man this place has seen better days haruka well it closed down because i heard a man with an eyepatch closed it down with a bad yelp review the sound of a voice saying kiryuchan echoes through the street the bakamitai segment is becoming a self fulfilling prophecy at this point i highly suggest you max out all the girls before taking on kirara having all your platinum girls with the request feature is going to work wonders with the match in addition there are still two sidequests to be done with the club after you complete the cabaret quest also fun fact about yua irl she was an jidol before going into porn her ingame counterpart makes reference to this seriously nicoyou gotta take aika to karaoke still glad to see majima didnt forget his roots and on this day nico realise the strongest character in the yakuza series was in factoil baron officer kiryu just walks in the door kiryu you are all busted where are the drugs random thug 11037 what drugs this is a warehouse we have no drugs kiryu we will see about that hya kiryu proceeds to run into every single box inside the warehouse creating damage of up to 500 million yen worth thug the warehouse my boss is gonna kill me kiryu oh yeah i joked about the drugs part i just wanted to smash up your place because i was very bored here is you life lesson for today that i always give to everyone you should have a passion for your job so that whenever you see a person just breaking your stuff you should always beat him up unless it is me kiryu awkwardly just leaves the building thug substory end this was definitely a moment i have been excited to see nico react to although i for one didnt even realize yoda was talking to majima on the phone to tip me off i dont even remember that moment happening honestly i think the majima return reveal was better the way i didnt get tipped off it was incredibly surprising and just an amazing moment when you dont see it coming so suddenly this is what i have been waiting for is this not everything you have ever wanted feel the hype just as i did and for some reason majima is here isnt that the case everytime majima shows up for anything its the pure core of majima what makes him so great majima what are you even doing here i dunno just looked like a fun place to be you know how did you even get here i dunno i was fired out of a cannon and just landed here i suppose how did you get a cannon i dont know won it at that black jack and hookers place its great its clown themed why am i even asking questions i dunno why are you asking any questions in relation to me kiryuchan i dont know majima the lord of the night is back baby yuki majimasan kiryu wait what do you mean lord of the night you mean majima wasnt making that up yuki yup majima was a legendary cabaret manager 28 years ago everybody wow thats amazing majimasan kiryu um well i beat up two tigers yesteday majima oh kiryuchan you and your silly stories

procceds to run out of the club crying majima there can be only one lord of the night kiryuchan now everybody do the hustle majima so kyiru chan your running your own cabaret club huh kyiru yeahwhy majima have you been doing everything i thought you kyiru yeah im doing the thumbs up and i never really giving our customers gifts majima good job kyiru changood job hey girls i brought the vinger majimasan that was 20 years ago ooops xd haruka would sit outside the club for several daysturning to weeksthen monthsjust waiting that one day daddy would finally come home from that quick trip to the hostess club but nobody camethen haruka said fuck it and broke down the door and found kiryu making out with goromi haruka haruka slowly backed away and ran as fast as she could the ps4 issue is just a continuation of majima everywhere under traffic cones under manholes and in corrupted save files and for some reason majimasan showed up sums up his entire character 036 ha called it i never thought id get comment of the day i never thought anybody would see my comments dumb or info filled they may be but i never expected this moment thank you yakuza 11920 majima yukichan im hoooooome yuki where the hell have you been you just disappeared one day after you went to get some vinegar majima hey dont blame me i was hanging out with this other guy said he went to get some cigarettes for his wife i think his kids name was ness anyway we both lost track of time but i finally remembered about this place when i saw kiryuchans tracker in a cabaret club kiryu wait you what yuki who else but majima seinfeld theme plays i am willing to leave my real family so i can be daddy kiryus child no nico majima construction is the only one with two of the special scrolling conversations cabaret club only has one in total makes three of the special conversations in kiwami 2 this last third one is after the majima construction story be sure to talk to the black jacket guy after the last main mission in majima construction also the last battle skills and heat action are unlocked through the amon substory this one must be bought after the last substory which appeared as a primer at kamiyama works completing all of the arenas which the last two are unlocked after main story of majima construction and finally for just completing all substories make sure to do all of the above also plz do aika like a butterfly song ahaha people who arent watching the majoras mask playthrough are gonna be so confused meanwhile i am on the floor why is that so funny xemnas the lord of nothingness marluxia the lord of castle oblivion ganondorf the lord of darkness detective fulbright the lord of justice zansa the lord of bionis majima the lord of the night yukichan its been almost 20 years howve you been still waiting on that vinegar oops luck is a part of skill akihiko jumps out of the bushes ive been waiting for this im back play crisis core work is a bitch by the way play crisis core majima so now that im back i guess we have a lot to catch up on huh yuki first of all though did you bring the vinnegar majima what yuki damnit majima ive been waiting for 20 years majima not my problem anymore etsuko did someone say majima majima oh god what is that doing here kiryu what majimasan you mean you know this battalion tank majima know her i hired her back when i was manager of sunshine biggest mistake of my life and i still have nightmares about her kiryu you too huh etsuko boys boys there is plenty of my fine figure to go around majima why did you hire her kiryuchan kiryu why did you majima because she had high talk kiryu well same majima well shitsickles etsuko stop fighting and let mama in on some action goes in for a make out sesh with kiryu and majima kiryu and majima noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo etsu the tanko attacks leaving kiryu and majimas hp at 1 yuki giggle and smi insert smash bros everyone is here meme here also just to answer your question kuro gyaru is basically just a really niche 90s fashion trend in japan it has nothing to do with heritage as far as i know it was pretty much a counter culture movement challenging conventional definitions of beauty at the time fair skin ebony hair very similar to the flappers of 1920s america there he is i feel like we havent seen daddy majima in forever and now back to the moment youve all been waiting for x3 ive been waiting for this moment i instantly skipped to the end to see the reaction that was glorious now back to watching from the beginning okay that was definitely a very unexpected bakamitai for once from the sound it still reminds me of that old goat meme 041 whenever i see the word kana i cannot think of anything else than those awful mcdonalds pakistan commercials mcdonalds here at kana i wonder if anyone else will get it and then majima meets etsuko again and forces him and kiryu into a dirty threesome the lord of the night returns now with a smidge of crazy oh who am i kidding the mad dog is always good for everyone majima yes tis i the lord of the night i have returned yuki you dont have the ponytail though majima shut up this is totally better also i fucking knew that was gonna be the gag picture i guess its time its nighttime get it because hes the lord of the night heh by far the greatest moment in the game show me uh hmm its time for daddies tell daddy whats wrong nicob nico simple and clean is the way that daddy is making me feel tonight its hard to let anguish go buts its given me so many things lately so anguish is all i need despite these daddies dont tell nico i love his anguish or do i have to meet his scary majora mask guy from the fishy place i guess these things arent that simple is majima saga only available after u beat the game ibuchi majima majima ibuchi ibuchi oh youre approaching me ibuchi and dio use same voice actor i never knew that part bout when u beat yakuza 2 with kiryu theres an opening u can play as majima why is the gun that that guy has at 10419 used by practically every enemy in the yakuza games majima is trying so hard not to make a sound its so funny yet sad cause its the only way makoto can truly recognize him see the first fistfighting majima sure cleaned up the field fast without let them laying some punch and kick on him definitely improved version of yakuza 0 629 what the fuck they going on about they are fucking yakuza ugh majima is best boy its not gay if its majima wholy shit its makoto makimura heh talk about a blast from y0 yuhkoozuh stooooooooop its pronounced like yahkoozah only in sense that that u always makes an oo type sound yakoozah actually looks hella wrong just be weebier plz learn yerr japanese pronounciations ill work on my english spelling xd too bad ive already finished the game before watching this yakuza 0 is surely the best finally it comes on pc on 9th may im new to the series because i havent a playstation so i was hyped as zero was announced now in a few days kiwami 1 will come and im hyped as fuck but kiwami 2 looks amazing as fuck too so did it in the netherlands dec 2017 i just got into the series with kiwami i played the game for 18 hours straight theres just something so addictive about the graphics and design language walking at night feels very very alive and ive never seen characters in a video game to be more alive japan knows how to tell a story and not to mention those random majima encounters are hilarious coupled with other pedestrian encounters and i never really got bored no english audio ironically the main bad guy is the kid who stole pants from highschooler from yakuza 0 this game disappoints me so much its not majima its majima and its not mokoto its makito sounds but spelt differently gosh have you not played zero or paid attention how about you pronounce kiwami even more ridiculously its the best yakuza game remade in the yakuza 6 engine thats enough to warrant a must buy what about cabaret club wait chono is in clan creator please oh please let hsei tsukitei from downtown no gaki no tsukai ya arahende be a person that you can get in your clan that chono can slap or at least someone that looks like him people who are getting upset on how he says the game title are weebs get over it and just play it cant wait i really hope they add climax battles in this would it be better to purchase physical copy or on ps network i heard somewhere physical copy doesnt have bonus stuff and only ps network does jesus christ you butchered every possible pronunciation its mahjima get it right you twink the wii u ver worst selling by a mile its yakuza game so its a must buy for me i cant wait im updated and ready plus i have shenmue 12 to start the week before for anyone who hasnt played the ps2 original youre in for a treat still the best game in the series story and characterwise did they fix one of the failings of dragon engine static discussion scenes people didnt really move their hands and only few important people were doing more than stand i got triggered everytime he said kawami instead of kiwami its 30 fps played the first remake about a month ago blind buy and all and was blown away how fun it was found out that the games like 0 and 6 just kept the series getting better played about half way or so into 0 and i love it i still need to pick of 6 and i will for sure be getting this game im a fan of asian mob movies and cop stuff like dead or alive triad movies and even ichi the killer has a little bit if this series in it to me also its just a bat shit crazy and fun game series imo yakuza is not hard to say it is not yakooza there is no ooo sound and definitely no emphasis on the second syllable they say it enough in the games yakuza this guy is a real expert on goru mahjeema bad vidia boys okay i get this video was more intended to promote kiwami 2 rather than actually inform people of what they need to know but you titled it that way so i gotta point this shit out cause its very important potentially negative details about the game that might make you want to think twice about buying it 1 one of the districtscities in the original yakuza 2 is not in the remake 2 although the dragon engine has been improved upon the fights in the story mode are still piss easy this is especially a shame for the fight with ryuji where hes a complete pushover compared to his original encounters lessening his overall impact as this intimidating antagonist 3 probably not a good game to start getting into the yakuza series youre better off trying zero if you want to get into the series cause gameplay wise starting from kiwami 2s dragon engine to yakuza 3 5s combat is going to be somewhat jarring this game wasnt remade from the ground up they put the dragon engine on top of the old game dislike for the pronunciation of yakuza kiwami wtf love the yakuza games cant wait for this and hope they remake 3 4 and 5 as well just buy the damn game you wont regret it just got to say if i was the dude who hit kiryu on the head with a bottle and he turned around to look at me like in the video i wouldnt have to worry of getting my ass kicked fear alone would have killed me off before anything else just buy one more thingno more flirting with cabaret club girls which is sucks the only thing you need to know is to buy it as soon as fucking possible yakuza 3 4 and 5 are being remastered to so the enire series will be playable on one console makoto and majimas resolution is something worth waiting for in kiwami 2 kiwami 2 releases soon ryuji will get his ass kicked for the second time by me before you must buy first day purchase i dont need to know anything i love yakuza but hate the dragon engine did you know when you look at majima without a shirt he doesnt have any nipples i read this is the last they will make in the dragon engine like 3 4 5 are not getting done i hope im wrong susumu terajima was voicing jiro kawara in the original game but in the kiwami 2 version kawaras face were modeled after the actor you saying yuh kooza bothers me so much dragon engine is not their first title using it yakuza 6 used the dragon engine that guy who gets thrown off the train landed on his neck german duplex style this game is everything cant wait to play this game shit is tight hope it runs better then yakuza 6 on base ps4 lots of repeating scene thanks for that breakdown of muhjeema i love gaming lists next time try to make a top 1000 things to know about yakuza before spending your hard earned cash yeah baby the things you covered are very important too wow wee i love the gaming press you nailed it bravo its so annoying that in every yakuza you have to clean up the situation kiryu should have stayed the yakuza leader and he could prevented all this drama and killing with tatsumi the dragon fujinami being in this game i have a feeling he might not be in wwe 2k19 like he was in the last three wwe games 1 if they dub it in english instead of sub whats up with the dragon engine do u have just different combos instead of different styles bcuz that wud b shit every title from japan to amaricans lets mispell everything the nuke hit the wrong target l game sounds incredible i must have it now i love these type of games pre ordered cant wait whats sup gamingbolt i already preordered the game when the demo dropped lol i am 100 behind sega on localizing the entire series plus the samurai one played yakuza 0 loved it then played kiwami loved it too cant wait for this one the yakuza series is a very underappreciated series im already pre order this game o dont really need to know anything lol just buy it yakuza games are always a buy for me another nice video personally dont mind the cut content and it has a better balance than kiwami damn bro i thought this had more views ill toss you a sub good video dont quit btw i like your review better than ign and gamespot you know the game so well one thing that i dont like about the dragon engine it doesnt have temporal anti aliasingtemporal anti aliasing is the best way to remove jaggies on this current generation console it is proven and tested especially on a high end console on ps4 pro and xbox one x it is also not expensive to implement and it is not demanding on hardware rdr2 has a agrresive temporal anti aliasing the results 93 aliasing free on base console on ps4 pro and xbox one x 99 to none aliasing hzd days gone aliasing freere2 remake also use temporal anti aliasing but the end result is is also good 86 aliasing free the dragon engine doest use temporal anti aliasing they use there own in engine anti aliasing the results is badalmost everywhere has jaggies edges to be honest i like yakuza kiwami 2 than yakuza 6 yakuza 2 kiwami is best played on ps4 pro better anti aliasing better texture and better ambian occlusion i bought yakuza kiwami 2 for pc yesterday and cant wait to try it my problem with both kiwami games is that they just take other games in the series and do paint job kiwami 1 is yakuza 0 kiwami 2 is yakuza 6 down with the combat engine and graphics i wouldnt call them proper remakes but more if a expansions for other games as call back i was more hopefull they will take the mechanics of yakuza 2 and expand on it and add more crazy moves to the combat and heat finishers like but more originality but thats not the case dont get me wrong theyre still fun games but personally i rather play with originals even if yakuza 1 didnt age well quick update worth mentioning to anyone who stops by yakuza 2s shinseicho location the one with all the shogi quests has been completely removed in kiwami 2 all the events that take place there now take place in sotenbori pretty bold to leave a whole city on the cutting room floor bums me out for sure kazuma has to be my all time favorite video game character hes such an honorable person in these games is the beer making him run like that police running from police is what i dont getkawara and date working undercoveri understand the cop from osaka has no jurisdiction being there but those 2 ossans action is confusing me that battle in the clinic sure beat the alcohol out of kiryu must be fun a normal yakuza wouldve butchered the barkeep kazuma aint a normal yakuza though overly forgiving dude ayyyy jim beam product placements going all out in this one ever thought about increasing health u have more than enoughexp at this point to get to the next level love your gameplay sub holy damn granny white got the moves if someone ask me whos one of the most badass female in vidya id say granny white tho kiryu and kaoru do actually make a incredible couple i kinda wished she waited for him after yakuza 6 can we make a movie out of these cut scenes so why they dropped this into the sea after yakuza 2 and went with lone wolf storyline 5903 oh look at that i love how she just gets naked in front of him like its no big deal if the bomb was real harukas last few moments of uncle kaz is him making out with kaoru you made it so great to watch even some story battles were included im really into it when i found out she wouldnt be on more games it broke my heart please bring her back sega i like to imagine that after the end of yakuza 6 kiryu found kaoru and enjoyed a quiet life with her lmao theyre making out while their ass is about to be blown up so cheesy you know yakuza is such an underated series and the fact that people barely mention the main characters and their emotions that might be one of the biggest wrongdoings of the industry 4400 kiryu showing his true power haruka is the best wingman 1202 you know what you came here for i gotcha covered what is the name of the soundtrack that plays at 1233 damn i cant believe they didnt use crazy ken bands december kuroi kizuato no blues for the pivotal moments just got the game today cant wait to get stuck in d datesan should have been like stop kissing goddammit and get your asses outta there this is quality anime in 3d basically this whole game is fuckin anime 10052 holy shit black screen the rooftop conversation had me heart broken i know kiryu has to be cold but still mannn thank goodness she did the cutest thing ever with the bear kiryu telling her ma hes the opposite of a police since when hes like the whitest knight of the yakuza world 3303 that son how i in love whit your mother takes robe off robe is back on a few seconds after it made me sad when i finished the remastered version a good sad though i hated the part where ryuji died so sad is this really necessary when both of you are doing that while the bombs are almost counting down to 0 10554 the piano background sound remind me of majima and makoto during the epilogue xd better than twilight i want this game on pc justice for kaoru lol bring kaoru back in the yakuza series damn she can be a good asset on kiryus story and a girlfriend i hope they didnt add the new main character there going to put on yakuza 7 but they should continue kiryus story on 7 like how he leave the orphanage to look for kaoru and at the same time kaoru is in the pinch and at the ending kiryu went back to the orphange with kaoru would be a perfect ending for kiryus story cause kiryu face alot of troubles so he deserve atlease a taste of good memories cause in all the yakuza game he have alot of friends that died so i have a feeling that he really deserves it if you guys know what i mean damn this story cutscenes is better than some movies out there wish they could include kaoru in judge eyes since its a detective version of yakuza anyone got the name of the track that plays in the background at 12034 that piano during the laptop video playback is amazing quality romance kiruys one and only love and a strong woman i wanna know what the song is at 10932 better relationship than majima had in 0 dont me how long did you take to finish this game is this even out yet total clickbait cause the only thing you get is this back shot httpsyoutubewjdqfu6srput12m2s and the rest is nothing worth watching obatarian shows up at table kawaii ne so glad majima replaces that bowl cut douche damn they have engrish 021 aw he is adorable okay question i recently started new game plus and i heard that the story for the cabaret club resets but your hostesses stay at the same level i just started cabaret club grand prix and havent done the fresh league championship match yet because i only have three girls but the scouting option isnt available i seem to recall on my first playthrough that the scouting was unlocked at the very beginning is there something different i have to do on new game plus aye that fever attackfuckkkk moon club attack wait so we cant play with kiryu as a hostess like in the past games i enjoyed that so much talking with customers and making them fall for him was priceless this final match is so hard wtf lol first hostess looks like kirara asuka if you know her xd that 90s techno mix tho im confused how is majima the announcer etusko is still an mvp in the cabaret club industry like she was in 0 lol came for the main game stayed for the mini games majimas color commentary is hilarious in the ccgp finals expected nonetheless from majimaaniki yuki is like kiryu an ageless wonder a 18 year old bottle of yamazaki im glad that the cabaret club is back im sad that they replaced the classy saxophone music kiwami 2 coming to pc next month shit i cant wait by the way devileon does this game have the marietta and adam club sidemission god i miss these both side missions back in ps2 era i love this mini game but the only thing that pisses me off about yakuza kiwami 2 is you cant go to a hostess club as a customer like you could in the past games i miss that lol obatarian is back my fave hostess why do i get the feeling that some of these hostesses are portrayals of jav stars wait the obatarian is back im waiting for the seventh part to see if sega will give kiryu a fair enough ending i can see why the mini games in this yakuza game are soo cooool 20 years later and yukichan is as pretty as ever how does she do it tbhi have ditched the main storyline just to finish the cabaret storyline and majima construction xd i have loved every second of getting to know all the platinum hostesses aika shocko kana and koyuki are such sweethearts still havent talked to yua or kirara yet wait so what are cabaret clubs exactly im still trying to understand the details too bad goromi wasnt a hostess i was so looking forward to that as someone who is playing 0 as my first yakuza game and is only on chapter 7 wtf majima and i really do need to check out that cabaret club suh a stupid minigame but i loved it i dont know why but is very addictive 21 seconds in and im already like i want this game now majima looks so adorable haha yuki aged like a fine wine hwat aika is in this game loved the minigame but kinda disappointed to see that majima is only doing a commentary it would be nice to see the real lord of the night i was all i miss yuki from 0 then i was all nani thats not judge eyes could we get a guide of the minigame now even this minigame had kiryuchan from majima on the commentary which makes the game even more fun sorry sayama you better be a hostess at four shine and even better with a platinum so i wont leave you at kamurocho and get datesan to be with you 20 years later and etsukos still wearing that same shirt i think at this point shes just doing it to bother me hey devil unsure if this is the proper place to ask this but do you like the original y2 more or do you tend towards yk2 i know this is a hot button with the fanbase but im actually mulling it over myself as to which the better game is its a photo finish to me this songs a real bagner nice to see etsuko be back in the cabaret club battle i wonder why there are no strip club in japan umwhy are all your girls maids i mean im not opposed to it but why wait isnt sotenbori sunshine the cabaret club majima runs in 0 is kiryu battling against that club in 2 i wish there was full list of osts cuz i like this music the soul of lord of the night continues to live on how to get majima as the comentator or its just not the time for me yet i think i could die happy if only i get the privilege to see kiryu and all the protagonist dress in a maid outfit leonchan can you show us how to spell the word ass with the hostess outfits s stats majimas live commentary makes this minigame a lot more entertaining gym outfits maid outfits please tell me im not the only who is familiar with kirara awww shit obasan is back leon you got any tips for this final battle i actually loved this cabaret more then 0and i dont know why lol does devilchan have a maid fetish love the cabaret music and majimas back too normally its my job but ok lol all of them in maid dresses yuki about to beat majimas ass for being the commentator instead of helping out the club lmao i was so glad when i realized that the cabaret club gameplay from zero returned cause that is my favorite minigame in the entire series it has so much substance and talking with the hostesses is always a blast all i want to the big watermelon uh i know milk right and here sotaro komaki sure teach shirrako to not use his signature dropkick move more often you skipped so much 2610 lol yuya was right there ive definitely been enjoying these thanks for the upload seem like youre short on money i recommend that you find some cash to return to osaka and make a fortune through the host club mini game finally covering the side quests hey can you do that ghost side quest after the story part is finished also is it just me or does kiryu look a bit beefier please keep them coming much love that old womans got quite the mouth on her i just come from time to time to hear my fav reviewer on random games always the best probably 10x better than average joe i mean angry joe im playing this now and still have watched this review like three times love your reviews dragon engine should utilize temporal anti aliasing it is very effective to eliminate jaggies on this current gen generation especially on ps4 pro temporal anti aliasing is not expensive to implement and it is not very demanding on hardware i really dont know why sega dont want to use temporal anti aliasing red dead redemption 2 is using very aggressive temporal anti aliasing the result is almost zero aliasing especially on ps4 pro im not a developer but the only solution to remove the jaggies aliasing is the temporal anti aliasing it is already proven and tested on consolestarting at ps2 era up to the current generation on ps4 they dont know how to fix the jaggies jaggies free game will help to increase sales i like yakuza 6 better kiryu doesnt need weapons hes the dragon of dojima his fist are the only weapons he needs no english dub can replace the kiryuchan shit i want to hear everytime i play this game the thing about english dub is that they need to make it right if they even bring dub to the main series and not just the spin off called judgement judge eyes ofc if they do make a dub i hope they do give the option to choose between english and japanese voiced because if people are forced into english then it wont end well english in ps2 only watching this cause yakuza 2 is coming on real platform 60 fps boi english dub would be legendary i think we need the full series on pc english dub lmaoblasphemy so much stuff doesnt translate from japanese culture to english aight bois we got kiwami 2 on pc just been confirmed for pc d best reviewer on youtube when i had the money for this i immediately preordered it this and yakuza 6 are the only two yakuza games that takes advantage of using ps4 hardwared fuck duded fuck im gonna buy it just for the physics is there any chance for you to do that walk in a walk for this game or its forgotten now i goddamn love this game series but i must say they really try to outdo themselves in all regards even the creepy peeping minigames the photoshoots in this were even worse than the videotapes you could watch in 0 like hotdamn one would think a 37 year old kiryu was a bit more mellowed out but nope he is horndog surpreme whats the order should i play yakuza 0 kiwami kiwami 2 the song of life so i will get 60 bucks in a couple of days should i get it i have 0 and kiwami and im enjoying it sooo much but my guts tell me to wait for a another great game to go on sale again eg spiderman detroit etc im so confused kiwami 1 was free on psn i finally got into it i couldnt stop playing until the end now i want kiwami 2 and ill play 0 and 6 after can anyone possibly tell me what the combat functions are like does it compare to tekken for instance or is it just one of those game which just have a single kick and a punch button and the game itself makes it more variable its not controllable by us please never add an english dub i love the japanese voices it adds to the immersion so how is sleeping dogs not better than this this game was amazing i love all the yakuza games and i cant wait for them to remaster 5 on ps4 that game was the best one in my opinion its 35 on psn right now yakooza it irritated me every time you said it why do people care about graphics so much i like that you are not an angry reviewer there is no cynicism to be found in your content plays like yakuza 0 which is a great thingyakuza 6 fight engine stinks after 0 and 1 the constant running around back and forth to see kiryu beat up another bad guy to prevent said bad guy from killing ppl followed by forgetting about that murderous bad guy entirely as soon as he falls down which seems to always end up with the bad guy taking his time to grab a weapon and murdering them anyway currently somewhere halfway or near the end of kiwami 2 can someone tell me if this continues all the way to 6 because at this point as soon as kiryu has to protect someone im just assuming hes going to be a dumbfuck about it so theyll get killed either way and im getting kinda bored with it will he remain a dumbfuck till the end or does he at some point figure out how to tie people up atleast am i missing something and is this done on purpose to be funny or something im thinking about buyong it but im afraid the free roam world will be really tiny anyone know what game t compare its mapscale to one of the things that made yakuza series amazing is because theres no english dub it wouldnt be genuine and original anymore thats rad is it coming to pc yakuza 0 was excellent i cannot stress how brilliant these games are i was an xbox gamer since the first console and only got my first ever sony console back in 2017 jan so for me youre talking uncharted 1 the lot everything was new as i had never ever had a playstation i always avoided yakuza as it just didnt appeal to me then kiwami come out and i thought id check it out since that moment i have done kiwami kiwami 2 0 and 6 gonna do 45 on psnow after probably one of the best gaming franchises i have ever played and im in my 30s i cant actually grasp in my head that goro majima isnt a real person like he isnt really alive this is the first game in my life where i feel a real attachment as they feel like they aint just made up its hard to explain for those that have played this you know that one scene when certain somebodies turn up in town and majima is just standing there and charges that gave me god damn goosebumps he is like the best anti hero of all games anyway no english dub perfect we dont need that bullshit i plan on picking this game up right around black friday because for me in the games that im buying this month im pretty stacked was good games spiderman shadow of the tomb raider valkyrie chronicles for the end of the month i still prefer the combat system of 0 than this one it made kiryumajima feel like a legendary brawler that they are the new combat system however feels slowed down especially in early game 30 hours in and this game is fantastic if you care at all about storytelling and characters go and play yakuza 0 first then kiwami then kiwami 2 3 4 5 and then 6 youll appreciate everything way more than if you just jump in randomly this is an amazing series thatll take you on quite the wild ride i havent regretted a single second in any of the games except maybe the one spin off we got in the west lol it had a lot of cool story and character moments but the gameplay was pretty meh hey acg your awesome its a simple buy but for me having played almost all yakuza series the one cringy thing for me is how easy kiryu stumbles into other pedestrians paths even when he walks very slowlyor when he has to walk accompanied by someone else look how easy he unintentionally hit people especially when he walks with the little haruka httpsdocsgooglecomformsd1d0ogm3htjbdimjamnwyv4183888bxj4gtjuk5cguviewformeditrequestedtrue if you want more yakuza games to be brought out in the west please fill out the official sega yakuza survey and spread the word is the gameplay different this is an honest question whats the problem with english dubs when 99 of the time its optional i personally prefer dubs most of the time but if it doesnt work for me i have no problem switching to subs i appreciate them both but the way people say dubs would ruin the game seems ridiculous to me every tom dick and harry in this game wants to fight me and sure thats a staple of these games but after like the fourth fight where i walk in to make human paste of 7 gang members 3 with guns 2 withs swords and 2 others with tasers and all i haveis a frickin safety cone youd think they would send out a fuckin statewide emergency alert warning dude dressed in white business suit is apparently not to be fucked with stand aside but they dont once i start with yakuza 0 is yakuza 2 next or whats the order should i play the 3 games in on ps4 if you havent played shenmue and you love yakuza drop what youre doing and for the love of god pick up shenmue 1 and 2 remastered shenmue started it all with the open world and sega mini games you can play that game was waaaaaaay ahead of its time and is truly a masterpiece please people glad to see yakuza getting some more recognition on your channel i was a bit worried after yakuza 6 as the new engine felt inferior to the 0 engine in almost every way but thankfully theyve smoothed it out a bit for kiwami 2 id still take the 0 engine all day every day but the dragon engine feels much better this go round added to the very best story and very best villain of the franchise i cant wait to keep digging in glad people who missed 2 the first go round get to experience its greatness in an even better form im trying to finish yakuza kiwami as fast as possible i need to play this game im playing this on a ps4 pro and the frame rate is unbearable the cutscenes are great but when gameplay starts its barely 30fps ive played yakuza 0 and kiwami on the same ps4 pro and screen but the framerate on those two was much better ive searched online and its not a common problem i tried turning off supersampling as well any help would be great also the trailers and gamplay i watch on youtube using the same screen look much smoother than what i see when i play having played all the recent yakuza games this is looking to be a great addition to my growing collection anyone who is unsure of these games throw away your auspicions and buy it you will have no regrets not buying because sega fooled me with yakuza 0 and its only on playstation i love the japanese voice acting and comedy in these games this was already an immediate buy along with 6 for me sega should release this game on pc i would definitely buy this just finished yakuza 0 it was awesome cant wait to ad this to my collection do they give you lots of points to spend on upgrading abilities like in kiwami 1 i think adding the minimap is a mistake sure its less hassle when youre looking for a specific place but kamurochos charm is all about memorizing the map and all its shops as it stays the same throughout all the games even if this game had dub i would still play sub only the first yakuza on the ps2 had a dub a dub with this writing would sound ridiculous imo i think were all better off the way it is now these games should at least be almost as popular as gta imo theyre extremely underrated i hate that i passed on them for so long mmmh i dont know the money grind in zero bored me a lot i want this especially bc of that awesome steelbook but i just cant find any time for me to play this currently finishing we happy few by the time i finish that spider man will be out im soooo disappointed life of a night shift 24 yr old father yeah they rework old game and improve the graphic long time ago i finished 1st and 2nd ones twice each still remember how to play and story but how sega take care of this series make me dont want to play it finished the 6th one never can find time to finished 5th one may get them on collection or 2nd hand 4th one was my fav 2nd one also good never played yakuza before picked up yakuza 0 a few days ago ive already sunk 40 hours into it its so good will defiantly be getting kiwani 1then this straight after its so good id buy it twice yakuza has quickly become my number 2 favorite series of all time only behind persona as long as i can play as the mad dog of shimano 30fps nooo karak how do you not have more views i dont get it your content is great i hope i can reach your levels on my channel one soon if you have any tips for me please tell me learn from those who do better how many yakuza games come out every year was kinda disappointed and bored by yakuza 6 yakuza 0 was goty material yakuza kiwami was pretty neat but started to bore down and 6 is just a step back for me personally day1 for me sega just take my money 600 i just love how ridiculous the combat is in these games english dub in tokyo and osaka way to ruin a game peace out such a meaningless and worn out phrase i pefer the subs over the dubs they are some japanese games have excellent english dub like nier automata kingdom hearts and most the final fantasy games however a game like this where its centred in japan i think japanese probably works best tbh only question ive got for the game is did they keep the battle music when youre in osaka or did they change itupdate it im glad theres no dub i love the original japanese voices i cant wait to buy it im a huge fan of the series yakuza games are purely japanese voice for the immersion alone english dub ruins that i mean go look up the ps2 yakuza game with english dub and watch how many fbombs are dropped like wannabe gangsters from new york acg u should re review sleeping dogs remastered this looks identical to yakuza 0 you said it runs at 30fpd and drops frames in some bits did you play on a pro or regular ps4 jfc these remakes are coming out so quickly hi how is the cabaret club compared to yakuza 0 that was my favourite minigame and i hope its just as fleshed out if not deeper seriously 30 fps even on ps4 pro why i just got into the series zero was great and i cant wait to play the others in the series as for no english dubs fine by me but then again i like foreign films especially japanese if its that big of a problem that people wont play it then maybe these games just arent for them if you start playing yakuza and you like this yakuza engine more than the old one i would start with yakuza 6 i personally started with yakuza 0 which i really liked than yakuza 6 which i fucking loved but then i played yakuza kiwami and i didnt really like it if you want to stay hooked and motivated to finish all games start with yakuza kiwami first this spidey ps4 and red dead redemption 2 my wallet hurts already actually being in japanese only is its charm to many the english dub of yakuza 1 is okish but after that people started loving the japanese version with subtitles mostly for immersion and the feeling of what they are saying that only the native tongue can portray first day purchase epic review please clone yourself for future generation of gamers after finishing 0 on pc i really want sega to port all the other games to pc 0 was the game i enjoy the most in years the correct answer is to preorder it and play it till the next one comes out sleeping dogs copy nothing special if the yakuza series had english dub and were available on pc i would buy all of them instantly its a huge untapped market pc gamers and also english dub that the series producers might be interested in for a new surge of sales i dont understand why they refuse it sega please bring this to pc yakuza 0 is my goty on steam better than y6 and as beautiful as y6 kiwami looked dreadful and ive been playing the series since western day 1 other than everyone calling a 44 year aged guy old man every two minutes y6 is one of the best in the series and i adored zero karack why didnt you pick up the shenmue hd 1 and 2 remaster and do a review on that i was kind of expecting you to the voice acting is excellent i dont understand a word of japanese yet the emotion and intensity still come through id never touch an english dub hey bro no english no thanks i might make a homebrew adventures for dd with yakuza ideas d ill happily wait for the pc release this and fire pro on the same day and dragon quest 11 the week after i just got shenmue yesterday slow down video games i still gotta work and socialize does kiwani 2 support ps pro im a huge yakuza fan but i never got to play 2 im so glad to see the remake was well received by you definitely going to pick it up nothing new here whats the next pc game to release from the yakuza series and when i reckon these games would be weird with a dub this is the only yakuza game i never got a chance to complete so im happy i get a 2nd chance english dub would just ruin the game thanks for the review i preordered this and cant wait to play it i cant wait for the fist of the north star game they created too this game really needs to come to pc im having a blast playing yakuza 0 at 144 fps dubs are trash so i am happy this game is in japanese every movie or game should be in the original language period we all can read subtitles right this game is a definite buy for me but im still going to watch anyways to support the cause karak thanks for the review is there any difference in graphics between regular ps4 and pro version is there any xbox fanboys or pc fanboys want to complain this game im waiting been playing the yakuza series for years its great that the series is finally getting the love in the west it deserves i prefer the subtitles i tend to have them on for most games anyway great review how many of these games are there feels like they release about 3 a year i wish they would make kiwami 3 since straight ps3 port with higher resolution looks like ass on ps4pc your content is ridiculously well written and delivered really hey karak quick question are you reviewing death gambit and thanks for everything man i mean it having studied shotokan karate for over 2 years the fights show no martial content whatsoever l cant see anything japanese in the fight sorry buzz more of a nightclub bouncer just not feeling it at all the settings are wonderful reminiscent of a good blade runner game fights look very tacky and made up great video as always why the hell is there a new yakuza game every 4 months i really enjoyed this favourite side mission is with an old lady wearing a gym track suit so funny dang wish i had a ps4 to play this thanks for the review either way i gave a thumbs up 488k subscribers i see youre getting fame congrats got yakuza 0 waiting for kiwami pc to start pre orders really hoping kiwami 2 comes out for pc any info on this shenmue 6 basically if it had gangsta dlc great review ill cross my fingers and hope it comes to pc in a few years ps4 or ps4 pro thanks for your review friend ive been waiting for this review as a huge fan of the yakuza games and a fan of yours thanks for doing this man appreciate the review will you do mhg ultimate next week the more and more i watch these games the more i want to get them on steam i wished that i had gotten into the yakuza series a long time ago i just recently finished yakuza 6 the song of life and the game was amazing the characters story setting combat visuals voice acting and mini games are all well done having said that i really look forward to playing yakuza kiwami which i just ordered from amazon i also plan on ordering yakuza 0 and yakuza kiwami 2 not too far down the road yakuza is one of the most underrated games out there kazuma kiryu is one of the most underappreciated characters in gaming with that aside thanks karak for another stellar review i really appreciate it not gonna lie this is my most anticipated game of this year yakuza 0 was my personal goty of 2017 thanks for the review karak its gonna be a long wait for me until they port this to pc they gotta release kiwami 1 first so hopefully next year big yakuza fan i dont want english dubbing would ruin the immersion its fine as it is already preordered the hell out of this game but what i want to know karak is how are you able to upload a review 5 days before release just curious ill buy it cheap i need to plat the 01 and 6 looks good maybe like a japanese mafia 2 anyway only n the ps4 so thats a no go id have to say my main complaint for this and yakuza 6 is the lack of a ps4 pro patch maybe a higher resolution would at least help cut down on the ridiculous amount of aliasing present in the games if this is going to be the same as yakuza 6 ill probably just wait for a pc release as the aliasing is fairly distracting in yakuza 6 in my opinion bring this to xbox please shenmue says hi took me 130 hours to get platinum on kiwami 1 currently working on yakuza 0 yakuza 0 on pc sold me on the series cant wait for the other games to make it over i hope the remasters of 3 5 comes soon to the west i dont wanna play 6 until i play everything before it when is this coming to pc ive got 50hrs in yakuza 0 and im having a blast hope they bring all the yakuza games to pc side question if you are playing the arcade of vf2 can you switch to an actual arcade stick instead of the joypad vf2 was one of my first 3d games i played in an arcade and is dear to my heart too bad that sega does not publish the vf games on a disc on ps4 separately i dont know why an english dub is so important after the original ps2 yakuza game and the english dub of shenmue im totally fine with the japanese voice with english subtitles if its about reading dialogue well zelda has is too so theres no excuse why it should matter just my opinion i love that you review such a wide variety of games especially this fantastic series great review as always yakuza series and by extension the new hokuto no ken are the only games that get a preorder from me though its still nice to see that it got a hard definite buy mr shakehands man tribute a segment from a tv show called banzai aired in the uk which parodied japanese gameshow and gambling culture i am currently playing yakuza 0 on pc and i love it will this one be coming to pc eventually does anyone know is it remastered or remade id buy it if i liked brawlers but i really dont the last one i liked was arkham city i preordered on amazon 3735 steel book edition delivered on launch day its a steal thanks for the review just started playing yakuza 0 really enjoying it just received my copy really excited about it love the yakuza games yakuza is such a underrated series here in the west was so glad karak to see you review this game in your usual in depth fashion hopefully more an more gamers who want to play a open world style game and do not mind the eastern setting and in some cases prefer it go pick this up and play its original games too thank you for all the time these reviews take god bless ragdoll physics i really want to play this series completely new to it should i start with kiwami 1 or go right into 0 or 6 been playing so much yakuza 0 on pc looking forward to kiwami and im hoping that we get kiwami 2 on pc at some point this game series seems to be so fucking addictive with its variety of content so much fun all redey preorderd online i love this franchise cant wait to beat up peapol if you buy exclusive games youre harming yourself boycott is the only solution they ported 0 to pc and kiwami 1 is about to be im hoping theyll port kiwami 2 and then either the ps3 versions of 34 and 5 or maybe do a kiwami 3 4 and 5 is beautiful season in kamurocho song in karaoke list it does have its share of problems yes it is 30fps dude its an open world title on a console what did you expect and how is this a problem framerate looks a lot lower than 30 in this video if i havent played a yakuza game before is this still worth trying thanks your integrity humour and competence are always so refreshing easily the best game review journalist around imo thanks again great review i cant wait for this game to drop your channel really grows well subbed from 235k nice one karak keep it up bought cant wait for fist of the north star while i wait for kiwami 3 ill get this later this year maybe black friday since weve got spiderman red dead redemption 2 and shadow of tomb raider coming you once again have me wanting to buy a game ive decided to relive my youth and downloaded yzero im enjoying it but the thought of continuing the series has me salivating has there been any announcement for us pc players i dont mind waiting waiting forever tho thanks isnt it just the same as the other games just with different story the main loop was pretty repetitive last time i think you nitpick this one more then usual also english dub would not bring the same level od depth so just forget about it do you recommend a noob to the series start with this or should i go with yakuza 0 first damn great review id never be able to enjoy a game and review it at the same time id burn out on games quickly even then am not as interested in gaming much these days a screenshot of 842 is all you need to introduce someone to the yakuza series will you just release virtua figher 2 4 and 5 final round on steam already im so salty i miss my akira ahhh the mission awesome review waiting for my steelbook to arrive the game is nice i have played and beat the japanese version and im going to buy this for sure already have steelbook edition great game in these times when games are getting repetitive except some exceptions yakuza series emerged my favorite series i will buy yakuza 6 after i finish yakuza kiwami 2 oh shit its out i only just finished 0 and havent even started kiwami awesome review karak this is definitely being added to my collection is it weird i want to see kazuma fight batman i hope they improve the rts element of the game cause i like the idea going to wait pc version when 2 first game already are coming too this is the kind of fun missing from so many modern games nice to see something that looks worth playing good review thanks karak another solid review for another solid yakuza installment there is a plot reason for why random people mess with you in one of the spin offs its mentioned that its a hazing ritual to get new gang members to fight a guy in grey suit with a red shirt great review again cant wait for tuesday solid game better than other triple a games english dub in the yakuza game come on karak that would kill the whole atmosphere which is one of the best things in this franchise after i played at 0 1 i saw that there was a preorder for the second game i just bought the fact that there is no dubbing to english many people will see it as something positive it puts you more into the air of the game great review waiting for my preorder it actually struck me recently this is the third yakuza game in 2 years surreal when you think about how slowunsure the releases in the west used to be and how theyve been spaced out well enough to not make me feel burned out on playing so many of them in such a short time good review really looking forward to seeing how it stacks next to the original 2s always been the one with the best story with 0 being the only one to get up there again have been looking forward to this game since it was announced the best main story in any yakuza title remade with a hopefully fixed combat system from 6 the hype is real it looks and plays too much like six ill eventually wait for the pc port 1313 its not a remaster its a remake man i never finished the original but im far along and i already farmed the platinum plates to make bank so im loathe to start all over still buying it though how different are shenmue and yakuza havent played any of the 2 franchises ill wait for the pc port to get that 60 fps goodness i hope this holds my attention until dqxi yes im getting the steelbook on tuesday a walking the walk will be pretty interesting on this one got the game on preorder cant wait actually took some pto to savor it was your footage from the base ps4 or the pro where you note the fps hitches and aa issues this is a day one buy getting the physical copy as well this spiderman and red dead are the games ive been waiting all year for acg is spoiling us today preordered the steelbook editon i cant wait to play it on tuesday awesome review this is a game that would look good with ray tracing story embargoeson a 10 year old remake come on japan get your shit together tell me bout this shenmu 12 bro buy this to support the franchise if you own an exclusivestation 4 oh shit i need to finish yakuza 0 on pc love your reviews would love to see the part of the review where you are at any time sometimes i do not have much time so i try to skip the audio part of the review but its really difficult to do it because there isnt any indicator what part you are reviewing ill be waiting for the pc release so excited for this remake thanks for the review karak will be buying asap it just feels wrong to have an english dub when the cast is japanese and it takes place in japan mark hamill did play an excellent majima in yakuza 1 though the yakuza franchise is huge which game should a total noob begin with another solid review karak will pick this up definitely down the line thanks a ton i want to start playing all the yakuza games but i am afraid i will be lost storywise is there a specific order i have to play the ps4 released games karak awesome review as always do you plan to review octopath traveler just paid my pre order up roll on tuesday big fan of the series great review i still have to wait for kiwami 1 questionable search on pornhub is there another kind of search yakuza 2 has the best villain in the series man i still have kiwami to finish and kiwami 2 is almost outthen again i recently got yakuza 6 so that has been taking up most of my time i just hope that yakuza 35 get re released in like a compilation or something though i see they are using the same leveling up and exp system as they did for yakuza 6 franklyi didnt like it i much preferred the original system but its not going to stop me from buying the game this is a steal at 40 and you even get it in a gorgeous steel case ordering it right now its go time for the fall baby a game that is great but does have a couple technical issues share it if you can what games are you looking forward to next always feel free to support acg at httpswwwpatreoncomangrycentaurgaming all support helps and you can get cool swag i already bought the game but i love watching the reviews anyway another yakuza review by acg happy fan love your reviews man i interrupted another one of your reviews to watch this one as it popped up haha if i want to start with the yakuza frenchise should i start with yakuza 0 this mini gamebusiness was already fantastic in y0 i am so glad that it makes a return im so glad they brought this back sega knew the cabaret club was a fan favorite from yakuza 0 and the song gives me a boner when i dress up my girls i have the infinity bandana on mgs1 my button mashing is on point this minigame is so addictive this was pretty difficult in the beginning but once you learn the hand signals the trouble signals best accompanying customer moods and giving them what they want and learn when and when not to usewaste the fever meter its a walk in the park fell in love with the storyline and the characters as well one thing i learned a little too late was not to rush through the story and go into championships without max levels found out the hard way when i went into the millionare league and got bodied gotta take your time and do gigs to level up your best girls in order to gain the most out of it getting marilynn ii headmistress yokiku to max or decent levels to get that escort perk the ability to have them start with a requesting customer at their table then later getting yua yuki kirara with the escort perk aswell is op but having those first three chicks maxed is an easy way to win every championship you come across overall i thought the cabaret grand prix was just s missed opportunity if majima isnt the last cabaret boss requests were already in y0 you just didnt get them until you get to the last two cabaret clubs in the five star storyline nevertheless thank you for this i am so excited to play oh god i just hope those request customers dont always want the same 12 girls they ask for as then it would get very annoying trying to relocate girls if you had sat one down at a table already edit still as long as the core gameplay for the mini game is the same i will love it as it has been my favorite mini game out of the yakuzas ive played the cabaret club ost was better in yakuza 0 though comes a little late but im in the first league and i have to reach the number 1 right but how the fuck should i reach 1800000 the best one was 500000 without any mistakes o what did i do wrong im glad they buffed the amount of money you got from cabaret club compared to 0 but i just wish they did abit more to make it just abit more unique from 0s version maybe they could taken some ideas from the marietta from the original y2 and have you decorate the club itself from its wallpaper floor the chairs even the potted plant in a corner and maybe each design can give you a different bonus like needing less button presses to please the pimp at the end or attracting a certain kind of customer more often this is my favourite part in yk2 as it was in 0 d the letter grading is much easier to follow what is the song that plays when you customize your girls cant find it anywhere how do you obtain the other hostess cuz it wont let me scout anymore i would buy this as an standalone game where can i find that club again it is not shown on the map hey great vid just a quick question once i leave sotenbori with kiryu at the beginning and go to kamurocho is it possible to be able to play the cabaret club minigame again i streamed all of yakuza 0 and my viewers kept asking me to go to the cabaret club even after i beat the game if the cabaret club is back and there is someone who help kiryu getting the ladies to join the cabaret club employment like majima way back take a good guess d whats with the 5050 like to dislike ratio the video was well made imo just a questioncan i make conversationsspecial training with the platinum hostesses to train them higher levels just like in yakuza 0 and is it possible to date with them karaoke example wait i can play dress up with hostesses that might be fun i like when characters have different outfits man i was done with yakuza 0 a few weeks ago but your video is making me to go back into it xd hope to see a livestream of the game whenever you can well having this mode in kiwami 2 is already an amazing upgrade as is really am looking forward to this very nice they used the dragon engine for this am i the only one who is waiting silently for yakuza kiwami 3 this is the best game everr now thats call remaster please make a city hunter game with team yakuza series it will be cool plz sony next on steam please this game is so autistc why is it in my recommended now i thought it was a new trailer goro majima is one crazy son of a gun i need to buy this game combat system isnt the same as 0 or kiwami 1 thats rad bring kiwami 3 english subbed just finished yakuza 0 on pc now im debating if is should wait for yakuza kiwami and yakuza kiwami 2 to come to pc or should i just get it on ps4 the kicks a tiger in the face im sold a majima solo game would be ace what is the name of this music did that man just drop kick a siberian tiger 108 thats street fighter power level o pc is starting to not feel so master race this better come out on pc playing yakuza 6 right now and am disappointed theres no ufo catchers about time it was only available in japan for a while and couldnt order it fair and square brings knife the dragon roars ok you show us haruka as an attractive female but we are only allowed to play kiryu and majima in my opinion it would have been way better playing a young haruka kiwami she was 9 so 16 to 19 would do it kiryu would have then been 4447 yo and rly more minigames we have to play to get all the skills that was sth i hated in kiwami so i am dissapointed now you know whats with this yakuza 2 and shenmue i gotta say i am celebrateing christmas this year in august because i dont get much christmas presents this year in december 25th i remember when i played the original yakuza 2 and fought a tiger i said to myself this is the greatest game of all time i am the dragon of dojima yay is the mad dog of shimano man next month is gonna be lit ok now i have to buy this and 3 shenmue hds in august lol just started yakuza 0 this is something i missed out on i still have my ps2 and wanted to try yakuza but never got around to it this series is fun and amazing nice filter in the thumbnail cant wait to play the side mission be my baby in this remake lets be honest we all want to buy it so we can play that mission in which you have to fight with the adults dressed like babys so this a remaster of yakuza 2 the boys are back for more trouble d majima campaign only 3 chapters and can be done in 3 hours is there a high quality coal and chicken manager im sad that yakuza doesnt have the fame it deserves in france because the serie is not traducted he has to fist fight a lion is there any yakuza game for pc when real estate wrestlers attack never thought id see those words in one sentence cant wait to play this on pc in 10 years when it ill be released cant wait to play this on pc in 10 years when it ill be released i miss the early 2000s when real estate wrestlers attack now theres some words i never thought id read i dont think i have to watch this i know im gonna love it already there goes my money for yakuza 6 virtual on is one of the arcades in that game and vf2 awesome shame that yakuza 3 4 and 5 are not kiwami remasters i can wait for this game but i cant wait for this game i love this game series literally just finished kiwami i cant wait this long i need the sequel now lol yes that is all i cant wait for this game kiryuchan love the yakuza series but not a fan of the new fighting system and rag doll physics wow lou2 this rip wackbox someone help me i played yakuza 2 on ps2 so is this game its remaster thanks in advance only problem is time i still have to finish yakuza0 and kiwami each game can take you around 200hours still gonna get kiwami 2 no doubt did he just kick a tiger in the face personally think the japanese pvs are better but still super excited confused fr wasnt there like a part 6 or some majima getting tortured by a foot massage followed by some sort of yakuza contructionzone rts is weird and i want it now oh its makoto makimura so im going to see more of my biggest ship that can never be true yeah im excited alright not crazy majima is a little bit better majima i like how when majima screams the subs also says scream whats the name of the song wait oo was that just someone similar to makoto or was it her oo wait a minute why are the 6 lunatics in this game these guys need to take a break game after game not missin a single year yall need to chill i hope u sell this only in japan and england eye of the tiger also need it on steam waiting for that steam release boi ive been waiting for a long time for this franchise to come to pc being poor af without a shitload of money to blow on a new console every few years this is truly a dream come true thank you sega stupid question but is this a remake or a sequel im assuming remake im so excited that is the true definition of remake not just by adding high resolution and call it a day youre rock sega sega does what others dont the 83 dislikes were made by platinum hunters when more minigames were announced this game needs lot of changes was that virualon yes still playing kiwami right now also get majima his own game already dammit the only one in the series that i played on ps2 annoyed that its not coming to pc love the amount of mini games so much variety in addition to the cut scenes and solid gameplay very happy that this is coming same with one could never olay both thise games due to jot owning a ps 2 anynore can finally finish them all whoa you can play virtua fighter 2 in this game sweet rather get it on pc i looooove yakuza series cant wait for this incredible game looks at hands am i dreaming or am i high or the localization for kiwami 2 is confirmed i would want either the yakuza devs or arc to make a jojo game please i need this i hope the new shenmue has the same combat gameplay as yakuza both sega games afterall one of the only reasons to even buy a ps4 enter the mad dog but will it have a better frame rate than song of life wow amazing graphics o need thid now im new to yakuza seriesbeat 0 and kiwami wont play 6 untill i play 234 and 5 best girl kaoru kinda sad the writers of the game forgot about her anyways the original ps2 game is a prime example of a sequel and how game 1 to game 2 improvements should be done i wanna buy this game this game comes out for my birthday ps4 has got so many games and thats me only counting the exclusives muscle as always wait how did makoto not recognized goros voice so many yakuza games each game is a massive undertaking i cant bring myself to start any more of them the trophies are tough man i can bearly beat the games on normal let alone the hardest difficulty those boss fights are usually where its gets me havent played yakuza 234 and 5 so im very excited for this and for 35 hd collection awesome i cant wait going to replay yakuza 0 and kiwami while i wait such a uniquely diverse and fun gaming experience nobody would buy this ps still wrecking xbox this year huh cabaret club always best thing on yakuza yay yakuza 2 kiwami is coming to the usa how this wasnt featured during the conference is baffling day one as soon as i pressed play i knew the final scene of the trailer would be kiryu punching the tiger xd this game is just pure insanity and i love it bring us yazuza kiwami 3 thats the best in series woah i cant wait cant wait i want to work hard for majima constructions is this a april fools joke in june currently playing through yakuza 6 having a blast finished yakuza 0 last year which was my personal goty and now looking forward to this in a few months hopefully im not feeling yakuza fatigue by then dragon of dojima vs dragon of kansai hyped such a big fan of yukuza series day one kiwami was amazing zero has been intense hope the remasters are released in the us next year let do this fair and square he said while holding a knife the battle ai in yakuza 6 was soooo much better than kiwami i am so glad they are transfering that to kiwami 2 i usually play the games in order but idgaf ill buy this and act like yakuza 6 was never released remastered or remake someone explained that to me noooo the clan creator is back that trophy for 100 battles was the worst in yakuza 6 hopefully its toned down but most likely the full completion list will be needed so rip platinum i aint gonna hold you yal keep releasing these games and i keep not buying em is this a remake or remaster whoa makoto is in this trailer thats rad this game has come to america it koo yo kiryu and majima for virtua fighter 6 as a person who just got into the series im dying to play this everyones talking about the game but hoo boy that steelbook cover in japan the cover of yakuza 2 was goda and kiryu but the us cover of yakuza 2 was just kiryu so now with both its a nice touch august 28 yakuza 6 just came out less than 2 months ago s im at yakuza 0 now where does this one take place after or before me playing yakuza 6 im only going to play this game watches this trailer looks like im going to buy them all everyone needs to play this series dont tell me they too sim out of the game im surprised sony didnt show this at their conference yesterday wait to pc please dont tell me they got rid of the famous tiger drop replacing it with a lame kick is weak bruh i really need to get into this series havent played a single one yet and i dont know where to start cant wait im not a child anymore in this game that once goda ryuji from yakuza 0 memory xd this game is the one that defined this series as my favorite franchise of all time yakuza 2 in my opinion had the best story moments actions and gameplay at least at the time when tge game brought you to osaka in the series its like tekken fighting but free open world nice game was that makoto i need this game i need this please a release also on pc master sega yakuza 2 was one of the best in the series i imported the japanese version of kiwami 2 and will gladly pay full price yet again to support my favorite series of all time yakuza is coming to pc you actually fight a tiger imma tiger drop that fool day one purchase best yakuza game on deckof course its imo lol i am beyond wet im hyped this game is legit fun man kiryu and majima are back once again ohh boi d while i like majima as a character i dont really wanna play as him in this game the original held up fine without having to play as him hopefully hes just optional real estate japanese wrestlers sold i cant wait to get this game i love the yakuza series why could they not show this as well op n the e3 showcase this shouldve been in the conference instead of killing time moving stages i bought this game for virtual fighter releasing not just later one day or two but almost a year most asian yakuza fans have finished this game for a while why wasnt this shown in the sony conference another one already does anyone else want sega and the yakuza team to just straight up make a njpw game pc please 0 and kiwami both are on pc already why you didnt use this trailer on conference sony this better be tekken 7 character announcement too xd now that bethesda has officially raped fallout this is the only game series i care about am extremely exited for this last year i didnt even know what yakuza was and now its taken over my life i just finished yakuza 6 yesterday was an incredible game yakuza kiwami 3 when i rather not have the remasters of 345 best thing yakuza o could ming to pc announced the classic sega arcade games got me sold lol im hype getting this game when it come out or a few week after it come out im gonna buy it i live in russia ill keep it fair and square brings giant knife to fistfight i hope the combat is better than yakuza 6 was not a fan of that this was the only yakuza ive played in my life back on the ps2 hope they all come to pc one day i am excited for yakuza 2 kiwami and the upcoming yakuza 3 5 hd collection fist of the north star is coming as well so hyped did i just see armored core does this game use yakuza 6 engine what great time for rgg studio fans fist of north star kiwami2 and the 345 remasters soon itll be on pc omfg this looks badass af should have shown this at their bad pacing e3 for every one i think you sould play yakuza 0 cos you should know some stories back there how many of these games do they release per year this is like the 4th one this year this is how you remake a game cant wait for the majima national anthem and tiger punching have u guys seen the news this game is coming for pc too why wasnt this in the conference they should release the other 3 in a single package because i wouldnt get 4 5 again i love this franchise yeeessssss mah boi majima is playable again how many yakuza games are they gonna release shout out for all yakuza fans yakuza forever ok sony i get it you blew the competition now its just straight up bullying sony you wasted a lot of time with 2 different stages this should have been on the conference same goes for all the other trailers that was put on youtube please dont be a culprit for killing off e3 imagine this maxed out on pc what is the order to play these games yakuza 2 had the best story in all of yakuza series 3 was worst some previous yakuza games are coming up to pc only on playstation is a lie started yakuza 0 looking very foward to this i will be doing a few of my favourite sub stories as well as some of them are just brilliant i actually paused and kept saying nooo for a good 10 minutes when i saw everyone wearing diapers and then when i found out you have to fight them while theyre wearing diapers that was another 10 minutes is this video monetized what i do i watching substory yakuza always kill it with there substories i could do them all day because some are just too funny this is hands down the scariest mission in any video game ever this substory is the definition of awkward willzyyy after you done with yakuza kiwami 2 all chaptercan you do just cause 4because many people ask that to you many timenot medont just look at me what kind of life is this wtf under 200 views plz heart the definition of a manchild taken seriously first the yakuza game series and the vocaloids hatsune miku kagamine rin kagamine len megurine luka meiko kaito really make me want to go to japan but thats one life experience ill never have because of how expensive it is its a real shame because im a huge fan of japanese culture and its been the place ive mostly wanted to go on holiday but ill never be able to visit japan but i can dream sayonara japan holiday ill keep dreaming hoping it happens eventually anyone know if we are going to get a remaster of 345 here in the uk what headset is that hollie it has great sound from the mic and im looking for a new one thats actually decent also will it work on ps4 or was this through obsxsplit anyone know which headset hollie is using really clear mic comnent section be thirsty yakuza is one of my favorite franchises i love it im worried about the frame drops and jaggies interesting this game has two things i like one fight two special mini games for entertainment i love yakuza minus the escort or whatever those chicks r called missions karaoke story fights majority of the activities r awesome hollie you are a dream goddess keep up the great work getting all remakes and played all yakuza except yakuza 5 cause it was never released in australia but hopefully they remake yakuza dead souls u gothic girl is this 100 ps4 exclusive or not i want to buy only ps4 exclusives and i dont want to be like yakuza 0 kiwami which were relesed on pc cant you just be quiet so we can understand the freakg game wow i didnt know that you played really all yakuzas omg i love you more and i did to and ps3 of course dead souls too xd lel and i make videos with yakuzas because this game is so underratet and i kinda feel sad that most of people dont know why we love this game so much and the story bring us everytime tears and i want more d i love the video description anyone who follows this channel knows how much hollie loves yakuza b she also got a few people into it points at self i swear i have seen one of you in scarborough at a water park i work at or am going crazy witch i probably correct gotta say i love how you have a real passion for gaming most people just play them for the job but you have a deep passion for the games you play i am the same been playing games since the snes days grew up all my friends were out in nightclubs wasting money for nothing my money went on games and at the age of 31 im not going to stop keep up the amazing stuff love your videos how am i here its not a friday feature man i am so sad that the yakuza or ryu ga gotoku has officially ended looking forward to the shin yakuza saga though holly i want to marry you yakuza changed my life almost a day late but hollie i love your hair that way edit i wrote this comment the second the streamvid started and i saw hollies hair i had no idea it was gonna be a little bit of a thing later also my hair is almost that exact shade of blond im a dude and i dont dye it and i style it nearly the same when i have it down except mine is a couple inches shorter or im ridiculously taller than you anyways always happy to see you hollie love your lets plays and miss you when youre not in the tuesday show i hope this goes cross platform i always wanted to try these games out but i hate japanese culture ah nice i just finished kiwami 1 like an hour ago guys i want to play these games but i dont want to play all of them cause i wont have the time im liking this one and maybe yakuza 6 let me know guys i want more yakuza in this engine i just beat zero and kiwami and i cant wait for this one sadly only this game 6 and fist of the north star will use the dragon engine hollie is the reason i tried my first yakuza game im very glad i did thank you hollie hugs hollie great to see you so excited again playing the series havent been able to catch the twitch streams as of late due to ive been getting looking after my nephew after hes out from school always great to watch after but theres always something lost when you cant catch live this is the best one out of all the yakuza games im glad i found out about this game it has been one of my favourite game series of all time it would be so perfect if yakuza was a nintendo game since nintendo use to be partners with the yakuza back in the days ive been playing yakuza since the ps2 but to be honest on the crazy scale when were talking japanese games its barely a 5 out of 10 question in metal gear series which of the following characters is related by blood to the boss a naked snake b otacon c solidus snake d revoler ocelot doing a quiz and im stuck and asking the master for help yakuza 2 is the best in the series i remember playing the original years ago as a kid and was like wow when the credits rolled really like your hairstyle super hot as always getting it day 1 i havent finished kiwami yet though gotta hurry its not out yet you scared me i havent preordered the only thing i dislike about the game is the forced movement speed which is like a 1 if i were to give this game a score 9910 love everything else wait when this is drop im still on yakuza 6 im so jealous i wish we didnt have to wait they should have given us option to change kiriyu sans apparels in kiwami remakes there are 100s of things to do in kamurocho true but still pre ordered cant wait love ya hollie and great stream i love the thumbnail i really want to get into yakuza but was confused thanks so is this game set in both osaka and kamarucho you dont know what you talkin about dead souls was the worst ever wtf i see the order you recommended someone should play these in but what if someone does not care too much about following the story does a game like yakuza 6 have significantly more content than the yakuza 1 remake or are the mechanics evolved so that they feel much better in 6 compared to 1 one of the most underrated franchise is finally getting the love it deserves god i cant wait for yakuza kiwami 2 love love love yakuza and hollie is the yakuza queen lol i love hollie i dont think anyone appreciates yakuza as much as i do except for hollie ouch i felt that wait is this out serious people doing stupid things confirmed another great stream hollie i can fight knifey spoony i cant believe how cheap they sell these games so many hours of entertainment at such a high quality id be more than happy to pay the full price what us the song tho right now i am going through a bad phase in my lifewho will help me with only 1 million dollars sony 0 exclusive sojudgement on pc when where are the salty peasant peeps game just got uploaded on torrents few hours ago if anyone wants to try it early for free then check cs rin forums thread performs as well as yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 meaning the requirements for 1080p highest settings needs only an rx 580 or gtx 1060 not a 1070 as recommended it likes 6 core cpu the most especially if high single core clock speed i fucking completed this game on the ps4 2 months ago and then 3 days later they announced this yeeeeeeeeeee thanks sega hope to finish yakuza 0 before kiwami 2 comes out its that kiryu fighting with majima on a ring what does it take to kill majima goro nuke what the hell italian gameplay on my channel now we will see all kinds of mods too bad that the graphics and animation are so poorly made its 2019 and this looks mich worse than sleeping dogs which came out in 2012 i know its from sega but look at other japanese producers like fromsoftware or konami they have gorgeous engine bloodborne sekiro metal gear solid 5 mediocre game compared to 0 and kiwamithe story is so much bullshit and here im just waiting for part 3 i just finished 0 the other day the hype train has officially left the station epic games are currently sleeping at segas door desperate to be let in if i

dragon engine does anyone know the name of the music it sounds awesome i cant believe it now i would get to use vending machines and yakuza 6 like feeling woah amazing sega wanna know something even

to find the track that plays at 900 i love it but cant seem to find it on the soundtrack goodnessshe was hit on the shoulderthe game is acting as tho she got hit on a vital 10434 that chair cant resist hero aura rip chair just so you know u can buy health items in convenience stores that food doe looks nice and fresh x3 i literally cant wait to get my ps4 so i dont have to watch terrible players is there any reason that u run away from basic thugs other than just saving time it would be more fun to watch u fight them and being the dragon of dojima that he is it makes kiryu look silly when he runs away just an idea its out cant wait to play this ff you preorder it on the psn store u can play it august 27th god i wish this was yakuza 7 142 her tits got grabbed supreme legit of mankind made ever haruka voice how why was adult haruka from yakuza 6 in the game files of kiwami it would make sense that haruka have a more kick centric and faster fighting style to be fair why do i assume these things i have no idea this mod kicks ass good work can you change her outfit is this yagamis moveset mixed with others like majima yo what move set is this i havent seen this anywhere in kiryus combat its amazing but i only know how to replace kiryus model much better than the previous voice pack d the guy just kicked a charging tigerthats rad its ps4 exclusive then why the fk you written pc in description fantastic game and trailer i usually go to ign to watch reviews but after the bullshit they pull on e3 i nope the fuck outta of that im playing through yakuza 6 right and god are they both too similar the best thing about kiwami 2 was seeing kaoru and kiryus romance in hd with the dragon engine lets start our review with a big ass spoiler can anyone possibly tell me what the combat functions are like does it compare to tekken for instance or is it just one of those game which just have a single kick and a punch button and the game itself makes it more variable its not controllable by us 77 hours into zero now i like the sound of the fighting styles that dont appear to use tekken style button gymnasticsand kiwami 2s mini games look much better than the shite in zero im sorry i just dont like the combat anymore the rag doll physics make it ridiculous the heat actions lack the badassery feel now and i honestly really enjoyed the multiple styles of 1 and 0 can somebody please tell me the name of the song that plays in the background when you enter the restaurant kani douraku 524 you can fight bruiser brody in a cage match the only yakuza game that has romance in it i have never played a yakuza game which is the best gameplay wise too busy to get sucked into story and lore long time didnt see a gamespot review this is a great game but i wont buy it after playing 0 kiwami and 6 i am tired of their asset recycling too much dragons 80 yes but is 17th december in this game yakuza 1 and 2 were the best games in the series in my opinion 410 the detail on this game is next level hope shes okay watch where youre going should i wait for pc version i use to play all series already all story line about kiryu really good and we all know all yakuza series coming pc too its completely look like sleeping dogs yakuza for life i played the original yakuza 2 when it first came out on ps2 and i score it a 9 5 enjoy it everyone you want to know how it feels to be a badass in japan this is it for you 8 is a cunning score what a great review ign should actually be copying in this case wtf 810 this must be 10010 real life japanese personalities ehem 409 to see haruka run into a wall original yakuza 2 game is perfect example of how a sequel should be done refinement addition and total improvement of the first game wait they took our majimas different fighting styles and he has no progression man i know its a new added story mode but that is pretty disappointing and make it feel a bit more tacked on then actually being an extra story what the hell was the score 10oclock score g great one of the best series in gaming ill buy it later this month along with the shenmue collection 8 it should get 9 95 pro support if so what exactly kind of important when doing a review of a game dont you think less on the story spoilers and more on reviewing actual gameplay mechanics might actually make this a real review i wish shenmue got this kind of love new to the yakuza series can someone please tell me which game i should start with on ps4 5 0 or kawami the gamespot sign at the end cover up the score probably will be way better than the 8s ign and gamespot are giving is yuma asami in this game must know for obvious reasons if you google her to this day ive never seen a yakoza character get hit or attacked by more than one person at a time cant wait for this one played yakuza 0 loved it and played kiwami liked it so i cant wait for this one the score gets blocked by the logo i wish they made the new shenmue like this i cant play this game because i dont want to be female yakuza lets go yakuza is incredible anyone who doesnt like it is not a real gamer problem with these for me its the movies are so drab well acted i can tell but man sometimes you just want to play and have fun very good games if you have patience and time it sucks that they copied the kiryu from yakuza 6 into this one shouldnt he be looking younger did you seriously just fucking ruin yakuza 6 ryuji goda was a side quest character in yakuza 0 right for me it is 910 im not lookin forward to jir and j amon or the terrible music and voice acting how has nobody mentioned them yet cant wait to beat the crap out of my boy jimmy neutronoh crap he is not in the game 323 holy moly what is that what freaks is that jesus they keep milking this series it seems like every six months i see a new yakuza game passing through admittingly the games are still good but oversaturation kicked in with me 3 games ago sleeping dogs with new graphics its great i need to finish shenmue 1 2 and then yk2 before the end of september playing through 0 for the second time man i love that damn game you guys rate everything an 8 i swear this is a great game playing through 0 now and it is incredible are there any xbox fanboys or pc fanboys wants to complain about this game no good first first this series never seems to get the love it deserves so i want to genuinely thank you for watching this video and listening to how great it is d it feels more like a direct sequel to yakuza 0 yakuza 6 is actually one of the worst yakuza i guess this guy hasnt play zero yet a lot of the things he said new were introduced first in zero the budget remake with the inferior dragon engine combat system is the best game in the series i really hate mainstream yakuza fans also kansai isnt a city its the region idiot what you meant to say was sotenbori which is the yakuza version of dotonbori in osaka come on cabaret club mini game and story lines are awesome i guess it just must be a little weird to ya no insult to ya man you just aint a die hard yakuza fan atleast not yet the fact you said that proves it keep playing man trust me if you think this is weird you aint seen nothin yet dude what do you mean it dont fit the tone this is yakuza weird mini games are its thing i get you dont find the hostess club thing fun but trust me out there mini games is what this game is known for dude taxi driving hunting an under water on rails arcade shooter where you hunt sea creatures hey so i played kiwami 1 on my ps4 slim and noticed a lot of graphical hiccups like loading details i only when you get really close would you recommend kiwami 2 for the ps4 slim or pc lol at this guy criticizing the cabaret game its a cornerstone of japanese nightlife culture and yakuza games games are becoming so seamless that at some point might aswell just go to tokyo red light district and experience it for real lol starting to feel like im just playing a second life i understand the criticism but the clan creator was my favorite minigame in the series kn y6 so im happy to see it back here although it may not have the nadass njpw cast in this one im sure ill still enjoy it i know you probably wont answer this comment but anyway i want a new game for my ps4 and i often come to your channel for recommendations i have never played a yakuza game in my life do you think i would still enjoy the game if i dont know what happened in the previous games i would really appreciate if you could respond to this comment about the hostess club i do not agree with you why put it as a con it is only a mini game so the gamer decides if its fun for her or him to play i like your reviews of games very honest my personal opinion is that yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 are amazing but kiwami 2 is disappointing the gameplay is just bad and the engine is unoptimized running at 25 fps most of the time also most of the heat action are mediocre its not a bad game but it is disappointing i love the cabaret club iam hyped for this game but disappointed that there is still no audio of dialogues for side quests im gonna have to break the bank and pick up all 3 whos hyped for yakuza 7 a 95 thats a really high rating for a game which performs poorly in the gameplay section features a story that feels overall trivial for the series and forcefully addresses absolutely everything from the first game not to mention how horrible this ragdoll effect looks like i do get some points here but we went from the diversity of 4 fighting styles with plethora of abilities to a monotonous brawler where every goddamn move can be completely disrupted and nullified by just one single block 0 and kiwami did a lot better job in that regard can somebody please tell me the name of the song that plays in the background when you enter the restaurant kani douraku why the fuck isnt this spoiler free i like playing hostess club its the money machine youll gain more much money than fighting the goons on the street is really difficult to take you seriusly on anything now dude you always come with this is my favorite x game ever every so often that it has loss his meaning btw yakuza 6 was your favorite you realise the combat system became more simplier and monotonus right and yes i know i platinum yakuza 6 the only yakuza i have ever platinum because it has the less bullshit activities but anywayyou realise this mini games were in yakuza 6 too right tone new fighting da fuck man you know whats missing for a game thats focused on the yakuza or crime the wanted system you know like in gta you have stars that determine how difficult the cops are and the more stars you have the more theyll come after you and the more difficult they become all of that is missing from yakuza which is kind of a let down for me as it does focus on crime right so for a yakuza game i expected to be a wanted system or something were probably never going to have it kansai quiet coastal area it has a population of 22 million and is the 17th biggest metropolitan region in the world its strange that you call goro majima just some guy hes freaking majima the cabaret club mini game was a cool throwback to yakuza 0 but i liked it much more when majima ran the club after all hes the lord of the night you talk as if youve played all the yakuza games but your review suggests otherwise if youre new to the series just be honest about it am i the only one who mostly preferred the combat from 0kiwami it felt faster paced and more diverse in scope maybe its just because i havent unlocked all the moves yet in kiwami 2 but i miss being able to just pick beast stance and mow down enemies or picking rush stance and dodge bosses as i counterattack in my own way i feel the whole combat system lacks flair it looks a lot more fluid but lacks the fun factor of being able to dodge and fight your way through enemies now it feels like the combat is way more streamlined you fight and you dont even really have any risk of dying because you can have a million health items in your inventory and just top yourself up everytime you get low this is in contrast to having just 13 items in yakuza 0kiwami im glad however they decided to remove getting knocked on your ass every 2 seconds from things like guns which caused ridiculous difficulty spikes towards the end of yakuza kiwami another thing that annoyed the shit out of which is better shenmue 2 or yakuza kiwami 2 just started playing yakuza kiwami 2 and its now officially my favorite yakuza game in the series first off this game looks mind blowing on the dragon engine the city is full of life i feel like im really in japan every shop has so much detail graphics are just stunning i also love the combat its so fluid every punch and kick just feels amazing really liking the story so far kiryu is still a badass even more so now then you got hilarious side quest the arcade games theres so much to do its insane cant wait to play more they nailed it with this one already got it wrong the cabaret minigame is great i started with 6 fighting got quite repetetive now playing zero and my head exploded after that kiwami 1so maybe next summer i arrive at kiwami 2 i loved your review and agree with a lot of the things you said having played the game myself but a few things you mentioned really confused me you talked like youve been a big fan of the series for years but when it came to the cabaret and clan creator you hadnt ever heard of them despite them both being major game modes in yakuzas 0 and 6 and you being forced to play them at least once other than those odd inconsistencies great review this is probably the greatest game in yakuza series just because this was the first time that they introduced jingweon mafia kiryus love interest in this game didnt die and is actually a bad ass hoping to see kaoru make a fcking comeback in yakuza 7 then kiryu will retire with him marrying kaoru 3 not sure about being perfect the new combat is really mediocre for me just my opinion i feel like older yakuza games had better combat and im not talking about that this game is just reskin of 6 kinda sad im buying this and dqxi instead of spiderman lmao just becauuuuse spiderman can wait next payday this first lmao since i dont own a ps4 i hope they release the pc version soon the original yakuza 2 is in my personal top ten of best ps2 games of all time such an unforgettable gem make me wanna get it now instead of waiting for black friday but i already have 0 and 1 and not even halfway through 0 yet should i wait just for the information both the mini games you mention are just minigames from older yakuza put into the new game for some side fun the clan one being from yakuza 6 and the cabaret club one being from zero good review but the cabaret club was first introduced in yakuza 0 as an activity for majima coz hes a cabaret owner and all that shit unless you havent played 0 its strange for you to not know about this on zero it was cool cus you could get more territory lol so i went from kiwami to 0 then im playing the rest from kiwami 2 and onward in order the story cinematography humour and overall depth of yakuza are honestly unmatched imo looking forward to this getting it this year and if is anything like 0 or kiwami witch i think is far better then what the critcs seems to think i will be happy i keep hearing that yakuza 2 the original was considered by many as the best with 0 or 5 close behind so if the remake is the best of 0 and kiwami well it might very well hit my top 5 games or sorry but the cabaret club management in yakuza 0 was the main game all the rest just sidequests gonna buy this game soon i have yakuza 0 kiwami and 6 i will also buy yakuza 34 and 5 when they come out zero is the pinicale of yakuza someone who doesnt like the cabaret minigame heresy shenmue now yakuza this is awsome sega i love u again i have to say that cabaret minigame was one of the most addictive parts of 0 cabaret is a big part of japanese culture and you have to consider that when reviewing a nonamerican game you really didnt like the cabaret club minigame thays pretty strange everybody who played yakuza 0 loved it sadlyyou will have to complete the cabaret club and clan creator missions to unlock all skills but can you play virtualon 2 players the best video game series ever made if i keep dreaming how do this benefit you i dont know the context for its return but running a cabaret club was a big part of majimas story in yakuza 0 i really enjoyed it not just as a break from fighting but in 0 you needed to spend money to upgrade your skills instead of xp so kiryu had his real estate minigame and majima ran a club 444 finally coming to terms with what a sick bastard you are i really wish reviewers would stop including detailed descriptions of yakuza side quests in their reviews that baby one looks super fun but now when i play the game ill know exactly what will happen next it really sucks because thats obviously one of the stand out side quests you could have just shown a little footage to peak our interests but a step by step description totally unnecessary kansai is not the city it s the region where you can find the second city osaka very in depth review and nicely done just added this to my amazon list to dig into after the nov and xmas sales i will be busy in a week plus with dragon quest 11 finally on us soil however with this game and then 6 and so well reviewed this will be a series i sink many many hours in thank you for the time these quality videos take and shining a spotlight on a great game absolutely love the review man i know some people get upset about the spoilers but it does not bother me the cabaret mini game in yakuza 0 is honestly fun and addicting just bought yakuza 0 in anticipation of this first experience with yakuza a few hours and loving it story is great im really confused as to why dreamcastguy talks about the cabaret club mini game which is far better than hes making it out to be although i get how its not for everyone like its something newwhen it was a requirement of yakuza 0 and did he not make a review for zero the only thing i hated about 6 was the endless amount of dialogue what arcade games are included spoiler filled review explaining ruining a tense scene look how tense this scene is everyone yeah not go experience it i just had to pound a bunch of dudes wearing diapers be my baby is the one of the best substories in yakuza 2yakuza kiwami 2 its been trending in fb way back when yakuza kiwami 2 got release in japan way back im just glad it looks good on base ps4 unlike the other game cough cough yakuza 6 i cant wait to play this in a few days glad it was a step up from 6 want to fond of the cabernet club in the 0 so i wont spend toomuch time on that now that you spoke about shenmue we can move on to segas preferred series dude cabaret club stuff is awesome one of the best side things in the whole yakuza series yeah huge disagree about the cabaret club but great review overall i have yakuza kiwami 1 still havent played itnow im going to have actually play the thing did you never play yakuza 0 cabaret was a main in thator yakuza 6 where the clan mode was present sometimes i wonder about reviewers i cannot believe that people would never appreciate this game series in general ive only played kiwami 1 but i definitley have to play the rest of the series that game was dope considering that yakuza 3 is really when the series hit its stride these remakes of 1 2 really keep every instalment in the series top notch the tower defence is new to these games but the cabaret sim was there before fist of the north star in this engine looks really good im definitely curious as to how the yakuza 6 engine compares to that of yakuza 0 which i adore maybe eventually if it gets no love then how are there so many yakuza games and everyone talks like they are crazy about it im glad its your favorite its my favorite too are you going to review fist of the north star lost paradise im in the same space as you with these games tried it with 0 and loved everyone since although 0 has still held the top spot after your review i have a good feeling this will take the top spot i love your work man trying to get through shenmue 1 and 2 now cant wait for this game tuesday the cabaret club was my fav thing from zero it was way more fleshed than anything else i thought and was pretty customizable does the remake have the adult babies like on the original was really funny must of not played yakuza 0 the cabaret mini game is amazing ohhhh yea 1 more week cant wait im getting my steelbook so hyped played all the others such a great series the cabaret mini game is like one of the most awesome things they could have included in this remake it was fun in yakuza 0 and it is fun now by the way did you really played yakuza 0 i beat the 4 and 5really underrated game and need more appreciation one of the best series ever im looking forward to the fist of the north star series developed by these guys i need this game on xbox one x sotenbori is not new and the club management game was in yakuza 4 and 0 one of which i am certain you played i love this series its one of the most underrated and over the top video game franchise of all time best game in the series easily good review however i know we were talking the other day and i know you beat all of your games b4 doing the video wether it takes 102653 or 78 hours to beat but i feel like for the kind of style review you do you dont have the kind of detail that would make it seems as though you beat the game so i dunno if beating a game like this is really warranted when you show some early on footage you dont spoil anything you go over mechanics and fighting but aside from the giant babieswhich may have been 10 or 40 hours into the story itd be easy for one to think like yea this is a solid review i wonder if that guy beat the game thoroughly its just food for thought cuz u said u played 14 hrs straight to finish it for this review and taking no days off sucks u said you didnt think youd have the style to do a semi review1st impressionsreview without finishing the game but i think you could where it could be thoughts on instead of a full review you need days off cant wait to start playing 2 finally plus the best starting point for story is definitely zero since each game after payoffs for each character as the games goes on im currently playing zero while i like it well enough im afraid to get invested until 35 are confirmed for us release on ps4 currently playing 0 still need to play kiwami lol just picked up a copy of yakuza zero still need to finish 23 and 4 should i play them in the order they were released or start with the first one is zero technically the first one in the story line what i understand about yakuza game is first and mostly its a japanese game for the japanese players and were luck to play it so how stupid the mini games seem just go ok now excuse me where can i buy a gift in yakuza 5 at the start of the game for some other taxi company i remember playing the first yakuza on my ps2 it was my favorite yakuza game back then still is i cant wait to play kiwami 2 i played the absolute hell out of the cabaret mini game in yakuza 0 cant wait to do it again dude i got so addicted to the cabaret game in zero trying to get more fans in certain areas leveling up girls or just earning tons of yen i actually thought it fit just as well as all the other weird mini games in the yakuza franchise um 0 was perfect i want to get it because i loved yakuza 4 0 and 6 the problem is im not that hungry for another yakuza game i finished 6 only 3 months ago so yeah i also prefer to play kiwami 1 before this one playing through yakuza 0 i am a big fan of these games very happy that sega is releasing the entire series on ps4 completely disagree about the cabaret club game like most i can see this series is awesome though great review man all yakuza games are fantastic cant wait to play yakuza kiwami 2 but for now shenmue 1 and 2 on the weekend d dreamcastguy are you a sony fanboy ive never seen a review of an xbox game on your channel i own both ps4 pro and xbox one x it would be nice if you did some xbox reviews love the channel spiderman tomb raider who cares when yakuza is in town speaking of awesome arcade games in yakuza kiwami 2 i heard you could play virtual on in other words its an instant buy for me man i really need to give this series a try if only i had a ps4 sega has done one hell of a job with the yakuza series and i love this franchise more than ever and thanks to 0 for the franchises boom here in the west with kiwami 2 approaching next tuesday im excited as hell to play the second entry of the yakuza franchise but in remake fashion i had to pound a bunch of dudes wearing diapers 1010 that cabaret club was an awesome mini game from 0 im glad they brought this back clickbait title dislike you should not start at any game in the yakuza series either play the old games in release order or play yakuza 0 then kiwami kiwami 2 and the soon to be released hd releases of the 3 4 and 5 the games may be great games alone but they become waaaaay better when you have played them all in order as there are returning characters and call backs to older games in the series that will go over your head if youve not played the older games great review so are you stuck with just one fighting style and that item inventory where you can use a weapon you technically can start playing which ever yakuza game in the series but playing starting at zero and working your way to 6 will bring you a greater sense of familiarity with all the characters i cant imagine starting with 6 especially since its the last game with kiryu i hated the second yakuza for its retarded plot but if this ever comes to pc gonna be insta buy where is the spoiler alert yakuza 0 was the perfect yakuza yakuza 2 is a close second tiger thats all im gonna say i hated the level up system from 6 lol really pound a bunch of dudes lol its being able to pound a bunch of dudes wearing diapers that makes this series what it is to me i only jumped in at 6 loved it enough to go back and play 0 and kiwami 1 really looking forward to this game instantly one of my favorite franchises i recently bought a ps4 pro and am really interested in getting these games the timeline kind of confuses me though do the kiwami games come first what order should i play them in thanks i need to get into this series i understand your qualms about the mini games but i dont think thats really a negative one of my favorite things about this series is myriad of different things you can do the cabaret club mini game was also in yakuza 0 and imo it was exceptional there it added more depth to the world showing different sides of majima and the side characters involved but i get its just a difference in taste the cabaret game is entertaining as hell played it on yakuza zero now you are acting like the american you are hostess clubs is embedded in the japanese culture so i dont agree with you at all here giant baby story so good lol that cabaret club mini was in y0 and i found that sht fun as hell lies dreamcast lies dreamcast lol this has easily become one of my favorite franchises its just so damn fun to play getting that sweet steel book edition right now preordered cannot wait and thanks for the wonderful review nice review as usual its honestly such a good time to be a yakuza fan seeing how far this series has gone since its beginning is truly amazing thanks for the review yakuza is an amazing franchise so underrated this is really my most favorite sega series yakuza for life i cant wait for part 3 4 and 5 to make it stateside remastered yeah is it perfect not getting that title but the game and series is solid gold if it wasnt for shenmue did you play the be my baby sub story in this game edit nevermind just saw it in your video lmao your journalism on this game is somehow my favourite to date it keeps getting better and better literally i want to buy this game because you made it sound so convincing thanks for the videos keep it up this is the game i want later i wanna play kiwami 1 first especially the price went down a bit on the ps store just so i can follow the story i have yakuza 0 and 6 song of life ah yes the remake of one of my childhood game is finally here i was waiting for this review played the original version yakuza 2 years ago it was very expensive back then but i just had to play it cant wait to play the remake one of the best stories in yakuza franchise yakuza forever for me definitely have to get this now thanks for the review dreamcast guy crazy that this is how i remember yakuza 2 but if i pop it in my ps2 right now ill see pixelated shit sweet review loved zero looking forward to play through 1 and 2 after im done with shenmue cant wait for goromichan to be in my club played sleeping dogs enjoyed it that was close enough to this series for me all i hear is muda muda a big ass bladder for a big ass man also this exists in japan lmfao girltoo bad so sad my gym clothes are one kiryu 241 totally worth it home of challenge pissing butthen peepee get hard on toilet how can urinate japan biggest man of culture watching this toilet minigame while on the toilet toiletception btw this is a silly weird thing exists in japan to anyone who never played urine for the time of your life oh my god that was horrible japan was a mistake killyu seriously xd i heard the yakuza team wanted to redo the whole series up to 6 in the kiwami format but would only release them in japan if they did and i dont know how i feel about that why so late this been out for nearly a month this ql is a lot 10 mins in is definitely gonna be in the next best of gb video holy shit aww man some stuff happened at the end of kiwami 1 lol alex should finish it the og version of this bored the shit out of me back in the day when i tried playing thru 1 and 2 dont think i even completed it neither of the two ps2 games were especially well liked in general back then tho like 6710 niche games at most just looked up some old forum posts from the late 00s and yes the impressions werent exactly glowing a lot of people thinking they were pretty garbage even after always wanting to try this series i finally played my first one in zero and am now hooked for life played zero kiwami and kiwami 2 all one right after another absolutly love the yakaza series i saw that heat attack at the start precisely once in y6 and never again so its nice to know i wasnt imagining it bad controls as every other console game in general cannot understand how it is so hard to do basic controls properly starting off very strong with be my baby i love this series sorry but i need jeff to continue his long running disinterest in yakuza quicklooks the komaki stuff has been around since 1 and is a reoccurring thing through out the games i am so glad i watched this cuz i never intended to play yakuza but after that fucking baby scene im in lol you can tell alex only wanted to do this quick look because he wanted the reactions of dan and vinny to the baby substory the way he tells them to pay attention right before haha ragdoll in a japanese game 052 is the justification is that they arent dead also add me to the throng to those requesting beast in the east to come backid resub for more beast in the eastdespite the fact i cant comment on the site anymore the quick look comes out a week after ive finished the game huh its an awesome game though way better than kiwami 1 and a little better than 6 really great game i want more beast in the east damn it ranking of fighters out west beast in the east out east its all i ask the baby part was justman i like how alex took command and said shhhhhhh we are playing yakuza pay attention sometimes it doesnt hurt to reign it in v ah the good content remember beast in the east that tears it i fucking need this game didnt expect yakuza 0 spoilers here god i hate doing this 1st that spoiled lil bitch haruka is driving me mad with her hideous requests like what do ye expect your ojisan to be tigerwood yakuza 2s definitely been the highlight of the series for a while but zero really outdid it for me kiwami 2 then once again upped the ente in a way thanks to how gorgeous and polished it is making them basically even in my book i loved this game i think its my favorite in the franchise great review man this game was amazing holly shit that story was epic bruh ruji goda is a fucking beast and is the second best villain in the yakuza series along with nishkiyama is the map bigger than 6 ive played 1 so im gonna play 0 next but then ill pick this one up and after that ill figure out what i wanna do about 35 lol we build shit thank you gamexplain for putting up a review on such a hidden gem of a series i just beat kiwami and im so looking for part 2 your non nintendo videos are always a treat i cherish kick punch scream the video game im playing yakuza 0 right now i bought it finally the other day its amazing i plan on getting kiwami next and then this one i might buy kiwami 1 today just because its only 19 dollars lol if he producer was smart he wouldve ported 12 hd to switch and anyone who says it cant be done or run good i will fight you on the streets ayyy videogames the dragon engine feels so damn good from my time in the demo im really looking forward to the first of a potential trio of yakuza games out this year planning to do a review of lost paradise as well ahh i just have no time to get into this franchise where do i begin and should i just wait for an anthology ill wait for a pc release i got the steelbook preordered so im super excited i do have one question though is the majima everywhere thing back in this one i love that man with a passion and need as much as him as possible in my game of course andre isnt doing it lol i just started this series with kiwami 1 how should i proceed i have 0 6 and the ones on ps3 quality review thanks the changes to the clan creator bugs me i enjoyed mashing units in 6 it was easy money very close to 1 million subscribers lol switch would explode trying to run this game but i dont think it would be a bad idea to port 0 kiwami the switch could handle those and they are great entry points to the series holy fuck gamexplain covering literally anything not related to nintendo in some way does the small in game area that was cut refer to the place where you climb the watchtower and have to solve the shogi mysterytried to keep vague bcz spoilers if so thats a shame but understandable why they wouldnt want to recreate that entire area in the dragon engine for a part of a chapter that lasts about what an hour or two on a blind playthrough great review hoping to see more nonnintendo content in the future ah something different on gamexplain nice to see them take on a ps4 game for a change my older sister likes the yakuza series so i might recommend this to her could you guys review allstar fruit racing not nintendo related looks at dislike ratio this has been the most elusive game in the series for the west im happy its easily available in stores now in remake form kiryu from yakuza didnt make it to tekken 7 instead he got replaced by negan from amcs the walking dead im not joking that actually happened look it up guys try and listen to the battle theme its so jazzy almost at 1 mil bois my boys at it again love seeing the yakuza love on gx and chris is the top guy for the job i know nothing about this series but im halfinterested any tips from current fans to lead me on where to start my primary platform is pc my secondary is the switch and i can wipe off the dust of my ps3 if im desperate are you guys going to start doing more non nintendo switch reviews the nerdiest gamexplainer takes on the yakuza just bustin your balls always fun to see you here ayyy a review for a nonnintendo game ive been waiting too long for this game kiryuchan for smash hey if we cant get him in tekken why not smash we want to see daisys final smash not on nintendo switch not watching it was pretty ok to me kiwami 2 pc stream incoming soon as well in about 12 hours be on the lookout someone know how to change the language between english and japanese the graphics and destructible environment of dragon engine is awesome the facial expressions too but they need to fix the physics when we throw an enemy it is still looks bad but overall its great who agree that majima is more interesting character rather than kiryu 60 frames makes a huge difference finished the ps4 port a few months ago so will definitely play it again on pc once 35 hd comes out at some point this year or next be me be yakuza fan since 2009 buy ps4 solely to play yakuza games buy 0 kiwami kiwami 2 and 6 right away play them all one by one and go for platinum eventually be next week be sega announce the sega exclusive yakuza franchise is now entering the pc market have 2080ti rtx graphics card and overall strong gaming pc be excited while also being sad itiscomplicatedexe why sega why why did you not announce it a week sooner you made me endure that 30fps dragon engine crap and now you shit on all my hard work and trust reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee friendly reminder that kiryu has never killed anyone its beautiful combat feels so bad idk maybe my imagination where is yakuza 3 for the us wtf arent all pc kiwami non fps capped i get over 100 with kiwami 1 yeeeeeeeeeee pc boy finally took so long i want kiryu body shape any tips for building it like that aww this feels goooood need a upgrade graphics 424 kazuma was lucky majima could have cut his dick off d gotta appreciate the accurate english of the announcer 052 i think it was meant to be silva xd my body and mind is ready so kiwami 2 will go out first before yakuza 6 on pc ok then dat ragdoll effect tho 502600 really smooth defeat goro majima hes enjoying this youre goddamn right he is and we wouldnt have it any other way greetings from malaysia finally k2 is here time to buy it full price maybe sega will make uhmmm persona 5 on pc meanwhile im afraid if ill be able to run this game in 720p on the lowest settings but the game looks amazing on pc worst optimized game of yakuza history never thought the day would come cant wait why are the counter prompts showing playstation buttons instead of xbox i need to finish kiwami 1 lol thats rad got off pornhub to finish my wank here because this is clearly better i cant wait to brawl and be nice to random people tomorrow and run a hostess club lets not forget that damn the heat actions looks so awesome in 60fps hot damn this looks delicious so glad im upgrading my graphics card right as this hits steam be honest did you let majima beat you up a little so we could all appreciate his glorious moves in 60 fps the dragon enginereborn this looks great im glad i waited for the pc release 047 hm its just a minor mistake but as a brazilian i think his name is supposed to be robison caetano da silva how did you get it early is it that much more demanding than kiwami 1 heat actions look amazing im currently playing it on my ps4 pro but now i wish i had waited for the pc release also i need gravure minigame at 60fps holy shit its very smooooooooth 60 fps ive been enjoying yakuza at 144 fps this whole time 60s kinda low hey devilleon whats your pc specifications this game will look rad on my 2070 ah thats hot even in 60 fps garys japanese still sucks ill keep it fair and square holding a knives im drooling because of how smooth it is holly f it looks beautiful will you do a combat guide for judgement before it releases in the west also ive sent you a friend request on ps4 i wish its well optimized like kiwami i still have to finish yakuza 0 the yakuza 1 on the pc first wont be diving into this until the summer important question how so early why are you bragging about 60fps console kiryus body looks weird idk why his body in yakuza 0 was more realistic i just hope therere no aliasing and blur in distance the game releases tomorrow how do you have it plz tell me i want to play this means be my baby in freaking 60fps oh god specs oof thnx a lot if you dont mind what are your specs so that i could get a rough reference my body is ready 24 hours more 60 fps tiger drop my heart wont endure is this game really that easyi mean look how many hp the enemies lose from one single punch someone give us a mod that lets you use 4 fighting styles from 0 and kiwamior at least bring back the original dragon of dojima moveset plz 004 that turnaround was smooth as hell damn his trap looked like its trying to escape his body its funny how 60fps almost gives the illusion of the game being heavier than it is if that makes any sense looks fresh in 60 fps wow the game looks so smooth on pc cant wait to play kiwami 2 again this week nice one its so satisfying to see majima slides smoothly ive been wondering long time ago where you from leon so tomorrow is the day i hope my notebook withstand high quality something tells me that there will be insane mods xd its so buttery smooth i love it i love you

cant wait for tomorrow to arrive the dragon engine looks slick as all hell when it runs like it should its so beautiful feel the 60fps how did you get to play the game isnt it coming out on the 9th got this game and kiwami 1 for 10 bucks on black friday cant wait to get lost in these games the worthy yakuza games are 0 1 and 2 the true ending in my opinion the others are funny but the story sucks a lot too bad mr shakedow only exist ini zero hahahaha i feel myself oldfirst time i played yakuza was yakuza 1 on the ps2 and played the whole yakuza series but seriously yakuza kiwami 2 is the best cuz my favorite was yakuza 2 sooooooo but there are some flaws on this kiwami 2 i preferred the old one meaning yakuza 2 on the ps2 in terms of grabbing and difficulty lol i play this in legend and its easy comparing to hard difficulty in the ps2 pc release on may 9th xd kiwami was good but was a pretty big downgrade but only cause 0 was such a masterpiece cant wait for this one im only just getting into yakuza just bought y0 while id love to play through them all i just dont have time with work ect is this one ok to play through as a stand alone game so you are saying that this one is better than zero yazuka 2 is the best so far of the remakes because i believe the devs actually listen to the fans opinions played since the first one was out my brother got me addicted from the off when he got it on ps2 played yakuza 2 loved it 3 4 and 5 were pretty good 0 was amazing to go back in time kiwami 1 was mind blowing all the extra stuff loved it got number 6 couldnt get used new engine so put to one side just got kiwami 2 love it yakuza 2 was the best in the series in my opinion so standard and yes i just got this its awesome good video like always jay long time yakuza fan here since the ps2 era very happy to see the series finally getting the attention it deserves also kinda sucks to see the tiger fight in the video as to me it is one of the coolest moments in yakuza 2 i dont mind it as much but it kind of ruins the moment for new fans also jay have you tried yakuza 5 its an amazing game and to me has a lot more content than 2 with many different playable characters and side jobs check it out keep up the good work cheers im right know playing this game its amazing im loving this this game ive been hooked since 0 i hope we get 345 and story was amazing i personally prefer 1 story over 2 but man i love 2 story its tight i just wish we got more of ruji goda cause he was standing highlight for me as a character httpsdocsgooglecomformsd1d0ogm3htjbdimjamnwyv4183888bxj4gtjuk5cguviewformeditrequestedtrue if you want more yakuza games to be brought out in the west please fill out the official sega yakuza survey and spread the word i see the game is sold out at all the best buys around me but really want the game but dont really wanna pay full price for it at other places cuz i had the gamers club subscription dont know when itll b back on the shelves should i wait for a sale or just get it right now i missed the combat system where u can change ur fighting style i love the game but i still kinda miss the fighting styles from 0 the forced walking annoys me a bit too id give this game a 98 out of 10 i still prefer the original for cinematic pacing and mechanical reasons but its hard to argue with the amount of effort put into this remake my brother thinks these games are stupid notice me senpai anime gameshe played 5 hours of kiwami 1 and is opening a case for a refund with sonyhes a weirdo cabaret management i would play that as a standalone game lol i am new as well played kiwami 1 then 0 so i could experience 0 as a prequel now am on 2 and will not do anything else til its done then ill move on to dq11 i am absolutely loving this game what does everyone else think played the first 2 chapters so far schedule and monster hunter generations ultimate stopping me from proceeding man oh man so far things got more intense starts than 0 and kiwami i think im gonna love ryouji goda never played yakuza since there mostly on sony system i prefer shenmue playing has a good guy rather than a bad guy wish i had a ps4 right now great review im going to be all over this such a great game enjoyed the review man doing a lets play of this game right now addicted to the series thx for the review yakuza my third favorite series of all time behind persona series in 2nd and hatsune miku project diva series as number one love orignal yakuza 2 and really enjoying the remake i wanted to get yakuza kiwami 2 but i already preordered dragon quest 11 and valkyria chronicles 4 and my wallet is screaming got this day one got addicted to the main story but i still think 0 is better overall thumbnail looks like the other mother from coraline kiryu goes to a half nude place also kiryu watches a horror video so cold this makes me wish theyd try a japanese horror game in a modern setting thatd be effin awesome people when they stumble across a ghost run away kiryu hey get back here 737 how the ring shouldve ended xd is that munan suzuki rat bastard is at it again isnt he so do you find anything if you go to the park beside the pocket circuit stadium as shown in the vhs i think there is also a ghost in tojo hq in courtyard where there will be a speech bubble that will say pls help or something like that and when you talk to the one near the pond he will say that the place is execution site in the past now im gonna wait for yakuza 7 the ghost dragon am i the only who thinks it wouldve been freakin hilarious if you couldve gotten the ghost lady as a cabaret hostess kiryu just dont give a shit that the ghosts are chasing him xd come on lets be real here kiryu could tiger drop the ghost into the after life in about 0259 seconds no need to be scared kiryu defeated an entire clan of japanese criminals and yet afraid of ghosts that guy looks like the leader of the cult in yakuza 0 you know youre supposed to say no dweebs think japan is all about cute anime girls and boys while the real gs know that japan is more likely all about drunkards scam artists and thug gangs who run shakedowns on the regular they subvert my expectations for good i expected that kiyru is gonna punch this ghost with a bycicle at the end but who wouldve guess suicide tape i thought he gave me something illegal because cops were chasing him lol holy crap that shit is creepy ghost wants kiryu d before she ascend to heaven holy shit kiryus almost got possessed if he didnt dropped that tape sooner enough one can only hope kiwami 2 is also coming to pc i kind of want to know the origins of that tape and the girl wish theyd elaborate more on it this shit scared the fuck out of me a 61 235 pound 18 year old male and almost made me scream like a child at 2am when she popped up on screen fuck you sega but very well done why is everyone a scam artist in kamurocho wondering if there isnt a mission based on juon in one of the games honestly thought this was going to be more complex with all 3 of them being in cahoots before a real ghost showed up dear god shes so cute oh im looking forward to nicobs reaction to this thats a pretty hot ghost i guess that girls unfinished business was getting the chance to do a ring style haunting ah i remeber my first ghost tape on yakuza 2 that red woman is creepy as shit this game was top quality in my time ps2 was such a great console back then the voice acting in this game is awesome i have a feeling kiryu would somehow find a way to punch the ghost ghost wants a hug she look kindda hot i dont mind if i had one like this no wonder the spin off was zombie horror shooter i have a guess that in the original japanese the guy was about to say akuma then said av instead hes a yakuza not charlie brown dead thot is this a spiritual sequel to 0s ghost porn sidequest what the fuck kiryu should be on ghost hunters just as the best friends said ghost pornography i wonderif this based on a true story wasnt this the same quest in yakuza 2 omg shes hot dont judge menow where can i get that tape now that i think about it there should be a game of great teacher inasuka but its with the yakuza char the underworld ist a completex where cute cute ghosts all are looking for love yo i would smash with that ghost i dropped the tape yeah that totally doesnt look burned moral of the story is dont get free dirty greased erotica tapes from strangers looks like a play on that japanese urban legend that inspired the ring ghost porn its on im not surprised that even ghosts want kiryu as their husbando wouldve been hilariously sad if it turned out the ghost was yumi sobs kiryu fights ghost porn first i think all scam team but turn up into real ghost thats some chillin script what kiryu fabulous pose uh huh and the real reaction would be im fr gets ass kicked by kiryu looks like the curse was worse than you thought 053 when you hear a sound in a dark hallway why no voice acting the ghost is hot af this wasnt nearly as scary as the one from yakuza 0 shivers 540 trickster plot say bye bye to the 900000yen that stone get it from neaby pond and the vase is get it from dumpster watse 900000yen only return 100000yen kinda wanna bang that ghost tho i already fear how poor nicob will reactpoor soul dx not a huge fan of japanese horror shit much scarier than our american horror movies when i played this quest her appearance on the screen up close made me jump and my heart rate increase so bad my body just froze for a bit i absolutely hate jumpscares if im playing the game but i like watching people play scary games idk im odd nice story d did this not scare the shit out of anyone else because i really didnt expect it she looks like a sims 2 character in the video ok but that ghost looked more like she was about to give her boyfriend a surprise hug than horribly murder him so thats how you take care of the ring girl okay i recently learned that kiwami two has a photo mode that i never learned about in game and you can take selfies with it it hasnt happened to me but i think itd at least be pretty cool if you took a selfie and theres a small chance that ghost lady here would be behind kiryus shoulder just posing as if she was part of the picture meaning she jusy decided to tag along with kiryu for his adventure instead of just doingwhatever she was going to do with that weird hug thing hahah xd aww what a nice ghostly lady not only she made the guy return kiryus cash but also destroyed the tape really kiryus a legend but hes scared yeah and call it yakuza horror souls or dead thing idk i ended up scaring myself because last second i was like no way yakuza would do a cheap jumpscare and then i freaked out they gotta give whoever friggin wrote that quest a friggin raise the moment the medium approached him i knew it was a scam and the scared dude and the vhs lady was in cohoots staging the entire thing only for it to reveal in not such a case in a genuinely disturbing way how the lady was slowly approaching him from behind with her arms out just as the sound of the tape breaking on the ground made me jumped now thats how you write horror baby even though this is my first time seeing this even though i have already played the original i was kind of expecting kazuma to clock the guy over the head with the rock something tells me it was good the tape broke when it did someone on the streets gives you a vhs tape its porn a snuff film or someone pulling a prank you have no reason not to just trash it in the ps2 i remember the quest involves beating up the medium and the ghost remains mysterious to the end i think shes cute hot ghost is this a sequel to the majima sidequest in yakuza 0 yes i remember this sub story from the original yakuza 2 im a horror fanatic so i loved this so much it scared the shit out of me back in the old ps2 version but i see they removed the scream shes supposed to scream when she appears close to the camera still happy to see this sub story again 540 548 im pretty sure he just did the mafuba the original ghost looks creepier this one looks hot wait if hes not a real medium how did he know kiryu is cursed at the first place didnt you know that theres an option for a rotational map in the settings might be useful if you didnt know whoever that woman was im sufficiently creeped out kiryu is on style even when he is jumpscared 539 thats some wizard of the dojima levels of exorcism a curse you say more like he gained a stand only kiyru can attract actual ghosts the ghost from the video scared the shit out of me when i was a little wonder why the medium reminds me of shooreh pippi guy still remember this sub story way back in the ps2 era fucking hell so scary aye now this is creepy i kind of curious if the ghost is modeled after an av actress i actually got scared can i ask how to search tournaments on ancient rivalry substoriesin kiwami 2answers this leon the ghost quite beauty kiryu gonna get covered in ectoplasm if you know what i mean i keep wondering why do they decided to remove the scream of the phantom that its hearing in the original 2 when she was in front of the camera at the end of the video its just a little detail but i think its change almost the whole begining of the sub story this should be the plot for yakuza 7 the ghost wants that dragon ghost pr0n that matt requested from bestfriends plays xd wasnt this in zero as well or am i remembering stuff wrong its not a good port the dragon engine has the same problems as on ps4 there are huge fps drops unless you have crazy rigs plz continue yakuza black panther project how to free download httpsyoutubeyv30eqyi38 tried my hardest to find the screenshot you used for the thumbnail realized it was a petty attempt at clickbait here have a downvote those cutscenes where locked to 30 fps because they are prerendered and recycled from the ps4 game looks like this past broadcast have the problem about sound and video not sync at all feelsbadman dragon engine running on 60fps or uncapped is so satisfying thank god it not suddenly change into epic exclusive time to pre order what now to next video judgement judge eyes the release in 19 hours hype flashback to this guy dying to daigo of all people what is your outro music sounds familiar shes 10 im surprised no one has corrected him about the engine yet 2 and 5 are bloody excellent but 6 is still my personal favorite cant wait to watch this 3648 wwhy doesnt the medic do something oo well now i have two more playlist of yours to tackle yakuza 0 and 1 haha 2 and 4 are the best 5 is okay it would not be a yakuza game if it did not take 45 minutes to get into the playable part d thank goodness i was having majima withdrawal symptoms im kinda sad you didnt see the zotethingy in hollow knight while it lasted would love to see your reaction xd praise the dragon of dojima i am so happy you are playing this is this a game or a 60 recap huh no intro in this game weird because kiwami 1 had it and the original yakuza 2 had it own intro also kiwami 2 the second yakuza game where eating a lot of food is good for exp instead of fighting tons of dudes another joins the die in kiriyus arms club still mentally scarred by majima everywhere huh now im happy been long since i watched you due to unintrest in most games you have covered recently some simply from overexposure so not all because i dislike or find them boring so this will be a treat ayyyy this came out quick at this rate im going to need to play overtime to not fall behind yakuza 5 one of the best ones i dont know about that most content rich sure and some of the best gameplay but id rank it more around the middle overall the story is pretty eh and its extremely bloated so the pacing is kinda bad even if you beeline the main plot yakuza 2 is pretty great though even with the remake its a little too dated to be on par with zero but its up there top three at least im 6 hours in and while i can still feel the ps2ness in a few cutscenes so far the remake doesnt suffer from the originals age anywhere near as much as kiwami 1 did but thats someone with nostalgia talking im interested to see how this game holds up for someone new to the series this made me happy i cant watch this until at least kiwami 1 hits steam just finished 0 though had as much fun playing it as i did watching your lp of it last year d please release it on pc had a blast with kiwami i just finished the game ps4 nomber one just got yakuza 6 and i finished yakuza kiwami last summerim obsessed lol japanese is so ugly but the game seems interesting yesssss okay just do a simple remaster of 345 then i can finally play 6 thats rad i am so ready for this how ready so ready that my level of readiness goes over so much that it actually becomes a negative oh gods im not ready for this what ever happen to yakuza 5 in american game did they forgot about making it in us likely im able to play in chronological order with no notion of the story i just picked up kawami yesterday and im already halfway through it wow i really need a ps4 for all these yakuza games is this originalyakuza 2s remake a refined 6 yes please so i bought yakuza 0 and 6 currently playing yakuza 0 and its amazing so before playing 6 what should i play next yakuza kiwami then kiwami 2 and then 6 is that the right order me personally im waiting for the yakuza 7 remake on ps5 i played the entiere franchise 1and 2 on ps2 345 ps3 and i can tell you that this episode is by far the most awsome and badass from all thanks to zero it got me into yakuza to the point i want all of them remade and if they all came out on ps4 i would spend a full year on all of them next up konami please redo the metal gear series all for next gen love it man just bought the premium edition of yakuza 6 and just heard about this announcement at gamestop better save up by sellin some gold plates we can play as majima again hopefully its permanent not for a couple of missions only i heard kiwami 2 isnt coming to the us but they wouldnt release an english trailer then right so we must be getting it so im kinda interested in copping yakuza 6 but idk dont really indulge in japanese games that much gave persona 5 a try and i was happy with my purchase my question for this is dumb question does it really revolve around that yakuza gangmafia life similar to the raid and gangs from kill bill and oldboy or what dont really know what to expect so glad its coming west sega please keep them coming will this have a standard edition for ps4 there only seems to be a steelbook edition yes my favourite yakuza hands down the most epic one in the entire series clash of 2 dragon ps most importantly managing hostess club yakuza is one of the best and an underrated game for me its far better than gta i thought this game was a copy like gta but its different better story amazing characters and an awesome protagonist i can assure you kiryu kaizuma is one the best leading character its a shame in yakuza 7 kiryu wont be there but i do hope them bring him back so i bought the original yakuza 2 cuz i was like oh were getting yakuza 6 so kiwami 2 probably wont come out till next year literally the day i started playing 2 they announced this its crazy to see goda as a kid in 0 and now as a fullfledge yakuza in 2 hopefully next year well get hd remasters of 35 revenge the revenging yes thank you so much for this majima everywhere cool more yakuza games coming out now i can have a better understanding about the game series i cant wait waiting for yakuza 3 4 5 on ps4 yes just finished yakuza 0 not too long ago and got hooked into the series im glad that i am able to continue to play the series on ps4 if we can somehow get kenzan ill be set for life is this yakuza 2 remastered dammm yakuza 6 was the end of kiryus story which is very sad but still looking for the next hero of yakuza series cant wait for 6 and this how much of the story will we miss if going straight to 6 ive only finished kiwami 01 and the original 1 back then on ps2 seeing how kiryu went through so much in each game makes me feel like theres a big chunk of story missing if we jump to 6 right away what a good time to own a ps4 already pre ordered this can someone explain to me the history of yakuza i bought yakuza kiwami 1 and i found it a very interesting game it had nice good and horrible parts with a very repetitive combat system but the game seems to be history focus with many quotes refering previous things that happened i got the history of kiwami 1 alright but is there any game that came before it that explains how his life on the orphanege or something like that or the history starts way off the real start will it come with spanish subtitles yusssssss they didnt waste any time localising it this time nice one sega you doing good today d ive been waiting for this sega while youre at it send the dragon of dojima to the seventh king of iron fist tournament yes woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo so excited for this ive been absolutely enthralled with yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 must buy topic closed i know kiwami 3 is probably next but i always wanted wanted a hd english remake of the psp game black panther annnd adding this to my to do schedule but will it have a majima everywhere mechanic just finished y0 today already gave up on getting the other games in the series besides yk1 only to find out that yk2 going to be released soon nice now rerelease the other 3 games too even if its just a port or digital only but rather all physical copies though dont hold back sega we want 3 4 5 what a moove by sega when western games are strugling with anti consumer policy you show what is real games havent seen any bugs in 0 and 1 so are they going to remake all of the yakuza games for ps4 i have no problem with this i think its awesome ishin please yakuza 6 done next to kiwami 2 i love this game finally thanks to sony sega and ryu ga gotoku studio this is what remaster is for its about to get real august 28th i wasnt even

pleasei like to have one please add rachet and clank all parts 20022016 i am disappointed they didnt use the song from the japanese trailers i hope its in the game though hello sony i am a lefthanded player and i particularly like games like overwatch or battlefield 1 or even the customizable keys and the change of interfaces attributed with it should be a classic in games i do not know these two and i in so that i can say that it is possible to integrate in all the future games thank you in advance julien is there any chance sega will port 35 to ps4 another one for people who played the original ps2 release im happy to see kaoru returning in this remake there are entirely too many of these games good concept but not graphics im hoping for rayman m classics on ps4 im looking forward

please cant wait to see be my baby substory in the dragon engine yes thanks can we see yakuza kiwami 3 in the future oh my god i was waiting for this please hd collection 3 4 5 now so i own but havent

possible wooow this the great grafic gj sony need 345 remake this is my favorite it didnt suffer from sequelitis if any it actuqlly improved from the last it added new features introduced new characters and even a more compelling story lastly a strong musical score by crazy ken band here we actually see kazuma be a more complete person and really placed his title dragon in the forefront my life is complete 2 yakuza games every year lets go i literally watched freeroaming yesterday and getting sad thinking it take 12 years to get it done well done sega this is truly the year of playstation god of war detroit spidey yakuza 6 and more oh yes please keep these coming isnt there a bathhouse rumble in one of these installments jesus christ those graphics are they using a new engine i can never take this games seriously ohhh yeah ps4 is the greatest i could play these games forever lol im new to the yakuza series ive always been aware of them though but finally decided to play them my question is are these remasters of the ones that came out on ps2 i seen they have yakuza 6 im guessing theyre remastering all of them hope someone can help clarify im playing 0 currently but also bought yakuza kiwami any fans here remember that period of hopelessness we suffered when waiting for yakuza 5 to get localized we thought it would never happen and now look where we are now fastest localization yet and so soon after 6 if you were one of those people who kept pushing sega to localize yakuza 5 and then eventually zero please take a moment to pat yourself on the back this has all been possible because of you we did it omg ive been waiting for this since ages finally they localized it hello playstation in europe its possible to have traduction of this game eventhough i dont understand a word of japanese i love the way it sounds 1 more exclusive this year the origin of double dragon im glad theyre bringing older yakuza games to current gen im new to the series after getting hooked to yakuza 0 and i cant wait to play this along with yakuza 6 there is a new yakuza or yakuza remake every few months now hey im not complaining omg yes take my money sega was not expecting to see this come so soon extremely hyped and glad to see the series doing so well and its official all the games are on ps4 sees kiwami 2 trailer essence of payout activated throws cash at sega is it bad that if i played 0 then kiwami kiwami 2 then 6 in that order bravo sega august 28 earlier than i expected yeah finally thanks sega it would be nice if they can also release yakuza ishin i will all these game day 1 yes just one request fix back of kiryus suit please and after this a whole new game engine one where there are no longer invisible walls okay now we need hokuto ga gotoku localise release trailer 030 his hair is unaffected geez sony my wallet has already taken a beating from nintendo why do you gotta gang up like that so if i wanted to play this series in order what should i play i was waiting for this best one out of the series imo looking forward to it 3 yakuza games released in the west within a year what a time to be alive im screaming like a little girl right now played this game years ago on ps2 cant wait to cry again playing this game such great story very good sony the best i love sony finally been waiting for this one we are not worthy all hail king sega omg thank you 0 kiwami 6 and kiwami 2 all i need now is an hd port of 3 and im good yes my favourite yakuza best story imo i wanna see the yakuza series from the beginning before 6 and i also want kenzan ishin and dead souls to be remade or maybe make a sequel to dead souls and have kiryu majima saejima goda daigo and akiyama kill zombies once again and also the ladies get a chance to go out zombie hunting so the guys wouldnt have all the fun haruka sayama hasegawa asagi show them that girls are total badasses just like the guys not only zombies appearing in tokyo but in osaka sendai kyoto nagoya hokkaido hiroshima aomori and okinawa as well always liked this game keep improving it please sega hori shitto i was not expecting this and this year too booooooooiii 2 yakuza games a year now what a time to be alive oh babymy dragon is rising wish sega was this generous for the ps3 era i never bought 5 i was hoping for this game to be called something else instead of just adding a number at the end well have the entire yakuza series remade in no time very nice shouldnt this be called yakuza 2 kiwami this is what ive been waiting for yes yes but please please please also release english subs version of yakuza ishin i will buy also make fight night for ps4 these games are awesome because we are tired oh shooters yakuza looks great but the only thing stopping me getting into this series is the english subtitles when the stories this deep it needs english voiceover this series will never hit the heights they want it to if they dont put the extra effort into it i cant believe how fast they are localising it normally we have to wait 2 to 3 years this is a dream come true well done segaatlus localisation team they gonna localize this fast this is rad i had recently replayed the original yakuza 2 last year and so happy to see kiwami 2 get a release date at this exact moment my excitement cannot be contained thank you much for listening to your devoted fans sega man im playing all these games in such a wrong order lol started with kiwami then 4 im waiting for 0 to go on a sale then ill get 6 eventually i already know what happens for the most part because of the reminiscing features really nice addition anyway so i can not worry about missing much this way such a good series my boy kiryu is finally getting the attention he always deserved here

this comes out i will be able to play through the entire yakuza series d this is literally perfect based sega just hope i have enough cash to grab both this and y6 another nintendo classic i feel like announcing it this early really undersells y6 now we need a remaster of the yakuza 3 4 and 5 on ps4 to complete the collection never clicked on a trailer this fast playstation i love your consoles espically your ps4 but i was wondering can we get free ps plus instead of trying to buy it every month and year because some people cant really afford it or are pissed that they literally only get a 2

announcement you will have my support i love this series day1 batman the enemy within episode 5 wow cool definitely buying wow i need to play 1 dont worry he didnt kill anyone 227 eugh resident evil 7 sound effects i sure wont be using that heat action how to do the 224 heat attack when i always piss my friend off and he unfriends me last heat action kiryu wins brutality last punk makes a great ships bow ornament dose any one now how to get someone in a chokehold for the life of me i cant figur it out i want to do essence of dynamic throw and i cant get it right pleas help methanks kazuma is so nice to doctors he makes them lots of new patients with all the concussions and broken ribs and severe near life ending injuries 001 that will always make me laugh kazuma is such a monster breaking a beer bottle over his head and his reaction is to just look oh really now kiryu had to be fucking around with some these kiryu hmm it tuesday i should go beat random thugs up today now how to make them cry for mercy without killing them yakuza 6 has the same heat explosiongs wtf heres hoping the english version comes out soon kiryu is a merciful and would never kill anyone fuck kiryu did not take the tekken 7 noctis dlc reveal well the very last one had me rolling 222 how do you do that one i like the heat action where he murders the dude oh wait thats all of them how i can unlock the heat action with the 2 twin weapons and 350 the wood weapon stuff and the baseball punch in head and 505 ty for answering i mean unlock in full game hehe i guess it was the heat of the moment is there a new version of the music called tracker in this game last one hurt so bad even i flinched 333 fat shaming at its finest which has better combat kiwami or this one one thing i hate about 6 and kiwami 2 so far is that the impact sound effects are totally out of sync you hear the attack land well before kiryu actually makes contact which triggers me a little 214 daily reminder that kiryu never killed anyone yess they brought back the classic baseball bat heat action its nice simple and brutal the other ones were too flashy and comedic to me fun fact the sound that plays whenever a qte in this game is prompted is the same one as the one from kiwami 1 makes sense though since they both had the same sounds playing back in the original versions of the games im betting that the theme they use for the majima boss fight in this game is the same one as the one from kiwami 1 damn it where is the infinite tonfa whack heat action that was my favorite one 523 kurohyo 2 reference oh god the one with the iron let me just iron out the creases in your face pal the last one tho i was wondering when you were going to upload this eariler but then its here well as a playstation player i only feel betrayed now this series will always make me cry but this time its not for the story too bad theres no yakuza for nintendo switch xbox weebos rejoicing ok now what about the yakuza 3 to 6 coming to pc ahaha ps4 has no games we dont even have to pay its on game pass ahah now we need it on switch since yakuza is not on xbox playstation and pc xbox fans are in for one hell of a treat i love this mini game nice vid guess this would be my final video for yakuza kiwami 2 hostess club wonder what i should work on next as a person who lived in osaka for over ten years i have to say this is awesome and accurate i really want this for pc 2 more weeks roughly i should be getting it via fed ex are they quick i live in uk so its a long trek and our mail import services are flawed 29 that motion blur turn made me dizzy a little bit how did you extend your heat bar youre the only one ive seen who has done it from the thumbnail my stupid ass thought u were actually in front of don quijote i was like oh cool a japan vlog lmao man i wish you could play yakuza entirely in first person can you imagine performing heat actions like smacking a dudes face repeatedly with a traffic cone or bodyslamming a punk with a bike or grabbing a fool and kicking his body into a corner bending his spine in first person just played the demo they really improved the combat in this game this just got me more hype for yakuza 6 and praying that this game gets a localization announcement at playstation experience youtube compression really does a number on 1080p videos these days but in person its clear and sharp heat this junk up after listening to this suddenly i want a game called yakuza kawaii with gender bent kiryu and majima nico jams pole up guys ass dick shot me damn it im not using their lifeless bodies to open doors anymore nico you seem to be forgetting that kazuma kiryu has never killed a man kiryu being a convenience store clerk must be harder than we imagine also kiryu kicks everything off shelves orders employee to murder someone with a microwave the maid pose made my heart swell and explode bye yall im loving this game so demon much bug spray s op plz nerf aww going back to jail again nico i cant decide if your resignation is good or not x this game has so much personality its glorious we have the bada daddy kiryu the crazy but lovable majima the sweet loving daughter haruka and many more however the highlight is the game ui with its savage attitude calling ryuji a problem child xd also nico you must do a heat action on the bridge just grab them and then youll see one of the most hilarious things ever in the game xd 1341 enemies also learned the beauty of entering a building without the loading screen 5944 dynasty warriors time nice it would be nice to see you play one of them i love the fight your way out of the building part of these games i gotta say the ragdoll physics in this game is beautiful lol 1359 1440 worldstarhiphop certified with the blue check mark and everything the photographer is literally taking photos while flopping around like a fish lol kiryu shrugs off more bullets and knives than a terminator does he even seems more hell bent on defying the laws of physics what if in every episode the intro where nico sings baka mitai gets more and more louder and distorted with every episode to the point that at the end you are no longer able to tell what is happening kiryu i learned that screaming makes you more powerful hrahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh kiryu why do you have it out for me ryuji you stole my nickname you know what i have an idea how about you live stream yakuza kiwami 2 letsplay part 4 in either youtube or twitch please omg that comment of the day made me laugh so hard cause of nico laughing so hard xd after playing yakuza 2 please play yakuza dead souls plzz its funny as fuck the true reason selfies became a thing kiryu started it rising from the shadow thats a substory in yakuza 2 you better play it monokid would be so proud of all the manly poses kiryu needs to be shirtless more often 1408 heat this shit up fam it be hilarious if now every cut scene that ryuji appears in hes just missing a tooth ryuji from persona has a ryuji goda cosplay in the dancing game you know what im starting to miss the other japanese intro the one thats not the weird rendition of bakamitai 910 we never found out what happened to him after yakuza 0 fun fact nico in the original yakuza 2 kiryu actually got on top of the chandelier and punched it loose to make it fall onto the guys below hold upwhere is harukas puppy another reminder to give ryuzaki the komaeda voice we all know the reason why she arrested dragon daddy kiryu right its because hes too damn sexy ok between this games skill list and spoil sword chronicless well sword spoiling stuff we gotta find a way to stop these games from spoiling the plot or just ban hammer them in addition to selling merchandise convenience stores also have printers and atms and allow customers to pay their bills and internet purchases which is useful since many japanese prefer to pay with cash they also allow customers to pick up tickets parcels and airbnb keys there was even a sidequest in yakuza 0 in which miho asked kiryu how they could improve the convenience store and one of the options was parcel delivery don quijote is the largest discount store chain in japan and sells a wide range of products including food clothes electronics costumes swimsuits suitcases binoculars bicycles ecigarettes and sex toys it also has souvenirs and rare food such as green teaflavored alforte and yakitoriflavored pringles the dotonbori store is also famous for its massive ferris wheel which was shut down for ten years and was reopened to the public just this year now kiryu can take selfies with all the people that he totally doesnt kill poppo guy was fired for cooking that deliquents head poor poppo guy rip 2018 2018 at poppo convenience store yusuke ryuji you strange obsession with pants must stop we have to beat that rubbish mentality into submission nicob its possible to combo into the charge kick see a guide here if you have the time httpsmobiletwittercomkhayyaambuttstatus1037023288374034433video1 japanese thatare obsessed withamerican cultureare called westaboos im dead seriousthats what their called also in tokyo is a borough called ropongi never go there else your going to have a bad timethe locals their dont hold tourists in high regard and you will be denied service at most places talked to like your an idiot due to being a foreigner seriously this is starting to become my favorite thing about this lp the amount of knowage for japananese culture is so intresting if you had told me that i would be obbsesed with this culture before yakuza 0 i would have given you some strange looks i know this is sappy but thanks for sharing what you know guys 11223 oh youre glowing with awesome power i shall glow too then instantly gets his ass kicked to the floor i think the japanese variation for weeaboo would be a westaboo i cant believe kiryuu is actually using doors like a normal person and not kicking someone out this game is ruined poppo employee thank you for helping sir even helps kiryu microwave a thug afterwards poppo employee get out of here and dont come back kiryu dame da ne dame yo dame na no yo i jist kinda noticed this afterwards but in order to complete the substory overcoming your fears you should be able to do so in the next chapter the whole modeling substory could be the next last time on yakuza kiwami 2 pretty sure youd die if you got your head microwaved there is a spin off where there ancestor fought naked in a sauna its called yakuza ishin 11247 the dentist of dojima dont judge kiryu for using the insecticide like that he may be scared of bugs though now ive got an image of him using that heat action to kill a spider in harukas room what huntress i dont see one ultimate tag team dad off dragon of dojima kiryju and louse cannon date vs dundun and riki fight 10746 kiryu im gonna swing from the chandelier from the chandelier omi alliance goons the fuck a weeb is a word for anyone that indulges themself in another culture to the point they believe they are from there and kinda insult the culture depending its just mostly used for anime or japan obsessed people thank you theanimeman actually a weeaboo is a mostly derogatory slang term for a western person who is obsessed with japanese culture especially anime often regarding it as superior to all other cultures basicly its just cancer i wonder if this ryuji has a goda complex okay so fun fact in the original game kiriyu jumped on top of that chandelier and punched it off hey nico if you finished your way about you start buying dragon quest 11 its a new game 11532 kiryus thoughts welp here we go again kiryuso your the director mitsuoyep call me poison 1do it kiryu 2 nope naw no way 3 be an ass and leave westaboo is certainly not a very well known term but these kinds of people do exist what is mostly seen is ameriboos kiryu is so powerful he make extra bullets in a guns chamberi gunonly on bullet left kiryuwhat gungun gets scared gets on more bullet by splitting the other one some how kiryu not impressed so shoots the bullet and breaks over some dudes head and somehow kiryu still didnt kill em mizuno approaches kiryu about modeling me kiryus gonna end up in a banana hammock i just know it that or topless 5 minutes later me called it nice eye candy though daddy kiryu more like zaddy kiryu hes fucking jacked holy hell fan service a japanese person obsessed with america is a freeaboo i think persona 4 may still be in nicos mind your blood splatters this canvas of mine kiryu cant eat chicken because he knows nugget is watching him about nicos question on whether the cop lady has a kansai accent look at it this way pretty much whenever they say stuff like ya instead of you or doin instead of doing its meant to convey either a kansai accentdialect or just a rough manner of speaking or both kiryu i never could abide an unfair fight you just had it out with daigo ryuji and you just didnt kill 200 of my goons your point last game we were blueballed with how we didnt get a kiryu banana bar version this game we were blueballed because we didnt get to jump on kiryu then and there shave them gotdang legs boi the term used for japanese who are obsessed with american culture is americakabure kabure means like irritation and is often used to describe medical symptoms so americakabures literal meaning is something like people who got infected by american culture that said america or english culture is so prevalent in japan now so nowadays the term americakabure is not used as often as before never use it on people oh yeah baby nico no man i thought all this time all the omi alliance was ass but turned but half of them are well looks like kiryu lost a couple of years again and he basically just got out too man japan using english words for chips seems good advertising i especially love these called fuck your mom wait if you ever visit japan i would recommend going to don quijote i actually got a monokuma onesie from there youd think joker would be kiryu but hed clearly be majima so is the millenium tower gonna blow up every game now so far the only time i havent seen an explosion there is during 0 and back then it wasnt even built at first ryuji stole pants but now he kidnapped his own father what a yakuza jin goda looks like hes hiding the bust under his chair for the japanese theyre called westaboos japanese people who are a bit too much into western cultures are at least in the west not sure about in japan itself known as westaboos one of the people ive heard being that is kohei horikoshi aka the mangaka for my hero academia whether that is actually true im not sure but i wouldnt be surprised honestly i love how nico always takes the time to look at all the details like in the store so many people would just rush past all that but i really appreciate him just slowly taking it in ryuji theres only room for one koi and one big dragon even as a straight woman even i have to say dayum at karou gurl can get it at last nico meets arguably best girl of the yakuza series kaoru sayama sorry goromi fun fact in the original translation she was referred to as the yakuza eater but that was changed here for kiwami 2 as yakuza huntress which sounds better also due to not being a hold of her voice actress yu daiki here in kiwami 2 kaorus voice actor is aya hisakawa she is well known for her roles as palutena in kid icarus uprising retsu unohana in bleach judith in tales of vesperia maya natsume in tenjho tenge ririko kagome in rosario vampire midler in jojos bizarre adventure lola and chiffon in one piece and finally bulma in the dragon ball series replacing the original voice actor that passed away last year a true testament in playing best girl roles ive heard the weeaboo equivalent for american culture is called a westaboo dont quote me on that though there is probably another word for it in japanese but who knows starting to have a gut feeling that you will be using different styles this game i mean 10 years in prison and not forgetting the styles in kiwami 1 might just be devs decision but 1 year out of prison and forgetting the styles may be leading into something new but theres the possibility that this is the only style in the entire game im not entirely sure if thats true though i know nothing about this game im sure a few others have mentioned this but there are actually real brands in the game you wont find any in the convenience store but im pretty sure all the vending machine drinks come from suntory a japanese brand known for their japanese whisky in fact you can pop into some bars and see that some of their drinks are actual drinks in case you havent noticed that in previous lps i forgot if you pay close enough attention youll see that they occasionally place real products in some of the cut scenes maybe youll recognize some of them really helps make the game feel more immersive i like to pretend that those shutters are straight up just metal and kiryu is just punching through that shit cuz hes that badass 3 i just realized does that mean kiryu can finally go into pizzala unless there isnt one in this game was that bakamitai in the place where the guy wanted a good knife it was then that kazuma kiryu was sentenced to prison for another ten years until the current year of 2018 where he discovers that haruka has become the babymetal singer whose voice would surely echo the devils song otometal my life today on vlogs with kiryu takes a selfie with a beat up majima on the ground look who i found again majima just smiles in pain and murmurs kiryuchan fun fact takashima in the original yakuza 2 was actually a lot younger in addition the moment in the escape from omi hq with the large chandelier was way more ridiculous as kiryu instead of dangling from it and swinging around actually started punching the chain host to the scaffolding that made it fall in the first place kiryu and ryuji start an intense fight picalo descends from the heavens picalo kiryu d o d g e beginning of the episode nico man i really hope ryuji will be a sympathetic villain those are the best end of the episode and then he kidnapped his own dad still waiting for to use that one heat action that involves a beautiful girl bystander or something like that i think western people call japanese people obsessed with america westaboos but i do not know what other japanese people call them if it is anything like latin america its probably wannabes nugget got to be the best real estate chicken by literally eating the competition if nico gets the chance i hope he gets kiryu to take a selfie with majima 4354 okayasu is that you ryuji kept telling everyone how he was part of the phantom theives so he was kicked out this soon lead to depression and drinking and then joining the yakusa they tried to kick him out too because he couldnt keep his damn mouth shut but using his trademark pipe he kicked all of their asses and gained his spot kiryu literally decided to be an ass and leave xd majima as a stripper also he trained hostesses in yakuza 0 somack daddy majima not sure if you know but you can travel from kamurocho to soutenbori and back with taxis and the kamurocho lockers has an item in the lockers that helps you find more locker keys thank god you cut down that opening theyre called westaboos when kiryu finished off ryuji did anyone else think of captain falcons fair also called the knee of justice kaoru always makes my heat action moist goddamnit why are all the daddies in these lps having son problems i thought kids were supposed to be having daddy issues 4942 hey look its japanese gandalf 1415 okay that guy is fucking dead and you cant give that kiryu killed no one excuse so yakuza 0 was about the empty lot yakuza 1kiwami was about the millennium tower and the inhabitants of the top floor yakuza 2kiwami 2 is about the millennium towers top floor exploding im starting to see a theme here omg nico actually knows what hagendaz is hell yeah hagendaz for life in the original version to looked much younger and with a different hairstyle they changed his model to look like his va i could never abide an unfair fight said the guy that just beaten the shit out of unarmed dude with a golf club not to mention ripped his tooth out with smuggled pliers 2722 fuck this shit im out nico try heat action with knives and swords before storing them they will prompt a different but more brutal heat actions 2931 he wasnt gonna be a model he was gonna be a stripper xd ive never been more interested in a video game before all i needed was a dad to start flexing after daigo fight against ryuji daigo kiryusan that guy is a tank kiryu take the chairman and get out here daigo daigo ok trying not to fall over jin hey young man do you want to sit a bit and chance places you dont look so good so in the original chandelier heat action kiryu straight up punches the thing until it falls it very well might have been haagendaz they do sell it in japan in japan they refer to people with obsessions as otaku so theyd call them america otaku in the west wed call a japanese with an american obsession a reverse weeaboo i feel like this game is going to make it progressively harder for you to pick what to use as the last time clip as in theres just going to be too many good ones for you to pick just one uhm nico i dont think hes slamming it into their groin with that pole hes aiming higher and at a smaller spot not a fair fight cuz he had a fight with daigo kiryu just took down half an army a bit late and someone probably made the joke but ryuji goda is the same ryuji from persona 5 but hes adopted now look blond hair and stuff ryuji seems like hes gonna be a sympathetic villain are we watching the same game here from what i can tell ryujis just powerhungry then again weve just started but i dont really get the sympathetic impression at all from ryuji so far its best girl not sae i see kiryus never killed a man streak continues with the microwave well done daddy kiryu kiryu already took out one dragon whats one more you better not say two nico b please do not use a weapon on the final boss of this game plz nico introducing a whole bunch of characters this game me well they had to fill up those empty slots from everyone who fucking died in the first game at least were getting a bad ass woman cop wholl be cracking skulls the moment kiryu took out his pliers this became an unfair battle how is ryuji supposed to fight without all of his perfect teeth the kneeeeeee kiryu is a falcon main ryuji didnt actually steal pants for just reasons hes stole the pants because he didnt like the high schools kids that wore them and heres an article from 2014 about a bontan hunting incident that supposedly happened in osaka httpswwwgooglecomurlsatsourcewebcd1ved2ahukewjszyxjlcpdahwwnuakhvkcan0qfjaaegqibbaburlhttps3a2f2fsoranews24com2f20142f052f222ftwoboysbeatenandrobbedofpuffypantsosakaslammedforbeingtrappedinthepast2famp2fusgaovvaw0l2iekcogo6noyvsljjum3 sowhere was kiryu hiding that pole so glad you found the microwave heat move without being told about it first its really hard to come across by accident but its so goddamn cool the first time it happens 034 hey your shorten the intro nicob why daddy kiryu shopping for family friendly items to use on family friendly people still zero kills truly a top daddy hmm i kind of wonder now after seeing the but spray heat action if grenades have a heat action where you just beat up someone using the grenade 3203 i wonder what happens if haruka were to see this 3 i could just imagine haruka appearing out of nowhere and says haruka err daddy what are you doing kiryuu haruka daddys busy haruka okaynice heart pose by the way are you going to work in a club soon kiryuu inner monologue im gonna kill poison kaoru has a really soft voice for such a badass bitch some cultural notes its yankee except not really yankeeyanki is actually what they call delinquents in japan im pretty sure kiryu did kancho with a ten foot pole there how much pole can you stuff up a mans ass well microwave this bitch 1412 the justine bieber haircut poppo employee just killed someone which kids dont do this at home to learn self confidence nicob sing bakamitai please stop teasing us sees thumbnail nico meet the best girl of this game yakuza kiwani 2 has a clan creator system kiryu may not have killed anyone yet but that poppo store clerk sure did 1344 with the power of the dragon engine not even shops are safe from kiryus wrath oh my god kiryu is becoming a super saipan xd the blue aura such awesome demon power so does does nico know whee the dick is that pole attack is clearly up the buthitting their tailbone like why is he taking a hit to the backside as a dick hit when a tailbone or up the butt maneuver is 110 more likely and believable wow kiryu reversed his social link with really guy on the same day he created it truly a sad day for our favorite daddy now ryuji may be one big buff tank but can he master bakamitaikwondo kiryu kiryu stabs a dude in the gut never kiryu shoots a man in the head causing his car to explode killed kiryu slams a pot over a mans head likely causing his brain to bleed internally anybody kiryu poisons a dude by spraying them in the face with poison interesting note both kiryu and ryugi have the word for dragon in their names this along with their tattos i think kind of shows the two are somewhat conected even if oposites in personality also the pole attack wasnt a dick shot but yes kiryu giving them a back door special why couldnt they call it eastaboo instead of weeaboo youd think itd be simpler than that then again now that i think about it those obsessed with peeking would become peekaboos wouldnt it kiryu dose know they can crop his face out in photo chop right wow mr libidos been working out since last time i just realized that nugget is totally dead even bernie has her own heat action when fighting against that heinous towel poison mitsuo speaking of which i want you to show me contradiction something so unmanly your manliness comes full circle kiryu contradiction huh pose as a cute maid pose as a superhero pose as an ace attorney kiryu summons desk desk slam kiryu objection edit i just noticed the fact that poison explicitly said a full circle wow what a coincidence i can totally see majima hanging out as a strippernicob 4210 store clerk get out and dont come back kiryu leaves the store and comes right back in kiryu hey buddy store clerk didnt i tell you to get the fu store manager hello treasured customer what can we get you store clerk wtf manager didnt you see that this madman just fucked up the store suddenly gets fixed like nothing happened wtf is going on kiryu and the manager talk like nothing happened and not long after that store clerk mind exploded haha ps and in case theres any confusion its pronounced archangel zol it just spelled wonky because it includes my name it too pps did i just assume that you would pick me as the next comment of the day the answer is yes bwhaha i really like kaoru sayamas introduction weeaboo is pretending to be japanese and poorly imitating the culture causing accidental disrespect towards that same culture like katanasodom from street fighter so after having microwave bad guys for lunch daddy kiryu decided to fulfil his life long dream to model his perfect body to the world including being a cute maid and taking multiple selfies it was the best day daddy kiryu ever had around about 1410 has become the best moment in a yakuza street fight so far in this series i really like the way you can interact with the environment i should try and i get this game as soon as possible i missed bernie so much so glad bernie is back oh my god i love her already 4335 im glad the yakuza series continues the tradition of having random npcs try to pathfind their way past kiryu and other npcs during conversations which basically amounts to walk forward get stuck try to walk anyway give up and walk away after the events of zero nugget usurped kiryus realestate empire and used the profits to establish holdings in the fast food industry selling chicken 5940 kiryu shoves stick up a guys butt nico argh right in the dick and this has been basic biology failure with nicob hey nico i think this game has an extreme heat mode of some sort when you press r2 every attack uses heat but getting hit doesnt cause you to flinch you deal extra damage and certain heat actions are available nico i saw this in some gameplay when youre in a fight and youre close to stores you can go in the fight doesnt stop you can still curve stomp assholes in the convenient store and yet again another new character who thinks they can handle kiryus awesome daddyness the big dude on the front of the casino is the shinto god fujin as the god of winds he uses that sack on his back to manipulate gusts he and his brother raijin god of lightning are feared and respected in japanese culture likely due to their connection with storms storms and typhoons are so common in japan that they actually prevented japan from being invade by the huns two times in a row the brothers are also known to be pretty mischevious if i recall correctly ive had a really crappy day today and im grateful for nico meeting best girl this episode today kiryu never killed a man he has other people do the killing for him god damn 1419 kiryu and ryuji reminds me of kenshiro and raoh from fist of the north star 1338 to 1343 thug gosh darn it he went inside oh well thug2wait guys here me out why dont we follow him inside i know it sounds insane but if we want to kick this guys ass which is impossible we must go inside that building thugsyou are a genius imagine if majima and ryuji meet up now man thatll be so awkward lol hey remember that one time you tried to steal my pants as a kid and you thought i was a middle schooler too best girl is here does anyone remember what the fortune teller from yakuza 0 said would happen for this game i know the last game was the long prison sentence and that theres something about children at some point what was supposed to happen here i completely forgot yes nico she has an osakan accent you see how she was saying ya instead of you and other stuff like that thats how you can tell they typically translate osakan accents like that now that i think about it we heard a lot about the omi alliance but weve never actually met any members until this game the omi have just done shit in the shadows also interesting developments the omi alliance isnt really odd when it comes to the yakuza affaires but their problem becomes that they are just too big the power balanced shifted in their favor and it also caused problems too many men to watch out making factions hell i could even see big time rivalries and infighting happening that them needing to balance out was more a necessary for the them then it is for the tojo its actually very interesting and also seems like something that can happen i imagine if an organization gets too big they do come up with problems with the power structure and for people like lawless yakuza thats a big problem for some reason i initially read that as tigress after watching the video that misconception seems more forgivable 4338 daigo alright theres no turning back now kiryu yea well speaking of back wtf is going on right behind you i mean youd think at least hed buy you dinner first people have always said microwaved meals were harmful the poppo guy now has a larger body count than kiryu this video taught me how kyriu gets away with not killing anyone he just has everyone else do it for him he didnt kill that guy with the microwave the the store attendant did kyriu never killed any of those people in those shoot outs the drivers were all responsible for their accidents kyriu didnt gun that one guy in the chinese restaurant the chinese mob did 1409 i was really waiting for nicos reaction to that one if you find yourself getting chased by thugs you dont want to fight against examine the nearest vending machine theyll always despawn when you do that i think the same goes for examining the coin lockers lol that microwave heat action xd 3150 found next episodes previously on clip that moment when you realize that kiryu glows blue and ryuji glows red the symbolism already appears the poppo employee is the one who pressed the button kiryus body count is still zero hey nico just letting you know that there are a total of 16 chapters in this game and everything can be done by chapter 13 i recommend doing everything then for reasons i cant get into kiryu heat this junk up clerk on what setting low well done or high kiryu leaves im never going to subway again even though he shot a helicopter out of the sky and used a waiter as a meat shield against a machine gun he never killed anyone im pretty sure they all survived maybe kamishiro wasnt the reason ryuji stopped doing track maybe it was a fateful encounter with kiryu one day im gonna counter all the best girl comments and say that the best girl hasnt been introduced yet d nico breaks the wall look at kiryu opening doors all by himself and not throwing someones dead lifeless body to open it for him hes come so far x3 nicob can you play the ps4 spider man on your channel please best girl i wish shed kick my ass tbh edit also i gotta say im really lovin nicos voice for daigo seems like its a staple for kiryu to beat the hell of an entire army in the first few chapters of every game i can dig that its so freaking badass i think in the original yakuza 2 the title of this chapter was the yakuza eater i much prefer huntress though you should try using knife and katana heat actions before you stow them you get a different and more brutal heat action but the weapon is destroyed in the process also when it comes to brands boss coffee is a real brand you can buy those ingame and you wrecked the poppo store one of the best things about the new engine is that you can take battles inside and absolutely wreck stores and of course when you wreck the store you get chased out lol so that charge attack combo the light charge attack can break through guards and while theyre stumbling back from that if you let go triangle theyll get a heavy dropkick to the face you have to let go square first then triangle the in the name of art substory is amazing also when it comes to the camera if you point it at npcs walking around some of them will react and when it comes to th 3823 hes got wrong thinking in anguish we trust you should fight nearby npcs that have substories nico all their heat actions will be different kiryu has neve killed anyone fires at a ryuji lacky if weeaboo is slang for wapanese mixture of white and japanese then a japanese person obsessed with englishamerican culture would have to be japanese mixed with american so in other words they would be japamerican the entirety of the yakuza series can be summed up in one quote let us beat the rubbish mentality into submission well i once heard a name for people obsessed with england and its culture teaboos the term for someone obsessed with western culture is a westaboo or at least that the term we use in the west for people like hideo kojima who are clearly enamored by western culture i couldnt tell you what the japanese term for it would be maybe a gaijin otaku is it just me or are their lip animations just a little weird in this game or at least the sidequests they looked pretty natural in the previous games but here they feel somechanical id not matter be embraced by those stunning guns xd kiryu when last expected he participated in gay porn mgzine collection im guessing it has to do with the new engine for why they stopped showing off the magazines they werent in 6 either but im pretty sure they had them in 34 and 5 nico didnt notice that kiryu can make expressions in the selfies and no worry nico if kiryu is asked to model next time in may be the real deal since third time is the charm just to let you know guns are nerfed hard in the yakuza games made with the dragon engine their only real use is to do that heat move where kiryu shoots a guy in the chest three times and then pistol whips him otherwise they always have one bullet each when you use it and bullets no longer stun you or even hurt all that much like they did in the last two games nicobs voice as poison mitsuo sounds like a mix of hercule satan and johnny bravo finally ryuji grew up to become a badasswait what this is yakuza oh sorry i thought you meant the persona one carry on i think they call the japanese ppl that love western stuff are called gaijin if im spelling it right and there are some called gaijin hunters ppl that use western to learn english be friends or love the idea of having a western boyfriendgirlfriend theres normally the bad side of a relationship if i remember right it been while seen i looked it up but yeah play crisis core 3042 that day kiryu turned super saiyan 10746 used to be a different qte in the og game then it was a giant wooden chandelier that kiryu punched 50 times over and over until it fell on all the dudes ok i just have to get this out about the episode and the voice actors the voice for the female cop does not fit at all with her personality i did not expect her voice to sound so high pitched when she looks like one of the top detectives in the division nico should try and bring fights to other stores and places to see if anything cool happens imagine what haruka would think about kiryu modeling i can imagine naked kiryu vs naked dunban discussing manly muscles together now 3450 meanwhile majima hears about these photos and decides to steal the tojo clans 10 billion again to buy all of them for himself 3113 god this is weird i love it 3204 and it somehow got even weirder we are not worthy we are not worthy 3206 okayi seriously love this game when poison mitsuo appears kyriu was like screw this i rather bow down and beg majima to take me under his wings than work with a guy that looks like that i think theyre called a westaboo like all might speaking of the comment of the day thing did you know that p5 dancing in star night has yakuza costumes as dlc and i bet you can already imagine who ryuji is dressed as it looks like kiryus social link with the poppo employee has been reversed daigo is covered in leather from head to toe child let me buy you new clothes please before even watching the video shes sexyedit also she very clearly has a kansai accent she uses informal language like aint after all as poison mitsuo goes to take care of kiryus photos okay now to destroy these amazing pictures of kiryukuwait where did they go elsewhere eeeh cee hee oh these are just precious this photographer knows his stuff i love how these came out you look so hot kiryuchan 24 hour cinderella ringtone starts playing majima here majima this is nico send me a copy of those pictures wait how did you doesnt matter but if you do send a copy to me i can guarantee youll be on the council of voicesafter the nonary game arc is done add kiryu to the council and you got yourself a deal deal nico you mentioned about how you werent sure if the game was using real food brands i can confirm that at least a few of the packaged stuff are real brands like the boss coffee drink from the vending machines they have funny commercials for that particular brand too am i the only one that kinda wants to see her and haru battling it out its just haru and her grenade launcher vs this lovely lady and her kick butt fighting skillsid pay to see it on the next episode of death battle 3045 please tell me this was in the original game cause if it was yakuza 2 predicted super sayian god super saiyan at least 6 years before it existed edit 11230 now its super sayian god vs super sayian god super sayian whoever made this game is a fuckin prophet i feel like the comment of the day is like that one sub story from yakuza zero for majima and kiryu if someone gets three comments of the day do we get to meet nico in real life and get a golden colored picky penguin plush the true work of art kiryukun and his manly friendmajimakun now we just need kiryu to turn into a super atrist yakuza 1 random but i mean cmon this is the mighty lord of allinternet oh snap we are getting so badass ladies in this game hope there will be more in the future and future games oh my god the new heat actions are amazing best game ever are you gonna play the other games on the ps3 or wait for the ps4 remasters i like to pretend kiryu is sending all those pics and selfies back to haruka baby girl look look where i am and when i am done you can come too and we can get chicken wings and crab from the crab place and whatever else you want baby girl just stay away from weird people asking you to model weird stuff happens that was t r u e art seeing this just makes me want to see kiryu and majima in smash even though it most likely wont happen holy crap mrlibido got buff the writer stuff you said at the beginning is kinda of wrong the crime novelist you mentioned hase seishu did not write this game he was the supervisor to make sure the game is accurate about yakuza and the criminal world the actual writer of the game is masayoshi yokoyama who has been the story writer since 1 all the way to the fist of the north star game though hase seishus influence on 2s story shouldnt be ignored as yokoyama directly worked with seishu for this games story from what i know seishu came up with the police plot ryuji and several prominent characters of the omi alliance while yokoyama came up withi said more i would spoiling them its common misconception though hase seishu is definitely the cowriter for the story there was some flak when this game came out iirc because the guy takashima was alot older then in the original game here he looks in his 30s or 40s when the og y2 has him as late 20s at best 3502 poison but we made art together all the best artists agree that to show a model at there best to show them naked yusuke damn right okay we seriously need more karaokeb can we make this another stretch goal for the patreon nico sings the full versions of our favorite yakuza songs whos with me legend has it kiryu buys that school girl outfit offscreen and would later find that he needs to become a bodyguard of a well known yakuzas daughter but he must do so without her knowing kiryu then has the marvelous idea he enrolls at the school of the girl as kirara kizuma a young girl from overseas and with the schoolgirl outfit he bought the plan went off without a hitch as he went undercover he slowly got close to the girl he needed to protect they would soon by pure luck become the best of friends and everyday kirara and the girl would skip home out of the fun of it kirara was the best damn girlfriend a girl could have she knew how to talk to her she was a fun hop girl and she knew how to punch the ever living shit outa any punk that harassed them kiryu was no more only kirara remained meanwhile haruka was just to the side trying to figur out what the fucking sht uncle kaz was doing with his life ive always preferred my delinquents extra crispy with a side of fries 2722 kiryu hear him out be an ass and leave wait is the model side quest a reference to the yakuza 0 side quest 030 that killed me d d d d trivia time the word weeaboo is actually not a japanese word see back in the day people would use wapanese short for wannabe japanese now over on 4chan accusations of wapaneseness have always been pretty common but supposedly it once got so rampant that the mods started banning people who included it in their posts in response the anons took a nonsense word from a webcomic called the perry bible fellowship and started using it in its place at this point the mods could have started banning people who used weeaboo but they recognized that if the anons could pull one replacement word out of their asses they could always pull more out so they let the matter drop and thats the story of how weeaboo became a slang word heres the comic in question if youre curious pbfcomicscomcomicsweeaboo i was thinking that maybe we can fight in the stores now since no loading screens fucking christ now nico has to fight in every store now ho boy its me wife damn the poppo fight was amazing thanks for checking out places such as poppo and don quijote so in depth nico i really wanted to see all the detail put into them from now on every video that gets posted nico will yell louder and louder until he reaches a frequency beyond human hearing daigo where the hell had you been kiryu i was posing topless for a really buff guy in a speedo who was taking pictures of me flexing and doing weird anime poses daigo ummmmm kiryu dont be surprised really its honestly really normal for me daigo normal how many times have you done this to people kiryu i dunno maybe the amount of times of the people i curbstomped on the way here daigo and how many was that kiryu 90 daigo oh god working with you is going to be a pain you slightly hear in the distance majima shouting thats right you tell em kiryu chan while he too curbstomps the living life out of people the end one of my favorite yakuza fun facts kiryus voice actor voices cranky the crane in the japanese dub of thomas the tank engine all i can imagine is kiryu getting roped in to record voice over lines for the dub of a foreign kids cartoon i think we can all agree that would be like the most yakuza sidestory ever i cant wait to watch nico play project judge when it comes out i just watched the english subbed trailer and the hype is real 2721 essence of nope oolong tea are we sure its actually oolong tea that does bring up an interesting question what happened to nugget after yakuza 0 cause im pretty sure that only kiryu cared about a chicken enough to figure out that it could manage a company tips when exploring the city as you already found out there are hardly any loading screens anymore on top of that you can actually explore the different buildings even more than you could before for example you can actually go up to the second floor area of smile burger i know its a little thing but you should try to explore the city as much as you can so that you can on top of that you can also take photos just press the up stick on the dpad and itll let you do that yakuza 0 makoto turns to the darkness yakuza 1 akira turns to the darkness yakuza 2 ryuiji turns to the darkness does this mean yuskue will succumb to the darkness in yakuza 3 such injusticeplot twist junkonort was behind it all another ryuji trivia in persona 5 dancing star night ryuji actually got ryujis costume from this game as a dlc costume holy shit kiryu just microwaved a dude to death wtf i just love how this game has so much to offer the story is so deep and rich so many different mini games to try the fighting in this game is so fun and yet nico spends about 8 minutes watching the food displayed on the marketstores this is why i cant watch these gameplays with anyone else its just not the same xd hmmm i do wonder if japan does its weird flavoring for foreign foods like the donuts like anyone seen those japanese kit kats and how weird some of the flavors could get do they do the same with other foods a japanese person obsessed with american culture is called a freeaboo oh god its super kiryu blue does that make majima vegeta are they so strong theyre aliens why cant i stop staring at kiryus abs these questions need to be answered kiryu come on man arent we friends clerk you wrecked my store kiryu it was asking for it that aura kuryiu has during the photo shoot it actually a hint to mahanic introduced later in this game wont say what is to prevent spoilers why this quest comes before you get it is werid 1153 dont know what they call people like that but im pretty sure we just call them westaboos a good example of one is good ol hideo kojima a more recent one would be horikoshi asahina black and white donuts monokuma theyre called despairnuts asahina are you sure you wanna go along with that name well nico theres actually a whole alphabet in japan dedicated to foreign words its called katakana and yes they really really like english i cant type it out in signs but some of the words look very funny in romaji like orenji jutsu witch is orange juice terebi television keekii thats cake its really adorable and the looks of the katakana signs are told to be cooler looking too 1408 kiryu doesnt kill people he gets other people to do it for him and then they tell him to get out of their store because he made them murderers in order to preserve his nokill streak actually the boss coffee you keep seeing in the vending machines is an actual brand in japan i remember seeing a vlog of someone drinking it when they visited japan it was stephenvlog by the way go watch him if you want to hes cool he met the creator of earthbound in one of his japan vlogs which was amazing and apparently the commercial for boss in japan has tommy lee jones in it i know its not too unusual to have american celebrities in japanese commercials i remember seeing arnold in some commercials back in the 90s thanks to those commercials being on youtube but i still find it funny sometimes xd i guess you could say that guy felt the heat im sorry ill leave now 915 after 0 nugget was taken up by the bubble poppingsending him into a blaze of starvation and maddening hunger his family tried to console himbut his mind was too far goneand nugget consumed them all for 399 at poppo convince storeswith 20 off with the coupon cod emy family died for thisyou too can taste the everlasting despair of a chicken whos life was destroyed japanese people who are obsessed with western culture are called westaboos now i know why people wanted you to fight in a convenience store xd nico press up on the d pad to take pics and if you point the camara at npcs they do a kawaii pose why am i not getting notifs anymore w 1147 so apparently the japanese think english is super cool holy shit it goes both ways senpai likes us back dont know if anyone has mentioned it yet but the term at least ive heard used when referring to japanese people who like american culture are called westaboos or something to that efftect i think nico dont know about first of the north staranimemanga but they will launch a new game in october 2 the game is made by the same yakuza creators and i think is a good game to play is it just me or does nicos vids always look like its running at 1620 frames its always so choppy for me no other vids are like that for me the manliest dragon you could always take pictures the game has yet to explain this to me bestgirlincoming we should be getting a new kingdom hearts 3 trailer tomorrow so hype for that well when i say new i mean an extended trailer that just came out last week even so new stuff should be shown off nicob starts episode nicob spends next 10 min in a convience store the pickypinguins love it nicob starts episode nicob spends next 10 min in a convience store the pickypinguins love it i was looking through the latest gameinformer and saw a review of this game i thought huh i wonder if nico will upload yakuza today looked a my tablet and saw he did there is a story mode where you play as the mad dog himself majima and it help explain his side of the story in this game a japanese person whos obsessed with western culture is called a westaboo youd be surprised by the amount of japanese people who idealise western culture specifically american i remember looking at images of such peoples homes and theres sections decked out in old cowboy and just american stuff and its mostly because thats how they think a typical american home looks like even down to the cow skull decorations they just think the culture is cool just like how many of us westerners think japanese culture is cool theres even the equivalent of a weaboo for them but with western culture i cant remember what its called but they have one i also remember a image my friend showed me quite a few years back about a dude who absolutely adored england culture from the meals to the old medieval armour and weapons they have its pretty cool to see this stuff elsewhere edit westaboo the word was westaboo feelings for yumi in kiwami and naked mens photoshoots in kiwami 2 kiryu swings both ways baby i dont know if this is intentional or not but how they set up daigo and ryuji in 0 was pretty cool with kiryu seeing daigo in kamurocho and majima seeing ryuji in sotenbori it kind of foreshadowed a sort of rivalry between daigo and ryuji similar to what happened with kiryu and majima although i wouldnt call what weve seen with daigo and ryuji the same at all xd a japanese person obsessed with western culture is called a westaboo oh goodie he shortened the intro now my ears are in less pain a shame that baka mitai is not in this game but dont worry nico there is a much much much more depressing and heartbreaking song later the feels in this game are insane baka mitai can however sometimes be heard while in shops kiryu vs thugs in convenience store or spike spiegel vs thugs in convenience store who done it better the first waifu is here 042 cool live fanart 1555 nico needs to pay attention to the music more often you can return to kamurocho any time using one of the taxis what an amazing deal 6 for a 300 mile6 hour drive best girl has arrived i repeat best girl has arrived new waifu bois i like girls who can beat me up 905 chickens are cannibalistic by nature nico so its all good d kaoru is legitmetly an amazing character shes part of why i love the story to this game so much shes best girl kaoru are you the kiryu kazuma kiryu yup kaoru come with me to the station kiryu is this because i didnt kill those 30 guys last week kaoru no its cuz you gave a 10 year old playboy magazines 18 years ago kiryu oh incoming best waifu in a yakuza game this time mama is home you should really try some heat moves near the river youre gonna love them man cuphead has really gone too far i mean hes beating the shit out of everyone instead of shooting them with his invisible gun heck he even brought one of his themes with him nico a weeaboo is someone who mistakes anime culture for japanese culture and its usually more of an insult i think youre thinking of an otaku for someone whos into japanese culture 1416 kiryu has never not once killed a man even here you can see that kiryu didnt kill that man the radioactive waves from the microwave killed him and who turned on said microwave the fucking store clerk that store clerk is a murderer kiryu is innocent 3208 and there you have it folks kiryu is now officially the new best girl end of discussion hello once again nico while i dont have a massive tips comment this time around as youll have to wait a while before you get another one i do however have some interesting info as you can imagine kiwami 2 has some changes from yakuza 2 however one of the the weirdest ones is regarding takashimas model here he looks for you like in his 60s right well hes actually 40 here you have a reference pic to og 2 httpsiytimgcomvipgumfrhmyqhqdefaultjpg in kiwami 2 the change was done to match the va playing him but still pretty weird im so hyped for this game one of these days nicos pronouciation of japanese words in this intro will stop hurting my insides that day is not today i still want this shit as my ringtone though here comes yakuzas best girl she is the embodiment of justice baby hopefully the next yakuza lp will have an actual counter for everytime kiryu says nani maybe there will be as much as donalds i got it in kh 2 so i learned that kiryu is supposed to be a virgin throughout the whole series apparently httpsegabitscomblog20180510yakuzaseriesproducerinmypersonalopinionkiryuisavirgin best girl alert dont look at me like that goromichan video title is dedicated to her yet shes only important at the very end nico captured this chapter alone perfectly holy shit is that a badass women protagonist nani best girl alert best girl alert best girl alert daddy kiryu is ready to feel the heat also on a side note nico an effective way to use charge attacks is to hold both square and triangle at the same time then after you do the first charge keep holding triangle while attacking with square so that way you can chain charge attacks mid combo let us beat this rubbish mentality into submission 3048 kiryu goes ultra instinct this substory was fucking amazing lol also nico try holding triangle while running during combat and release it does about the same amount of damage as the regular drop kick but it looks way cooler is that a waifu i see edit oh pls guys im just an innocent bystander dont drag me into the waifu wars the huntress aka more perfect than the foolishly foolish fool are you going to play the new kingdom hearts and or spider man or smash ultimate hey lol i legitimately want a seriously sung version of bakamitai in the last episode edit oh and best girl btw best girl best girl best girl ahem wouldnt it be funny if the man in black kiryu keeps getting messages from was actually not amon after all but one of us picky penguins this is definitely one of my favorite games and everytime i see this notification i squeal like majimachan yes yeeesss nicob mmmmmmmmmm give it to daddy anguish oh well hello best girl edit sad there wasnt a new pic for majima but still a great intro still willing to sing for the intro nico edit 2 since you brought up nugget you could switch majima in the intro for nugget holy crap im early very heart warming trailer and i finished k2 its a masterpiece hilarious considering they put that broad on a bus forever after 2 i never played 3 4 an 5 so can somebody tell me what happened to her please as she wasnt in 6 i thought kiryu was a virgin until ive watched this vid i just finished the gamei loved that lovestory 3 why is there no happy ending whats the name of the background music i just played yakuza kiwami is this the next game to the sequel someone gotta tell me how the games go in order plz so heres the question are they planning to bring kaoru sayama back to the remastered version of yakuza 35 cuz on yakuza 3 back on ps2 she went to us to do some stuff and she said to kiryu that when she comes back shes going to look for you sooooo that gives us a big question whats the name of the song in the background the best game on earth has to be yakuza whats the name of the song being played this is awesome we need more romance in games i love the yakuza series so much i just like his super though face at the end now kiryu can go stay with her without any hesitation after kazuya 6 happy true ending i miss those days when no one knows about this game people were hard to convince guess i was cool before most folks my sausage if you played 6 youll know what im talking about yes i ship it now meet up again after the events of yakuza 6 and be free together maybe kiryu can make his own family i am a big fan of yakuza please sega and sony give even more support to this fantastic game wow i played it and ps2 cant wait for ps4 let the poor man be happy for once shut up and take my money kiryu gives me the feels got to ahinjuku japan and buy the official tojo clan emblem i dont know if i should buy kiwami 2 or song of life i like everything except his response at 032 ah uh does he have to be portrayed as a gorilla his stylin with his hair and suit hes already expecting this hes a classy gangster not an ape now i am fall in love tooarigato arigato nod the stuffed head they say its time to move away from kiryu to a new yakuza without kiryu but they still use him again and again and what a endingcant believe they did that in the final 6th game i cant wait to fight ryuuji again with hd kiki do you love her are you riding i wanna break teeth not date an asian cop no im not crying i just have somethin in my eyes this is truly a great franchise western audience should be more respectful with this game this is an outrage majima is the only true waifu i shouldve got an ps4 this is a nice soundtrack piece is this for kiwami 2 or anyone know the name of the piece please and thank you i remember wayyy back in block buster i picked up yakuza on the ps2 and it was english dubbed i have played all 3 that released on ps4 and i just have to say its on the same level as gta where you can cause extreme chaos in gta you can box up any thug in yakuza and it never gets old hope majima and makoto returns kiryu never stops serving life lessons with his quotes my man kiryu pulled a kabedon on her its sad to say that nothing comes out of their relationship help me out people ive ordered yakuza 0 for the ps4 comes saturday my question is is this the yakuza to start off playing in order to get into the series your replies please x kiryu hase only one true and abondoned love real estate i love this game all i care about is my destined fight with jo amon does anyone know the name of the piano soundtrack in the background i cant wait for this game also i am begging you to announce yakuza 35 remaster for ps4 i finished this game on ps2 and i loved it this game will be hype can someone please knock me out till august 28th i feel like the next few weeks is going to drag cause i want this now her head is too small will there be a remake of 35 what is the timeline of this game im still buying this game but i prefer the old engine and the old fighting mechanics from yakuza 0 and yakuza kiwami yakuza 6 have so many glitches during the fighte that it takes away the immersion sometimes also in yakuza 6 i hate how they zoom the camera in so close when in heat mode and much of his cool move sets are heat actions i hope they fix some of this in kiwami 2 i didnt become acquainted with the yakuza series until this current generation of consoles im in love with it now i completed 0 and kiwami and im almost done with 6 i cannot wait to play kiwami 2 on the dragon engine i miss the crazy ken band from yakuza 2 bgm some tension between kiryu and kaoru along the way and all answers will be reveal when kiwami 2 is out for the ps4 what a game after clocking in 78 hours into yakuza 6i think im ready for kiwami 2 everybody say rouge of love eh i think its a very cliche relationship yakuza 2 has the best story but the character relationships writing horrible theyre far below compared to say the portrayal of relationship of makotomajima in 0 or akiyamahana in 4 even the kyodaibros relationships are also written better in later games tldr 12 has better actionoriented story but 0 36 are better in making interesting characters he gave her the dragon anyone know what soundtrack this is this is cute but very sad at the same time some people dont want to play yakuza because they affraid being called weaboos lol what a pity life they had okay but what about the duo heat moves i hope kiryu marry her in 7 if have spoiler alert kinda anybody know if this version of the game still has that somber rain scene set jazz music and then shes just like okay bye im off to america in 3 such a wasted character before writing that comment play yakuza 3 and read kaorus bio youre welcome i need kiwami 2 in my boring life forbidden fruit a retired yakuza in love with a female cop it would have been better if kiryu married kaoru and fathered a child with her whay happemed to that detective woman than after yakuza 2after that it never brought out again aka one time one title romance only after yakusa 6 he still single right will this have more heatmoves than 6 and overall a better improvement than 6 like kiwami was literally the same as 0 im hoping that kiwami 2 is a bigger difference than 6 yakuza one of the few sega franchises that still is still being supported to this day and going strong another one to my yakuza collection i will never stop supporting ryu ga gotoku love this series since 2006 i sensing the feels of the ending of the game already that they will not end up together i used to fap to her back in the playstation 2 days dude i havent gotten these types of feels since majima and makoto seeing a shirtless kiryu on the cover after that trailer really gave it that romance novel feel all he needed was a rose in his mouth fake everyone knows the real forbidden love is between kiryu and majimagoromi thats it im buying all the series it all started when she cuffed me to her heart please sega let my man kiryu settle down with kaoru im so glad i jump in the yakuza 0 train this series are one of the best just letting you guys know she gets written off because the writers didnt know what to do with her in future games also this is the best story in the series ok now i really want this game oh one thing this trailer didnt include is the heat action kiryu and sayama can do together its pretty sick the forbidden romance between kiryu and mr shakedown so stoked for this this is why ps4 is worth it was expecting majima preordered shenmue 1 and 2 remastered for my xbox and yakuza for playstation both getting their fair share of asian this august waiting to add this to my yakuza collection then i can start the series i always thought theyd be together in sequels but for some reason developers decided to kazuma be alone such sweet love i still prefer the manga yakuza is a game of deep emotions love hate honor betrayal friendship loyalty etc all in the same pack no dlc required wish he had a ending like that but no my buddy got shafted in nr 6 my favorite in the series i havent played it in awhile but it seems like there are a lot of new cutscenes like a dragon extreme 2 looks im so glad i get to play all these games again in hd secret lovers this trailer and then yakuza 3 ps4 demo came out at the same time sega is on the roll in life i think the most important part is to just be yourself that ending with her making the teddy bear bow is the epitome of awww see kiryu has a soft side end of august cant come fast enough im honestly really excited for this i see yakuza i clickkkkkkkkkk why i love this game so much shame yakuza 3 4 and 5 isnt getting the kiwami treatment why sega already preorder this game cant wait for it and im happy kiryu have someone he can love again dude need it with all the stuff that happen in kiwami i peacocked this trailer is this coming to pc if not ill buy the ps4 version they should be a couple oh no its gonna be majima x makoto all over again i can feel it lol its like watching a romantic game ps what is this game a rpg or what never heard of it before but looks interesting sorry i cant unsee the but thats forbidden love meme when i see this which dragon do you guys think looks better thought this was one of the best stories in the yakuza series yakuza easily is one of the best videogame series of all timestupid casual gaming kids will never enjoy this gem what is the background music please this is urgent too bad they changed writers i like her character kiryu majima have the weirdest relationship ever be yourself but add new things like skills etc cant wait to play this game well that looked like a pointless bland story why not english guys i wanna see playstation and sucker punch bring out infamous second son 2 goddammit who left this bowl of onions here is it called forbidden romance i caaaant waaaait is it just me or sometimes kiryu has stupid face 6 mainline games later kiryu still canonically is a virgin the teddybear scene in the rooftop its still cute af i love it already in the ps2 but with the dragon engine looks even gorgeous too bad that in kiwami 2 we cant hear the crazy ken band theme that was in the original though man theyre pumping these out not saying thats a bad thing guys what is an xbox we are the dragon of dojima already have shenmue 1 2 and kiwami 2 preordered what a time to be alive i think after yakuza 6 kazuma kiryu went to america to see kaoru and they embrace each other thats my ending for them both whow spoilers guys hurry up and bring the other 3 345 in one compilation i know youll realese them in japan separately but in the west bring them together please thank you ps4 finally kiryu romance he didnt had proper romance with yumi now is his chance lol ps4 back at it again my homie just finished yakuza 6 and said it was the best game hes played in his 36 years of living you guys agree we all know that kiryus real relationship is with majima i wanna get into this series on my pspro but theres so many sequels and prequels that i wouldnt even know where to start do they get to do it that animation look different when patapon 2 remastered i played this way back on the ps2 but never finished it not because it was bad but my ps2 broke that is why i preordered it there is no way i am not finishing it this time update the playstation tv to 1080p and the new update the new revision of the playstation vita 3000 builtin l2 to r2 audio video where is the headphone jack at oled touch screen 4 gigs of ram 4 gigs of video memory 123 gb internal storage memory 1080p camera micro sd card slot bluetooth everybody will be happy for this sony i really hope kiryu get some and that woman doesnt die i feel like thats whats going to happen the rich gamer ok now im intrigued about time kiryu this is the sexiest trailer to a video game ive ever seen i want all the parts in steam i did not find does this mean we expect a kiwami 3 4 and 5 because i would be okay with that im a simple man i see kazuma kiryu and kaoru sayama together in the thumbnail i click and like the girl is pretty cute i wonder who is she modeled after so forbidden that it only lasted one game lol why am i so excited for this i have never even played yakuza before ive never played the game but let me guess doesnt end well for these two my last yakuza game was 2 and i never finished it lol i didnt think they had this kind of relationship though haha i thought it was going to be a romance like chris tucker and the chinese girl from rush hour anime the game needs better subtitles though were to small i wish sega could make sonic improvement games like yakuza more often what yakuza 6 ending spoiler kiryu gone to kaoru they are were happy together 3 if only sega put this much care into making a great 3d sonic game sega chill ive still gotta finish 0 and start kiwami shenmue 3 please take notice of this masterpiece so youll be one as well i thought yakuza kiwami is the last chapter of our beloved protagonist kazuma welp my prayer has been answered ordered it as soon as it was available yakuza is such a amazing franchise shout out to all yakuza fans please make backward compatible with ps2 on ps4 i never really looked at this game series and i have pretty much every console what game for the ps4 should i start with before this one musthaveall yakuza gamesas soon as possible and hokuto no ken o the rooftop scene was one of the best i cant wait for the hd version aaaahhhh holy canoly ohhhh yeeees spoiler alert i like to think that after yakuza 6 he went back to kauru and are living happily together never clicked on a video so fast romancing a cop xbox is green playstation is blue xbox has no games but playstation sure do kiryu getting cucked by majima in 3 2 1 sega really felt the emotion well done sega our boy kiryu is back at it on the ps4 i hope they remake all the games over these next few years yakuza is truly one of the greatest stories in videogames ever even romance is handled decently unlike many other games where their idea of romance is to randomly fall in love without any build up like getting to know each other or have intimate time not only is this romance trown under the bus but according to the writters kiryu is still a virgin i guess kiryu is the equivalent to a female idol in japan hmm it doesnt have the ps exclusive stampinggonna take a guess this is going to be on pc soon like 0 and kiwami i know this i play on ps2 and knew he will kiss her this game looks cool where that bromance trailer at tho for majima and kiryu 7 th view thanks for the guide thank you soooooooo much because of your video ive been able after almost a yr maybe a lil over lol but nevertheless i was finally able to get a perfect 8 bingo only thing is im playin this in legend mode im in chapter 5 at the moment but damnnnm did it take forever for me to finally get it plus i was was able to get a 9 like 750 pts bcuz i sunk the ball twice on the other golf thing however the intermediate difficulty is well too much only got 70 pts on that i cant stand it lol nevertheless i just wanted to say thanks this was a huge help now ive got to be with haruka lol youre saved me thank you thanks real much it drowe my mind crazy thanks man it really helped me out damn that shit was fast howd you learn to get perfect so fast you some fast learner or somethin 3 does this mod removes some extreme heat movesi cannot activate ex move after dashing to the enemies and i buy this game on play 4 well still wish it had the beatdown really well done although if i have one critique its about the base rush combo the second hit should be a lower strike to the enemies stomach rather than a hook right before the second hook kinda makes it look more like brawler style rather than dod style also the combo finishers performed after two rush combos the round house punch followed by a knee strike kinda looks a little choppy when it doesnt have that wind up to the round house punch missing i miss those move from 0 and kiwami the dropkick never gets old i understand youre making a masterpiece mod for kiwami 2 honestly i love this mod and i do want classic dod badly but after this video i understood you did great but maybe kiwami 2 made by dragon engine is not suitable for this mod if one day 6 released on pc that would be an amazing mod kiwami 2s engine ruined the possibility of this mod made battle more harder so that is not your fault hope one day we could use this mod on 6 this is nice now this is a reason to buy yk2 when i get a pc thats rad this is crazy awesome stuff dude the animation for square square triangle circle combo looks quite wacky omg thanks alexander this mod is great waiting you to make thug style for majima this mod has officially convinced me to put kiwami 2 for pc on my wishlist for the next steam sale thanks alexander the great omg youre a godsend brilliant work and nice gameplay i also really like how you used the myth from yakuza 4 ost keep it up i need 10 copies of this game with goro majima there is no new japan this is glorious if majam was ever in charge of his own country this would be the national anthem if this doesnt make you want to play yakuza then i dont know what will if i ever go to japan ill do some karaoke i hear some places have yakuza songs this is the best trailer ever released hands down what a song what a game love u sega friend yakuza must be a dark and gritty game about the japanese mafia me shows this trailer this is yakuza at its very core badassery hilarity drama and whackiness built on top of fun 138 hes wearing my flamingo shirt people having a hard time looking for videos that promote diversity when all they have to do is watch this video you see men and women in different colors and body types singing majima construction in unison if anyone ever asks me who majima is ill simply just say hes deadpool but even better im sad that we cant sing this in karaoke here for the 400th comment this is hands down one of the greatest pieces of video game advertising i have ever witnessed not only does it encapsulate everything this franchise represents in one trailer it does so with a catchy tune now this is advertising between two groups of people who want to make inconsistent kinds of worlds i see no remedy but force gary buster holmes please rise for the national anthem wow this was beautiful playstation will never top this yakuza is either the most serious crime drama or the best japanese comedy in a video game and that is why i love this series why doesnt this have more views majima quitting the yakuza to become a construction worker is one of the best character arcs ever this is one of my favorite all time trailers not for video games all time how do i find this just now o 66 people who dislike this got fired from majima constructions ah yes a serious sword fight to the death gets just as much screentime as kiryu golfing and majima singing karaoke this trailer got its priorities right you want an example of diversity done right crunchyroll this this is how you handle diversity correctly you hire people based on their talents and what they bring to the table not obligatory racial and gender quotas this is the best localization ever this is totally canon too i have to play this game song is about goro majima footage is ths kazuma kiryu attention all majima constructions employees goro majima needs your help hes been attacked in the streets of sotenbori while the poor thugs who made such a bad call will never harm anyone again let alone walk his wonderful jacket has been ruined to help him all he needs is your credit card number the three numbers on the back and the expiration date but you gotta be quick otherwise hell be late to his tojo clan meeting and wont have time to harass kiryuchan thank you for your kindness best thing i have ever seen i just got to this part last night and have been laughing about the song all day but sir we dont even know how to build anything this is just to beautiful brings a tear to majima eyes that youve done it right however the segata sanshiro song still rules i can bet a lot of money this was majimas idea for the trailer top 10 times sega beat nintendo everything about this is amazing is it wrong of me to sing along this is why the yakuza localization team is the best in the business cool where do i sign up yo is there a version of this that doesnt have the sound effects because i need to listen to it on repeat for the rest of my life this is one of the best things i have ever seen get nicob here right now this is the weirdest and yet most appropriate advertisement for a yakuza game ever why because this is literally the game thank you sega for giving us this gold im totally blessed wish i was there with you bro would sega beat r gta5 ubisoft watchdogs 2 and the creators that made sleeping dogs n by all that what would yakuza be if u drove n did missions n more fights beter then sleeping dogs over 200150 mission n submissions n watchdogs well no1 hacks on yakuza so no1 cant beat ubisoft so its against gta5 n sleeping which 1 would would u perfer if yakuza was a street gang n roaming over 1000 miles on japan n is japan a big country to put it out there n make somthing of its self cuz i sure do how bout u guys no matter how bad a day ive had this song brings a smile to my face majima construction goes international the dot is just majima with a hard hat how could this be any more perfect wow majima even hired nick fury best thing ever shut up and take my money but keep singing i love this song the smiles and construction in this district go through trevormajima industries or they aint going it is sad that this is an ps4 exclusiv i almost forgot to watch this today i been waiting for this full english version of this song for days and i tell you they nailed it game critics no game can have a perfect trailer yakuza 2 hold my beer this is quite the proud anthem xd the new captain america theme song follow the bouncing majimasan and sing along yakuza is a serious drama game involving the japanese mafia glorious if this does not sell the serie nothing will is there an auto refresh this game is about doing crimes watching this itd be hard to say this series was almost dead in the west praise be to lord majima the world will unite under a single banner the banner of majima construction new ringtone this should be a dlc for the karoake minigame in yakuza 2 kiwami this is my national anthem now 3 its perfect they really have this someone needs to tell nicob about this masterpiece this is what a video game trailer should be best trailer ever lol imagine being an employee of sega you just want to clean the room and go home but your boss bursts into the room and is like take this helmet and eyepatch we need you to sing an anthem they should call the instrumental receive you the anthem majima construction forever any applications for majima construction sounds like the cccp national anthem if it was japanese it will be better i love is song when i play the clan leader when the song come up it make smile and sing is there the japanese version of this somewhere the english aint bad just want to hear it in japanese too cant believe they make a english version of this song and it sounds as nice as the original japanese version man sega knows exactly what i want and they love giving me more kiryu and majima 3 this game looks glorious im prob going to buy this one yakuza is a serious japanese crime drama welcome back sega wackiest most badass game ive ever seen this franchise is amazing too many ugly people around where are the japanese 3rd time watching this great trailer but bummed there wasnt a

youll never get tired of bless me for the day props to literally the most genius trailer iv ever seen im so confused the perfect ad this is brilliant for the virtual on part i think you should do more dash attacks and jump attacks since they make the camera snap onto your enemy for you hi there do you have harukas requests for kamurocho aye pc fellas want some of that kiryu lover too is she gonna die like that bartender that i thought would last me 6 games but only lasted a little over one actually met the voice actor for kiryu fantastic guy very funny same voice irl weirdly self aware of the fact that he has to say nani and harukaharuka 3 times in every conservation of the game will definetly support the series once its released on pc later this year it deserves it yeah not gonna happened have you played yakuza 5 come on sega just give the man a wife already i might actually try this out this looks goos secret lovers why are people comparing it to shenmue so much both are fantastic series its weird to watch a trailer for yakuza and then whine about shenmue ay shes cute too get it in kazuma i wish she wouldve come back in the series their romance was a favorite of mine in the yakuza games best girl and ship ever and stop with the shenmue shit this the orginal og game kids copy cat of shenmue thats for sure cant wait to get my hands on shenmue 1 2 i need that shenmue drug back lol meh just give me shenmue 1 2 already tenryuu reminds me so much of kuze hes the man as you saw goro majima majima construction majima construction actually really fun based on what ive seen 457 how nice that they waited patiently for 10 mins until the two finished talking tanahashi i wonder who else of the new japan pro wrestling roster they have jo amon is supposed to be absurdly strong he is the hidden boss in the yakuza series he uses wacky and straight up deadly weapons such as the rocket launcher as it shows here the three musketeers along with mutoh and chono are actual wrestling legends in japan some of the sr people you recruit are also current day wrestlers like that tanahashi guy not a fan of the clan war stuff personally they did it in 6 too it just becomes a slog we build shit is the best tagline i have ever seen 3237 we build shit goddamnit majima hostess club is the fastest way to earn money and best to do if u want to increase majimas equipment defense also the full majima construction song is so good they use it for the release trailer where is the gameplay fake video this is ps4 pro not pc so just mortal kombatstreet fighter in open world meh and i was about to buy it thinking it gonna be kinda gta style instead of simple arcade beat em up thanks for the videosaved me 60e looks no different than on a ps4 pro its pretty bad when the older fighting mechanics are better than the new oneslol how come the cutscenes looks more bad than the gameplay can we skip or i have to wait 30 minutes long just to play the game is this running at 60fps or atleast a stable framerate it feels wierd seeing the dragon engine run above 30 fps how did you access the preload content before time feels fucking good to finally see 60fps gameplay thank you how can you have so many suscribers and screw up so badly man honestly you have the game earlier why the fuck dont you show some graphic settings and say the settings that you are playing or something i dont like to be rude at all but i just cant believe that someone that has so many suscribers misinform so much please show us the graphics options when you are so strong till you break an axe with your uppercut the enemy of majima construction are japanese wrestlers is there any other moves you know instead of rushing kicks all the time geez im kinda suprised you didnt have the same horrendous framerate drop i did during majimas intro everything in this game is like yakuza 6 ive honestly never seen such a moronic player lmfao how do you not know how to change units are you a fucking idiot i dont tend to be a dick yet youre literally so bad its giving me a headache if it wasnt for the fact you had the most episodes released i wouldnt watch your shit at all just hope that you can lvl up your character more i really enjoyed majimas story in kiwami 2 but i thought it was way too short and it doesnt let you upgrade abilities or do side missions so thats kind of a bummer i would have liked his story arc to be a few chapters longer at least and some side quests to go with it but im glad its in the game all the same id love to see a yakuza game where majima is the main focus i know he is one of the main characters in 0 and maybe his story after the events of yakuza 6 if they did a yakuza game with just majima it would be frickin awesome and they have to include his yakuza 0 costume cause that was a cool skin for him his eyepatch changed sides when are you going back to the acupuncturist cant get enough majima hes the highlight of the yakuza games nothing like fighting brazillian conan the barbarian amirite defense and health requires a bit of boosting hell ya our boi shirrako back at it again with yakuza kiwami 2 gameplay thank you gonna legally change my name to goro majima and open up a construction company if this really is coming to pc oh sega please never change 026 i can never get my ps4 to run like that with kiwami 2 is mine too weak this is the best game in the series kiwami was just lame compared to 0 but y2 kiwami is significantly better than 0 and kiwami no comparison its easily up there with ff storywise except the gameplay is a lot better ive just completed yakuza 4 and have begun 5 and ill still say that kiwami 2 was by far the best in the series although maybe 4 is second best 0 would be close to 4 kiwami was the worst in the series by a long shot though not even yakuza 3 was as bad if youre playing through kiwami and are bored just bear through it kiwami 2 is just so so so much better but kiwami is still important storywise for the series look like japans national anthem or the yakuzas national anthem lol one of the weirdest game trailer ive seen i admit the creativity but the duration was too long for my ears the reason i keep coming back majima san hes the best well this is officially stuck in my head now played 0 and kiwami now 2 perfect petition to make this the national anthem of japan when this job caught me interest where do i sign it this is like those one of those weird japanese commercials except its for americans i bet ryo wishes he has a bro this crazy to back him up at times why doesnt this have millions of views wtf ppl dont seem to realize that this was just a english version of the actual song still fuckin amazing doe wow they went all out for this trailer leave it to majima group for greatcrazy imagination 1210 just the best trailer what ever i seen i thought i click on a parody account 1110 one of the greatest game 144 gods if majima isnt the perfect crazy is it true this series might go to x1 now this is how you do a trailer great way to promote the game why am i getting segata sanshiro vibes outta this ive never played yakuza games which game to start best trailer of the year do you new comes out all rise for the japanese national anthem awesome gotta love this game so much bang for my money best trailer ive seen in a while games are taking things too seriously these days the forklift yes yes its so beautiful gooooooooroooooooo majimaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa what was the song about all i heard was majima please make the noise stop can we get a clean version of this song its so beautiful i thought tekken never heard of it wtf yakuza is a must buy 3 thank you for bringing kiwami 2 to the west cant wait for this one i better complete kiwami fast goty for me 11 out of 10 thats a beautiful steel book yakuza2 honestly now how high is sega when theyre doing a yakuza game and do they increase the dosage with each new game i think this perfectly sums up yakuza lol 1010 for creativity heres the part that had to be snipped out httpswwwtwitchtvvideos308879327 cheers never been through a game franchise with so much feels im quite surprised i thought after playing yakuza 0 and kiwami one should already learned completing certain sub stories mini games or challenge will grant really good unlockables or side stories and claiming as a yakuza franchise fanhmm i dont know just saying my feeling of wanting to know this game is equal from yakuza 0 and watching cohh skipping alot of subquests even for the reason of doing it later probably or not kinda hurts i dont think he even went for aikas or kiraras karaoke session which is kinda cool and funny 2205 the autoblock didnt work v theyll be divorced in a year i wonder if anyone else noticed that ryugi and kiryus bullet wounds were the opposite of each other just like there dragon tattoos anyone no just me then 2949 she will never learn 1 kaoru has a bad case of cutscene incompetence 2 cohh absolutely trivialised the fights with his equipment i loved it will he ever finish the game or do the majima saga theres still so much hes missing kinda felt like he just wanted to rush through the game and just be done with it when do you play majima part l am looking forward to see it for some reason i feel like cohh rushed this game compared to the other yakuza games which is kinda surprising because i think this was the best one compared to the other 2 he played thanks for those 30 hours of pure joy cohh still hate the way you fight in this game hello anyone knows the name of the track that starts at around 550 and end at around 705 cannot find it anywhere thank you in advance he blocked that machine gun but a single handgun able to hurt him utterly fantastic and i thank you id be depressed its over but i know theres more coming did he end up watching the majima saga would love to see that i wonder if cohh still doing the substories and cabaret to finish almost all of it i still waiting for yuki to join the cabaret as a hostess its a layer cake of plots from one side it looks nice from another it looks delicious but cut it any way you wish and you get what layers of plot cant wait he finishes the cabaret stuff 650 shirts off 1035 rubber bullets 2215 chekhovs gunman over here 2750 extended magazines 4100 a bittersweet end majima saga tomorrow i hope soon anyway please thanks for an awesome day and game 3445 hey man sword v sword fists v fists 1720 t and the cop from earlier in the game thanks rem better love story than twilight was that romance in the original yakuza 2 or is this something new for the remake any chance of this coming to pc like yakuza 0 holy shit that scene was hype as hell why is this video in 360p seriously 360p i dont get the nd now back to i love how kiryu just nosells that bottle to the head its in 360p my eyesssss 1500 wow that pronunciation was near seamless the grand kinda went downhill without majima i mean the waiters are pussies yup ryujis that kid who likes stealing pants from y0 also i do hope kashiwagis alright that intro brought me to tears such a amazing song good lord i loved that scene it was so epic best character introduction always happened in grand lol that intro fbhdskjfs watching porn with nicob censored edition 3650 so uh is kiryu a p0rn critic now the exact face he makes as he watches that is your best intro to date never change it drunk japanese nico singing bakamitai now we need a full version of nico singing it that blonde goon that ryuji fucked up looks like hentai kamen theres a soccer ball can i kick it yes you can hears nico sing this is the quality shit i want everyday i live for the i peacocked your mom line omg nico club sunshine is right theeere 5506 thats me hiding from whats about to happen 3818 please tell me im slow 2420 you can never go wrong with a classic joke kingdom hearts 3 nico please sora needs you now majima will have to come and kick kiryuis butt just for not noticing club sunshine let us beat this rubbish mentality into submission i like how i get to watch nico watch kiryu watching porn 3806 omg i just noticed what u were talking about nico y best opening ever i laugh so hard omg i tears up so much i so hope if we ever do the cabaret side stuff majima will appear to help out since he is skilled in that field also you walked by sunshine and not addressing it had me upset for a second best intro ever i kinda actually teared up a bit you have a beautiful voice nico 757 personal note its interesting the way that they spell sotenbori on the banner is soutenbori maybe its like a translation thing or something about the way they pronounce it 2423 goddamnit nico anybody knows this reference i relate to that intro on a spiritual level im worried about nico why do you seen the porn shop oh god i thought i saw that too i thought there was a yknow a mans uhm uh uhhh you know what i mean dont judge me guys have you ever heard about this anime called back streets girls gokudolls its about three yakuza forced to become idols by their boss i immediately think about goromi the first time i saw the plot you should definitely check this anime if you havent 030 i swear to god i will buy you single d i cant stop laughing literaly im dying here xd big hug from france and keep being you nico oh wow youve already started this that felt fast i have noting particularly useful to advise but can you try starting at npcs when you do they start to look away oh and based on 6 you can immediately start punching when a battle starts and the screen is blue you should throw a person off a bridge with a heat action osaka is sometimes called the kitchen of japan and doutonbori is the gourmet town of osaka the clown at 1709 is kuidaore taro the mascot of the restaurant kuidaore which closed in 2008 now it stands in front of nakaza kuidaore building which has my favorite karaoke chain on weekday afternoons you can sing for two hours with a drink bar for 640 yen if you look out the window of the karaoke place you will have a good view of the don quixote signboard 532 theres a sign that says penguin in the train 3800 i know exactly what you thought it looks like what was happening to that girl i couldve sworn she was holding something or something was in front of her face lmfao nico 5703 thats an ax kick nico and very accurately named that comment of the day was a god dame essay paperlook like a better essay then mine i do at school and really impressed with the amount of details god that intro killed me nico you are a legend how did you manage to golf the most boring sport ever hilarious this is going to be a great series how do none of these thugs see kiryu as buff and ready to fight the battle music has a jazz feel to it omg 3028 i just died in line at chipotle dammit nico cant come back to this one for awhile cuphead cuphead delicious last course yakuza kiwami 2 2934 watching nico pass by club sunshine and not notice it made me so sad one of these days millennium tower is gonna blow up for the millionth time and therell be someone in the crowd who says geez again the song in the intro is so perfect nico hahahaha it gave me a good laugh somewhat related to the bit about exp from food from the comment you highlighted should you want to grind a lot of exp the easiest way is probably to buy a bunch of appstims to decrease your hunger then go buy food allies are characters who will help you out in some way if youre fighting while near themjudging from the first one you got shell kick people well you know where still aniki its pronounced annnahki the englishbritish way of pronouncing as i fucking love ryujis accent man just one mistake made in this video at 3719 kiryu also needs his hand for holding onto haruka maybe some headpatting as well ryuji goda the dragon of bontan pants makes his return 5548 kiryu still hasnt killed anyone at all shout out the to nexus427 for a list of notes dude i bet you play this a lot or just have a good memory its your boy kiwami bob i love him now edit i peacocked your mom is the best thing thats ever happened to this earth suicide rate goes down to 0 i can see why this game is considered the best these cutscenes are badass ive been getting goosebumps the power was out where iived i just got around to watching this just when you thought the video store couldnt get any creepier it does still a great episode overall wonder if the intro will be as long next time fun fact about the train that kiryu and daigo rode in the beginning of chapter 2 for those who dont know that train is called shinkansen or bullet train in english from what i know it is the fastest train in the world correct me if im wrong it can take you from tokyo to osaka in a whopping 2 hours while a bus and plane tooks 8 and 15 hours respectively unfortunately it also has the most expensive ticket price compared to the other ways of transportation a single trip from tokyo to osaka costs around 13k yen around 110 120 usd plane is around 6k 8k yen depending on the season 50 70 usd and a bus trip will cost 3k 5k yen 25 40 usd hope this little information helps especially if any of you picky penguins are planning to travel to japan see you next time fun fact i just found out yuya the host at stardust shares the same voice actor with all might from mha what is nico seeing at around 3748 no matter how hard i try i cant see oh my god that picture really does look like something oh god now im mentally scarred nicooo you missed the club sunshine paused at 2929 hooow nico go back to the cabaret club at some pointtheres a surprise for you c pleeeeease keep nico singing baka mitai thats the best of the episode lol i like to imagine the piano guy playing the bgm fight music in the grand the ball must look way too shiny to bernie nico are you telling me you dont analyze the porn you watch 3747 its so stupid but i cannot unsee it now how has goda not heard of the dragon of dojima becoming the chairman retiring and becoming a regular citizen walking as a default feels like it was a nod to shenmue because yakuza is considered to be a spiritual successor to shenmue nico fights in front of club sunshine is sad that it doesnt exists anymore did kiryu ever find out what happened to nugget the chicken i know random but curious if he did so like is that intro gonna be a full cover eventually or what nico oh my god i liked these games before but now i everything was just cranked up to 11 graphics music fights this is truly amazing the opening is so beautiful goro 24 cinderella goro come back to us again as a cameo again nico you have to go to the karaoke with majima you will cry man that intro sure made that patreon worth it that intro makes me want to deadass cover bakamitai maybe one day 1709 oh dear god that is all kinds of nope and creepy when you get close to that clown it looks right into the screen dont worry nico youll see majimaa lot is anyone gonna mention that at 2930 club sunshine was right there kiryus video shop face made me uncomfortable also i get what the poster looked like im ashamed nico you passed club sunshine it was right there whyy officially the best intro i dont even fucking like golf but here i am watching nico play a golfing mini game for like 10 minutes xd the gods have given us a godly intro welp now i know not to watch your yakuza videos when its late because i will sing the intro every fucking time that intro tho nico im dying xd also tower blown up last save was on the 11th of september which in american date system monthdayyear is 911 coincidence i think not rest in piece japanese weaboo intro and my ears as far as the smaller sotenbori is concerned its actually modeled after what it was like in yakuza 2 because of that some of the areas that were implemented later in the lower part of the map are not there its kind of dumb but hey also i would highly recommend upgrading the ability that increases the chance of dropping money asap has been a huge help and the drops for it become quite frequent with the allies the game doesnt do a good job of telling you but if you are in or near a area where a ally is there is a chance that they will throw you a item to help in combat thing is the game doesnt explain that you need to actually unlock this ability by buying a skill with your exp points i believe its in the heat section yes ryuji is the one who stole the pants from high school students because they where picking on elementary kids and ryuji was in their class also nico you should press up on the directional button when youre not in combat youll love it and try to fight someone close to those poppo stores you can do a heat move inside thats pretty awesome that ball is pure concentrated evil bernie has watched enough disney movies to know that nothing good comes from lime green the intro brought tears to my eyes theyre allowed to smoke on trains i could watch nico golf for hours i was screaming at my friends today as we were walking back to our dorm in seoul they were looking for the train station and i was trying to tell them that the train station was right there theres a big flashing sign right above it later i get back and i pull up a nicob video and at 2923 im screaming at the video he was looking for club sunshine and i was trying to tell him that club sunshine was right there theres a big flashing sign right above it why does this keep happening to me 2929 nico you just missed club sun shine so i assume this is the ryuji goda that ryuji dresses up in p5 dancing starlight ok that has to be my favorite intro i think kurokawas character plays up the fact that a lot of people in osaka tend to be more friendly and engaging with strangers as opposed to tokyo also ichi nino sunshine kiryu im busyoh yeah baby more haruka break down the door dad im so dissapointed in you kiryu haruka tthis is not what it looks like honey please haruka i hate you dad pull out a gun kiryu oh shit harukas got a gu and thats the end of yakuza kiwami 2 credit roll theres always a sacrifice to everything no porn video was shown so its not age restricted but you have to watch kiryu orgasming that intro i like it but agh my ear it hurts i really want to see nico play actual golf i can just picture everyone else being all quiet and stoic and then nico rolls up and screams at his ball that golf rimshot bit at 2423 fucking killed me this game runs in 30 fps why are the videos on this game in 60 fps best intro ive seen yet and nothing else best intro yet even in yk2 we cannot escape majimas 24 hour cinderella as a refresher the guy you are remembering of wanting to be the dragon of dojima in 0 was keiji shibusawa the final boss omg that intro is gold i was sing along and yes i did see what you saw in that poster at the video place dont know what that says about me though i love how everyone picks the peacock your mom option lol i cant believe porn with nicob became kiryu jacking off with nicob i was honestly not expecting nico to do a take on baka mitai as the intro just goes to show you that you just cant get enough majima seriously you just cant is that a permanent intro its thirty seconds long xd nope that was him ryuji stole pants nico not sure if you know this yet or not but yakuza is the western name for the series in japan it is called ryu ga gotoku which translates to like a dragon i remember during the previous games you brought up a few times why it was called yakuza when you werent in it i kept forgetting to comment about it someone else may of already so sorry if they have is it me or is there something wrong with kiryus right hand at 628 in the video like is his forearm snapped cause it doesnt like look right like hes holding a fake hand in his sleeve and its actually not situated naturally that dominatrix sub story gave me some assassins creed brotherhood vibes o3o i just realized know that when kiryu send thugs flying into the ground they dont fall in that cartoonish way of butts in the air kiwami 2 really changed things around holy shit watching kiryu watch those videos sure was a trip xd just fyi in case you dont find this nico because i think the sooner you know this the better and if you guys dont agree with me feel free to downvote or whatever on the dpad press up then press triangle kiwami 2 is looking much like a rpg with all thoso stats to work on that mustve been the longest intro gag yet love the intro nico but maybe shorten it to bakamitai please dont let it be that please dont let it be that hear the intro i got my wish but my ears also ryuji gorda went from side quest boss doing elementary math to main character doing middle school math nico please try getting into stores nearby when a random street fight starts stuff happens and there are location specific heat actions too i saw what you were seeing on the poster youve done a good job identifying it all puns are intended i do think they made the camera rotation and walking speed as defaults as a way of the game devs to say look at the scenery we worked our butt off on it and yes ryuji goda is the same guy from yakuza who was stealing peoples pants to see him come this fardamn the intro while funny is rather long and is probably gonna get annoying fast maybe cut it down some in future episodes ughwhy did they do the adult videos like that its gone from slightly awkward to really uncomfortable everything else looks amazing though the bontan pants stealer is now the dragon of kansai nico age does that to people but not ryuji dudes got a body of a linebacker since he was ten every since akira left ryuji hasnt been the same 5914 hey nicob remember that big tall guy in yakuza 0 whos wearing the school bag and you bumped into after meeting with the fortune teller hes back d bernie was right never trust a mysterious ball you dont know where its been nico has an extremely powerful technique possibly the most powerful there is he is able to keep surpassing himself with the intros time and time again im scared and i still missed that 24 hour cinderella intro from the last game xd this is indeed the same pantstealing giant 12 year old from yakuza 0 remember the fortune tellers final prediction that the next guy kiryu bumps into will be a significant part of his fate and he bumped into that kid yep a fun tangent persona 5 dancing all night has a yakuza costumes pack and they had that ryuji cosplay as this one 532 its us the picky penguins wowowo 555 ryuji ryuji what are you doing with yakuza ryuji ah you got me heheh missed opportunities to say i like to ride my bicycle lets stop me now nicob btw try a charged running triangle i believe you will like it so i saw a project judge trailer pop up on my feed id like to watch it but can anyone tell me if that trailer contains any spoilers for the main yakuza series i watched 0 great lp nico played and watched kiwami 1 and played watching too of course kiwami 2 thanks hey nico just as a bit of quick advice for lp funsies go into a convenient store like a poppo run into a shelf and hold down the sprint button and wiggle the stick back and forth if you keep at it something really funny will happen nico i really dont get what youre pointing out ok not through the whole video but nico literally stared at club sunshine and then said nothing so unless i got the name wrong i feel i must inform nico that i did in fact spot club sunshine and here we have one of if not the biggest reason 2 is considered to be the best game in the series ryuji is immediately interesting hes got a natural masculine and primal charisma he commands easily and he blazes his own trail in two scenes they show you hes not just a solid antagonist hes a perfect foil to kiryu an exceptionally similarly talented man who took the same path as him but for a few major turns i would love it if every intro is a different photo that outro was so cute aaaa such an amazing vid too keep it up nicob 3 i see ryuji hasnt lost his penchant for saying things he shouldnt since his time with the phantom thieves he literally walked in front of club sunshine at 2927 and didnt notice kiryu experienced postnut clarity new patreon goal for 10000 you find out what nicob is talking about of that picture of the girl hey nico if you get 300 points in each of the golf pin challenges itll spawn a substory there and once you beat it youll unlock a golf club exclusive attack and heat move i think they dont show it now is cause they could only barely get past the rating with vanilla stuff but stuff at that time was anything but vanilla the reward you got from the masked barker is a new heat move to buy called the essence of sadism you can only do it right next to her 3800 i didnt know what nico was talking about until i look at it the seconds thinking of what nico could possibly be talking about and then i saw it i blame horny kiryu 5154 blonde guy sprouting out all his groups secrets sounds familiar that better not mean that kashiwagi is dead hey nico dont know if anyone else has said it yet and if they have im sorry for repeating it but you were at club sunshine at 2930 mark of the video 3808 im not sure what youre talking clearly its a beautiful girl nothing wrong with that that intro was true beauty 2929 nico i love how you walked right past club sunshine o no ryuji back in 0 was actually a 4th grader that looked like a grown man like despite his looks ryuji is a decade younger then kiryu and he was the pants thief you should check out the spinoff game judge eyes its also set in kamurocho but its a dective story tried out the demo and loved it 020 now i want to here nico sing baka mitai i always like to guess what the previous clip is going to be for the next video its like a little game i like to play while i watch your videos sometimes there are so many hilarious clips to choose between i love your videos man keep staying awesome nico he was the same kid stealing pants 2922 you can see club sunshines sign in the upper left portion of the screen a little bit later you walked right in front of it and looked right at it come on man i know youre more observant than that hay nico when youre done with the yakuza sires they released a fist of the north star game but i think its not going to be released in america for a bit more time to be translated but it was created from the people who made the yakuza series and ken is voiced by kiryu in japanese with the same steam form yakuza kwamii so it would be a great game to play and you should or shouldnt see the trailer its up to you officially the longest previously segment ever does anyone else find it kinda annoying that everytime someone says soka i see in these games nico always says it right after edit 711 is just one example this just in the millennium tower has exploded again what are the odds someone put subtitles for nicos intro please i need it first off intro made me laugh second that woman is staring into my soul xd edit the scene with kiryu not being fazed by the bottle smashing him in the head reminded me of when one of those gang members in durarara smacked shizuo so hard the stick broke in half he beat the shit out of them xd i love this intro you were staring right at club sunshine at one point it was out on the main street in stead of the ally yes he is indeed the pants stealing big kid he also appeared in kiryus quest dealing with the fortune telling lady hes also who i like to call ryuji sakamoto from persona 5 all grown up and became a yakuza you walked past club sunshine aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa that has to be one of your best intros ever this game is extremely well detailed and im really starting to enjoy this game let the war of the two dragons begin anyone else want to see nico do an lp of gta v the final boss fight will probably be like ryuji goda give me your pants kazuma kiryu never ryuji goda we only need one pants in our world aint room for more wouldntt ya say nico doesnt even compare ryuji gouda to ryuji sakamoto who both have the same hair color not even when he was playing persona 5 at the same time as yakuza zero just thought i would address the elephant in the room and point out the cheese for this game similar to shotguns in 0 and tiger drops in kiwami theres an easy one here as well simply charge square and hit an enemy to stun them then tap square to end the enemies stun animation there is then a second or two where they will return to their default stance use this time to charge another punch charge square tap square charge square tap square etc tada infinite stunlock that works on all bosses havent tested amon yet though the battle theme for sotenbori is called outlaw lullaby and it is a jam easily one of my favourite battle themes out of the games so far i love the and now back to 3810 if i understand this the woman is right next to a guy that is happy to see him when yakuza kiwami 3 drops nicob is probably gonna make the most amazing intro involving both kiryu and haruka running through the 80s get it because of the 1980s ill shut up now bernie touching the ball was the real highlight of the vid the ragdolls are glorious nico you walked infront of club sunshine you even stood in front of it at 2916 got a key than walked away there is sunshine here silly goober i know what that looks like nico and it took me a sec to see the picture since i see no one mentioning it nico 2930 club sunshine still exists i wonder if the girls are still there s ryuji goda dragon of kansai 2nd patriarch of the goryu clan fan favorite villain ryuji is honestly one of my personal favorite villains from the whole series hes just sogreat i cant say much else but hes amazing cant wait for you to see more of him all i wanna know is where the hell is the pizza la the pizza saved the day in yakuza 0 it needs to return that intro is glorious who sang bakamitai better kiryu or nico god i laughed and cringed so much good job nico okay i cant be the only one that want a proper bakamitai cover from nicob waitthinking back on yakuza kiwami and zero after having seen that scene of badassery incarnate i was reminded of our badass daddy in xenoblade dunban and i finally figured it out you seein the final fight of each yakuza games there is always a tendency for both the protagonist and the final boss to take off their shirts and go down in history wellwho else gets more naked in an fight thats right dunban is a yakuza and he is the dragon of colony 9 does that mean thoughthat riki is the dragon of noppons o i would pay for a fight between riki and dunban yakuza style might as well add some hints now that you gained your first ally you unlocked the possibility to learn a special heat action triggered when near that ally during a fighttrust meits worth it also yes ryuji here has been charged with the crime of stealing pants coming soon to store near you its the nicob picky albem listen to nicos takes on beloved video game music as well as some other notable songs 24 hour cinderella i can believe i can fly the eye of morishige and 1 song despair blitz coming soon also i laughed my ass off on that intro i dunno about you but having a lot of questions after watching japanese porn sounds pretty normal to me so just a tip eating food is probably the best way of getting exp so the digestion and stomach upgrades are real good when you havent watched any of the yakuza lps and you see the new intro me tilts head blinks a few times and stare in confusion huh but still manages to laugh because nico is a cinnamon roll nico you should try to charge your heavy attack while running towards an enemy daddy kiryu got some nice new moves you should know that you can charge your attack at any time like when blocking attacking or on the ground so you can do a square charge followed by normal square attacks while holding triangle into a triangle charge its awkward to do but it is strong you got two guys called ryuji who are blond got no fucks to give about being subtle and would rather solve problems beating an asshole up epicnesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss good luck nicob that intro is out of freakin control 2930 nico you walked right past club sunshine the intro tho nico you missed club sunshine at 2922 you can see the club at the top left corner 3815 still fixing the comments but no one seem to get the weird thing you saw nicob i need answers i cannot believe nico missed that massive club sunshine sign 47 seconds in and i was so ready i fucking love that intro well we got nico sings much earlier than i thought we would and hopefully we can see the exciting conclusion of the arc berniesama vs ballkun did you just nut shot that guywith a pole 2922 its right there nico club sunshine is right there they just have a bigger fancier place now wait did i see club sunshine yesterday i had a friend over at my place and he found a video from nicos yakuza kiwami opened on my browser paused right during a hostess cutscene it was really embarrassing and he thought it was porn so i had to explain to him this was a legitimate entertainment and that it was ok to watch porn with nicob then we watched the video together and he started to understand and then i watched some more so now im finally caught up with the series d 2920 2935 no nico you just walked passed club sunshine you may laugh now but we are all going to have to endure a thirtytwo second intro now and like it adult video shop segment oh nico youre so innocent xd some cultural notes han is the equivalent of san over in kansai gotta love regional dialects i believe in some cultures pouringreceiving a drink with one hand is a sign of superiority while pouringreceiving with two hands is more like a sign of respect which you can see in that one scene where ryuji pours a drink for one of his subordinates 2923 i see club sunshine hey nico just wanted to say that while there is a sidequest inside the sega arcade you can unlock a new minigame by talking to the guy with the green triangle over his head standing on the left in front of it iirc it does start a siedquest as well also while its a bit weird how the videos are handled here it was replaced by something even better you will see what i mean when you unlock it just do every sidequest and you will come across it eventually a good trick for the golf minigame is to aim for the flag when you hit it it will guarantee that the ball lands in the hole or at least in the red area and i cant wait for you to try out karaoke d its official the final words of bernie are the best part of the videos yes nico ryuji was that kid who stole guys pants in sotenbori and believe it or not he was only 12 in yakuza 0 he did also appear in kiryus story briefly when you talked to the fortune teller and she said you will cross paths with a young man whose fate you are entwined with or something like that shortly after that kiryu bumps into 12 year old ryuji who then says something about liking kamurocho and then leaves also in the persona 5 dancing spinoff game all the characters have yakuza crossover costumes and funnily enough ryujis costume is ryuji pushing for this again if you meet a man named ryuzaki in a side quest please give him the komaeda voice ryuji was indeed the kid stealing pants in that one sidequest he also ran into kiryu and the fortuneteller warned him that his and ryujis fates were entangled i dont blame them for not remembering each other they only met for less than a minute 18 years ago also based on his voice ryuji seems to be the guy who was on the other end of that phone call at the beginning of the game the one you thought sounded like shimano which means that mysterious guy in the cutscene was likely the one who caused that explosion ive been here a while and just want to point this out for the future when pronouncing japanese names every vowel is pronounced the same a ah e eh i e o oh u oo also please dont try to grind for levels nico since its very easy to get overleveled in this game i hope no one heard me die of laughter from to the now back to screen club sunshine at 2928 nico wonder if there are any familiar faces im sure everyone is giving you the same tip but just to make sure check your heat actions youve unlocked a new one that you need to buy and use as soon as possible so i saw he walked right past club sunshine could he not go in or nico you can also bring you foes inside convenient stores and fight inside them if close by them and also nico that ally you got their when you fight near that area and you get a certain heat action from them thanks to kiryu watching those dvds he really feeling it now jesus shit the new intro 2358 we shall never forget nugget nico on the other hand brand new sotenbori brand new kamurucho brand new story brand new experience hears nicos purposely butchered version of baka mitai same old nico we need a full version of nicob singing bakamitai p nico golf tip the bingo golf is hard as fuck to beat and you have to do it as one of harukas little missions theyre back by the way clearing it all squares also unlocks a special golf club heat move but dont do it until haruka wants you to cuz its really tough and you dont wanna have to do it twice that fucking opening i almost spit out my water at work xd xd xd can nugget appear in the photo on the intro 2922 club sunshine d i spit out my water when i saw 24hour cinderella majima in the intro this game was sponsored by boss coffee the coffee that makes you boss it sounds like a joke but that is exactly what they did all those drinks in the vending machine have been sponsored by real life companies the yakuza series are always on their shameless ad promotions and its beautiful 5256 they called him the bontan hunter i love he was looking for club sunshine the whole time then passes three time so im 7 minutes into the video and i wonder if nico realizes that ryuji goda is the big kid you did a side quest for in yakuza 0 the bontan hunter is back 2422 peak comedy right there 3759 nico what are you talking abou oh oh oh at 2931 nico literally just strolled right in front of club sunshine look at the upper right corner at the billboard also there is a reason why its not in the same place oh god the intro is lorp as hell holy shit that intro performance was a blessing but now i cant tell if im in heaven or the fiery pits of hell on the skills pages you can press square to sort the skills so you can immediately bring up which ones are purchaseable also if you hold square and triangle at the same time in combat you can charge both light and heavy attacks and do it as a combo sotenbori it looks gorgeous in the new engine and 2006 sotenbori is pretty similar compared to 1988 but also plenty different 2006 sotenbori was close to what real life 2006 dotonbori in osaka was like when you talk to kurokawa who gets you the vip invitation to the grand he mentions a name maki kuraishi who got her start there and turned into a famous actress in yakuza 0 maki kuraishi was the hostess in the yellow dress who was being groped by nishitani in the grand she also appears in the cutscene where majima is introduced in yakuza 0 yes that is totally the blonde kid who was stealing pants off of highschoolers back in 1988 and majima had to beat him up the dragon of kansai 2930 um nico club sunshine is right there well in other news thanks to that intro im pleased to report i now have half my tea up my nose well done there xd also isnt that the boy who was stealing pants cant help but wonder if that maki kuraishi they mentioned briefly is the same maki that spent most of her screentime in yakuza 0 getting her breasts groped other than that make sure you learn the essence of sadism and then get into a fight near to the masked sm club girl love that cove nico you should do one of why from crisis core play crisis core man ryuji came a long way from running track and being able to summon the spirit of a skeleton pirate to confirm yes this is the same guy from yakuza 0 who went around stealing people pants to get revenge for his friends and his father who was a big time yakuza is now currently the chairman of the omi alliance he was stealing pants thats him goda ryuji nico walked right by club sunshine he even fought some goons right outside it if he just wouldve panned the camera up a little bit he wouldve seen it 3705 thats that post nut clarity yall know what im talking about that rimshot after the wind blows killed me editing nico likely died of laughter after realizing what past nico had set up i see nico is fluent in gibbernese when nico said extras like singing things would come back if we reached a patreon incentive i wanted to suggest a full cover of bakamitairequest met listens to nicos baka mitai interpretation well you tried man you tried ryuji was 8 years old in 0 remember that 3746 yes nico i do see it lol she looks really intrigued by the size of it and is checking that you are seeing it too lol its that or the funyarimpa this game is just so badass i just cant help to get pumped at every single moment god dame it nicob you mad spray coca cola out of my nose it was so dame funny ow that hurts 2931 diddid you really not see club sunshine you looked right at it so in the original game the video store was the way you learned how to wield certain weapons and one even boosted your heat gauge maximum all of those boosts were earned in different ways in the original yakuza 2 since they were using the system from 6 they decided instead to make the videos goofy weird somewhat erotic stuff which are all pretty funny if only just for how great the faces kiryu makes oh man many reasons i love this game especially cause of a certain saga intro goaaals kiryu majima my love gentle tears majima hiding in the bars trash kiryuuuchaan i didnt know you felt that way too kiryu runs to roof and jumps off that intro its its beautiful 3747 honestly all i see is a lady holding a nice looking sandwich while staring at the camera covered in mayonnaise yup kiwami bob is a true cryptid nico you missed club sunshine i missed watching porn with nico ah the struggles of having a crappy connection and having to squint to read captions while the backgrounds are mostly white nicob that intro was insanely funny and stupid okay wow youtube didnt notify me how rude again ryuji there can be only one bontan stealer kiryu wait what notices his pants are gone damnit okay attention please so can we add a full version of this baka mitai from the intro to the first official nicob album alongside despair blitz nyah of morishige and dig in the pancake king isnt that club sunshine right there at 2931 from the way the game spawn in enemies sometimes with just one or two i like to think when they spawn in groups its just a bunch of people who never knew each other at all and just decided to walk together and beat up old dudes in white suits its kinda ridiculous that you can run around just fine in the heat ba dum tish of battle but when youre just putzing in town youre slow as shit also kiryu kazuma ex yakuza ex real estate agent full time daddy badass daddy and now porn reviewer nico intro sounds like the megaman legends fan base after they found out mega man legends 3 was cancelled 4323 look at the purple expirience you get from this substory thats all you need to know turns intro up to max to hear nicos glorious singing did nico walk right by club sunshine around 29 minutes in call yusuke and his crab freand that line at 1002 is so selfaware since its actually a fourth wall break because there was atually really something lost in translation not in this game but in the original yakuza 2 at the same place in love with this intro i dont usually comment on videos but with that gorgeous intro i had to say something about it i loved it and even sang along so thanks for that i cant get to the main video the opening is too glorious seeing the and now back to part makes me need to tell you that sadly nico baka mitaeis not in this game funny i just imagined baka mitae except the picture is kiryu singing baka mitae and its just one big infinite loop now watch out kiryu hes gonna steal yout pants it really is just like the back of the box says there can only be one dragon and as you play through the game your gonna notice the whole dragon theme really is everywhere here 1649 oh yes kiryus most memorably quote i peacocked your mom the whole thing its a bit of a translation joke that originated with the original yakuza 2 gotta give credit to the translation team you choice for the now back to segment but i wish it was shorter through you should try to remember about the millennium tower from now on for some reason yakuza really likes putting epic fights and scenes in there in their games im not sure if you remember nico but you actually met ryuji goda in yakuza 0 it was that one side quest on majimas side where you found ryuji stealing other peoples pants he also appeared in that fortune teller side quest too oh my god this intro is debeste 5210 he was 12 years old in that game he was at best 1 year older than the other kids hes the same age as daigo hey when comes to the minigames like golf you actully get useful prizes like heat moves and weapons so would be in your interest to complete them sooner i always cry for baka mitai i ditto greatly appreciated that fabulous intro ditto wishes it will never ever change also ditto wants 24 hour cinderella even as a separate video it would make dittos day ditto out this may be a stupid request but can you give kurokawa a jonny bravo voice if you cant do it thats fine also when not in combat i suggest pressing up on the dpad ahhhkamurochothe city of hustle does the libido dance munanchoooooooooo we need a full cover of bakimitai now 10 10 would buy the album and cry again 1406 not to be confused with mr krabs that felt so fucking short that means it was good as fuck tho that scene with kiryu and the bottle was fucking badass tho thanks for featuring me in the opening of this video it was a big honor multiple styles to 1 person was introduced in yakuza 0 so take the single style mode as the classic mode and as an indicator of future things to come please tell me you threw people into the water this episode and plan to do so in the future its so ridiculously exploitable in this game especially when you upgrade your heat also theres a heat move you can do when you lure an enemy into a convenience store that is just magical you put way to much power when golfing man that intro is looooooong gotta love the yakuza populace kiryu havent been in sotenbori in over a decade i wonder whats changed mob give us your money kiryu youve got to be kidding me today i flew to see my aunt on my continual job search hunt i got to her house and she has me staying the basement next to the furnace which looks like it could have an army of spiders crawl out of it at any moment i had an anxiety attack the moment she left me in there this barren humid room will be my home for the next month im glad that at least i have the picky penguins as a constant in my life something good to look forward to at least there is something better get some kiryu insurance if youre visiting it should also be noted that while most of the yakuza games are translated by the same folks theyre actually written by different people now obviously nico isnt playing the games in order of release but even so yall can already see that among the 3 yakuza games hes played the gameplay is massively redesigned and updated all the time its ironic that in a series with such a consistent setting and cast of characters and assetanimation reuse that the actual design of the games changes so much across all of them but anyways yeah most of the games are written by different people so the quality and style of storytelling is always changing which a big part of how beating up punks with tiger drops in kamurocho manages to stay fresh for so long this particular game was written by an actual japanese crime novelist so its got a really distinct flow to its storytelling and attitude as well as the overall complexity of the narrative which is a big part of why this is the bontan hunter of kansai hey wait a minute i dont remember that version of baka mitai lmfao 3800 shes looking at your back idk man ryujis had it rough since leaving the phantom thieves he used to steal hearts now all he steals is pants what the hell was that intro i swear these are getting weirder and weirder i love it lol in my humble opinion ryuji is kiryus true rival and equal majima is fun but not even he can touch kiryu sadly baka mitai is not a karaoke song in this game and wont be back until yakuza 5 where it originated although you do hear it as background music in some areas of the game omg the intro im dying nico no chokes 1230 thats why you gotta pay attention to the music that introi died majima will always be back even if nico has too edit him in ok i saw that intro and i have to say i dont blame you at all for that whod have thought that one middle schooler ripping off the pants of highschoolers would become kiryus rival ryuji to this day is seen as one of the best nemesis for kiryu best fg now back to yet nico although i find it a bit long dont change it evolution of ryuji goda going from a bontan hunter to a chairman of a clan is certainly interesting that fucking intro that intro i dont know what to say the crab food stuff looks so good i would willing to through anaphylactic shock to eat it the intro im crying also the pants thief has returned i fucking love ruyji daddy kiryu for smash perhaps i want to hear a full cover of bakamitai now best intro ever nico you finally saw the guy thats next to kiryu in the steelbook ryuji goda the dragon of kansai d as opposed to nishikiyama he has a decent amount of screentime and appears pretty early in the game as you can see also hes a fan favourite just wait to see his best moments oh just in case you forgot friendly reminder there was a majima substory in yakuza 0 in which a kid a younger ryuji was assaulting highschoolers and stealing their pants the fun thing is the kid looked just as old as the highschoolers he was going up against in the end its revealed that the high schoolers were bullies and that ryuji decided to beat their asses because they were harassing little girls edit httpsyoutube2gcctcgiffet241 here you can see the substory d yknow when i played yakuza 2 seven years ago ever since it was always a dream of mine to hear larry singing baka mitai at karaoke im glad i lived long enough to see that xd wtf nico whit that bakamitai xd that rendition of bakamitai brought a tear to my eye absolutely godly sounding wait its literally called the dragon engine holy shit kiryu became so powerful he changed the world around him to look shinier nicos singing in the intro made my ears happy maybe hell make a cover sung by monokuma i was literally impatiently waiting for nico to witness i peacocked your mom that might just be my favorite intro ever nico do you remember ryuji he was in a substory in yakuza 0 he was the kid who looks like an adult and he beat the shit out of people for their pants or whatever instant like for that intro lmao phoenix objection get off the mic larry madre de dios that intro xd just when we thought that nicos intros couldnt get more over the top he always proves us wrong its just like kokichis increasingly more terrifying nightmare faces oh majima this is so sad alexa play despacito 2 i want a full version of you singing yakuza songs i cant get enough of this ryuji like man that guy has some great pants i wanna steal them sees intodies of laughter beautiful nico with every curb stomp kiryu becomes even stronger than he was before legend has it that ryuji punishes the lower ranking yakuza by making them unable to wear pants for a week edit kiryu also met ryuji in yakuza 0 during a sidequest iirc previously on yakuza kawami 2 and now back to that ryuji should join the council of daddies oh hey sup ryuji goda nice to see you again how many pants you think he stolen since 0 oh shit ryuji in here bois i am glad that i played 0 first the foreshadowing was nice please tell me that intro is not gonna be used the entire series its a bit to longstill funny though beautiful intro nicob httpimgurcomoixelrs that intro killed me im fucking dying of that and now back to i just see a picture of majima and kiryu is singing like wtf sees intro is good to know that god has not abandoned us since there is sadly no baka mitai in this game i appreciate even your ear splitting attempt to include it also ryuji is such a badass hes really the only villain in the series that can stand next to kiryu and feel like a threat also holy fuck that bakamitai opening launched my sides into orbit i tried to say something smart about the intro i couldnt hey nico nice to see your enjoying the new dragon engine for yakuza i know nico i miss that fabulous 24hour cinderella outfit too larry had enough with painting and decided to become a vocalist maybe he should stick with painting ryuji goro makoto and haru so many yakuza characters share their names with the phantom thieves whats next a futaba best opening of 2018 nico do you realize what you have done you made kiryu sing in the larry voice you know what that means right it means daddy kiryu is now gonna get weaker and become a weenie like larry you fool you have doomed daddy kiryu now daddy kiryu is gonna get arrested multiple times and be a complete buffoon like larry i envy those whose first game in the series was zero no disrespect to the original ps2 game but zero does so much of a better job establishing characters and their dynamics with each other while also being a great self contained story case in point nicos reaction to modern day sotenbori would be much different if he hadnt played zero first that intro really got me laugh me also bakamitai is best song also 24 hour cinderella too with the way nicos back to intros are progressing its only a matter of time before we see him acting out a joke in full cosplay daddy kiryu still best boi still waiting for majima tho dammit nico you made me spit out my chocolate milk with that intro xd only one video away from 2000 videos d objectively best previously on everbrought a tear to my eyesniff that intro is pure gold xdd two pair of bontan enter one pair leaves why is that intro a thing and why do i love it so much i love how for that sub quest in 0 they just decided to make ryuji look barely any different even though he was in elementary school okay that intro really killed me and my ears welpthat opening is now a memeand i cant tell if thats a good thing or not first also yess that fucking intro is a m a z i n g holy shit sunao ni i love you nico 3 the now back to dame dame is beautiful just in case you dont remember who ryuji is allow me to clue you in be thankful he didnt end up stealing your bontan pants while you were fighting his goons also the substory that he appears in zero is called rise of the dragon that introwas beautiful souda a hahahahahahahah that previously on is officially the best one yet yes japanese back to two dragons one daddy and oh my god he did my and now back to suggestion i love you nico best intro xd thats as close as the return of lets sing with nicob early for once was wondering when we were going to see this guy again edit im already at the intro and im dying holy crap im early to watch this glorious video i peacocked your mom is the greatest line of text since nugget had joined your team as a manager the best part is imagining the always serious kiryu saying this in his voice ooooh were early today edit oh my god i got in thank you so much nico well well well welcome back sotenbori or technically welcome back for those who started with 0 as chronologically this town showed up for the first time in original yakuza 2 for ps2 but here i am once again with various tips and info so hold on tight the i peacocked your mom line is actually a reference to localization of og 2 where in japanese version it wasnt even there which is also referenced after beating the thug something got lost in translation just like in kamurocho sotenbori has specific restaurants that give you the biggest boost of specific types of exp those are kani dourakuosaka king red ganko sushikomian blue ganko sushiosaka kingkani dourakuzuboraya yellow zuborayakomian green kani dourakuzuboraya purple sotenboris resturants overall give much more experience than kamurochos but that comes with a price a literal price cause dishes in sotenbori cost a lot why is it so harder to execute tiger drop in kiwami2 since ive learned the mastery too its a lot easier in 0 and kiwami1 is the fps effect do you have to play coliseum to unlock it i can barely get the tiger drop timing right in kiwami 2 at all thats awesome the guy on the left is dressed as the man character or am i wrong just downloaded and played the demo been a yakuza fan since the beginning love the series cant wait for the state side launch in late august so its just yakuza 2 with a yakuza 6 reskin lol im all for it aside from the mutiliated pronounciation and lack of knowledge of japan loved the info just got kiwami because of the ps4 greatest hits cant wait to jump into this one later this year so far ive finished yakuza 0 and 6 and man i cant get enough we need a game about sera and kazama i still miss my favorite heat move with the crate oh and i think were getting hokuto no ken lost paradise yakuza spinoff will we get mahjong and pachinko though also what about the beetle wrestling game too just started playing yakuza zero for the first time absolutely loving the game another yakuzahmmm the 6th was not that good as yakuza 0 i like how they are using yakuza 6s engine it was really good i thought amazing looking forward to it looking better than kiwami 1 i cant wait best game in the series besides the ps4 music redubbing and resubbing being inferior to the ps2ps3 versions the random street fights that happen in any chapter made this superior to the original for me cant wait to play this d i pre buyed that dominatrix stomp though it almost made my eyes water kiryu looks too old are we going to get a weapons dealer on this one ugh looks terrible compared to the mostly smooth 60fps of 0 and kiwami 1 stuck waiting for pc release o still the best one but kiwami 2 is really starting to look good all i want is my destined fight with the one and only jo amon in this upcoming game what max how could you dress up as my man kiryu shame on you o d man this series just rocks so hard im so glad it got the attention it deserves yakuza 0 did get me into the story but i have gone back and traced every game in the series down so i could beat them before 6s release outside of japan and just wow every game had an amazing story with great characters fantastic combat and honestly kazuma is probably like the best character in gaming i love lots of jrpgs but seriously his character tops so many in this medium not without the others trying yakuza is another one of those games i dont really label as games its an experience im playing yakuza 6 on my channel check it out if you like wtf he supposed to be an professional kiryu cosplayer but he forgot the dragon sideburns indonesia loves yakuza games bruh the fighting is the same as song of life bring back fighting styles please just finished the first one so excited for this one gonna get the rest eventually already finished the game couple months ago from someone whos only played yakuza 0 im curious which yakuza game has the best story i thought 0 was really good excited one thing i dont quite getevery time npc characters walk by instead of walking past they instantly turn and walk in the opposite direction glitch they did it in 0 too stripper hey there big boy wanna take a peek in our club kiryu thinks to himself i wonder if they have pocket racers what happened to i peacocked your mom yakuza is life this series is so much fun cant wait to play the next one in august hostess club i been waiting for a long time im excited its back yakuza is one of my favourite video game series glad its getting more love will this demo be available in the playstation store do the styles from kiwami 1 and 0 return please tell im not the only one who noticed the guys outfit like bruh recently bought kiwami and 0 on sale cant wait for this horrible gameplay facepalms the player they chose should at least try not running into the npcsalso glad they brought back the original phone use in the game cant wait to buy this and play virtual on on the arcade so this is the guy who doesnt optimize yakuza for pro users i smell laziness in his words yakuza kiwami i s really good so i need 0 and im excited for 2 its really annoying me how the guy playing this is just mashing square mix up your combos with triangle finishers goddammit its a remake not a remaster mad respect to the yakuza localization team so excited for this game and wow virtual on was one of my fave games as a kid its gonna be a nostalgia trip playing that again everyone needs to play this series love the series that localization guy has such an awesome job pretty sure he does work on persona too its not kowami its kee wa mi is it that hard to for english speaking people to speak a simply word main character steals the shoes of crusty the clown perfect thank you for bringing yakuza to pc if you want to get into yakuza yakuza zero is on sale for 20 bucks this is the start of the series this is gonna be sick i love yakuza being a super novice to the series and just starting 0 2 weeks ago i am pleasantly surprised its an amazing series for sure glad max got to talk about this yakuza is so good and im just waiting for this one to come out i love this representatives exuberance you can tell hes having the time of his life excellent choice for the interview hahaha that guy with kiryus outfit 1010 would kiryu again we need a yakuza prequel where we play as shintaro kazama during his days as a tojo hitman thank you for this and thank you to sega and the amazing job they are doing not only restoring these games but localising them and adding new features so happy the club is making a return does this have the multiple fighting styles again and they licensed the music too graphics look like an improvement from 6 love the yakuza series since the ps2 era need isshin remakw one of the thugs from the urinal game looks like jotaro wow nice looking game it looks totally like the real japan and the graphics are stunning is sega retarted showing some noob gameplay and making the combat look bad facepalm max dressing sharp cant wait already played 0 kiwami and 6 now to finish the rest aww man i thought they retired this character way to draw me back in sega lol why arent there guns in this game youd think a game about gangsters would have guns the fact that max got dressed up shows hows easy it is to get hooked to these games once i start playing each game i cant stop until i complete the majority of everything great game i have never heard ofwill definitely give it a try this year imo the og yakuza 2 is the best one even better than what ive played of kiwami 2 many years of yakuza and still it has this bad facial animation change it already they probably really liked he is dressing appropriate for the topic at hand max just keeps surprising me on this e3 always asking the right questions and actually doing his job i was impressed with the questions he asked for doa6 and all the other ones he had like code vein and this ign back at it again with the dude who dont know wtf to do and still play the demo how many damn yakuza games are there is the demo out now if no when u can play virtual on they announced 0 and kiwami for pc imagine this engine running at 4k i love these guys and the fact they put so much care in it for us western fans people really need to learn the difference between remake and remaster this is clearly a remake yet ign puts remaster underneath the video the combat looks a lot tighter and less physicsreliant than yakuza 6s glad to see the developers at least are improving the dragon engine jesus christ talk about washed tf up at this point damn reskin using words like silly and goofy dont do the series or anything justice ign presenters need to think of better words my dreams came true pc version sega wont touch that thing in stuttering 30 fps this game needs more popularity good on you ign for showing it love not really a fan of how kiryu doesnt have his dragon of dojima style kind of messes up the continuity thank you sega for bringing yakuza to usa idk if i should get this or wait for a pc version graphics looks good i might check this out once i play the first kiwami the hype is outta here man cannot wait so three four and five will be remastered either way im fine with that ugh the guy who s playing is making it look really bad please for everyone who s never played any yakuza it has one of the bestrewarding combat system of any action game cool yooohhh ign insist for sega to bring yakuza ishin to the west so many samurai games coming that are receiving such a good reception by gamers is proof that yakuza ishin would have success in the west after i seen the japanese enjoying yakuza kiwami 2 months ago right after me beating kiwami 1 with no release plans for the west i wanted to catch some of these devs slipping in the streets of japan hit em with a random bicycle to the head glad i dont have to do that anymore another one was i suppose to play 0 first oh man i cant wait for this so hyped its a remake not a remaster japanwhy the baby thing isnt just japan the original csi had an episode about that particular kink too and kiryu crying during that song and i think kiryu was singing about his rivalry with majima hey are you going to add kiyru to the council majima karaoke actually made me cry omfg even kiryu would rather smoke sportscars in his taxi in a middle of a streetrace than taking care of those manbabies 5356 thank me later granny has a kansai accent same accent as majima i feel traumatized i really want to unsee that subquest its an abdl thing httpswwwgooglecomampswwwurbandictionarycomdefinephp3fterm3dabdl26amp3dtrue thats some serious bullcrap evidence for dates arrest the most that makes sense to me would be carrying an illegal weapon 1 the video theyre are showing would not match up because of the time lapse unless the footage was doctored which is pretty hard to do seeing as theyre are two positions of shooters 2 their is very clearly two bullet injuries coming from two different locations 3 ballistics would confirm the marks on the perps face would be consistent with the bullet from dates gun 4 if they both used the same type of gun bullet marks would prove whether or not the second bullet was his 5 he fired 1 time how tf do you get two bullet related injuries from one shot 6 get yo head out yo a japan do black thunder really think those motorcycles look cool man those bikes look dumb as hell i just learned about this in my psychology class and its an actual sexual fetish called paraphilic infantilism or adult baby syndrome it can cater to both men and women and there are cases of it in japan and america there are actual people like that i shit you not wow the rugrats reboot looks pretty realisic semi spoilers for this episode well thats a funny title time for another quirky and funny yakuza video oh wait yakuza 0 memories welp damn you onion cutting ninjas i really like majimas song in his song hes saying a lot of sweet stuff with his mad dog voice examples are if i could make a harem i wouldnt because that would make you unhappy even if i live in poverty its okay as long as you are happy no matter how merciless and cruel hell is its a thousand times better than seeing you sad you being sad is a waste of your rare beauty i wont even say please dont forget me later in the song dont forget me please dont forget me are the words i really want to say also during the later part of the song he drops his mad dog act and starts to sing like the old majima 2952 after he says i love you he stops singing with his mad dog persona i think you shouldnt use that autoblock armor it makes everything too easy i want kiryu in smash bros with his final smash just being him beating the shit out of nearby opponents with furniture and various other random streetofficeetc items 5710 theres a penguin in there mr libido no even i would touch that baby kink with an 80foot pole i keep seeing you in my damn feed who the hell are you nico that yoriko grannys son mentioned in her substory is actually that one guy in kiwami 1 that keep selling us mushrooms in a dark alley until some mobsters show up ah the kareoke bumbed me out a little no bakamitie and kriyu sitting alone clapping for no one majima made up for it though edit okay no just read the lyrics to majimas song my heart cant take how broken this boi is i want you to be happy majima you dont deserve this shit i just want you to be okay and thus kiryu is a true daddyand by that he beats up man babies when he encounters them also can we talk about how fucking absurd 728 seems to be any way you look at it date shot him even if you wanna nail him on being a civilian in possession of a firearm shouldnt the lack of muzzle flash be a dead giveaway that date didnt make the killshot 038 thanks for the nightmares dayum the song like a butterfly is fire though i wish kiryu had sung along rather than rap kinda kills it a bit for me aww my god i am so happy to see that majima still loves makoto after all this time i wished they could live happy together they are a really sweet couple and i am sure majima would make her the happiest girl on earth sheesh first csi now yakuza why do i keep running into adult baby play i dont wanna im not even looking and it keeps showing up no nooooooo goes off to look for gravure photo shoot vids i still feel like nico should be editing the council of voices on his own honestly just so that theres no complications and he can do whatever he wants with his baby wets fwi high like a butterfraiii i wonder if the gran wholl cook you hot pot as an ally counts as one of those obatarians she seemed brazen enough to earn that title although you said not to look it up i thought id do it anyway just in case you were still curious traumatized but curious so the likely condition that the head of the gondawara family has is something called paraphilic infantilism or autonepiophilia a type of fetish where the person experiences a sense of regression to an infantlike state of mind although it doesnt always have to involve the sexual aspects about half abdls adult babydiaper lovers usually just want the nurturing part of the act such as diaper changing bottle feeding cuddling etc and just so were clear this isnt just something that stems from japan although it likely exists due to the rise in adult diaper sales because of the longevity of the older population if you think can stomach a read heres an article about a place where adult men celebrate their abdl fetishes at a certain club in london enjoy the enlightening trauma bossman httpswwwvicecomampenusarticle tbh i had a feeling of where this was going before theyd revealed it personally i think it would have been highly amusing if say kazkun lost to the gondawara family and they force him into a diaper and put him on time out as punishment so the other day i came up with a funny yakuza story majima after another round of protecting majima constructions equipment decides to ask kiryu who has recently had another acupuncture session why he seems so relaxed majima kiryuchan you look really relaxed today did you get lucky recently or something like that kiryu no nothing like that i just went to the acupuncturist earlier majima acupuncture ive never tried it not after that one time in sotenbori kiryu well if you dont try it thats okay but youd really be missing out besides its helped me relearn stuff i forgot how to do majima wait what kiryu yeah im hoping next time ill get my tiger drop back majima interesting well if you recommend it ill give it a shot 10 minutes later kiryu oh my phones ringing grabs his phone out of his pocket hello majima kiryuchan open your menu dont ask why just do it kiryu ummmm okay kiryu proceeds to open the menu only t warning this episode has japan in it i wonder if majima has some unique songs on his sideor was this it i know everyone is talking about majimas very sad as long as youre happy but i think pride from despair is also really interesting i dont recommend looking at some of the lyrics since it kinda references some stuff not all revealed but it really goes into majimas mindset about his mix of selfhatred despair and a gleeful pleasure from the madness he causes its really cool 5620 oh god plays persona 3 battle theme mass destruction baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby bb baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby the new idol series looks great the like a butterfly song was present in yakuza 6 and you could sing it with one of the hostesses and it was better in yakuza 6 because there was a whole music video with kiryu wearing funky glasses and rapping along and in kiwami 2 you can get said funky glasses to wear them later i can imagine during the baby section kiryu may have been thinking i may be the daddy these men babies want but not the daddy these men babies need oh my god nico why you gave me flashbacks to aa with that really stupid case the coatcape just falling perfectly onto that statue with that remark 2312 12050 btw thats marie antoinette from rose of versailles just gonna throw this out there for everyone who is sad at the explicit lack of bakamitai in this game i am pretty sure that a chill piano version of the song plays in the background of all the bars and some of the restaurants in the game so it may be fading out but it is not gone it still remains in our hearts and in the bars if thats the song that they play i believe ive discovered the cause for the walls appearance nico there was a time when kiryu punched a npc so hard that without realizing it an aftershock was caused forcing the wall into a daddy fisting realm and only now when a void was discovered has the wall returned only a true fighter with the spirit of a yakuza and heart of a daddy could perform such a feat it seems that all that crazy has finally bled into majimas singing he sounds like he can barely hold it together i bet next episode will start with kiryu singing baka mi ti to a photo of kiryu singing baka mi ti sorry if i spelt the song wrong you should try the tales of berseria game it has good reviews 5557 oh god nico just wondered into the wrong side if deviantart i was waiting for this episode since i watched the trailer its episodes like these im thankful i dont have to worry about someone coming in and seeing the weird shit im watching 2616 that when we all knew his soul was gone ive been in osaka before and i think that guy who was walking confused around 11450 was walking in front of ichiran ramen the best ramen in osaka youll get the new videos when you progress further in the story you just did step 1 also i noticed that you dont grab thugs from behind ara ara press l1 when grabbing an enemy so that you could use a different heat action also why not use the quickstep heat actions in extreme heat mode those were my favorite in y6 btw if you think that the toylet thingy and that be my baby place cant be real think again httpsyoutube0mtwzvd5v3c the toylet thing can be found in akihabara and shinjuku from what i saw me and my best bro will challenge each other next year when we visit tokyo for vacation with our inner strength is kiryu secretly sanji from one piece cuz he sure loves to kick alot like a fucking lot a place where men litterally act like babies somewhere out there miu iruma will probably check that stuff out and ohmygodijustpicturedgontainadiaperthisismessedupwhatthefrick kiryu just cant be baby because hes already daddy daddy and babby are totally opposite things you can see it in pair of d and b how are they are one and the same but mirrored also daddy and pappy are two forms of father and we must to include carl yung works into this theme to fully understand it daddy is persona babby is shadow and pappy is reverse persona daddy is the one who helps others and creates his image babby is egoistic kind of persona which asks for his own satisfaction and pappy is daddy who makes his work only if babby asks him to so from which point of view nico never stopped playing persona series since kyriu and majima are personas their friends like date and yuya are pappys who need help from daddys and everyone else are shadows kamurocho is shadow world reverse version of kabukicho real place in japan you must to escape persona world nico burn your dread reach out the truth and then wake up get up get out there you know a shop is a kiryu favorite when it looks like a tornado formed inside it for one of these episodes you should have the photo of il jun in the intro age play is definitely a niche thing i think it could be good for those who didnt have much of a childhood or someone that wants to have a kid but not have a kid if you get what i mean like a parttime pet speaking of parttime pet yup thats a thing too personally i think i would love being a mommy in some nonsexual age play im too nervous to even hold actual babies theyre so fragile and my body has some issues that makes dropping them a possibility an adult would be a nice release of my built up motheringprotective instinct without the worry that my arm would go limp at a terrible time resulting in the traumatic injury of an infant adults are way more durable than squishy babies after all thinking about it maybe i just need a hug a nice long cuddle session with someone i am comfortable with but that aint happening since the people i am comfortable with arent the huggy type i want that feeling that i had when i held that lost dog i wonder if this this just in aggressive man beats up five babies i dont need to know this kink exists yes nico you can sing songs with some of the hostesses and lemme tell ya fly like a butterfly is fucking golden 716 no gun flash no recoil and wound comes from a different direction yeah thats date alright 730 one wound on his forehead but were not gonna mention where it came from here look at this single bullet instead 1004 yes when nico said i like how they threw the coat and it magically just fit on his body remember justice for alls magic trick nico same fuckin one mind blown kiryu noticing all those grown men babies kiryu i know my name is daddy kazama kiryu but this is clearly not the side story for me kiryu turns away and walks into the sunshine with ending music playing the end nico i paid how much twice for this game alright kaoru youre gonna be our new maya kiryu let met sing alone karou kaoru fineeee just hurry we already are 3 days late to actually get to the story 4 minutes later kiryu nooooooooooooooooo bakanitai where are you you were here last game staff umm should we worry about that kaoru no its normal hes most likely shocked about something staff why are the chairs breaking spontanuiously now kaoru nani kiryu stop that i cant afford to do dishies for 32 hours again oh so thats whats happened to the botw videos dammit nintendo just some advice karaoke is better in sotenbori since they dont kick you out of the room every 2 songs whens nishiki andor makoto showing up for the bakamitai photo 11457 if tear of grace was playing this game he would lose his mind over that xd if that video of date an fake kazuki shows anything its the fact that date did not shoot unless date has arms of steel and an suppressor there should have been a flash or recoil on the gun so the kamirocho pd are a bunch of bonnets i just like how all characters in this game so much pack with awesome memorable personalities they just cooler than pack of mint chocochip icecream d mentions the bs copyright thing he has to go through especially with nintendo bah its okay man i think we all would understand but so help me if they make you change that metal gear moment that was friggin amazing then somebodys gonna die is nicos chinese voice racist probably do i care no is it hilarious hell yes hot take kiryu dies not from bullets fighting injuries or numerous explosions its because of a lack of bakamitai just imagine this some guy off the street wrongs you in a way so insignificantly that is honestly doesnt even mess with your pre established plans or anything then he insists you go with him to his favorite club in town the place seems like maybe a brothel at firstthen the chick tries to take off your pants and put a diaper on you whats the first thing that comes to your mind to do my minds jumps to grabbing her by the waist and suplexing her through the wall kiryus instinct on the other hand tells him to try to leave then when that wont work go straight to his usual plan apunch first ask questions later mr libido comes to be my baby nurse now lets change that dirty pants into some clean diapers mr libido nurse nurse oh wait youre already nico that wasnt even close to the worst funny thing about yuyas voice actor he played japanese kratos in the new god of war weird fetish lady do you prefer breast milk or milk bottle kiryu i love tender cleavage hey nico heres a full version of majimas song with an english translation httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvptrbrmr3bzk nico in karaoke you need to be in heat mode in order to get the cutscene and for backing vocal songs you need the other singers thanks nico im learning more about this game thanks to your lp and everyone giving tips like selling weapons to kamyama to get better weapons and how to get heat action for the bat no bakamitai looks like next episodes intro is gonna be kiryu staring down at a picture of kiryu staring down at a picture of kiryu starin er or maybe just the title of the song xd real talk this baby scene first time i saw anything about yakuza i had never heard of the series before still didnt know the name until you played 0 and went oh its the guy who beats up the baby fucker and i was just left okay japan what seriously ive heard of people literally dressing like babies and not wanting to do anything but look at this fucker hes huge and hes wearing a diaper what do you do when a giant man is wearing a diaper huh nothing you question life drink a cup of coffee reconsider your life choices ask should i have been wearing a diaper this whole time is that the lesson ive learned from this what kind of valuable life lesson am i getting from this daddy kiryu can you tell me that huh episode ive been anticipating only because i wanna see the same wtf japan reaction from you that i had why does japan have some of the weirdest kinks not kinkshaming just saying we all thought that persona 4 golden and persona 5 is the best japans representation game we can have until we all noticed this franchise the next baka mitai intro should just be an inception deal where its kiryu staring at the bar staring at a picture of kiryu at the bar staring at a picture of kiryu at the bar etc and on this episode of weird japanese kinks one thing i realized after kiryu and majimas karaoke session is that majima and dio brando share something in common they both like using extremely heavy vehicles to attack their rivals actually nico the spear move where you hit someones legs you arent hitting them in the nuts youre shoving the spear up their ass penetration im the only one that is excited to watch nico reacting to get to the top i know there are a leash two games in between but i cant help it cabaret club please beating the shit out of baby men and seeing an old lady beat the shit out of other people were really covering out age range bases today alright i think i have finally figured out japan sees fat man baby and like that japan youve lost me majimas voice actor rocks his song in the last line you can hear the mad dog facade break because he gets lost in the emotion from it its a subtle detail but it speaks volumes 5654 i like how as soon as kiryus face comes into focus his expression changes from angry to oh god please no baka mi ti how ever you spell it better be in the intro next time like a butterfly is basically evanescence song thats a really sweet jacket yuya has i hope its a bonus we can wear in end game shirtless lol with just that coat anyway you look at it date shot him i mean the blood flew out on the wrong side of the wound if date really did it he wouldve flopped backwards not forwards the bang is probs way too quiet for the angle that camera is taking it where the hell did that camera come from theres no flash nor recoil from dates gun come on guys we have his bullet alright whered you find it on the roof in which case it makes even less sense because from the angle the video was taken it shouldve flown off the roof and be somewhere on the street geez kamurochou police are screwballs small note you did not get the scene when singing tonight song because you did really bad at the beginning of the song what the hell did i just see what nintendo did for the one video they claimed of mine is that they just took the revenue honestly id rather not make any money ona video than see it completely ruined by most of it being muted or some other horse shit it wouldve been nice if they took that kind of mercy on your vids things magically floating onto peoples bodies my god mama killed the ringmaster not acro its okay nico but i honestly prefer more main story and less side story and save the side stories for end game but hey i like the way how you try to balance it out the moment i saw the title of the video i knew what was coming the proper call of granny whites attackers after being beat by kiryu should always be aiya we suck japan or as someone i know would call it hapan as in what hapan not sure if this is a spoiler just remembered there is a certain boss that uses kali sticks in the story that you fight you must unlock the video after that fight then youre nothing compared to your father ummm lau ka long wasnt yen longs father nico please stop upgrading your attack at this rate the final boss fight will be over in 6 heat moves focus on your health and heat gauge instead oh dont worry the licensed songs are horrible just god awful muting them would probably improve the scene if anything they used to be really good and fit the scene really well but because of legal shenanigans in the remake they got changed into the most hilariously unfitting things youve ever heard well at least one of them has im not sure what the second instance of licensed music is hey nico check to see when you being followed by enemies inside a restaurant or fast food place and you grab an item and see if you can attack the npc of the people inside when the fight start i want to see what the games will register the npc as enemies or not kiryu oh hey miyu its been a long time and miu hey big boy you look like you have the stmana of a horse shuichi right next to miu shuichi dude run for your life watching your intros is like watching an anime opening you sing along to and never get tired of eg pokemon opening damn i love this game i want the next episode to have the song forgot the name that he sings at the intro to be in the photo since we dont have it here and nico misses it see the thumbnail the fck see the intro not him again old lady ill call you kakun cute isnt it kiryu well im glad it isnt kachan bakugo shut up ill kill you bastard kiryu for more reasons than one oh trust me nico theres far worse than that once you go deeper down the rabbit hole that is the internet seeing the jacket magically land on yuya gave me vietnam flashbacks to phoenix wright justice for alls flying cloak trick shiver the sub story be my baby was from the original yakuza 2 never thought i would think about the idea of kiryu beating up men in diapers remade in hd4k on the ps4 to answer your question nico yes we have heard tonight before kiryu sang it in kiwami 1 its a song about nishiki and during karaoke last game scenes of kiryu and nishiki from yakuza 0 appeared on the screen we are now going to have a baka mitai about baka mitai 3957 i like to think kiryu is just training for the next time he goes to a karaoke with haruka shed be pissed if he didnt get a perfect score fun fact of the day komaeda has a romantic interest in hajime does this have anything to do with yakuza no but if the fabled myth is true that nicob actually reads his comment section then this is gonna be a real mind blower unless of coureyouweretogothroughallofkomaedasfreetimeeventshrngggghhhhhhh i bet the photo for next episode will be bakamitai and the award for parent of the year wouldve gone to kazuma kiryu but we had just received news that he had beaten the shit out of grown men dressed in diapers so by stupid rules regulations kiryu is disqualified therefore the winner of parent of the year is daddy majima like a butterfly is pretty much the bakamitai of this game but youll have to come back with a specific hostess to get the full majesty of it so when satan in destroy the porn was talking about diaper porn was this it japanese have some weird fetishes 10447 omg i just rewatched v3 lp recently i miss the memes so much if i understand right itll be a while til baka mitai appears again in karaokeassuming you do 36 in order just to note for future karaoke blue connection between 2 buttons hold pink rapid press finally yes places like that do actually exist at least from what ive seen on tv i think i saw something about in on a g4 segment a long time ago where they talked about weird kinks 2750 majima sings his pirate song of sorrow the next bakamitai picture would be bakamitai itself next intro photo is just a loop of itself karou you wait outside while me and my real love interest do karaoke as soon as i saw this in the yakuza kiwami 2 trailer i was waiting for this moment i like this type of game were the encounter is up to the ai even though in can get annoying in the long run but imagine this situation with the delinquents delinquent that dude look at me ugly lest beat the crap out of him delinquent 2 yea lest beat that guy that looks like a yuakuza delinquent 3 we are more peoplehe has no chance against us delinquent 4 he wont know what hit him passerby hello emergency send ambulances to this direction and yes is kazuma kyriu related edi manjos critique on kiryus charactersanta gintoki one of the many reincarnations of kiryus lil bro shinji substory embracing my true self persona 4 plays in the distance black thunder guys slowly rolling their bikes in in single file to stardust yuya uh what the fuck are you doing koji just hand tight and dont worry about it itll look cooler this way yuya whatll look cooler koji damn whats with the third degree just trust me itll be cool ok yuya fine whater black thunder guys start circling menacingly around yuya yuya dammit i thought you said itd be cool koji its cool for me alright alright alright for some reason koji turned into matthew mccaunughey in my mind for other recruits i suggest doing the sidequest at the batting cage as well as finding a particular sidequest in sotenbori this sidequest will start when you hear two guys talking about a movie once thats done look for the building with the lion statutes in sotenbori also that yakuzalooking guy from that comedy duo can be recruited he found around the northeast side of sotenbori also that politician can be found and recruited at the entrance of sotenboris karaoke bar having more recruits in the clan creator allows you to level up the equipment it will come in handy when you get the later stages of the minigame where the game throws everything including the kitchen sink at you so more recruits the better also sidenote you can get the music video for like a butterfly when you eventually start going through the cabaret club grand prix and getting more platinum girls from the minigames story however much like 0 you need to bond with them in order to h funny enough and since you brought it up while harukas request in otometal my life was hard i honestly think the demon of pool hell master of all dickery and asshole design that feeds on the tears and salt of others was much worse to deal with and now i cannot watch this in public thanks nico pride from despair best song ever in kiwami 2 listen to the full version to experience the sheer badassery and kaorus just standing out there like you invited majima out to karaoke in front of me and didnt ask me to join kiryu and majima bros before hoes d kaoru tonight restart from this night is about nishiki ive been wondering is the ice in those drinks are sphereshaped cause that looks cool and sphery in the intro of the next episode were going to have a picture of kiryu choosing bakamitai while singing bakamitai because the song is not in the game that sidequest happened on the unluckiest number in the us your feeling like kiryu right now want to take a shower try to wash away the the filth of what you saw then bleach your eyes and drink a ton of the most alcoholic drinks to forget what you saw but the image burned too deep man for it to work man hellodarkness 5620 if thats not the thumb nail for the next last time opening i dont know what is i think the real thing to take away from the sub story isnt some kinks are bad and wrong but dont force your kinks on others its find to have a kinkif you dont force them on someone of course especially not a legendary yakuza whose kicked the asses of a ship full of people is that diaper club real asking for a friend next episode in the intro the picture shown is the image of bakemitai in the menu make it happen nico im calling it next episode kiryu will be looking at a picture of kiryu looking at a picture of kiryu singing baka mitai majima is just chilling in his office when his cellfone starts ringing majimahello majima construction goro majima here how can i help you kiryu majima i need a favor from you majima kiryuchan what a suprise what do ya want kiryu remember that time you runned a truck into that building last year majima like it was this morning what about it sends a photo of an building with a sigh saying be my baby kiryu can you do the same to this place majima isnt that the gondawara familys hangout or somethin kiryu trust me youll be doing them a favor kiryu vs eminem who would win i just imagine the next kiwami 2 opening being the list of karaoke songs from zero with bakamitai highlighted in the picture kiryu expected majima to sing some wild goofy song and instead majima sings this heartfelt love song leaving them both in tears they never sang karaoke together again im guessing the other cop had the camera he was resting on dates arm when that footage happen from the angle of the camera and that he was the one giving his gun and telling date to shoot edit also that he suggests kaoru not tell anything to police office because i think kaoru confessing is still worth trying at least there will be record about it even if they will try to bury it later like its still worth a shot thats maybr the whole reason the fake kazuki exist he said that once you know the ending the story will write itself he is suicidal agent sent exactly for the purpose of recording that footage why else he dressed like kazuki and didnt killshot all four of them when he got the chance i cant believe nintendo is still doing this hyperstrict copyright shit they make fantastic games but when it comes to pretty much anything community andor online related it almost feels like they are trying to piss their consumers off so if i remember right back in yakuza 0 earth angels mamasan mentioned she was looking for a someone to take over for herhim saying theyd have to be herhis spitting image and the former leader of a biker gang i think kiryu response was something like thats oddly specific in reference to the substory in this episode 2713 i just realized that i wanted to link majimas full version of the songwith english lyrics but i cant because i didnt take my laptop with me edit i dont know what i find funnier nicos reaction to youknowwhat or his heartbreak about bakamitai funnily enough as soon as i saw how the members of black thunder were dressed i thought they might have been bosozoku then the motorcycles confirmed it bosozoku are pretty much like biker gangs here in the west except for the crazy mods they make on their bikes its usually stuff like extremely flashy paint jobs tall seat backs and even messing with the muffler to make it louder comparing yuya to oowada wasnt far off either hes also a bosozoku you have to do tonight again in karaoke and dont f up the beginning then the video will play rape face engaged retreat i repeat fucking retreat wait that heat action was yuya a student of granny white any way you look at it date shot him lmfao thats horseshit his finger clearly didnt move to pull the trigger and nothing came out of his gun so the one eyed man chose to sing a pirate shanty just saying with the more abilities kiryu gets the more overall terrifying he seems to get despite already being dragon levels of ohgodnothimanyonebuthim todays episode is literally the two things ive been waiting for since the day that nico picked up the game the baby sidequest and majimas emotional ballad 4300 it sounds like its from the lion king where timon and pumbaa singspeak in the beginning of a song not sure if it was can you feel the love tonight or after that if yakuza was a movie who would play kiryu if yakuza was a movie who would play kiryu no bakamitai this time you know what that means time for bakamitai inception for the next intro photo xd nico the reason you didnt get a scene during the tonight song is because you screw too much in the beginning before the scene this isnt just for this game this apply for 0 and kiwami as well although you havent mess up enough in those game to skip those scene also yes it kinda suck that kiryu is reserve to only 2 songs and only the two majima songs the one he sings and the one kiryu sings are the new ones i thought it was going to be some funny crazy majima stuff but nope its makoto feels i lost it at i love you can you imagine kiryu as an ultimate despair that song got me thinking oh my godgranny white is lau ka longs komaki i swear if next episodes bakamitai picture is the karaoke menu from last game with bakamitai dont forget to come back to karaoke when youre bonding with the hostesses i think you kind of wasted a bit of time checking the support songs unaccompanied but there were no way of you knowing so theres no problem and yes i would love to see you progressing on the cabaret club questline it will help you a lot financially speaking in order to get the cool weapons and such but thats not all lets hope todays episode doesnt get nico flagged for child abuse nicob just as i was about to write this you found out yourself yes the video that has the kali sticks skill gets unlocked in chapter 9 can it be that you accidently switched off videos in the karaoke menu because tonight definitly has a video and i was sitting here wondering why it wouldnt play and yes otometal has one as well though i was pretty sure it also plays regardles if you have haruka with you or not but i could be wrong 5655 while kiryu is making this face he thinks to himself kiryuim about to fight a bunch of grown ass men dressed as babies what am i doing with my life kiryu no i will not put on a diaper im daddy kiryu dammit not baby kiryu the picture for next episodes intro should be kiryu singing baka mitia nico therere some pictures in the tonight song you have to be in heat mode when you about to enter the main part of the song the next intro pic will absolutely be the karaoke list stop blaming japan nuclear radiation is mutative 258 oh hopefully you can still lp majoras mask damn copyright i cant help but tear up everytime i listen to as long as youre happy hey if nico does a cover of as long as youre happy like he does for the bakamitai intro at least itll be true to form well that was a weird sidestory oo please tell me a club like that doesnt actually exist in japan for real callin it now the next episodes picture gag is gonna be him singing baka mitai for the lack of baka mitai leading this gag to go full meta this episode gives a new meaning to the waaah from the last one dont worry bakamitai does come back in all the other games as far as i know except for six and also you should make next episodes intro a picture of kiryu singing bakamitaiimagine the irony this isnt reliable since i got this from reading a particular manga but i have an inkling feeling places like that exists in japan where grown ass men strip down and wear a diaper or plain baby clothes and have a mother figurewellbaby them i think its a therapeutic way to relief stress i dont know its just a feeling i have i saw it in a manga one time and now im seeing it here theres a pattern going on lol your videos got partially muted fuck you nintendo and youtube embracing my true self insert shadow kiryu here so hey guess who brought some lyrics its ya boi ruka lol but yeah after that brief comedic intro its time to cry shiawase nara ii ya as long as youre happy lyrics in english if i had the whole world to shape however i wanted and i could create myself a harem paradise that would never turn me down id give it up because you would be unhappy even if i had to sleep in a tiny room in a mouldy old cottage wrapped up in a threadbare futon with a pillow as hard as a tombstone even then itd be okay as long as i know you have found happiness however much terrible cruelty i suffered even if it meant going to hell id take it a thousand ten thousand times over you being unhappy as long as youre happy its okay i dont mind pain hatred bring it on as long as youre happy as long as youre happy as long as youre happy its okay so hey dry those tears as long as youre happy its okay i dont mind a precious beautiful woman like you should be spoiled as l someone might already had it but heres the translation of majimas karaoke song if i had the whole world to design as i liked even if i made a heavenly harem that never turned me down if it turned out to make you unhappy id stop even if i had to sleep in a tiny room in a mouldy old cottage wrapped up in a threadbare futon with a pillow as hard as a tombstone even then if it made you happy well its okay however much terrible cruelty i suffered even if it meant going to hell id take it a thousand ten thousand times over you being unhappy as long as youre happy its okay i dont mind pain hatred bring it on as long as youre happy as long as youre happy as long as youre happy its okay so hey dry those tears as long as youre happy its okay i dont mind a precious beautiful woman should be spoiled as long as youre happy as long as youre happy i do not mind however many times to whatever deity i will pray i love you i love you never forget why i didnt say omg i realised that kiryu is such a good person that he literally sits in karaoke by himself and just cheers alone to a tv screen such a wholesome boy aaa haruka so ungel kas what did you do today kiriyu well i went and sang karaoke with the sociopath who tried to kill me like 150 times haruka do you mean ungel gorochan kiriyu yes and then i went singing for myself and then i put on a song and just sat there and clapped to the beat for the whole thing then sang some more and then i watch majima sing hes song again on video and then i did a rap about butterflies haruka you know ungel kas you got some problems kiriyu sigh yeah the next bakamitai opening will be for bakamitai it keeps saying kamurocho in the upperleft in the karaoke maybe bakamitai is in sotenbori unfortunately bakamitai is only in 5 0 and kiwami 1 whats cool though is that like a butterfly from 6 and ring from 4 made it in i love how the comments of previous videos kept telling him that you can sing with majima and hes just now realizing thats a thing also who the fuck was cutting onions when majima was singing 2411 obligatory is that a yu yu hakusho refference im a be honest there are only two kinks that should not exist full on bestiality since that more often then not may lead to the human or animal dying and children no more needed to be said on that and so nico was made to look stupid by using baka mitai for the game that doesnt have it just like baka mitai in a sense guys we just gave a new meaning to daddy kiryu dear god can you make this come true bakimatai intro about the fact there is no bakamitai song in this game everytime you upload one of these videos you manage to put a smile on my face so if theres no baka mitai in this game how the heck are we gonna play it for the intro then sad day for us all tries to play baka mitai even though its gone love the fact that i can actually say ive seen a grown man beat other grown men while they were in diapers the kiryu song tonight was in yakuza kiwami where he sung about nishki and how they were brothers for life even up till the end in future yakuza games kiryu still sings this song to remind him of his best friend and brother and that he will never forget that night as he wish he could restart it 5210 kiryu didnt you read the news papers huh you hear about this big guy murdering everyone in town thats fucking me you stupid majima kiryuchan thats actually me you silly nico picks as long as youre happy wait im not ready for this when you realize nico doesnt get sexualy invested in photos prostitutes or the clubs no majima is the best sexuality we can learn alot from the goro nico ship the thing with date and the police wanting to arrest him as of the end of yakuza 1kiwami date is a civilianis not a cop anymore in japan gun laws are strict and for a civilian to be carrying around and firing a gun is a huge nono in their society appearances matter a lot if it gets out that the police is using a civilian to do their job and said civilian is shooting people the authorities will be cast into a bad light the police and politicians cant do their job the police are allowing people to run around with guns and shoot people thats why they want to put a lid on it quickly and shove it into a dark corner where no one will find out and talk about it if it gets out to the public even correcting misconceptions wont do anything you experienced this your appearance matters in this society with persona 5 already p5 main character has a criminal record thats a blemish that will be staining him for the rest of his life doesnt matter if its not all of the people in the comments making comments about japan being the source of weirdness like those kinks on displayyall are too innocent and dont know how deep the rabbit hole goes kiryu embracing my true self eh persona 4 ost intensifies kiryu what the fuck is going on here its nice seeing how yuya has developed throughout kiwami and kiwami 2 he became responsible for stardust and showed alot more character development throughout the main story but the kicker for me was the sub story with the black thunder gang it just made me fall in love with his character got the game 1 week ago i regret nothing although ramen until next paycheck such a complex game it can make you cry out of cuteness amaze you with action and make you question humanity this game takes being an emotional roller coaster way too far there are some places like that in america and i agree its wrong on every level the song tonighy is the one that had the nishki scenes from yakuza 0 the intro for next episode where nico sings baki mitai should have kiryu looking at a picture of him singing baki mitai editmy bad its baka not baki hearing majima sing silly but at the end he becomes serious bc hes thinking about makoto it hurts so much too much 2900 is going to be nicos new intro maybe just imagine the possibilities embracing my true self woah getting persona 4 vibes here sega must be thinking about putting a persona similar game into one of the arcade machines in kiwami 3 this is so sad majima play baka mitai what what do you mean we dont have baka mitai wryyyyyyyyyyyyyy next episode the bakamitai picture kiryu cries to is gonna be of the bakamitai song itself i have a feeling that despair from pride is probably the reason why kuzuryu became such a big majima fanboy xd also you have to do well before certain parts in karaoke to get a music video thats why nothing happened when you sang tonight because your start in that song didnt go that well you also require a specific partner for some songs which is something you already figured out im calling it now that next episodes opening is going to be a recursive image of kyriu singing baka mitai for some reason i desperately want to see nico play deadly premonition i just want the bakamitai intro in the next episode to just be lamenting the fact that theres no bakamitai in this game bakamitai singing about bakamitai just throwing that out there now to actually watch the video majima is literally tomoyo daidouji and that breaks my damn heart fuck im picturing the song otometal my life is on there because kiryu saw it and wanted to think about haruka so he played it and just did the support because he is just that much of a supportive daddy nico needs to record himself listening and reading the full song majima sang with eng so we can all cry with him whos willing to bet that episode 14 is going to start with kiryu singing bakamitai about his inability to sing bakamitai my favorite part of this mission is just how sad kiryu looks upon realizing what hes gotten into i was coincidentally listening to this song earlier and what do you know you had to crush my heart again what the holy fuck did i just witnessed i kinda hope the intro to next video is kiryu singing bakamitai while looking at a picture of him singing bakamitai i havent played yakuza 6 but heard bakamitai wasnt in that game either i guess it was excluded from games using the new engine ik this comment is vry different from the video but i would like to thank nico not just bc he gives us hours of entertainment everyday but also because before i found nicos channel i didnt own any gaming devices but after falling in love with games played on this channel it inspired me to get a job and buy my own psvita and ps4 to so i could play them myself so thank you nico for introducing me to some of my favourite games of all time finally nico is doing one of the best substories ever nico scream like that guy who won the 2 free tacos when he found out that you can sing with majima majima in the middle of construction as his phones starts to ring as he answers who the hell is it kiryu hey majima i was wondering if you where up karaoke majima majimahe runs in with a exhausted breath impant im already here guess the photo in the next and now back to bit will be of kiryu singing bakamitai bakamiception and side note yes you can sing with the hostesses that of course is how you see the funny scenes like a butterfly is a personal favorite so im looking forward to those i have been binge watching lps of yakuza 0 kiwami 1 and kiwami 2 up to this episode over the past month and feels so good to be caught up now 4536 omigod kaorus little squat im dying that was quite fortunate alright i prepared a little today so today i can give a proper crime fact today well be talking about something were all a little familiar with by now chopping off your pinky this is an old tradition and like a lot of old traditions is kept up by the yakuza exclusively in this case this is known in japanese as yubitsume finger shortening or occasionally as yubi wo tobasu literally finger flying as in your finger goes flying and is as we know done as an act of atonement particularly for when a yakuza does something that hurts the family either directly or because one of their subordinates screws up which would be a failure on the part of the superior a failure of a child often reflects the failure of a parent after all theres a whole little ritual for exactly what you do but we all know that it basically comes down to chopping off a pinky so instead ill focus on just why they do this this ritual is traced back namely i was so happy when you found the best thing in this game and im sorry nico for what you have found xd seeing this makes me look forward to future games and nico reactions to future wacky adventures of the yakuzies as well as other future characters im afraid to even give a hint that only long time fans would know wait i got comment of the day again wow thanks for taking your time to read that comment nico i really wanted to write that about kiryu for a while and that scene just seemed the perfect transition point into that analysis theres just so many great comments and people on nicos videos that are always a joy to go through that i can imagine how tough it is picking only one be my baby modders this video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvotiumilf7but375s goro majima quirk persona this quirk makes him act like hes offthewall crazy but really hes got a good heart the only downside is that he has overly extravagant tastes and ideas often involving his rival kiryu in some form or fashion kiryu kazuma quirk heat guage he accesses the bodys inner soul to deliver devastating attacks he is gruff and taciturn but tries his best to relate to others begrudgingly goes along with majima when his ideas involve him mostly for some information but when they sing there will be no quirk more powerful tjsn theirs combined i think its safe to say we were all looking forward to this well this and a certainbeastly battle heres the english lyrics to majimas song if i had the whole world to design as i liked even if i made a heavenly harem that never turned me down if it turned out to make you unhappy id stop even if i had to sleep in a tiny room in a mouldy old cottage wrapped up in a threadbare futon with a pillow as hard as a tombstone even then if it made you happy well its okay however much terrible cruelty i suffered even if it meant going to hell id take it a thousand ten thousand times over you being unhappy as long as youre happy its okay i dont mind pain hatred bring it on as long as youre happy as long as youre happy as long as youre happy its okay so hey dry those tears as long as youre happy its okay i dont mind a precious beautiful woman should be spoiled as long as youre happy as long as youre happy i do not mind however many times to whatever deity i will pray i love you i love you never forget why i didnt say it i love you i love you it was s thumbnail is a cursed image everyone has that special someone except kiryu well could you imagine the first date so what do you do for a living well today i got roped into a baby fetish hangout so i beat them all up that happened after i destroyed a group of thugs in my friends cabaret club oh thats uhhh i also ran a real estate business with a chicken check pleas then there was the time i beat a bunch 7 year olds in slot car races during the intro nicob otiggawa sugi sugi steven spielberg aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh hey like a butterfly is an awesome song make sure that when you get the girl that sing with you you do show the music video instead of skipping it you will not regret it this is just my own personal take but kiryu is a great character but while he did join the yakuza hes now almost always trying to leave but being roped back in since hes good guy and has responsibilities what does that say about the yakuza as a whole im curious yes nico every time you see a substory with actual cutscenes they were from the original games and not the remakes they dont do that anymore because its too expensive but 6 actually has voice acting for every substory so theres that at least to look forward to looks at the previous episode and title serious and storyoriented looks at this videos title and thumbnail i have several questions for sega gondawara behold the ultimate power of a true baby daddy kiryu dammit i dont have a chance against him by myself majima majima yea kiryu i think its time for that technique majima thought you never ask kiryu majima fusion haaaaa and at that moment kiryu majima were no longer for only majiryu the wild beast of japan stood where they stand still holding out on more nonyakuza characters for the photo gag xd ah nico doing the majima song cant wait for that part i feel like one the intros will be dame da ne dame yo dame na no yo anta ga suki de sukisugite kiryu looks at photo and see another kiryu starting baka mitai dame da ne dame yo dame na no yo anta ga suki de sukisugite kiryu looks at photo and see another kiryu starting baka mitai dame da ne dame yo dame na no yo anta ga suki de sukisugite kiryu looks at photo and see another kiryu starting baka mitai dame da ne dame yo dame na no yo anta ga suki de sukisugite kiryu looks at photo and see another kiryu starting baka mitai and then this goes on for an hour why i dont even have anything else to say just why man the intro is getting more fun and hilarious every time next time put do man who got somebody once told me the world was roll me 2008 hey niko its roman lets go bowling 2018 hey kiryuchan its majiam lets go karaoke god damn i was so afraid that i would have to live with only 1 episode of yakuza this week guess i cant live without this anymore oh good both of the things i wanted you to go through in one video the man baby and the majima version of the bakamitai okay who else has been waiting patiently for this part of the lp just for this one side quest d seeing this kinda makes me worry my family will judge me if i ever go to japan guys you should check this its a modder who makes fake kiryu payable in kiwami 2 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7grqeksrl50t248s first was the japanese mafia then the chinese now the koreanswhats next the goddamn mongorians baby man definition a fully grown man that by all appearances looks normal however once you get to know him you realize hes a big baby trapped in a mans body ex mary are you still seeing that guy james me noafter awhile i realized he was a big baby man i handed him a tissue and called it a day 5655 this is what the dragon engine was made for kiryus face has a perfect why does this shit always happen to me expression alright finally caught back up stopped watching back at yakuza 1 to stop and play the games myself now that im caught up some questions that have yet to be answered on ps4 pro the facial hair looks a little better not a whole lot but enough to not be jarring the cabaret club never gives you all the money but you do start earning ridiculous amounts of if like an hour session of just progressing net me of over 20mill i encountered a similar game crash issue reinstalled game new save fixed as well but i havent had anymore problems i also started on physical its great to have played this next to you keep doing what you love nico like akihiko sanada said ive been waiting for this zetsubou nara ii ya nicob i told you i would use it again at a fitting point and its fitting in multiple ways trivia about this stupid joke majimas karaoke song is called shiawase nara ii ya translating to everything is all right as long as youre happy what zetsubou means should probably the most of you know ps heh pps look up the full song rip stephen spining he made such fantastic movies like at im honestly kind of shocked that a substory like that is in a game like yakuza i guess yakuza has literally no shame when it comes to something like this it gives me this newfound respect for the series i guess you could say nicob didnt cry because he doesnt understand majimas song lyrics god the lip syncing is so weird and has uncanny valley movement to it o boy are we about to encounter this games mrlibato only fucking nintendo can cause so much rage when it comes to people who do playthroughs only those that work for them meaning they get a free copy of some of the games and the like never get copyrighted assholes i get to watch this before work nico tonight was in kiwami 1 black thunders got nothing on judgement knights of thunder back when i was playing this game on my ps2 i was playing that side mission and then my dad walked in he just stared at me in disbelief i have never felt so much discomfort my whole life 1740 sorry bernie black lightnings already taken see the thumbnail and into well its going to be one of those videos unzips japancould you notjapan sometimes nice video as always but can someone explain king crimsons ability man i cant believe broly is in this game oh this one its probably my favorite by the way the best substory in the history of substories edit also that majima song is pretty damn sad i cant remember the exact lyrics but it basically told us that while majima is sad that the woman makoto he fell for left hes still happy because as long as makoto is happy he is as well and thats all he ever needs and if you listen real carefully majima starts to loose his mad dog persona near the end of the song and starts sounding rather normal the feels hurt man hey nicob their a game i recommend you play it called fist of the north star lost paradise hey nico i want to suggest a solution to the copyright song problem you can put the song that was used in the ps2 version in those scenes that use the new copyrighted song the song from the ps2 version is as far im aware not copyrighted and some people even agree this song fits more those scenes than the new song they used for kiwami 2 the name of the ps2 song is crazy ken bandkuroi kizuato no buruusu i hope this is useful so you dont run into problems youre the most underrated youtuber ive heard lmao i nominate this as best anguishing episode of all time in this game nothing can top vanitas sees thumbnail ooh noooooo i have been looking forward to this substory in this episode of yakuza kiwami 2 kiryu finds himself on the wrong side of deviant art will kiryu escape with his decency intact will majima construction become japans national anthem and what picture will nico use this time lets start curbstomping an find out on this exciting episode of yakuza extreme 2 mr libido thought he could get a good workout if he played epic sax guy when he was dancing turns out he got too good of a workout creepy dude wanna change my diaper kiryu no creepy dude how about you patchy majima f no i belong to kiryuchan kiryu errgh creepy dude ok kicks the 4th wall how about you handsome godot hah sips coffee creepy dudeok how about you mrlawyer phoenix please no i have enough trouble at tres bien maya dont be a wimp nick do it monokuma yes do it my despair levels are quite low today fill my honey pot with some sweet action shivers oooohhhhhhh phoenix its only a diaper were changing diapers creepy dude ah good then its settled come at me mr lawyer man phoenix you know it would have been a completely different substory if the place centered around a daddy fetish kiryu a place where kinky daddies get paid to be kinky daddies where do i sign up okay soi think youtube is catching on i got an add sayingasians is the cutest race there is and i was likei meani guess but theni meanmthe babymanman babykiryuconnection the kiryu cult begins editit was an asian meet asian dating ad 15 minutes into kiwami 2 and chill and he gives you that look finally the substory we were all waiting for nico remember that you can invite the hostesses to do karaoke with you as well but you must complete their individual substories before youre allowed to do that and whats hilarious is that you can invite them in both the kamurocho and sotenbori karaoke bars even considering how far theyd have to drive to go to kamurocho also you probably noticed but karaoke is a little different in this game its a lot easier to know when to press the buttons this time because its all on one line that goes at the same speed but you gain points based on combos as such if you mess up even once it can drastically lower your score and if you screw up three times its almost impossible to get at least 90 points that song by majima literally is him screaming out all of his feelings that as long as makoto is happy then its fine someone will definitely post the lyrics for you nico and you will see the feels if you listen carefully near the end of the song you can hear majimas voice became serious like he was in yakuza 0 as oppose to his desperate screams in the early part you can hear this even better in the full version as every time he said as long as you are happy its fine you can feel that he is still traumatized by the events in yakuza 0 this is his version of bakamitai this man baby side quest is the reason why some penguins told you to not look up the majima construction anthem english version as they used the scene of the man babies in that vid lol japan has some of the weird places tailored to fetishes of certain type as long as there are customers for that kink there will be shops and clubs for that nico i was just thinking about power rangers and sigma so i put on the song power rangers and as i was singing i sung go go horny sigma it was funny nicob i keep signing go go horny sigma majima has the voice of an angel with a horrible voice jk majimas singing is beautiful oh you think this baby kink shit is just japan hahahahaugh knowledge is a blessing and a curse the fucking steven spielberg side mission in yakuza 0 picture hahaha if nico finishes xenoblades lp before yakuza we need to have a xenoblades reference for the intro unlikely the infamous sidequest and the weirdest one of the all yakuza games man baby the first time i heard majimas karaoke song i wont lie i actually teared up out of all the yakuza 0 references this game has this one is absolutely my favorite and hits the hardest he really did and still does love her and she will never know im loving these intros xd throwbacks to characters from yakuza 0 good times yes my ultimate favourite substory of all time and im glad to bear witness with no regrets and backtoback with the black thunder nicob i bow down to you chairman of the penguin tojo clan kiryu truly is the daddy of all daddies majima kiryuchaaan whens it gonna be my tuuuurn he appears in diapers a pacifier and his snakeskin jacket hold on majima ill put you to bed in a minute dammit the face in the thumbnail shudders i had seen footage of this substory months ago with zero context and it was one of the most bizarre experiences of my entire life i could even write it in off as odd japanese humour this is just straight up weird i think my faith in humanity died a little wait is this japanese rugrats well nicob now traumatized thank you japan meanwhile im laughing in my seat as see madness of man bady side quest rare footage of a japanese man finding the secret forest of the common kpop fan 198something colorized yes you found it my favorite substory from this game and the original i love how the moral of the story here is not to kinkshame lmao still relevant 12 years after 2 came out p also that look kiryu gives at 5655 floors me every time he is so done with this shit fun fact you can actually fight gondawara in the coliseum and his fighting style is called crazy baby nico i kinda thought about it and its been a long time since you did cabaret club maybe you could do it next episode especially since you have to do it anyway due to sidestories being locked behind it there are people and then there are virgins sees title errwhats going on sees guys acting like babies goddamn it japan the thumbnail is my reaction whenever nico posts a new yakuza video that steven spielberg pic is gonna haunt some penguins dreams nico when you get a dark blue dress hostess please sing ring with her plz not the green dress one even though i like her edit and all songs have a cutscene get them all he finally made it and this is the substory ive been waiting to see nico react to all lp correction the substory weve all been waiting for every first person early firrrrrrrst local man beats up babies man baby ah another episode about majima then omg i beeen dieing for this most famous infamous sense my eyes have been tainted i think nico is really gonna enjoy yakuza 3 sees title ive been waiting for this early so i took a bit of a gamble today i heard the copyrighted song you all mentioned and decided to leave it in since its pretty quiet and it fades in and out a lot also it adds a lot to the scene unfortunately yt still dinged it so i have to remove it using yts editor its still processing so enjoy the song while its still there cuz it will be gone later edit also for those of you who may not hear it the song is the sound of breath by sim it plays during the rainy scene with kiryu its a nice song the thing that bothers me about the massage scene is that makoto is apparently more blind now than when she actually couldnt see if someone reacted that way to the foot treatment she wouldnt just continue it the makotomajima scenes are really good through its too bad the majima episode doesnt really offer anything else beyond those two scenes though tfw i saw him sell the 3 million yen gun to a pawn shop and not the weapon dealer holy shit yay im still on the first game but i allowed myself five seconds of spoiler im excited ill be back here in like 9 years i know this video is from months and months ago but damn i regret missing out on the listening to blcd yaoi section there dammit hears ibuchis voice kono dio da i definitely wish hed come out and said it but at the same time i think it was probably better he didnt at that moment for all she still cares he did just vanish without a word there may be some uglier feelings there too and if she had any romantic feelings itdve made things awkward with her being married majima still does have romantic feelings so that would also have complicated things i think itd just be a reheartbreak for him and for the fans maybe wed view her poorly despite the situation and majima having left first if she had to let him down or outright reject him i dont know how happy id be i think the way they did it was probably better i had to skip the comment of the day because spoilers come on nico i really dont wanna be spoiled on that game the dynamic intro is still one of the sickest 2616 i rescind the yakuza ways majima i am at this point 100 that guys va is dio real glad that makotos able to put 2 2 together after receiving that gift it simply doesnt give that feeling of full closure without it and i knew it aside from the aura ibuchi emanates the moment i recognized his seiyuu who usually takes in badass andor villainous roles tis apparent that hes someone to contend with xd wow the song is still there a month later lucky me give me a moment to cry over one adorably sweet crazy majima goro i feel like kiryus stab wound was a representation of our heartbreak dio whit a gun ughhh so the song is still here after 6 days not complaining just weird that its still there or did it will be gone later actually mean the volume on it is gonna be turned down a little im confused i cant believe majima killed dio i just really need to let it out and say this video had me in tears after i figured out who ibuchis va was i half want majima to scream out diooooooooo majima reunion part 2 first half nico unsure second half nico realization complete now for a message for nico no mater how many yeas pass you will never not hear the jokes since no one is safe fore eg some people say something and it becomes like a joke a meme etc etc so no mater how many years go know one will ever for get on the bone meat seesaw effect let us beat that rubbish mentality into submission siiiinnnnjjjjjuuuukkkkuuuuu fruitball etc etc 2534 evil togami doesnt that imply theres a good togami also i cant be the only one who thinks that ibuchis va is dio right if kiryu cant kill people with guns then how does one expect kiryu to die from a stab wound villains never learn 442 it represents the elephant earth cuts to savannah five elemental elephants stand arguing over who gets what and where each one goes im so happy makoto could finally say thank you its just so satisfying what a beautiful way to start the mornin although the majima saga is sweet with makotos parts i cant help but feel a little disappointed with it it pretty much implies that he never forgot her or loved her throughout the past 18 years but saying this really screws over a certain character in yakuza 5 im avoiding spoilers but this is specially the case when you know through some of the things they went through during that characters career and its end of it it just feels weird especially since that character already had an established backstory and everything before y0 was even announced or released idk but it wouldnt be the first time the writers do something like this when it comes to love interests either way keep up the good work your vids are always a pleasure to watch i still really enjoy the small detail of the younger generation sitting casually while the older generation sits in seiza if only majima could be with makoto and lived happily ever after my man majima deserves some love im happy in this episode we got to see kidryu majimas last chapter begins me nico will cry nico will cry w majimas last chapter ends me crying like a river ttott i think the conclusion of makotos story is very common in japanese stories specially in the ones with heavy emotional plots stories from the west tend to conclude straight to a clear ending even if it leads to a cliffhanger but japaneses when they are still very good ones usually end like in a implicit and bittersweet way mostly because they rely a lot in symbols and metaphors yakuza series is so underrated if you or anyone also enjoys sleeping dogs and kung fu movies of the 80s and 90s then checkout this short play of sd with added bgm let me know what you think and maybe ill do more httpsyoutubengkaaxboq94 just getting in to leave a comment im a fan of nico but imagine this you dont have enough time to watch every episode of yakuza kiwami 2 but you love daddy kiryu and mayima and nicos jokes about all the silly humor of the series you are excited because when the series is over you could enjoy a daddy overload in one weekend buuuuuut you see makoto on the thumbnail of this one video a character you loved in yakuza 0 and you thought would never appear again in moshurigues own words sonuba bich nicooo nooo plizzz give me download your vidd i using wifi cause i dont have internet plizzz i was expecting the hostess hiding behind ibuchi to help out with maybe a bottle to the head or something can you guys help us out with the internet by signing the petition

they were indeed having the cookies hot and heavy cookies beware the mighty elephant earth nico its deadly 3045 you can really hear the dio in his voice but nico on the meat boneis part of picky penguin culture just like hope bagle turkey sandwiches and light heart dark heart part its hard wired into our brains for the rest of time theres no stopping it embrace it well nico you could have kept the gun for refill your heat gauge or just when you want to keep shooting at someone its always great onthetender cleavage god i love that you look it up on the internet line majima says hes totally that person who in a group chat asks the insanely long dumb questions but when someone else does it just answers ggrks which is japanese slang for go google it you dumb fuck they took her they are all dead they are about to learn what happens when you touch a dragons reverse scale first makoto got kidnapped and stabbed then kiryu gets stabbed i swear to christ if somethings happens to kaoru or haruka im gonna need to shank a bitch i was so stoked to see majima and makoto again that i needed to bingewatch yakuza 0 lp again bless her 3 whispers kiryubestyaoiva holy shit kei ibuchi share the same actor with dio tons of stuff to talk about here first of all while i appreciate the majima stuff we did get i cant help but wish theyd done even a little bit more with it than what we got i dont just mean making a more interesting mad dog style or hell even just straight porting some of majimas heat moves direct from y0 i mean also that it was crying out for substories of some kind giving us a chance to see the doll girl or one of the cabaret girls or heck even komaki interact with majima again the world feels so empty when its the same size but theres barely any people with faces to interact with i also wish thered been room to squeeze in something like majima meeting makotos sondaughter with neither of them knowing who the other was him helping them out in some way like he did makoto that sort of thing a less rushed way of getting majima and makoto to reunite if you will rather than her popping up out of nowhere and then disappearing like that that said the cutscene did someone sayreasearch when haruka enters the picturenothing else matters i genuinely cried my heart top 10 anime reunions did majima just shake off a bullet to the back of the head teruteru loves his meat on the bone on the meat bone rather than selling the special gun at the pawn shop its actually much better to sell it to kamiyamas shop to unlock more stuff meat on the bone bone bone from the cow cow cow what do mean thats not the right answer as the last leaf falls from the tree when the grass is a dry as can be our water resources turned to dust and the wind gives out its final gust destroyed and dead is our home the last picky penguin alive will scream out meat on the bone this is the most real baka mitai youve ever done you were expecting the main antagonist but it was me dio wait how is it that i only just realized that ibuchi is hans christian andersen 5700 kiryu god this sucks hope this doesnt become a thing this is adult writing unlike cheesy movies or dramas for teenagers when the guy and the girl live together happily ever after this is the pinnacle of love sacrifice seriously just do the majima karaoke in this game you would see that hes freaking heart broken on the inside but as long as makoto is happy he would gladly accept that and to those that wish something bad would happen to makotos husband so that she and majima can be together just dont majima will find you personally and you would find that death is a much more pleasant thing compared to what hes gonna do with you not gonna spoil anything but the copyright song destroys the atmosphere in this game aka most sad scenes i dont mind people liking this auto tune music or anything but it just feels out of place when compared to scenes from yakuza 0 and even kiwami that knows what song fits bone on the damn your cleavage majima vs dio and also another jojo reference 10023 kiryus voice actor has the voice of a sadistic top obviously i just now realized that makoto is whats written on majimas yellow helmet which made me think of what it means true real genuine and how it associates with makotos personality that kanji is also the ma in majima but it is interesting to see how it works for the both of them also that bakamitai intro nico why sees thumbnail oh god this is gonna hurt that majima final fight intro was so fucking good that glasses guy sounds weirdly familiar is that dios voice actor edit can confirm majima killed dio aw man lots of feels this episode first that baka mitai then that makoto moment i need a few minutes to recover oh also i really liked what they did with majima and makoto cause she worked back at that place just to meet majima again and thank him for what he had done but at least i was pretty sure that majima wouldnt tell her who he was so i was expecting a bad ending it left a really nice feeling to me when in the end for a completly different reason makoto ended up saying thank you to goro which means that her wish of thanking him for what he had done came true majima never fails to fulfill everyones dreams that last part with majima construction was like if the joker had to star up a construction site forreasons thanks for the awkward boner nico holly shit is that why gyarados from pokemon is water and flying type cause it counters rock pokemon with water but it is weak to rock cause its flying type also i cant believe what u can learn from 2 completly different kind of games for eachother haruka needs to catch a break i mean she was kidnapped by majima and saved by kiryu and then a year later kidnapped again man now we know how much is a maya she is im more surprised you actually played that audio clip nico brave soul bone on the meat on the cubone bone please next episode i wanna know how ya gonna save haruka d editbtw when u take a picture on your phone with karuka she will pose for the picture its kinda adorable thing they did to yakuza kiwami 2 xd if you are interested the bl was from a bl drama cd called gokudou wa suits ga osuki and kuroda did also played a yakuza in that drama too ahand he plays with one of the ultimate ukes hirakawa daisuke i totaly have a lady boner right now man this episode was one hell of a feels trip 3523 was he trying to summon his persona i remember trying to watch a playthrough of danganronpa 2 and not being able to find a channel that i liked even your channel nico i was trying to get used to your humour and such up until on the meat bone that single freaking quote has made me stick with you till this day and age keep being weird and dumb and funny nico love you and all the picky penguins on the meatbone will never die as a joke never majima vs dio is top 10 anime fights the song that plays during majimas massage session with makoto and when kiryu is sulking by the river is actually one of two licensed songs in the game by the band sim unlike earlier yakuza games that were localized in the west sega actually managed to keep sims songs in the game both zero and kiwami had licensed songs for their openings but they were cut due to licensing restrictions the song featured in these two scenes is called sound of breath while the second song they wrote is called a you thought i ibuchi was evil togami but it was i dio i feel like kiryu and makoto both bring out majimas mad dog with kiryu bringing out the mad crazy part of majima while makoto bring out the dog protectiveloyal part with him trying to protrect her from trouble by not revealing who he is so that no one will see a connection between them but also tht he cares about her after 20 years and is still trying to keep her out of harms way by not revealing who he is dang it didnt have to remind me that stan lee is dead every single time i watch the reunion between majima and makoto i get hit with the damn feels all over again i have no regrets i like how majima still managed to hide his eyepatch the whole time thats the only feature makoto really knows about him you have just watched majima beat the living shit out of dio youre welcome i love the song when it was raining and kiryu was smokingi also got a copyright claim but luckily no one too any actions the whole stab wound couldve been healed if kiryu went to have some food 5700 alternate song how could this happen too meeeeee the sequel to really guy seriously guy nico the song that plays when kiryu gets stabbed in the rain is called sound of breath by sim did majima just fairly odd parent nishidas question man that old man was right kyriu would end up with a knife in the ribs on the bone meat the bone on meat the meat on bone on the meat bone meat on the bone bone on the meat employees get mad if you break their shit woulda thunk ryota theres only one left proceeds to shoot majima 7 more times 1650 you do realize that joke is never dying now dont tell the internet to forget something now itll come up even more well screw you too kaoru majimas last boss fight should have been dio majima vs dio i had actually looked up what happened to makoto after watching youre playthrough of yakuza 0 and when i read about what happened in the story there i cried i was happy she finally got to thank him but was also really sad because its just sad hope they got the build permits or the city will come tear it down at least in the us woah woah woah this is a christian minecraft server abort abort rest in peace stan lee makoto knew im pretty sure about that the moment she began massaging his arms and he recognized the watch she paused feeling his arms and then she told him the story she said she has not told anyone else a story he already knew i mean she clung to those lovely muscle bags for her life many many times in yakuza 0 w it all makes sense now guys why nishiki ended up hating kiryuhe got feed up of being on the receiving end ripstanlee you always be our superhero excelsior prized gun is actually like the cricket in the men in black movie nothing much to look at but secretly the most powerful weapon in the game and nicob is going around selling it for a measly 3000000 yen omg this entire episode is really cool so me being weird i decided to watch the first few moments of the fight with evil togami where majima charges forward and the 2 start countering each other blow for blow in slow motion i realized at 3112 the second gun came out of nowhere hello nicobsan the other day i was walking down the street minding my own business when a stranger stopped me to ask for help turns out he needed someone to fill in the role of a voice actor for a video game having never done this before i decided to give it a shot i mean why not but i soon realized i made a mistake the video game was for adolescent girls i cant explain the details right now mostly because im still recovering from this scarring experience anyway its been rough but at least i got a gift from my sugar daddy 3 sometimes i think his love for me is over the top in fact let me go open the gift really quick he gifted me a prize gun i mean it looks great and all but its not a very effective weapon at all what the hell sigh judgement kazzy what sengoku doesnt realize is messing with kiryu like thatisnt going to end well with him kiryu fuck my no killing rule you mess with my baby girl ill pull your fucking head off meat bone on the meat hard bone xd that intro too soon nico too soon to soon nico to soon rest in peace oh legend of marvel i dont think youre greedy for wanting majima to reveal that its him im sure a lot of fans wouldve wanted that complete closurewas what i was going to say i held out after thinking that weve still got the rest of the majima side story episode so maybejuuuuuuuuuuuuust maybe theyd somehow manage to wrap things up nicely and well it was as good as the ribbon wrapped on makotos present so im happy 3048 god you can just hear the dio brando in his voice lol kiryu has taken bullets to the face planks of wood to the chest furniture thrown at him majimas knife but a basicass poisoned knife is what gets him weak as much as i adore majima i have to feel bad for the guys that work for him also damn makoto really knows what shes doing if she can make majima squirm in pain to many feels packed into one episode edit also listening to yaoi with nico feels so weirdbut fitting considering my profile pic is kiryuxmajima haruka being all maya fey up in this bitch sengoku buddy there has got to be a better way of delivering a ransom note than that i mean i know the point is you want him dead but still i wonder if this will be the last time well ever see makoto again makes sense for her to be gone from yakuza 3 to 6 but maybe she can come back in 7 or any spin offs they have i also wanna know what she named her kid i bet its after her brother since i think she has a son in after its always dio if you got into a fight while bleeding out you imidiatly return to normal speed when the bakamitai actually brings you feels meat on the bone meat bone bone the background song for majimas song at the beginning is called the sound of breath by sim a really good listen nico i swear if majima doesnt get her in the end i will cry dont test me you dont know what im capable of doing ill cry so much well have enough water to fill the entire world im not funny but after that i just imagine this you just listened listening to porn with nicob ft kazuma kiryu to listen to the whole audio download it now on mayafeysyaoistack com with the promo code wtf69 and get 60 off order it now phoenix maya stop download ur yaoi crap on my computer maya never youll never understand phoenix pearl i still dont what yaoi is im glad nico put the image of stan lee in the now back to today that one of my sources of inspiration was able to pay tribute to one of the men that started me on my journey and one of my first inspirations rest in peace stan lee excelsior rip stan lee edit glad i had headphones on oo you know seeing the original rain scene in y2 compared to this kinda ruins it both song fits just fine but the original songs jazzy and out of tune singing does an amazing job at contrasting the current moody scene with it also being synced to create an even better atmosphere people thinking the jazzy upbeat and out of tune singer doesnt fit kinda misses the point its good because it doesnt fit it enhances the atmosphere the scene is trying to convey the original was pretty perfect imo and while i dont have anything against the current song as it also fits y2s rendition was just the type of scene where you go back and watch it just to admire the scene composition combined with the intended track majima inner voice say yes ahhhhhhh majima externally dont let the reunion with makoto distract you from the fact that majima fought dio in this episode or the this is like the fourth or fifth time harukas been kidnapped by someone i can most assuredly tell you i did not in any way lose my shit at the revelation that she was kidnapped nope not at all didnt the stab messenger play the deadpool game youre suppose to impale the note onto the knife then stab the receiver rip stan lee i love that somebody looked over the script and even devided people wont buy kyru being seriously injured from just a stab lets throw a poison in too nico uploads a new video meah hell ye stan lee shows up mei dont want to live on this planet anymore nico the counter that majima does can only be done when your enemy is unarmed i believe 3400 waitmajimoku spares freezuchi but wait just when majimoku thinks the battles over and he has done his part the caniving freezuchi shoost a ki blast at majimoku next time on yakuzaball z ibuchis boss theme is one of my favorite themes in the game too soon never forever meat on the bone on the meat i wont even say please dont forget me all i want is for you to be happy into tomorrow as long as youre happy forever rest in peace stan lee your comics will always be remembered weird when ibuchi pulled the trigger and killed himself my lamp just flickered and my heater just turned off what in the actual fu the golden samurai just wants some on the bone meat 1006 crudely cuts out doctor with scissors and pastes a picture of majima over him adds eyepatch to kid there scene fixed waaaah why no happily ever after with his princess because a yakuza is not a prince reunited and it feels so good painful yeah go ahead and kick my heart in the balls why dontcha majima is the only guy that can bring a knife to a gun fight i like how nico wanted majima to talk to makoto but just like he did it the last time he saw her on yakuza 0 he didnt say a word to her yet managed to make her happy once more in 0 he made sure that the guy had his mind set on getting together with makoto and now he managed to lift a 18 years old weight from her chest he said that she worked out some knotts he had for 18 years but he did just the same for her when youre getting the notification for nico video 1 hour late too soon im really enjoying this lp i starting taking japanese class this semester and its really fun to be able to understand little pieces of dialogue today i heard a new vocab word atarashi which means new this game is helping me recognize words and learn different contexts they can be used in who said video games impede learning bartender sir im going to need to cut you off kiryu but i havent even ordered anything yet bartender thats not the point you come in here everyday order the same drink and cry while singing over a different picture every time some days youll leave and come back with a new picture like three minutes later youre scaring away my customers kiryu shut up you just dont understand beats up bartender kiryu three minutes later sings baka mitai over a picture of the bartender majima sure knows how to pull on our heartstrings so ive said this before on an earlier video but i really think you should get all the side stuff done at the beginning of chapter 13 everything is unlocked then and the storys pace will be really screwed up if you do it anywhere else to note about ibuchi committing suicide it can be inferred that since majima beat him and report to terada ibuchi was going to die either by the tojos hands or by the omi as a result committing suicide would have saved him from a long painful death by either group plus the omi executive that ibuchi was talking about is arguably takashima as they are the composed schemer type as well as ibuchi using takashimas original visual model due even though the voice actor in both the original remake are the same the remake decided to mocap the actual voice actor oh fuck that makoto opening the gift scene actually almost making me teared up damn you yakuza dont worry nico i think youll get the tiger drop real soon i got off of pornhub for th hears yaoi moaning welp zip previously on listening to porn with nicob i love how kiryu came in drenched in blood but when he woke up he was spotless how nice with having dios voice actor voice ibuchi im very surprised that there wasnt a wryyyyy or any jojo references but the voice acting was great however majimaaaaaaaaa ibuchiiiiiiiiiiii muda muda muda muda muda muda muda ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora where did kiryu get a new suit after being stabbed either aoi washed and dried it while he was out and then slipped his jacket and pants on or kiryu just has extra suits stashed in places he might need them that opening today mr nico i dont feel so good glad everything got settled with majima he did a smart move to tell makoto who he was now its time for kiryu to be the one suffering when kawamura got shot by ibuchi my immediate thought was it was me dio n i couldnt help but laugh my ass offxd the fact that ibuchiz va is the same as dio does not helpxdd 3054 3124 that dynamics intro is so awesome i mean majima is dodging bullet at point blank like its nothing plot twist when majima was injured and encountered kiryu and kaoru the omi thugs didnt hurt him he just barely escaped the obatarian by the way nico fun fact in the original yakuza 2 the song that played during the raining scene was actually different the original song was kuroi kizuato no blues translation black scar blues by crazy ken band its a really good song i recommend later to either look up the song from crazy ken band on youtube or alternatively look up on youtube yakuza kiwami 2 crazy ken band because a person was nice enough to edit the kiwami 2 raining scene to be like it was originally in yakuza 2 with the song from crazy ken band and without the knife sound effect i would have if the same thing didnt happen to the nyan cave and remained me long comment short itll never die how the first majima construction meeting went majima you guys dont know how to google shit dont you guys have phone so everything confirms that makoto is no longer blind but she still somehow doesnt point out majima desperately crying for help reaching out for someone while applying pressure to his soles there mightve been some more trauma than we first thought guys tender cleavage on the meatbone tender cleavage on the meatbone errrimma shut up now is anybody else hoping for nico to fully sing baka mitai in the finale cause i would definitely enjoy that not gone lie ah makoto began yakuza 0 from a masseuse to demanding the heads of 3 dojima lieutenant hooo quite the growth when i heard ibuchi voicei was like where have i heard his voice before but then it hit me he is fucking voiced by tokeyasu the same guy who voiced dio mother fucking brando the stan lee cameo even though there are few elements of the majima chapters that are a bit disappointing namely the very limited gameplay that stuff with makoto definitely makes it all worth it its really nice to see a character like that get a proper happy ending because that is extremely rare in this series of course it is still bittersweet since we all want majima to end up with her but theres no way that relationship wouldnt have ended in tragedy conidering i dont see any ads on this video yep deeeeeee you can finish the word yourselves im to lazy apparently not togami is voiced by takehito koyasu who voiced the one the only dio ibuchi i am going to update the yakuza redraw the yakuza i am going to remake the yakuza and give it a cool new name like extreme yes i will turn yakuza in yakuza kiwami on the bone meat great memes never die nothings better than some yakuza on my birthday ah what a beautiful day to start the day by watching nicob nico lets hear kiryu having gay sex wait wha gay sex noises kiryu oh shit i been stabbed in a cutscene cant fall over or blackoutmustreachgameplay the earth elephant youtube your monetization is already dead nico nani 2450 a reference to angry joe so before the dragon tattoo teen kiryu had a dragon design on his varsity jacket does that count as foreshadowing or not because its a flashback i went online and nico there is a remake of yakuza 3 for ps4 but its in japanese it will not be released in the west for a while but to pass the time play one of the spin off games such as the fist of the north star majima and terada meet with the omi majima heywait a minutearent you that pants thief i caught 20 years ago ryuji wait what chairman goda ryuji you were stealing pants 20 years ago ryuji ok i can explain 5749 get stab pulled out a knife and ask why blood not stopping conclusion it must be poison i like how at the end of the intros yaoi soundbite kiryu pretty much says just kidding what a cocktease had to turn the volume down wouldnt want my grandmother and little sister mistaking kiryu helping that dude with his cookie dilemma for something else ya know sorry to nitpick gamingsinsstyle but wouldnt that note be covered in blood dame da ne dame yo dame nano yo crudely drawn picture of majima and makoto making out on the side i visualised that fight to be majima vs dio 5550 that turned anime as fuck can i also just say that having ryu in both kiryu and ryuji is just cool on the development part even tho i know its wholeheartedly intentional rambling mode alert theres something i want to say about majimas and makotos relationship from early on it was clear majima wanted to protect makoto because he really is a good guy those feelings ended up evolving into love but how could he love her when he was supposed to kill her when he got her into an even worse situation where her brother died now too he doesnt say anything at the end of 0 to protect her its sooo bittersweet but then the yakuza crew decides to throw in some hella good developed fanservice to break our kokoros in this dlc majima is still trying to do his best to protect makoto by keeping quiet but even still he cant help but feel relaxed remember in 0 how majima couldnt even sleep a wink in his cage of a city yet when he meets makoto he finally falls asleep despite his unrequited affection he still worries over her even when she gets married and has a kid he has no jealousy only pure happiness and relief that said you coul wouldve been nice to have that heat move where you take someones hand to a wall or a table high anything and stab the hand i know in the yakuza playthroughs thanks to the sidequests we joke about everyones favorite segment watching porn with nico but today i had to actually experience listening to pornographic material with nico and for that i thank you wew majima saga time the music is an odd choice it doesnt feel like it fits but at the same time it kind of does sometimes because of the dissonance the reason why the counter seems finicky is that it has a tight timing and youre doing it at 30fps harder to time in yakuza 0 you were doing counters at 60fps the cutscene to the final boss not the long ass speech the action sequence of the majima saga is fuckin amazing majima literally anticipates and dodges shots from point blank range and then you get some closure to makoto and majima which was nice kiryu gets impaled and just walks the fuck away how awful nice of kiryu to offer his cookies and milk he made that dude sound real happy ugly crysinging when you walk away you dont hear me say pleeeeeeeeese oh baaaaabyyyy dont gooohooohoooooo yes nico good good begin the descent in yaoi madness join us nico join us muwahahahaha if this gets comment of the day my name is pronounced cyan like the color i just realized the glasses guy in majima saga has the same voice actor as takasugi from gintama neat love me that i will destroy this world voice man remember when majima fought gun dio love at first assassination attempt eh majima imagine if the guy who stabbed kiryu was actually bacchus kiryu bacchus why bacchus i warned you about the knives in the ribs boy and since you werent prepared you must perish and then bacchus runs off and kiryu realizes that his wallet is missing damn never expected the stan lee in the previously on rip hes truly the greatest cameo to ever to grace the world stan lee will live on in our hearts forever rip stan lee only majima can bring a knife to a gun fight and win man those low life punks are going to die for taking haruka hostage i feel sorry for them when that day arrived i gotta say that part where kiryu reveals he was at the jigewon mafia shooting kinda annoyed me a bit yes it does explain why the guy said you lying dog but it still felt like it was added in that being said it was pretty awesome to see young teenage kiryu here on the meat bone is immortal its such a bitter sweet moment to see makoto again its like you know majima saved the girl but he never got her in other news that fight with d i mean ibuchi is badfuckingass especially how majima clashed at the beginning also rip stan lee picky penguins unite to give majima the biggest group hug ever we all know he needs it goddamn why did ntr yourself majima i hate situations like this so much because i totally understand why he chose that path but what about your happiness majima be happy makoto tt 5640 looks like bacchus was right all along dammit old man yakuza when its not warming your balls with joy they bust them till you cant feel anything its a never ending cycle whyd you have to give me the feels with stan lee but in a happy note the waifu returns i hate the fact that the bl nico played is the very same one that introduced me to takaya kurodas bl audio stuff my fujoshi heart aaaaaaaaahhhhh i wanna know where the clip is from though lol ya worked out some knots ive had for 18 years that is such a good line this is the monetization police we had a report of some kinky shit in your videos nah false alarm its just two guys enjoying cookies in world where both honor traditions are drowned by greed one man fights to drag those values back to the surface cues yakuza kiwami 2 majima campaign promo this thursday witness how one man proves that every dog has his day nicob as goro majima takehito dio koyasu as kei ibuchi in goro majima vs zaworldo coming to youtube preorder tickets on patreon for any price get a makoto plushie and after that kid ate the cookies kiryu gave him ryuji stole the thiefs pants hello nico it is i satan again here to ask you two important questions totally super duper important first who is your otp in kiwami 2 is it majimaxmakoto kiryuxkaoru or the deeper meaningful ones like kiryuxdestroyingfurniture or kiryuxyaoifanfics or judgmentkiryuxcinderellamajima where was this going again oh yes and question two if someone already asked before i apologize but for the kiwami 2 finale can you do a legit cover of baka mitai at least the chorus id love to hear it as im sure everyone else would thanks for reading and being cool both you and your subs satan 5000 finally youve reached the point that i mentioned to have been foreshadowed for awhile its the fact that kiryu knew and was indirectly involved with the jingweon genocide remember very early on when kiryu first met kaoru and asked her about why she targeted the tojo clan about her being an orphan he asked her if she is ready to know about the truth like he did in the last game he suspected her to be related to certain incidents caused by the tojo clan later on he acted awkward around her especially after that dating scene asking her several times if she is willing to know about the truth whenever hes not calm about something he smokes which you also saw in the rain scene here he really was worried about her and her reaction upon finding out the truth and partially also because he felt that he messed everything up by going after kazama another reason behind him being really sad and worried that kaoru will find out the truth will be revealed later on also ive been waiting for this never expected to have a listening to bl with nicob segment on yakuza of all series i love it its just so touching how they tied a loose end which wasnt even that loose even tighter in the end makoto managed to thank majima and he can rest easier knowing he left her in good hands oh look guys its everyones favorite nico session watching yaoi with nicob please never make this a thing no matter how hard maya pushes

heard from him again end ps i already miss larry voice nishida 027 rip stan lee that baka mitaii think i need a moment yeah japanese music publishers are even more ruthless when it comes to copyright than american ones especially when a very popular band like sim is the one the song came from thats why the licensed songs in yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 were removed because it costs so much to have them licensed to be overseas the fact that they were kept in kiwami 2 is actually pretty incredible even if im not the biggest fan of them if anyones curious about the song that got removed these are the beginning lyrics and donald voice oh boy if anyone wasnt sure of majimas unrequited love for makoto sit tight sim the sound of breath if the world could fit in my palm it would be easy to keep it calm if i can hold you in my arms ah ah it would be easy to make my resolution firm if you want to stay like this forever youd better stop and close your eyes but you you wont let me do even that ah the

good you do good anchoring also and you do a lot of hardwork but most surprisingly you are running this channel from 2009 and it is going to be ten years next year but you have only 38000 subscribers other channels which have joined in 2017 have 44000 subscribers like anmol jaiswal but unfortunately your channel has only 38000 subscribers in 9 years i pray for you that as soon as possible you channel reaches 1 million subscribers by the way can you suggest some games like this one only which do not have much violence in them because i dont like games like the last of us uncharted series

extremely underrated game in indian gaming scenario japanese games especially jrpg games need more recognition in india its funny how she kept saying protective custody when kyriu didnt really need it and save her more kiryu is lonely now kaoru san please u must find him if you notice throughout the games kiryu despite being a physically speciman and very handsome and masculine really doesnt know how to talk to women and is quite awkward around them this is the first time you see him actually have some game ryuji why the hell did you dislike this video so she comes back bam kiryu is dead when i first saw kiryu kissed kaoru i was like whhaaatttt and jawdropped didnt know he has the guts to do it proud of him though kudos to kiryu whats the theme name that starts at 133 also this scene come back kaoru kazuma is lonely at the end of yakuza 6 oh boy nicob is gonna flip in not cryingim not crying 2 is the only one i dont remember much about haha im still struggling to beat the pachinko side mission in the original so hold up yea he shouldve been the dlc in tekken 7 instead of fn noctis i has play de yakuza 1 and 2 in ps2 plataform it is a amazing game very badass characteres great history funny moments great title of sega its come to the point where kiryu just doesnt take any damage anymore so is kiwami the first game and kiwami 2 the second one im new to series and preordered yakuza 6 and got yakuza 0 with it so starting with that one but this is really a cool game visit the same video on my channel pin this comment plz first comment first only a minute and a half in and elyse is out of control and im here for every second friends is the worst shit ever sorry the thumbnail art for this video is really great kids who have mustaches in middle school always like ska man im sad they didnt get to fighting majima i get a feeling james would love it is james japanese cause i would totally beat him off 957 those beeps remind me of a really popular 80s song that i cant remember and its driving me crazy did anyone else find it adorable when elyse said the lollipop sentencenojust meok this video has so many classic moments 015 james reaction to the accent 133 you are deh wun who da treaden 228 japanese names honda prius and crv 340 fuckin weeb 556 extreee extreee small boy 1133 berrrrry guuuuud eleyse never stop with the voices we need more moustache bruce aw she can beat me anytimeno for real i would actually let her beat my ass dudes the thumbnail had me thinking why is daenerys targaryen beating up bruce for a sec boss coffee had tommy lee jones on a couple of their commercials he played an alien for some reason the hit detection in this game is horrid lol how to watch the full gameplay eylse is super cute in this like kawaii cute damn it james just do the voice they shouldve photoshopped in a godbeer on the train the thumbnail looks really cool whoever made that did a good job i really liked snappy elyse in the video she was taking extra shots at james this time around 1126 take that honda ross growing rage throughout the series was the funniest part as soon as i clicked on this video i realized i had already watched it so obviously i watched again and laughed at the same dumb jokes i love you funhaus damn thumbs up for the baby bash reference 505 um yeah hey alanah its called kaiju porn you uncultred swine love the gameplay video thou ok bye oh you got suga how did he get so fly thank you for that charalanhzard according to bruce the fault in our stars takes place in the problem ward of the hospital oh alanah it was definitely not emilia clarke me i dont like alanah alanah ross is garbage me aaand i have a crush now i was in middle school when g4 was a thing lol i forgot about attack of the show thought yall were a lil younger james is just worried if the actual yakuza is watchin this theyre trying too hard to be lacist see it aint hard on side note no wonder i dont watch these people 215 is the best part they should do the rizap side missions for james didnt even notice this was a yakuza gameplay because their impressions distracted me so much where did bruces hairline go uh it was shailene woodley i swear if i see one more tick tok video im going to flip next best teal video james restraint in this video is absolutely amazing alanna is wrong about the fault in our stars cast and must be reprimanded ross is a nerd i dont speak the language i speak the accents james elyse nailing the sonny chiba impression heptonast for this guys when ever they play something asian they usually have lawrence in the video not that the 4 arent doing a great job its missing that touch lol as an asian i cant believe james is not asian if i close my eyes he sounds exactly like my mom i figured it out subheadline mustache growing in nicely jesus elyses legs are heavenly fucking thank you james and elyse everyone i know hates ross but he genuinely is the funniest friend can you tell that bitch to stop skipping cutscenes is it bad that i clicked on this so i could hear more of james japanese voice this video has an exceptional lack of incredibly uncomfortable adam in it i dont get this fanbase how are those the top comments i dont like jackusa demon soul and witcha games wheres my medal as a white male im offended i came for james japanese voice and then i came for alanahs japanese voice rip allanahs suga howd you get so fly line criminally underrated zilla is what the japanese named the shitty american version of godzilla they took the god out of the name because he sucks how do these guys not get skinned alive in california for even pretending to be edgy andor racist imagine if mark dice or some other moderately right leaning youtuber acted the way these guys dolol not complaining i love them thank god they get a pass i call bs at ellise being 7 when friends was on puns are dropping faster as brucies hair elyse where did you get that skirt sooooo cute this video was berrry gooo so if you had a nameless katana what would you name it who is mark ass spam japan is so awesome alanah stop trying to womansplain romantic movies try rocket launcher how the hell does elyse do such accents its as if she is a native pivot pivot pivot i dont know what that means i only came here for james japanese voice very upset hey funhaus should do a running yandere simulator series let me guess james makes a that racist joke i wish to see james react to kiryus sexy dragon shirtless body he would love that anyone else notice the continuous small looks of confusion on alanahs face every time bruce starts on a monologue turn this into a series please the likes to dislike ratio almost made me cream my jeans thats one of my favourite elise moments 129 youuuuu are de 1 who de tredin lmao toyota corolla crv hahaha bruh that killed me i dont dislike alanah at all i wish achievement hunter was as good at new hires and guests as funhaus but she is always so confident in her assertions even when she is completely wrong its a bit annoying why is alannah wrong about so many things that dont really matter and now my brother is wondering why i am shouting pivot at my computer and laughing dont ever stop the voice although i like that everyone gave it a go lol you know who else is a racist your mom if alanah could just constantly do her different accents like her anime girl or american person thatd be pretty splendid alana it is definitely not emilia clarke the thumbnail for this video is incredible alanah as a japanese thug kina cute tho 828 alana oh you got sugar alana how did he get so fly alanas music references are the best is james slowly becoming a pc sjw npc not good in japanese voice youre lucky cause skipping yakuza cutscenes is a crime in most countries the whole episode i was waiting for james impression never felt so much tension my whole life attack of the show was pretty fun to watch back in the day its crazy that james bruce and adam were a part of it all along yeah but can we talk about elyses skirt in a ijustthinkitlookscoolandisanicecolouripromiseimnotacreeppleasebelieveme kinda way please alanah the movie you were thinking of is me before you yo that thumbnail was on point just sayin the casting in the fault in our stars is a hilarious thing for bruce to know about and not alanah lets appreciate alanahs baby bashrobin schultz reference at 0829 though for a second if you want to do a japanese accent imagine youre doing a heavy lift thats why james is so good at it something about alana just pisses me off i dont know what it is exactly but videos with her in it always make me tune out elyse what is that a kpop group bruce its jpop elyse before another 12 minutes of offensive japanese references oh well im a racist james getting offended by their bad accents you can see alanah questioning her decision to be in funhaus at 1207 dont lie your all weebs omg that kid bruce with only his stache looks like pedro infante xd friends is garbage but no one is gonna listen to little ol me alanah has confused fault in our stars with me before you and ive never seen someone so confident theyre right while being so damn wrong hey u tell that burnie guy alleged tesla owner to shut up no one can stop master james with japanese accent alanah has to leave funhaus until she becomes more cultured alanah is like every australian ive known frequently loud and frequently wrong ill say it i loved the video but it was painful watching them play this lol i feel lawrence would have appreciated this more and i noticed they finally changed the title to kiwami 2 haha friends sucks not very funny i was a frasier man myself we should fire him elyse 2k19 ross is garbage says alanah geller that elephant though routine gives me the willies huh their confusion over the breathing tube thing made me think about how many strong woman supports strong mangenius with crippling disability movies weve had recently ive never clicked a video faster my favorite gamers playing my favorite series heaven james is self aware i demand justice for the miss identification of the star of the fault in our stars hey im just a little boy with a mustache bruce greene not even her its emilia clarke rooster teeth we need a video to offend japanese asians in general the gays newsies and shailene woodley fans funhaus say no more pretty disappointed they didnt touch the minigames i almost expected it to be 80 them playing minigames james that was super racist dude wtf we take a de kidz heh and we make a dem gae geyou kidduz its pronounced gojira chandler is the best friend ross is the funniest character finally people are saying it james was an asian man in his previous life james should do some voice acting he can teach everyone how to sound like a anime character lol 848 i think bruce was saying banzai not bonsai but i guess it works either way that wasnt emilia clarke bruce was right its the same chick i hate that i know that this is great love jamess coaching keep it up ugh elyse cmon let adam handle the steering wheel why are all japanese things so fucking stupid allanah isnt that funny but she fits well ah revenge the revenging 827 woah hold up is that a baby bash reference alanah alannah pearce captain of the funhaus clan elyse is on fire in this one so fucking hilarious omg this is amazing great cast for this video let james do the voice which yakuza is this convenient pile of knives killed me xd i havent laughed this hard since scrobbles holy shit elyse you made me bust a nutt 215 3 fuuuuqqq d shailene woodley was in fault in our stars definitely not emilia clarke lol great thumbnail this reminds me of sleeping dogs guys please play sleeping dogs good story the friends from the tv show friends are shit unfunny people wake up people i really hope they get to the final level and defeat the crime boss called honda civic farmer roots rainbow mountain blend is the finest canned coffee known to man i think elyse does the best japanese accent janes you fucking sexually confused cocktease do the damn voice so we can all go home 1141 and demonitized 531 i laughed so hard at this im offended that there was a 12 minute video of a japanese game and james only once did his authentic japanese voice i love the fact that alanah made a baby bash reference elyses laugh brings me to life the thumbnail embodies the potrusion of alanah in funhaus perfectly imo they seemed like they were having fun around this game not with this game but definitely around this game it is shailene woodley in fios disappointing alannah poor bruce ramune james the marble soda is called ramune um acktually battra is a mothhes mothras evil brother also one piece ramune bottle nice b this wowwy pop is dewisious i understand the silent joke at the beginning this is offensive hahaha can a funhaus member say who edited this because they are now top of the funhaus editing rank list i never noticed that body pillow graphic before between the shelves thats some booty bruces lollipop phrase had me dying nah my dude that isnt emilia clark in fault in our stars haha bruce was 100 correct dang that thumbnail tho this went real always sunnyand i love it also high so i duno it couldve sucked so many good things this vid everyone doing asian accent elyse burning james bruce as a newsie alanahs one chance at getting a contemporary pop culture reference and failing horribly elyses closing zinger golden the adjustment bureau is in change of eyebrow alignments elise sucks stop putting her on the stream re takeda kids and re makedem gaaaeeyy is it just me or am i seeing alana slowly losing it thorugh her face expression lmao although i enjoy every alanah appearance im worried about rorensu the yakuza where is he is he got killed another video ruined by her i get that you guys are trying to cut dead air but it was very hard to enjoy some jokes in this video when it gets cut immediately its so fast paced i feel like im being hurried so much i really like the thumbnail for this scrappy doo is a mumble rapper pile of buck 110 knives usa madedesign seems right for streets of japan lol that thumbnail is brilliant bravo i love newsie bruce better be a recurring character lot of consistently good content as of the last couple weeks its really appreciated so glad its coming to pc the art for the thumbnails has been awesome i shall not let alanahs baby bashs suga suga reference go unnoticed when alanah said that it was emilia clarke in the fault in our stars and not shailene woodleywas she being reverse racist by saying that all white women look alike she should stop skipping cut scenes elyse oh very good bruce ooooh verrry gooood james hold my beer httpsyoutubeyk4wn22hdp4 i love their video backlog didnt alanah go to japan like 6 months ago lawrence wouldnt skip the cutscene and would waste their time on it also they stopped just before the iconic chandelier scene and boss fight lol alanahs face in the thumbnail is my reaction to the videos title i stopped listening to beastie boys for this couldnt resist beating off japanese men elyse is a national treasuresure hope the muricans appreciate us lending her to you suga how you get so fly i see you alanha every member of this gameplay looked super hot on this day note to alanah it is shailene woodley in the fault in our stars coulda done without the voice but the newsie bit and all the murder kiryu committed makes up for it emilia clarke the fuck is alanah watching game of thrones disabled edition im here for japanese james where is he this rarely happensbut booce was right shylean woodlee would be so proud james likes friends but hates the big bang theory why am i not surprised oh you grabbed sugar how did he get so fly fuckin lold until this episode i didnt think it was possible to have a gameplay of an asian game without lawrence i had this one piece one fucking weeb man friends are over rated oh he is talking about the show yea that show he did it he did it i think allanah was thinking about me before you which has emilia clarke looking after a paralyzed guy sad af film let james do the voice it is soooo good my poor mustachioed baby boi bruce knowing full well emilia clarke is not in that movie yet alanah insists on cufuzzling him thats the equivalent of a japanese dude not being able to tell the diff between an american and a canadian damn still waiting on pc really would like alanna to stop replacing lawrence tbh james is the only one that can do the voice you offensive fucks for gods sake funhaus get your shit together lawrence will end you all with one decisive cut for this great transgression against his motherland daaamn elyse somewhere besides those legs theres a video about something going on but i cant tell alannah is no lawrence how did i die i died of laughter because of this video god dammit i wanted james to do the asian accent as an asian man i dont feel offended at all cause i think its funny please do a part 2 why does the thumbnail look like wiki how art i like bruces face when theyre talking about shailene woodley alana says it was emilia clarke in fault in our stars but he was right and he knew itso perplexed such weird timing i just bought this game today lol funhaus needs more color just sayin as an asian person i would say james is correct all of their impressions were offensive only james has truly mastered the non racist asian accent said it before and ill say it again alanah could go away and i wouldnt miss anything was that pewdiepie on that poster this whole video elise and bruce try to upstage james perfect ethnic voice i love the thumbnail goddamn hm really like i get what funhaus is and i love them but the whole video has to be riding the line of racism 420 we both went to punch each other oh its like tekken our fists accidently grabbed each others dicks oh i would so watch a fun lp of any yakuza game even dead souls from funhaus u can put part 1 and stuff so we know very upset that alannah skipped everything 331 that could not be any further from the truth alanah i really appreciated that sugar how you get so fly joke from alanah im glad they corrected the title haha im like 98 sure this is kiwami 2 but okay 224 james japanese man trying to speak english bruce elyse non japanese person trying to speak english as a japanese person alana every english dub in existence do a full playthrough please imagine james and bruce seeing some of the most ridiculous side missions ever created cmon wow her beauty i cannot stop looking at alanah 820 me before youdo i need to give up my man card for knowing that 120 thats not exactly untrue there were actually mass stabbing where they killed upwards of 8 and injured many more people one was at a school and the other was old folks home though with that said there was that 1 terrorist group who gassed people and had lots of illegal guns alanah you are garbage for not thinking ross is the funniest character the soundboards people can make off of this episode lmpo laughing my patooty off pronounced lampo thumbs me up so it catches on it wouldnt be the dumbest new acronym sugar howd you get so fly fantastic reference we should fire him now all they need to play is yakuza 0 thats how yakuza works alanah corrected bruce but was wrong it was shailene woodley i am disappointed at this vulgar display of femcorrecting oh funhaus is channeling the spirit of super best friends play recently especially pat who loves the yakuza games so disappointed james didnt do the japanese voice i love it so much does anyone know if they still upload the 23 hour unedited footage anywhere they used to do that all the time back in the day and i miss it thugs in japan are just guys that are better dressed than you hahaha i can see it now vox white male from funhaus is racist the whole time i was waiting for lawrence to come bursting through the door 530 that reply is spot on yeees a beeryyy goood paul bettaniiaa now bringata robertaa downey juniore in hearre im with james i have star wars cereal boxes from the force awakens displayed in my kitchen along with a box of luciohs and an unopened can of overwatch junkrat pringles im a hoarder its so refreshing seeing these types of jokes in the environment we live in today when people get offended by a fart thanks for the laughs emilia clarke wasnt in the fault in our stars lol i think alanah is thinking of the wrong movie god i wish these games were on xbox those boss coffees are actually really good in tokyo berry good we should fire him this was a fun video the asian voice bit had a nice pay off im also happy to see more alana im gonna have to go watch kung fools again to make up for the lack of asian james or maybe the pearl harbor demo disk thats how yakuza works oof yikes it definitely wasnt emilia clarke in the fault in our stars it was shailene woodly and she was the tube one with problems as bruce puts it alanah ruins some thugs oghh werry gould you makka my penisue weerrry haord why are people hating on alanah shes one of the 3 women from australia without jacked teeth shes funny and beautiful fuck lame ass blaine he didnt deserve this goddess fucking james is so good at that voice haha this episode can be summed up as everyone tries to convince bruce hes crazy remember kiryu never killed anybody ever not even when he was blowing up cars full of people crv come home its time for noodles wow im sorry but how do you get that actress so wrong lol they dont look or sound the same and emilia is a much better actress my excitement peaked at 002 and my heart sank at 004 just so everyone knows zilla is actually the 1998 american godzilla film which tojo bought the rights to just so they could make fun of it in godzilla final wars which is also the only all cg monster in that film i like to think that to this day bruce still corners james in the bathroom at work and asserts his dominance hr had to talk to james about his japanese voice impressions lmao alanah has the best laughing face out there dont worry alana i got the sugar how you get so fly ref 059 mumen rider on the scene remember when the dumb one didnt know that washington dc and district of columbia were the same thing well in this one she thinks emilia clarke is shailene woodley olivia munn pissed on bruce at aots some guys have all the luck yakuza is one of my favorite series of all time im both excited for them to play it and bracing myself for the heartache of them tearing into it somewhere somehow lawrence knows this is being played and hes masturbating furiously can never have enough alanah now all we need it alanah and the lawdawg playing this ohhhhhh james 1140 he resisted for so long im at 717 for the love of god james unleash your inner japanese hello hr this is spooleits happening again alanah is gorgeous its difficult to pay attention to anything else going on would be sick to see you guys revisit totally accurate battle simulator just watched your old vid on it again yakuza were the cutscenes can literally make a movie out of it you got sugar how did he get so fly alana with the baby bash reference reminder that kiryu is a paragon of humanity who never killed nobody alana is just the best i never thought id see someone use a bicycle as a weapon you dont go to japan and kidnap a japanese man start jerking him off and giving him fucking acid then ask him to learn english i just started the vid and already wanted to repeat the first 000 020 seconds dammit funhaus first of all if someone finds making a joke to be offensive they are a fucking pussy and need to just leave elyse is the best sad to see that at least half of the people present are only there because they suck james off you get to choose which two but only one woman cast your votes now good thing sony doesnt own youtube or this would be censored and demonitized dang alanah skipping those cutscene smh guys this is yakuza kiwami 2 not yakuza kiwami not cool gonna have to unsub for that one alanah is the new anime queenlawrence lost his thronecant wait for alanahs lets play of senran kagura anyone else practicing the japanese voice at home i didnt know funhaus was half japanrese japanese alanahweirdly hot love these roundeyes is that boss coffee lhfh lost my shit over the pile of knives not alot of japanese james im surprised i want more asian james wheelchair jokes and lawrence being lawrence damn the expense an asian video game without asian james this is heresy of the highest order ugh alanah is still hanging around huh hard pass i like alanah and all but please stop trying to turn her into lawrence lmfao japanese accents killed me watching this video from rainy tokyo seriously thought elyse was wearing a towel elyse looks lovely as always and alanah looks lovely as well she is awesome in this gameplay sorry alanah but bruce was right about that movie alana really doesnt add anything to funhaus i dont get the hire sees new fh video me d sees alanah is in the video me d downvotes and leaves can alana do that voice again is that a skirt wheres my porn at i feel like lawrence would want to be in this one gahh i was so hoping for asian james ross is garbage no more alanah i love elyse today what have you done to lawrence you maniacs skipping cut scenes in yakuza is worse then every crime the real yakuza ever did alanahs vast alternative knowledge of pop culture astounds even me sometimes if lawrance would have been there and somebody would have skipped the cut scene of a yakuza game he would beat you all up that was lovely great stuff as always guys and gals has adam beaten up james while bruce watched xd bruce is actually known in some parts of asia as bruce four fist greene it is said that he is able to punch so fast as to able to fist 4 men at once legend says using the way of the four fists he was able to beat off 4 attackers at once this is yakuza kiwami then what game was i playing why isnt lawrence here i love this game alanah got it mixed up with me before you if james doesnt do the japanese voice in this gameplay ill have the weirdest blue balls ever can we all take a moment to appreciate the thumbnail of this video xd ummm actually i think youll find this is yakuza kiwami 2 derisive snort the editing is masterpiece yeah this isnt kiwami this is kiwami 2 where the fuck is lawrence unpopular opinion alanah feels like those female bullies back in high school i love this channel and u guys 3 they literally described fault in our stars so wrong it hurts i love the thumbnail reminds me of the banner saga ok i wasnt crazy this is definitely yakuza kiwami 2 im glad these games are more popular now im a giant nerd for this series and i recommend to anyone who likes crime dramas did you draw this thumbnail alanah looks really good remember kids just dont do drugs in japan or youre entire career is gone and the game you are in might not come to the west it wasnt said in the title but this is yakuza kiwami 2 not kiwami 1 214 holy shit that was good am i insane or this kiwami 2 not 1 i agree with alana ross is garbage haha use the plate boioioing ross is the funniest character confirmed is this kiwami 2 because it doesnt look the same as the kiwami i played elyse is so funny i wanna see them do the photo shoot mini game this was so hilarious 830 that reference to the all times classic song suga suga by baby bash was noted thank you alanah y ahemthis is yakuza kiwami 2 lawrence would never make such a rookie mistake smh this is cringy as fuck without adam yes this is yakuza 2 its all good though we should fire him im not high right now but elyse always makes me laugh as if i took a 20mg edible and im only 60 seconds into the video lol james and his accent will be prominent here will elyse follow suit find out on the next dragon ball z that title oh my god yes japanese james is back and i love it man still with the vague casual racism we want lawrence we want lawrence james japanese voice is perfection is this tokyo drift who does the art for the thumbnail also this game needs to be a series you have to have more footage from when they filmed this 10 years ago pretty awesome that they got billie eilish to play video games with them this is yakuza kiwami 2 but hey two outta three isnt that bad these bafooks messed up the title this is yakuza 2 kiwami come on guys yakuza 0 is the best yakuza game ever made you should have played that please play yakuza 0 wish lawrence was at the main chair i feel sad that i knew the answer to james friends trivia funhaus is the best yaoi by far hes a bat i get it killed me dead you cant play this without lawrenceson everybody is learning from master james on how to do the best sensei voice you have a long way to go young padiwans alanah is about to become the dragon of funhaus its so weird to hear them talk about their time on g4aots grew up watching that show and waiting every week for new episode guess that means i grew up on funhaus before they were a thing damn i miss g4 this episode is missing the quintessential gamer this isnt yakuza kiwami this is kiwami 2 not a huge deal probably but i mean im really glad yakuza is getting noticed more in the west i hear people talk about it a lot more now 046 elyse big racist confirmed im 40 seconds in and james hasnt done his japanese voice yet this has to be some sort of record except this is kiwami 2 that was literally james on that poster i just want there to be a bukakke shoot dlc this is kiwami 2 first expecting james japanese voicebut everyone has a go happy days no lawrence what trickery and no asian james im losing my mind im so glad my boi kiryu is finally getting the respect he deserves lately lmao the intro without james asian voice is hilarious anyone else watching this with the wrestlemania kickoff playing in the background hope they have the uncut version available 20 seconds in and the potential for james asian business man voice is getting me so excited i came to hear japanese voice allanah is truly lawrence 20 two videos on this holy sunday my word you truly are spoiling us the best of april is going to be 45 minutes long at this rate fight 55 seconds dam last time i was this early my wife left me and took the kids this game should be made into an anime or movie kazahori probably didnt know this master utabori created two dragons design first one given to shibusawa the complete dragon and the second one was given to kiryu the incomplete dragon you know that yakuza kiwami 2 would coming to pc on 9may im not going to liethis was great in so many waysthe fighting performancethe cutscenes uncovering the hidden mysteriesetc but i feel bad for ryujihe wasnt that good guy but he was a true fighter he had honor unlike takashimai wish i could see ryuji goda vs goro majima but in the end the game was great thank you very muchbut i want to know something why does it take so much bullets to kill any of them ryuji went crazy at takashima with a barrage of bullets and yet takashima still shoots back at ryujihow does that make sense please play hitman 2 at the end its all good me crying the hell out of myself 25 to life or el matador i guess heh willzyyy bro u should also play yakuza 3 remaster version too ryuji goda one tough antagonist and got rid of one asshole up next with be the short but sweet majima saga story which is only 3 chapters long but very entertaining then well be moving onto some more classic crime games in the new year will what game will you play after this game so will what games do you want to do next year watching them learn oicho kabu might be one of my favourite allies moments they really should do a mahjong stream one nightdedicated to learning the basics of mahjong there are some fun heat movies for example there is one for throwgg people down stairsthen of course the dual heat movesoh wait thats spoiler stuff my bad the appstim ben got from golf reduces your hunger meter allowing you to eat more i like to use it while eating since if you eat every option at a restaurant you get extra exp for it forget double bullseye go for triple 20s 60 50 though that matters more in count up which is just get as many points as possible would love to watch these guys play more yakuza would love to see some of their reactions to the different side stories you can hit a hole in one in the golf i have done it numrous times its worth 200 points damiani is 100 right when it comes to hitting in the batting cages loved watching the japanese card games and the allies learning as they went i just started playing kiwami 2 following a platinum of shenmue great to be back with kazuma d they made the wrong choice with akira on vf2 he is extremely hard to master if you know how to use him he is a beast but if you dont know what youre doing than the ai will just own you i find the easiest pick up and play character is sarah thanks for reminding me what a great game vf2 was what is this yakuza you can jump off buildings nowi been cool with kazzy since yakuza 1 back when day 1man this is a big step up im proud always been one of all time fav top 10shenmue looked like this 20 yrs agowhich is why would be my 1 no question what up huberlr 2807 going to play mahjong wrong door 14633 bens frustration mounting then jeffrey in for the kill 14647 i just started yakuza 0 on pc and its quickly becoming one of my favourite videogame franchises always trust hubers hype i got a support ben shapiro ad before this video yuck salty ben is the best ben 327 dates inferno wow the level of detail is insane in this game i always discounted the yakuza franchise as probably being some mindless beat em up without story or merit until hearing the allies hype it up so much on you guys recommendation i got yakuza 0 and put 80 hours into it within a week haha 50 of which easily went into the cabaret club and real estate minigames and everything i had to do in order to make the most of them and flex on everybody with all the money i earned mr shakedown hah try mr shankdown i got so much joy out of stabbing the yen out of those losers i never thought i would see the second stages of space harrier and outrun in my life and now i have at last the story

says he has a score to settle with someone he did five years in jail kiryu did 10 years in jail for something he did not even do he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time because we know he didnt kill sohei dojima back in 95 it was his former best friend turned worst enemy and glad he killed nishikiyama because nishikiyama was a snake he even told the widow of sohei dojima the interim chairwoman of the tojo clan yayoi dojima that akira nishikiyama killed her husband not only nishikiyama killed him but everyone kiryu loved and cared about boss shintaro kazama his friends reina and shinji tanaka the 3rd chairman of the tojo clan masaru sera and his long time girlfriend yumi sawamura it was decent i ate ass once 000 chase comes in sounding like bill cosby 403 that slap 405 408

series was the game that enticed me to learn japanese in the first place was a big improvement from 1 in the ps2 era yakuza 6 the song of life is fire and plus metal gear solid cutscenes in them are

i been waiting for this playlist gang how yall doing on this fine night move over majima theres a new cabaret daddy in town what are almonds supposed to be everytime people ask kiryu for help i feel that in his mind he says thats nice and all but i dont recall asking you but he is the best daddy in all of yakuza he has to keep his image gotta love nicobs dialog when it comes to exchanges between majima and kiryu oh no hostess gacha does it work like that in yakuza 0 as well i hope not gachas are a cruel mistress to me doesnt recognize yuki even after shes been introduced jokingly predicts majima showing up in the grand prix the best thing about nico is that he has the power to pick up on anything but refuses to believe that its true in wich episode nicob plays the new karaoke for the first time can i say i kind of hope majima shows up at some point and tag teams with kiryu in the cabaret or is the final manager to beat but thats just the majima fan in me talking you used to be so insightful four to five years ago when you played 999 and those kinds of games but now you are super airheaded i think you might need to play more puzzle games again to regain your plot guessing bullshit powers and your attention to detail lol now its kiryus turn to make this cabaret club prosper starting out with 3 girls just like majimas it sure would be nice if yuki mentions her past boss to tiein with gorochans claim from the previous game i love the cabaret minigame so much yuki is awesome nah nah nah you fuxking fell for it and suckkkkkkkkkk just because it turns out there is something like that going on does not change what happened here but its hell of a payday for us friad ya have ta die game crashes 10540 a gacha system in yakuza has f2p game flashbacks ahhhhhhhh bernie now speaks in squeaks maybe now the wild rubber duckies will accept her as one of their own hey nicob you love moshirg and slime maya i am so horny for nico slime nicob do you really like me nicob nicob no slime ur nothing to me whahaha slime ughnicob nico was so thrill to back in cabaret clubs daddy omg i love all of these video so fun to watchd there was a cabaret club side quest in the original but not to this extent it was more getting girls designing for the club and setting up menu its been a while yuki nice to see you again gotta love the kiryu brand of problem solving fight it until its better i find it interesting that club 4shine has the pun in its name that nobodys recognized when kiryu first arrives its on the brink of death in japanese i believe the number 4 is a bad omen due to its kanji being pronounced the same way as the word for death shin or shini i forget which one now that daddys home its become a cabaretclubkiller changing the meaning behind its name but not the pun itself heh oh shit is nico gonna be stuck on gacha now also something something ryuzaki rando the komaeda voice if only that four eye owner of sunshine knew that h fuck up when he decides to mess with yuki the return of majima running into a build with a truck return to ask the shock member of sunshine as he asks what the hell happen to my club you better have not thrown away my letter that i spend hours working on just to hear it in the radio you baster not really sure if its the real intention but sunshine sun pronounced as san in jpn and san mean three and then four shine majima was the heart of club sunshine without him it got corrupted and became the new dark vader you kyriu must rise to the challenge and become the new luke skywalker defeat dark vader and save the galaxy for you are the chosen one ps club sunshine is your dad kyriu noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo welcome to yakuza kiwami 2 nico edition now with 3 more game crashes hey nico you werent that far off when you said koyuki could mean new yuki it actually means small or little yuki the full translation of the name koyuki would be little snow for yuki it is just snow its a brand new one and its really cool hey nico theres a japanese demo for kh3 with a new mini boss oh my god gacha hostess system xd oh fun fact the guy who voiced lion rafale in vf4 and vf5 was also the voice for the announcer of super smash bros for the n64 koyuki can be translated to little yuki sothe running gag for the yakuza 0 cabaret club yuki got ignored a lot good to know nico is keeping that tradition up we all did the link with yuki but wasnt kirara a bronze hostess in y0 no nico cabaret management was in the original y2 the circumstances were different and hell the club was different but minigame was in the game i cant wait for you to sing the duet like a butterfly i just lmao at that first time saw him my first thought for the whole almonds thing would be poppy seeds the stuff that opium is extracted from yakuza the only game so far where crashing is constant kirara asuka is one of the most famous porn stars in japan she has been featured in over 120 movies performed as part of the allpornstar idol group ebisu muscats and now has a career as a fashion designer the members of club sunshine are all members or former member of ebisu muscats who the f yuki is you were on point about koyuki nico her name written in kanji from the jp version is which means light snow the combination of the two characters ko small and yuki snow so you can call her little yuki koyuki comment ko can be used in japanese as a prefix or a suffix in this case it probably is the prefix which is little something like little yuki seems like a good wordplay 904 if nicob played any of the neptunia games im pretty sure he would say ooooh pudding or something like thatwe need himmm to play hyperdimension neptunia hello i am yuki she sounds a lot like yukii wonder if shes related to her insert naked gun facepalm scene esaki fraid you gotta die now ultimate move blue screen of death game crashes nico motherfu i came for kirara if you know what i mean search her up if you want to you dirty penguins im looking forward to see your reaction nico when you ll unlock the second buisiness to run in this game i hope nico plays crosscode someday i love all the fanart so cute 3 talented picky penguins d this play through will be the death of me i almost busted a gut laughing you always make me laugh thanks for your amazing videos nico they brighten my day nicob more like nicoffeine i think ko means child so koyuki is child yuki mind blown its like a gacha game now xd nicos save file had to taste such terrible despair insert monokuma laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha also good job at virtual fighter nico i have some tips about the charged attacks like nexus427 said few days ago hold both square and triangle release square while holding triangle press square 3 times then release triangle while it might take you some couple tries to do it and the enemy sometimes dodge or block it but when you pulled that out its just too good i like to call it the charged combo i hope this tip help you the girl in the glasses sounds a lot like yukichans voice actor flashes back minutes ago im yuki the owner of club four shine good old classic nico at his finest i want vince mcmahon to do the commentary for the cabaret minigame please kiryu initiates fever mode vince there is jubilation what a manuever kiryu at this point im not even suprised anymore 10540oh my god is a gacha banner xd even the way they appear looks like a gacha game summoning xd hey nico just wanted to let you know the kanji for ko or can be interpreted as child so koyuki is pretty much means kid yuki or yuki junior or something of that sort anyways love your yakuza lps keep it up meanwhile back at aoi aoi did you heard a news of a brawl in the mahjong place youve send kiryu there sayama sayama wonder if hes alright at four shine kiryu make it rain d nico heres a fun fact the kanji for ko can also mean small so koyuki is smaller yuki 918 here you can see a death wrong worp that by getting tazed on the same frame as winning a fight that is so powerful it brings you to the end credits of yakuza 6 instantly i love how koyuki has the same hairstyle as makoto niijima from persona 5 also please nico the next bakimatai photo shot has to be of yuki oh wow shes so cute and adorable majima kiryu is flirting on yuki 5249 this achievement is named after the chorus of 3x shine the karaoke song that the hostesses sing yukis version of 3x shine is best anyone wanna start placing bets on who nicobs favorite cabaret waifu will be my bets on koyuki but kana miiiiiiiight give her a run for her money lol also yes ko translates to small or little so koyuki translates to little yuki also yuki translates to snow meaning koyuki literally translates to little snow which explains the snowflakes on her default dress juuuuuuuust a little fun fact lol holy shit yuki got an upgrade how will daddy majima feel about this oh the humanity edit wtf she is almost 40 damn girl did you get access to the fountain of youth im sorry i wasnt aware we were playing fire emblem heroes i dont know if someone already mentioned it but adding ko to a name in this case koyuki or even yukiko like in persona 4 or even just a word neko cat koneko small catkitten usually means small name i cant confirm if it is the case with koyuki here because i couldnt find the kanji her name is written with but i would assume so so we have the original yuki and small yuki also if you didnt know yuki means snow i just start watching the vdeo and the previously on made me laugh my ass out loud xd so yuki is 39 in this game girl aged with incredible amounts of grace four shine is probably referencing club sunshine aka sanshine or three shine dont forget kids only you can prevent lost save data i love how nico uses demon in sentences ex dont make me demon laugh koyuki is a normal name for japanese girl yuki usually meant to mean snow and usually koyuki means little snow 940 the thugs follow kiryu into the elevator and its like 6 guys cramped in a small space battle music starts this elevator may be going up but only place you guys are going is down to hellll you know i gotta say the cabaret club minigame was one of the best parts of the yakuza 0 lp i really enjoyed it and im glad to see return here in kiwami 2 this time with kiryu as the manager yuki as the owner and club sunshine as the villain this time really looking forward to the explanations for all this that cabaret club minigame song is smooth as fuck i think its really obvious why takeda if all the banks are denying you and a random man offers a loan theres a 100 chance thats a loan shark majima you stole my job you stole my town and you stole my yuki but theres one thing youll never take from me kiryu whats that majima my 60 fps i looked it up yuki is 39 yrs old in yk2 ooh and i just noticed the chilledtone in her voice when she asked kanzaki what he was doing at their club she may still be cute as a button but theres no doubt shes become even more of a formidable businesswoman who doesnt take likely to being pushed around youda shes definitely far surpassed your wishy washy abilities as an owner nico should play tales of symphonia or vesperia majimawatching this video i feel proud disappointed pissed all at the same time well fine if kiryuchan wants to take over my substory my yuki then ill take over his realestate substory his marina well do our own realestate grand prix marinathats not a thing majima shut up ill make it happen nico out here beating on yusukes cousin nicob have you ever though of playing pq did anyone notice that while nico was fighting the mahjong parlor he beat up a guy named tachibana i could be wrong and probably someone already pointed it out but four shine really seems like a japanese pun on club sunshine sun is phonetically similar to san which means 3 in japanese and of course 4 comes after 3 so its like four shine is literally a step above sunshine clever girls esaki looks like you 100 million bounty on your head boy kiryu without missing a beat thats a bit on the cheap side aint it me kiryu this is exactly the reason why julius caesar got stabbed by his friends wtf dude it looks like yukis eyesight has really deteriorated probably stayed up all night reading yaoi fanfics of majima doing dragonstyle yuki hi my name is yuki kiryu yuki i think majima told me he knows someone when worked at a place called club sun shine i think yuki majima remember someone named majima who hosted at club sun shine when i was a hostess kiryu wait a demon minute are u that yuki that majima know yuki so kiryuchan that majima love to talk about kiryu yuki please not call me kiryuchan only majima majimathat right kiryuchan kiryu where you come from bernie got herself a ducky kiss your sleep goodbye mrsducky here to stay meanwhile at the aoi bar kaoru man kiryu sure is taking his damn time i wonder whats the hold up well lets see whats on the tv click announcer buono and here we are live at the runner up for the cabaret club grand prix club four shine right next to us is their new manager with a fiery gaze not unlike a dragon the man the legend kazuma kiryu kiryu uhh kaoru huh nicob i think your hdd might be busted might be time to buy a new one for the ps4or just upgrade to a ps4 pro and do a giveaway for a signed copy of your old ps4 p yakuza 2 crashes this is so sad can we hit youdasan i cant believe the game crashed on you 3 times hopefully this doesnt become a regular thing i hope goromichan returns oh my god i cant wait to see what four shine has to offer d wait is this actually club sun shine and that dude i forgot his name offered to buy the club but yuki declined and for that he took the trade mark sun shine no this would be ridiculous i saw the name yuki but i wasnt sure that it was the yuki also man kiraras eyes kinda freak me out i dont know why but the way she was looking at kanzaki while he was talking to his girls looked weird like she was trying to stare into his soul or something remember the event with goromi last game at one point she tells kiryu about her time managing a cabaret club and then she told kiryu that he should try running a club because it will put being a customer into perspective one of kiryus possible responses for that conversation was if i ever get the chance maybe i will man i love yakuza yeah yuki is fine but im waiting for the best girl where is that obatarian by the sound of it koyuki seems like a play on words in japanese the prefix ko is used to refer to little or young things like kotori little bird or koneko little cat so koyuki in this case might be a little yuki 5221 man this is like the time i used to play sm with a struggling dominatrix in kamurocho in front of the kids on the playground tip in the morning you can hire that same hostess from yakuza 0 in a sub quest not going to spoil who but majima does remember her nico time to daddy up once again pans away and back to kiryu hes wearing sunglasses now and has pulled out his official daddy placard and is shining it up kiryu where do i sign up smug smile the four shine invitation actually has them forming a 4 with their bodies no offense but nico allways looks nerdy why doesnt he give himself the morshirge voice the name koyuki in japanese is usually spelled as which literal meaning is small snow these seasonal names are common in japanese and it usually signifies your birth season if you look into it maybe you can interpret her name as small yuki too yukis names meaningspelling was never specified ingame either a lot of hostesses do this but the common ways to write out this name is path to reason and have faithhope it might just be snow too now i want in the next intro pic a picture of majima in his cabaret suit new platinum girl unlocked moromi joins club four shine kiryu moromi why does that sound familiar wait no moromi kiryuchan i like how the new girls name is koyuki the ko there means child for example neko means cat and koneko means kitten so koyuki kinda sounds like little yuki or yuki jr to me the glasses girl is adorable oh shes yuki awesome or course shes adorable her eyesight seems to have gotten considerably worse she might want to get her prescription adjusted this is quite long yuki okay kiyru if your going to be the new manager you need to dress like the best manager that used to run club sunshine when i was a hostess kiryu okay is it a black suit yuki kinda he wore this outfit when ever he goes to the karaoke kiryu and what would that be yuki youll see minutes later kiryuin majimas 24 hour cinderella outfit yuki there you go kiryu yukii look ridiculous yuki to be honest i though the old manager who wore it looked ridiculous but looking at him in it again made me see how he is hot in it kiryu and for some reason i feel like i know him majimacomes out of the ground in a monokuma outfit your right kiryuchan kiryu aaahhh majima wait thats right you wore this majima thats right and i gotten all the ladies wuith it on also yuki hows our kids doing yuki their good majima thats good kiryu waityou two have kids yuki 3 of them majima and another few with other hostess i know one anyone else here think there is going to be a waifu war from the cabaret girls or is it just me i am leaning towards yuki by the way kiryu has the alcohol tolerance of an adult african elephant ah yuki it feels like it was only yesterday we left her tied up on a balcony to freeze in the night air if not die of thirst how they grow up so fast four shine is absolutely brimming with kawaiiness how can you resist i snorted so hard at the intro poor nico esaki decided to pull a flowey to be kiryu not gonna lie that intro killed me more than i was expecting im only skimming bits of the video now as while ive played 2 im saving kiwami 2 for after i finish 5 and 6 so i dont want to spoil absolutely everything new but still it was pertinent i just encountered a this content will expire in 30 minutes error on yakuza 5 and lost all the progress since my last save as i was in the middle of a rough bit to avoid specifics so yeah it wasnt as bad as that crash thankfully but i still lost a good amount and had to join n the baka mitai there the timing was kind of crazy as id never had anything like that happen before im fairly savehappy in general but ill be careful when i do get around to kiwami 2 hopefully it was just awful luck and its not a pervasive problem im so happy to see the cabaret minigame back though the question is how long it will take me to drag myself away from it afterwards im not sure if its because im biased towards the colour pink but yuki in that new outfit is the cutest thing ever 3 hah looks like nicobeat get it you fools when it comes to the westaboo thing yay yuki also morishigue as the commentator makes sense with his running skill he can get to one club to the other with no time at all lol cabaret club scouting more like cabaret club gacha thats just mean new yuki who would name their kid that just because there already is an yuki and that she is like a replacement koyuki just means light snow in english instead of just snow that video went fast i want more data errors are the bane of a consoles lifespan with loss of save data and even bricking as some of the nasty consequences best of luck to you nico welcome to the most profitable minigame seriously in 15 minutes you can make 80s level of money xd some tips get the club hustler perks from your skills lets you keep more of the money you earn in the club money will rain on you son always ask if they want an extension if they have a pink smiley face it works almost always even if they are poor works sometimes with the yellow smiley yeah you can reach 3 s ranks with your platinum hostesses very worth it its mostly dependant on their hairstyle and their clothing with the accessories filling in for some small weaknesses lastly the dates you get 3 per girl you go on with the platinum girls give a very good amount of exp make sure you save before you go because the choices you make will determine how much xp it is and you can fk it up bad xd did they just dap man yuki gone through some shit when she got fired from sunshine or maybe thats why she got fired the girls have the potential eh i bet yukis persona is mara iwillburnmydreaaaad 5145 why is the caberette minigame this time around so anime kiryu i can see the customers really do love it here someone help the bathroom is locked ive been trapped here for weeks now kiryu definitely love it here youda what you guys talk about majimasan but nobody talks about me i thought you want to hire me youre mean yukichan tttt nico play mahjong for us in an episode yuki my names yuki nico that sounds a lot like yukichan what if kiryu was a wizard he would just shoot lightning bolts at those annoying enemies with guns interesting how kitagawa and minamizawas names go together respectively translated north river and south stream 3635 you finally notice it dont you xd yuki damn does it mean im going to be treated just like that other manager 20 years ago kiryu who yuki you dont wanna know hes an ass majima somewhere hes sneezing perhaps i should visit yukichan to see how things are going 045 rip progress man cant believe almonds is the only way too crash a game wait does that mean that man who is in the business know that hes a video game character mah god is something wrong with nicobs subscribers it seems kinda lower than it should be 3638 hello everyone and welcome to nico is stupid koyuki could mean kid yuki or yukis child so whos the father is it just me or does kanematsu remind me of an older more evil mr moneybags like after the bubble popped he had to go to all kinds of extremes to keep his riches oh nico sweet summer child poor naive little nico if it looks like yuki acts like yuki and sounds like yuki its probably yuki nico in regards the meaning of koyukis name in japanese ko has many different meanings in japanese but the meaning most likely used here is child this is pretty symbolic since koyuki is the 1 hostess of an underrated club just like yuki once was not to mention that she works under yuki further driving home the child symbolism almost as if koyukis the next generation of hostesses also please tell me you noticed kiraras ridiculously creepy face at least during editing from 10136 to especially at 10244 i truly wonder how a hostess like her rose the ranks with a face like that fraid youve gotta die now game crashes now thats what i call comedic timing yuki is such a wall flower that nico actually forgot what she looked like majima is trying his hardest to battle kiryucall back to true nicob fans thou art iand i am thou thou hast established a new bond it brings thee closer to the truth thou shalt be blessed when creating personas of the majima arcana almonds and arsenic share scent and taste similarities one of these baka mitai intros needs to feature that gold kiryui statue back from 0 also a picture of kiryui and nishiki jamming out to judgment cries majima walks into club sunshine majima what happen when i was gone runs out walks into four shine majima kiryuchan something happen to my cabaret club kiryu majima i cant talk to you right now im busy running my cabaret club hey nico i just wanna say that i love your videos and they always make me smile even though right now smiling hurts since i got my wisdom teeth taken out today but i dont really care and your videos help make the pain feel less i hope you enjoy your day nico and stay classy you amazing penguin king i was not expecting that intro 30 seconds in but nico makes a habit of making us laugh less than a minute in yuki has leveled up to meganeyuki adding glasses increases her fetish fuel is it just me or does anyone else want kiryu and majima to have a cabaret battle and have that face of they do in yakuza 0 when they challenge another club that would be one of the best rivals in the world it would be like clash of the titans but clash of the daddies instead im hoping she didnt that would make me feel less stupid she didnt only say her name to you she also said it as you where commenting on fourshine sounding familiar and koyuki said her name two lines after you mention that yuki sounds like yuki well i had a patch download when i turned my ps4 on today so maybe thatll fix the crashes hopefully yuki is actually 39 in this game nico you must beat the cabaret club not for yuki not for youdawhere ever the fuck he is and not for the completion points but for majimas golden statue those assholes went ahead and destroyed it avenge it nico avenge it nico beware a shadow now hangs over kyriu one so great it has even devoured majima fraid youve gotta die now crash the game well thats one way to do it jerk at some point you should definitely put gumshoe in the intro 2200 i think the thing about almonds is that its actually a good source of cyanide and being in the poison business would definitely be bad if anyone found out i have to wonder if club four shine is a pun on yukis previous club sun in sunshine sounds like 3 in japanese four shine is actually a really bad pun because 3 in japanese means san spoken like sun the same pun is actually made in the refrain of one karaoke song you know the pun is also used in a one piece opening wait kitagawa like yusuke kitagawa how the hell is someone like him the straight man in a comedy duo most set ups would fly over his head hell most of what anyone says would fly over his head 5717 goddammit first ryuji is stealing pants and now chie looks like a middle age man whats happening to the persona series tt 35003505 then they just start making out right there yukiy0 ill quit this job soon and later majima whatever 18 years later yukiyk2 plz help us daddy kiryu kiryu ok why not yuki why u lying i didnt have the same problem as you but i had problems with the kiwami 2 disk as well when i put it in my ps4 made a weird whirring noise like it was trying to read it but failing i managed to get into the game but always within a few minutes i would get an error saying the disk couldnt be read and would eject the disk i thought the copy was messed up because it kept doing this so i sent it back and got another one the disk did the exact same thing as the last copy the way i ended up fixing it was to update the game and the console what made me want to say something about this was the fact that the same thing happened to me with the sound still continuing even after the error popped up 2530 a short katana dont you mean a shortcircuit katana i know the perfect girl to join the four shine roster junko next time i want the opening pic to be kiryu and nishiki in their karaoke outfits xd also isnt it interesting that majima set up the club that would ultimately turn into the enemy club its almost like majima is cursed to cause bad things to happen even without bad intentions like the tax substory nicob the densest guy when it comes to remembering girls in video games i think they called it four shine because the sun in sunshine is pronounced the same way as san that means threeso i would be a pun by the waybuono means good in italiani don t know why japanese use so many italian and german words as something cooler damn those westaboos okay i just know at some point during this whole thing kiryu is gonna join in that 4 shine pose thing hell feel like an idiot doing it but its daddy kiryu hell do anything to make his kids happy the name four shine is because the other club was named sunshine read in japanese sanshain and san is the japanese for the number 3 not to mention sunshines intro was one two sunshine ichi ni sanshine thats why now its four shine well im hoping nugget comes back as one of the hostesses i feel like there was a slight mistranslation when kyriu was hired for the caberet club when yuki says er at the end before calling kyriu mr manager it should say no the name koyuki could be literally localised into lil yuki so youre not wrong with calling her new yuki it depends on the kanji if any is used which may not be the case considering hostesses choose aliasses but it is reminiscent of how a baby sheep or kitten gets called kohitsuji and koneko ko being childbabylittle lets hope koyuki will live to shine as bright as mama yuki also did you notice the naming behind club fourshine sunshine sounds like san3 shine in japanese as heard in shine x3 in karaoke so its like even shinier oh my god the blue ps screen of death xd yuki is back i was wondering when well ever see her again of she was just a one time character i really hope it explains 1 why yuki quitgot kicked 2 why majima doesnt run sunshine anymore 3 how that prick got a hold of it and 4 where are the other girls you wont make as much money from cabaret clubs at first youll need to purchase life skills that increase the amount you get from cabaret club also mahjong difficulty is different between sotenbori and kamurocho in kamurocho theres an easy and medium and sotenbori has medium and hard theres also tournaments for both parlors i can make the not realizing its yuki thing worse nico not only did you not notice the multiple times her name came up the first time it was mentioned you reacted to her saying she was the owner of club four shine but not her name which was on the exact same line right next to it in all honesty i dont like poking fun at people like this but wow that was actually kind of impressive okay the photo in this intro was really clever its only been 11 years hasnt it gets tazed and wins fight anyway proves that nicob is a nicotesla time to add a goromichan and tenderchan honestly four shine sounds like a number pun of sunshine sun being pronouced like san in japanese san meaning 3 yuki must be like 40 now what is her secret omg bernie is so cute with that squeak toy nico talks about how yuki sounds like voice actor fails to notice that the girl calls her yuki ill learn from you yeah you tell that yourself yuki 2327 oh you just saw it wrong nico he was talking to your game not kiryu im sorry buddy fraid your save file is gunna have to die nico i hope yuki didnt say her name in the cutscene me 3233 nico me also side note the original game did have a hostess club mini game but it was very different also there was a host mini game where kiryu became a host and talked to customers fraid youve gotta die now game crashed guess kiryu really did die then and it was so sickeningly gory the game itself couldnt handel it and switched to a different channel p maybe its four shine because before it was sun shine which sounds like san 3 shine dont forget were in the world of anime a world where all girls look like teenagers until they suddenly metamorphose into tiny greyhaired old ladies unless theyre unlucky and go through a morgan fey phase in between and all boys look like teenagers until they one day wake up with a full beard and grizzled elder mentorfigure knowledge and then finally wind up as sticklike old men who are inexplicably good at martial arts no matter their physique all joking aside kiryu majima and yuki all look unbelievably good considering that theyre all pushing forty or higher but they at least look like theyve aged a tiny bit ahem more than you could say for some games speaking of the cabaret club it does actually replace another cabaret club minigame that was in the original yakuza 2 which has been removed entirely in kiwami 2 except in that one you were working at a host club and you had to play as kiryu seducing the customers and trying to get them to buy more d seriously both me and nicob didnt recognize yuki now i feel better the reason that you didnt get much money from the hostess minigame compared to what you earned is because you need to unlock the ability to get the full amount in the skills list otherwise kiryu only receives a fraction of the earnings while the rest goes to the club kirara has all the charm and looks of neferpitou from hunter x hunter yuki if only majima was here kiryu wait what majima did you just say majima yuki oh yes he taught me everything i know he was such a calm and collected gentleman so dependable and really had manners he was a true buisness man kiryu ah okay that must be a different majima then funny though what are the odds we both know a majima yuki then get this mine had an eye patch kiryu what are the odds of that seriously yuki but its not the same majima kirtyu absolutely not no way seriously there is no way in the far distance sounds a kiryuchaaaaaan damn again nico wow your ps4 loves making you feel anguish 60 hours for me and 0 crashes your ps4 must have some problems on a software level so how long before kiryu recruits the number one hostess in the world with goromi chan on his side theyd be unstoppable also no the cabaret club was not in the original it was added purely due to its popularity in yakuza 0 and for koyuki yukis name means snow actually it has multiple meanings but thats not important right now while koyuki means little snow so yes koyuki would basically be new yuki or more like young yuki get of the throne melia the best underrated waifu has returned edit to explain why yuki is working at fourshine instead of sunshine is a japanese joke sun can also be pronounced as san which is japanese for the number 3 the cheer that everyone did at the end of yakuza 0s cabaret story was one two sunshine in japanese ichi ni sanshine this pun is also said in 3x shineyukis solo song in 0 and after the number 3 comes 4 and that why its fourshine the descendant of sunshine edit 2 okay nevermind sunshine is evil now did yuki spilled vinegar into her eyes it would explain why she never get the vinegar herself he actually did the crashing for the intro xd the battle theme outlaws lullaby is stuck in my head so everytime i blink and all i see and hear is daddy kiryu and that smooth as butter jazz ko sometimes is used to mean little so koyuki could mean little yuki i find if a game is acting strangely or crashing a lot its probably something with the install and reinstalling it fixes the problem i had weird loading issues with the kh 1525 meaning in cutscenes and opening chests and that fixed the problem koyuki calls yuki by her name several times nico doesnt realize until he reads it himself nico please man i wonder if we will see sunshine again strolls right in effinfront of it looking around while somehow missing the giant blinking neon billboard man i wonder if we will meet yukichan again is litteraly speaking to her while she is being adressed by name multiple times in a cutscene one can only facepalm so hard before it turns into something kinky never change nico when the game mentions yukis name multiple times yet nico doesnt put two and two together great job nico nico wait how old is yuki now yuki 39 nico what yuki i was 21 in 1988 and its been 18 years kiryu wait youre older than me yuki yep kiryu why didnt you tell me this yuki why didnt you tell me that you knew majimasan a wild majima appears from nowhere majima shes right kiryuchan yuki majimasan kiryu majimasan majima majimasan yuki where have you been all this time majima you know trauma had to leave sotenbori yuki what happened majima eyetwitch as he remembers the events of yakuza 0 majima i decided that id best go back to the yakuza so kiryuchan runs your club now what happened to sunshine yuki well majima it was youdachan wasnt it damn it youdachan majima pulls out the demonfire dagger and runs out into the night yuki oh majimasan kiryu goddamnit majimasan oh shit is that really yuki im dumb i never realized you know this girls voice sounds a lot like yukis voice i wonder if this is the same girl yeah you know i kinda asked myself the same question nico when i was watching some guy streaming yesterday that sounded a lot like you hmmmmmmmmmmmmm nico make sure you try and get some perfects on the hostess conversations there are a lot of yakuza zero references that are too good to miss i wonder majima will be and when he will show for that will be the best moment ever man i wish a cute girl would just grab me off the street and give me a job just like that i fucking died at that intro so now i will say that the absolute best girl has been introduced she wears glasses yeeeesss its yuki the yuki from 0 the cabaret club minigame is virtually unchanged but they added a new things they also tweaked it to make it slightly more difficult hp decreases like crazy this time around and youre more reliant on hostesses you scout youre going to need all of them eventually i dont like the way you recruit hostesses though its a kind of gacha game where you put in yen and hope someone good turns up except it gets more expensive each time just like 0 all the main girls except koyuki are based on real life jav actresses the girl with the short hair and red dress that shows up with kanzaki when he gives them the invitation to the grand prix is kirara asuka she doesnt have that crazy stare in real life lol i love the cabaret club in this game more than 0 for one reason late in this ones story that intro is getting more and more brilliant i got kiryu saying what the other guys saying never kill esh 1 daddy and now a mind reader wtf else can kiryu do to answer your question why theyre working separately its because while they all have the same goals in mind none of them really like each other so its a cluster of ill do it my way so you guys can fuck off i hope nico does eventually play yakuza dead souls after kiwami 2 i never had the game crash on me so i think that it is an individual problem fraid you gotta die now crashes the fucking game kiryu shit didnt expect that i dont know man yuki is a pretty common name in japan but if it is the same character then damn she looks even younger here than she does in 0 i feel like the timing on the game disk getting corrupted was perfect esaki fraid youve gotta die now kiryu esaki kiryu line for anyone who doesnt get the pun with the clubs name sun is pronounced like 3 in japanese same reason why in yakuza 0 they said one two sun shine as a cheer so yeah going from sun shine to four shine i wouldnt really call that clever also koyuki ko can be translated for child or young so yeah younger yuki thats our nico fails to realize things that are mostly clear while being very good in noticing very intricate plot twist one episode better have the bakamitai picture be the closeup of kiryu from this episodearound 1152 also im really impressed by this club the customers seem to really love it here kiryu not everyone shows love how you do dont feel bad nico they didnt say her name once only like 3 or 4 times 038 lets see what sad picture nico put this time shows a picture of nicob holding a larry buts penguin plushes fraid youve gotta die now crashes the game aka destroys the universe ingame whoa shit dude aint fucking around that girl with the glasses is so freaking cute i absolutely love this games physics engine especially when you throw something at people whilst theyre running towards you that star fish slide across the floor always gets me koyuki can mean small yuki so youre pretty much correct she also looks a little like how yuki used to look which makes sense as she mentioned she was a fangirl so sometimes people ironically mistake her for yuki instead of the glasses girl facepalm ko can mean child young or little nico is back to playing barbies play house and dress up esaki you got a 100mill bounty on your head kiryu nani game crashes btw there are some extremely funnyinsane sidequests to do in kamurocho so have fun with that basically ryuji sengoku and takashima are in the running to be the next chairman of the omi alliance seeing as the tojo and the omi are rivals if one of them were to take out kiryu the legendary dragon of dojima and fourth chairman of the tojo clan it would be enough prestige to stake a claim to the omi leadership similar in principle to how the dojima lieutenants jockeyed for the position of captain while kazama was in jail i like how nico trying to psych us out with his choices when we all know that hes sweet and kind as haruka i dont know why but i keep imagining majima running at kiryu in peach dress send help please i know cyanide smells like almonds so that may be it honestly im as lost as you on this one nico nico try looking for a chiropractor as he gives you free abilities that you cant get through normal means when youre back to kamurocho there is one side story that i want you to react baby 1614 how did nico not comment on that yuki is in her mid to late 40s at this point and she somehow looks better than she did in the 80s i didnt think it was possible to age better than kiryu but she has yuki hey nico good to see you i bet you missed me d nico hi kooky little girl have we met yuki d is talking to yuki text makes it clear that nico is talking to yuki nico i wonder if we will talk to yuki never change nico oh that intro gotta love it 1010 would listen to again with a sprinkle of game crash the go ryu clan is ryujis gang poor nico the comments bully him so much xd my two cents are that yes weeaboo and westaboo are definitely real terms but they are insults its not something you want to call people by seeing as weeaboo means youre essentially obsessed with japan to the point where you dont think they can do anything wrong and wish you yourself was japanese you generally think you have learned japanese just from watching anime westaboo is the same but in the other direction theres also weeb which comes from weeaboo but doesnt really have the same connotation weeb is more often used by people to describe themselves in a somewhat mocking sense god im such a fucking weeb so in a sense its a less harsh version of weeaboo theres also otaku which people use to describe people who like anime and manga though this is somewhat incorrect otaku just means nerd or geek its also generally used as an insult as it implies that youre obsessed with something you probably s love nicob here looks like yuki sounds like yuki is named yuki cant be the same right i just finished the cabaret quest the other day it is so good i was kinda worried it would just feel like a pale imitation of 0 its all around fantastic fraid youve gotta die now game crashes omae wa mou shindeiru by the way nico koyuki means little yuki or basically yuki jr absolute sweetheart that one you know that comedy act side quest reminded me of smiley and surly from ni no kuni except you know the beating up part haha that intro brought up memories of last time that was so sad i forget who did we leave in charge of club sunshine is it called fourshine because sunshine sounds like sanshine like threeshine if so thats kinda clever in this episode we learn that nico needs to learn the skill of paying attention and that yakuza 2 kiwami loves crashing as many times as kiryu has lost people close to him dear god im so sorry for this comment please disregard it nico 3551 niiiiicoooooooo angry vein popping on my head seriously im just waiting for one of these now back to to feature a comment weird teeth guy more like yakuza spongebob weird teeth nonstop smile and is an ninconpoop it may not look like it but its been kiryus long life dream to be like majima hence why he is doing the cabaret club minigame now he just needs a bat an eyepatch and another person to call kiryuchan the cycle continues after that last episode i had a distinct suspicion that the bakamitai intro would include that blue message and lo and behold i wasnt disappointed our baby girl yukis all grown up and as cute as ever but damn nico i was wondering how many times theyd have to say her name before you recognized her 855 lets see how our popo guys doing sees mr popo from dragon ball abridged walks out gives us shit about the westaboo thing and immediately confuses the two words that nicotine comment was pretty good similar to yakuza 0 all of the platinum hostesses with the exception of the first one you get koyuki are modeled and voiced by reallife japanese porn stars you can tell koyuki isnt based on a porn star because her voice acting is better than the other hostesses and her character model looks more natural as opposed to aika whose eyes look kinda weird in video game world also each platinum hostess has her own substory and the route to get them is a lot simpler than the previous games you just need to do three conversations with them and then youll get the substory afterwards however similar to y0 you need to play the cabaret minigame each time you want to unlock a new conversation also once youve completed the hostesss substory you can invite them to karaoke by going to the bar and selecting the option to call them youll need to do this if you want to unlock their karaoke animations although i should point out that each song sung by a female is generally s try nintendo switch online where your save data gets saved into the cloud i expect nothing from this but weeaboo western anime superfan teaboo western anglophile westaboo western americanophile yankee japanese westaboodelinquentneerdowelltroublemakerblonde person also ko or in japanese among probably a lot of things means small girl so koyuki is just little yuki for the scene where kiryu lets go of the bald guys head and you see the tile imprinted on his forehead the tile is one of the dragons i believe the red on nice touch oh damn the game crashed that much shit thats fucking weird hasnt happened to me yet i find his save data being corrupted a sadder ending than tachibanas fun fact you remember the mr moneybags kanematsu translates to something with a similar meaning so you might as well call him this games mr moneybag depending on the writing which is most likely 1613 1615 is it just me or did they leave a few frames out of the cutscene it looks like he instant transmissioned the timing of the game crash was great lmao nice recap of last episode its been a little while mental note never drink while watching nico videos specially those intros thought it couldnt be better than the last time but me and my sandwich clearly wasnt ready for it xd for the record a short katana would be called a wakizashi like that one attack of yojimbos from ffx yes nico all the new girls with the exception of yuki and koyuki are porn stars also i recommend holding off on the cabaret club sidestory for now as you dont have enough money to fund it for new girls and partners i suggest to complete the kamurocho side story as that will give a lot of money that can be used for the cabaret club 2338 kiryu died that day the picture for the intro i cant this intro is now approaching new nico meme levels and i am totally fine with that holy crap it happened again this is becoming a serious issue i have no clue where i heard this but wasnt almonds code for diamonds or maybe they really need a snickers bar damnit im hungry now 1614 what the he just gets up like that hes down 1 second and the next second bam hes back on his feet what is this phoenix mode from fe fates i dont know if your aware or not nico but do you know of danganronpa killcure the fan made project its one of the best fan made web series ive seen i sound like im clinging on to the last breath of danganronpa but im just curious about your thoughts on it you havent done any of the allies heat move yet having the picture in the bakamitai section at the beginning of the video be of the crash screen of the game is fucking brilliant nico nico nii 10 hour version will blow your mind yeah i still dont get it why people where mocking nico about the westaboo thing in the last episodes comments hiring for the caberet kiryui know who to call grabs phone kiryu come on pick up majima hello who the hell is this im trying to nail chika here kiryumajima its me i need a sexy hostess for my new club majima throws chika out the window and grabs drag outfit u got it kiryuchan goromis coming to sotenbori hangs up kiryu mistakes were made i just hope that in this game majima can be one of your cabaret girls he would be very social yuki is 39 kiryu is 38 koyuki is 21 kana is 20 for the other i don t know and nico its not the game its the console because some games wen you use them crasha lot because i got final fantasy 15 to do some trophy hunting but then it just crashed 1335 ok theres no fucking way anyone could survive after drinking that much alcohol ok kiryuchan is an exception the pictures change everytime hi nico huge fan yakuza 2 has crashed yameroooooooooooooo mister kiryu we have a guest in our cabaret club calling himself shuichi bird and hes making a huge ruckus claiming that were in a video game series what should we do 5221 the face of a man regretting his life choices and completing the cabaret side quest will get you a new fighting style wait i dont make it a habit to save my progress nicob nico if your going to add the yakuza characters to your council of voices they are sprites that you can use for kiryu and majima in a game call project x zone 2 i said it before ill say it again kiryu in a suit is fuccin good shit just so you know nico you can actually go over the hunger limit when you eat at restaurants its just that you wont be able to earn any additional experience if you do so if you still need to eat for that completion point or health then eat all the food at the restaurant just forget about obesity p daddys here nicob dont save your progress for the sake of anguish btw nico after you finish chapter 5 you will be given the option to start a new game obviously because spoilers i will not tell you what this entails but i recommend doing it as soon as you unlock it because its very short and more of it unlocks as you progress it also makes more sense narratively if you play them as they unlock rather than saving them for the end ahahahahahahaha the picture this time truly killed me this time kiryu and nico truly had a reason to sob i actually missed out on yakuza 0s cabaret club minigame because i ended up watching nicos lp of the game thank lady justice that i was finally able to in kiwami 2 here brings me back to pony tailxigbar majima sniffle but hey at least we got to see yuki again in waifus we trust we need a spinoff where its kiryu and majima having a cabaret battle to see whos the true king daddy of cabaret clubs but will goromi be one of the hostess finally now we can get back to watching letsplay40 souda 042 that moment your ps4 cant read a game man had not have internet in a while and now see dmc stuff and browser art what the fuck happen well play crisis core then love that yuki is back omg senpai noticed ahehe sorry im doing a test in school so i cant be loud thank you nicob for making todays comment of the day ours alright yup its official this series has the best and now back to i never had this game crash on me though i have a digital copy not a physical one so that might be why which i find weird now that yuki owns her own club she must get the vinegar time for a question who did it better as a cabaret manager was it majima or is it gonna be kiryu yuki is now 41 she said she was 23 in yakuza 0 let that sink in she also has kiryus god genes alright another video for me to laugh my ass off 3 i mean i smoke and im addicted to nicos videos so comment of the day accurate xd i thought it was obvious that westaboo was an american term i think people dont like it when its applied to western culture and try hard at discrediting it the intro hit me on a spiritual level the game crashes twice on you ive played 80 hours and have never had a crash maybe your disk has scratches on it it might be damaged slightly now kiryu is staying classy too now when is that picky penguin plushie crying because its been to long since weve seen daddy kiryu daddy kiryu lookin fresh in that suit get clean wit it break my spleen wit it cuz everybody know that a bruddah gotta lean wit it i happy for the return of the cabaret club minigame that was so much fun in zero btw im not sure why but i dug the battle music in the mahjong parlour in og 2 a wee bit better now i just want majimas cabaret club girls to go against kiryus yakuza style fists only best hostess waifu returns just beat this game and gotta say theres some sick stuff coming up i felt the pain in the intro lol the thing from last episode in the now back to scene aswell lol random comment my brother thinks youre racist yt didnt notify me on the website but my phone went off whoop i knew the save thing would be used for the previously on dam not first love you nico omg i never knew that i wanted to see daddy kiryu as playboy kiryu best hostess waifu returns and shesolder than daddy kiryu the hell edit just remembered that goromi exists sosecond best its raining champagne halleluja kiryutose is a daddiness and libido enhancer specifically designed for men in their 20s to mid 40s kiryutose should not be taken by patients with high levels of dandiness as over exposure may cause blood and giblets to rain via eye contact it should also not be taken by those who experience chicken allergies the insatiable urge to beat down wellaged men whom have yet to learn their leasons and people who use humans as living golf balls side effects may include the desire to shove someones head into a micromave copious amounts of karaoke the drive to protect every innocent smile within a ten mile radius and the compassion to teach random strangers the meaning of life kiryutose is not for everyone please talk to your doctor before taking this advert was paid for and sponsored by majima construction cabaret club is once again here but kiwami 2 introduces pretty significant changes one of these beinghow unbalanced it is first championship will pretty much be similar to how it was in y0 when the difference between your and currently on top club will be in thousands but something happens after this maybe its the upgrades you can get relating to club but with each championship the difference will get significantly bigger until in later grand prix you will be utterly destroying other clubs with few million differences but let that not fool you as when you reach the very final championship the club that will be destroyed will be you the difficulty spike that ensues at the end is so sudden that youll be left wondering what happened and i might have explanation for this this time you dont unlock championships based on how many fans you have but on much money you earned during a single ranking match the problem that lies in this is that you can lead into a situati even if its bitesized i will take any bit of majima i can get giggity ii know this is gonna sound really freakin weird butanyone else think the ghost looked pretty cute no just me ok when you hear dios voice at 622 1525 oh my god majimasan is scary when his face goes serious also whats majimas tatoo edit nico that actually took a lot of health me you do realize the guys got a butcher knife right kiryu was a great 4th hokageoh wait wrong series pffffft best intro so far clearly 1545 fan service 2640 is he asking you to be his komaeda 5235 nicos toylet score is ass hears voice at 0625 takehito koyasu damn im pickin up voice actors left right from this series mostly those who has done voices for gintama rie kugimiya kagura who did harukas voice tomokazu sugita sakata gintoki who did shinjis the real shinji kazuya nakai hijikata plus other characters such as mugen from samurai champloo and zoro from one piece did the odysseys mgr yamagata and now this guy takasugi doing kei ibuchis voice guess this shows how much ive enjoyed the anime im shutting up lol 4103 its mahirus dad again we helped him out in kiwami he got diesel as shit and turned to a life of crime like his daughter you thought it was iibuchi but it was i dio dont you hate it when kiruy is taking a piss at maximum power while screaming and youtube connects to the living room tv at 11pm that horror video scared me o nicob there is a reason to put enemies in a choke hold aside from heat moves the fat enemies that have you mash circle when you try to throw them you wont have to mash circle if you put them in a choke hold and throw them i realised that the money came from selling the empty lot from yakuza 0 i would very much like to know how to beat this bouncer mission changing game difficulty to easy helps but its still not enough maya would approve of the yaoi in the opening lol also is it me or do all the characters have stiff jaws like they look weird when they talk and really awkward too oo goddammit i was eating breakfast when that opening turned on i like how punks call a 38yearold an old man like cmon he looks pretty good for that age i dont know about you guys but the ghost girl looked cute 4800 wtf japan you are a crazy person hahahahahahaha 427 maybe its because youve nearly maxed out your damage and arent even halfway through the game ive finished the game and have almost have all abilities unlocked but and the last bouncer missions are still giving me trouble ive managed to do the first one spamming weapon heat actions you really went there with that bakamitai picture huh proud of ya nicochan i dont get it wasnt majima family from the omi alliance pretty sure toylets are real sound like one of the persona 5 soundtrack at 12414 i love how majima just casually recreated the central conflict of yakuza 0 an empty lot bought up and getting in the way of land development projects off screen to make buckets of money just to prove a point shine on you crazy goddamn diamond that lunging guy reminds me so much of these fat enemies from senran kagura burst they attack you with body slams and they go so fast and do so much damage ive died a few times to them the principle seems to be the same wait until they lunge dodge then attack them get them out of the way first theres a strategy to it what am i watching i feel like the fights that majima goes through just gives him a way to make more money to donate to kiryushame it seemed there was only one heat action for him though i was supposed to write this comment in the last video but oh well yes nico i realize that this a girl laying on the ground giving a hand on another persons shaft happy now all what i can say is congrats on being a 12 year old nico apparently kiryu is into furry porn i realized something if kiryu has stayed in the clan it would make sense if he became a right hand man instead of being a chairman long term kiryus power will and daddiness would keep the yakuza in line he isnt exactly a businessman the yaoi is very strong in the intro i love the awkward sound of the leather chair squeak in the tojo clan meetings its really undertones the seriousness of their discussion technically speaking the first time you could play as majima was in a yakuza spinoff called dead souls it came out way before yakuza 0 a new clan captain is needed to fill this chair kiryu kicks the door down and sits in the chair kiryu sorry guys i had the craziest day with majima andwhat what are you looking at was this seat taken a guy objects and kiryu beats everyone up and destroys all of the furniture kono iibuchi da yeah iibuchis japanese va is dio tbh the medium looked very similiar to the cult leader that majima met in zero nico i personally doubt kiryu would have been a good leader for the tojo clan the problem is kiryu doesnt commit crimes he would probably have donated all the money they had to charity and redesigned the tojo clan headquarters to be an animal shelter everyone would have left except majima would would help him raise puppies holy shit majima owned them so bad at 1537 it was the best i didnt deserve that jumpscare cmon im just tryna enjoy kiryu beating people up and doing dumbshit dammit yakuza mayahey nick i finally found the yaoi its in the beginning of nicos videoyaaaaa yaoi phoenix wright thats good for you maya ahhhhhhh why am i yelling you know the glasses guy is the real villain here when his voice actor is dios i dont know if anyone has mentioned but the to the dragon palace is a reference to the japanese tale urashima taro where he saved a turtle from bullies turtle in japanese is kame and as thanks the turtle carried him to the dragon palace i just thought you might wanna know lol kei ibuchi you may recognize his voice as dio from jojoor deadpool nico the world ends with you the remastered is coming out you got to play it i hope at the end of this series the final and now back to is a live action version just nico recreates it doesnt need to dress as kiryu or anything i just need it sees opening oh my never in my life has being majimasexual come in use fire water earth air all of them stand no chance against majimagic i live in japanand the toylet thing is actually real 12115 kiryu im gonna build my own theme park with mahjong and hookers i dont know if anyones mentioned it yet but kamiyama the guy in the back alley where the porn mag substory was in 0 actually sells a lot more weapons than he initially shows if you keep selling your own weapon to him after certain thresholds of money hell give you more weapons to buy and said weapons are basically almost a necessity for the last bouncer mission on legend difficulty thought it might be useful to know im beginning to think majima is wearing those tight pants to expose his crotch and give himself a sort of dominating aura can we have oreo have crossover with yakuza and make a oreo curbstomp edition and everytime you take a bite you feel the essence of a dragon inside you oh no wait thats just the wasabi burning inside of you oh my god the yaoi kiryu has a kid now him being their current chairman was kinda foolish since he just wanted to stay at harukas side he was done being a yakuza also the fact that his life was turned upside down after kiwami and 0 too but he recovered but then kiwami happened i do agree trusting terada was a dumb move since he doesnt know him too well just that terada was deemed trustworthy in kiwami i love how you have such a good understanding of majimas speech patterns when you do improv i think ive actually heard of these toylets things i guess you need to be really desperate to go in order to play them though it also kinda puts the targets printed on my local malls urinals to shame lol hey nico i would highly recommend going to the karaoke bar in the next majima saga chapter he has his own song that only he can sing and the song itself is quiet good as well imagine playing a toylet game and loose you will be sadangry after every piss that would take the angry shit concept to the next level so toylets what would the womens version look like i i am just asking for a friend yup just a friend i am not at all curious myself i did it for the trophy the fuzz know nothing bout this place either koaru out the front phoning it in kiryu receives a gift from majima kiryu hm what could this be opens gift revealing what appears to be a discarded sexy ponytail kiryu what the fuck 10652 kokichi lady if you wanted to freak nico out you need to take a few pointers from the master nyee hee heeisnt that right nico nyee hee hee hes got the eye of the dragon the fighter that doesnt fit as well at least that thing gives good buffs its shit for song lyrics majima daddy construction crew boss badass horror movie star and one many character they draw r34 involving kiryu i hope the majima story includes a section where you teach your employees the majima construction song its a high c dammit once again from the top 042 the fact that nico probably doesnt know the english lyrics makes the yaoi picture even funnier ill totally put up the english translation in the comments in the lastor second last episode ohmygod that picture in the intro friendly reminder that here comes the money by naughty by nature already exists in 2002 before the moneyraining incident probably the best possible touch to nishida bringing in the cash i imagine being the person who walks by the toilet and hearing kiryus noises as he plays these games majima is like hey watcha doing kiryuchan why didnt you tell me you had fun in there and everyone would missunderstand it i dont see anyone saying this sooo nico keep a lot of the weapons you find and sell them to kamiyama he sells you new weapons and armor that way 5848 man japan really will do anything to raise their birth rate although they may have accidentally awoken some fetishes in the process i wanna see kiryu from the original old school yakuza game for baka mitai he looked so mich different back in the old days wash your hands kiryu hand washing game starts the bakamitai intro of this episode caught me off guard but thats some good shit uh4640 and before that you can see mesuking wallpaper that super spooky substory is perfect for this time of year i went to a dave buster that had a game you played in the urinal not even joking you should play majimas karaoke it has the feels kiryu who knew peeing on things is a sport majima play with me majima as you wish kiryu chan both ready set go pissing starto majima you win again kiryu chan walks out kiryu yesss i win karou walks in karou walks in kiryu are you omg scene wait for part 2 oh no the yaoi sees intro oh my how lewd hehehwewhehe nico do karaoke with majima theres a really good song in the original yakuza 2 the ghost substory was just a couple that basically ran a con on kiryu no ghosts or anything just con they changed it for kiwami majima comes to uematsus office and finds a dead uematsu in his chair damn now the tojo clan will think i did it at that moment kiryu enters the office and assess the situation kiryuchan i didnt do it you gotta believe me go majimasan ill take the heat from you whats another 10 years in the slammer huh and so kiryu spent another 10 years in jail and majima disappeared from the tojo clan all the while enjoying his fortune made from the kamurocho hills construction until one day majima remembered something important wait whatever happened to kiryuchan i knew i was missing something and so majima vowed to jailbreak kiryu from prison find out what happened in yakuza 2016 the great escape coming spring 2019 ibuchi is dio also john dying in the boat is a reference to jonathan joestar i think the ghost broke the video on purpose as a thanks to kiryu i think he was not the first to be scammed by the tape the fools must have gotten a cursed item by accident the spirit was probably attracted to kiryu and decided to end the chain of scams ghost oh this time another man has fallen into my trap fufufu time to scared him to death ghost girl appear infront of the tv ghost fufufu you are scared arent y sees kiryus face ghost im in love not even ghost can handle kiryus daddiness wow this is persona 5 all over again i wonder if the medium works with chihaya cant wait till he finds the game braking item intro was easy to fap to me watching now back to screen nico what the flying fruity fck is this kiryu can handle thugs he can handle street people he can even handle an entire yakuza but when it comes to demons kiryu fuck this shit im out i guess kiryu was just goin with the flow with those toylets woah the yaoi is strong in this one when kiryu is on the phone to get the dog i feel like that lady behind him is trying to steal my soul with her stare scaring me more than the dead tape ladyahhhh really wasnt expecting to see majima jerkin kiryu off today but ya know a pleasant surprise sees intro oh oh kaorus police journal day 11 sega arcade kiryus been speaking to a strange man about some bizarre toilet game i suspect its actually a yakuza code must stay alert if i want to learn the truth about my parents hes been in and out of that bathroom for the last 3 hours i overheard him muttering about getting her dress off now i suspect something more inappropriate but theres no way he could be aroused for that long rright adult video store beam he was aroused for that long video viewing booth fusion after half an hour i caught him walking out of the booth his face wet with tears talking to himself about his bro his fetishes are far more terrifying than i ever suspected im not even sure i want to learn the truth anymore 526 i think yakuza dead souls is the first game you can control majima and ryuji goda too sees the picture somewhere maya is cacklingmore yaoimoreeeee of all things that couldve showed up in the baka mitai flashback i didnt expect that goes to pixiv and adds it to favorites nishida theres no elevator in the tojo headquarters right how do we get the money up there majima not my problem when you get a chance go to karaoke with majima im sure youll like it kiryu alright now its time to head to the amano building t kaoru the deadline was three hours ago kiryu daigo and the omi chairman are dead kiryu oops in this episode kiryu makes splendid use of his time im surprised nico didnt put the connection between the spirit medium here and chihaya from persona 5 especially with the scamming them and trying to sell a stone that they said had magical powers but was a total fake listen nico i saw sonic mania on your downloads list new lp confirmed lets get on the ss lp that stone the moment kiryu had put it in his pocket the tape broke if only the fake medium knew that it was the real deal ibuchi you thought i was realistic togami but it was me dios japanese voice actor 10910 lady in red appears kiryu kaoru did you see that kaoru are you talking about that creep lady in red that just ran away kiryu wait what im not talking about that that man in the blue suit just vanished into thin air did you not see that kaoru i dont know what you are talking about kiryu kiryu then proceeds to mommasans bar he then drinks all the alcohol at the bar so he can forget what he saw and now we wait for the fated day that isthe dragon vs the mad dog in toylets kaoru kiryu what are you doing kiryu its a guy thing you wouldnt understand kaoru what you mean going to the bathroom and making those loud noises while you do it nico rlly needs to make much more use out of the selfie mechanicyou couldve taken pics with majima in purgatoryselfies as majima with kashiwagicmon 10919 kiryu did you see that koaru koaru you mean that man vanish into thin air yes kiryu what no thats completely normal i meant the woman in red you never see women in red in this city omg love the majima x kiryu drawing 3 xd thanks for the nosebleed oh yeah when playing as majima make sure to go sing karaoke majima has his own unique songs kiryu dame dame me i wonder what wacky thing nico put in todays video majimakiryu fanart appears me hnnnnnnnnng fangirling too much daddy everyone here is fangirling over the into while im here with a new pair of pants looking over my shoulder because of the ghost lady oh boy yakuza heartbreak when did they make a movie about the tale of majima and makoto 524 no it wasnt the first did that ghost just kidnap that man that ran into her 12000 a photo of pochi wait that seems familiar smash music plays mamasan joins the battle majima enters the room hi guys the yakuza clan at the same time oh no yakuza 0 wasnt the first time you controlled majima in the spinoff game yakuza dead souls you got to play as majima in his purest insane form and it was awesome probably the only good thing about dead souls although id recommend not looking up anything else about dead souls as youll get spoiled about future characters a ghost may spook kazuma but the only thing that scares him truly is goro majima 11852 greatest return in the yakuza series if kiryuchan has never killed anybody majima hasnt either if thugs can survive bullets and explosions they can survive a little dagger to the stomach kaoru ok now can we go to the amano building kiryu hold on i need to take on some bouncer missions at club debolah kaoru can we go to the amano building now kiryu just a sec i need to build up my relationship with the popo clerk kaoru but we just passed popos kiryu no no not the kamurocho one the sotenbori one kaoru are you serious kaoru kiryu can we get to freaking amano building right now kiryu in a minute i need to take a whizz kaoru well alright then kaoru jesus fucking christ kiryu what the hell took you so long kiryu sorry i was trying to beat the game but my stream wasnt enough kaoru what were 10 episodes in and we still havent gotten to the sub story ive really been waiting to see him do i am disapoint batman wait youre majima i thought you were just some other guy with an eyepatch bowl cut and snakeskin jacket the fact that nico took the time to look up that yakuza fan art makes me wonder what else he looks up in his spare time 640 is that dios voice actor too bad the majima everywhere system isnt a thing in this game i would have loved to see majima challenge kiryu to a toyletts battle kiryu finally got the high score hell yeah i got the ultimate stream majima guess again kiryuchan zip kiryuoh goddammit i wonder what would happen if kiryu chose majima as the 5th chairman or if majima got voted into the role of the 6th chairmen imagine the whole tojo clan hunting kiryu again except theyre all zombies or if majima ordered the clan to dress like him truly majima will be everywhere nico this is a warning but if you want to finish the last bouncer missions on the legend difficulty dont be ashamed to turn it to easy it gets bullshit fast if you just charge in okay i keep forgetting to try this but we can take selfies in photo mode yeah i wonder if now that youve done the tape quest you can take a selfie and the red lady will be in the background just posing for the picture like instead of killing him with that weird hug thing she just decided to tag along for the journey to me if you pick someone based on who makes the most money thats just asking for trouble especially in their line of work those making all the money could easily be making their money on the black market doing illegal activity and getting their hands dirty and it looks like the old guard does like that way of choosing it should be someone who has good morals or is respectable and works with honor if thats what happened i dont blame majima for leaving nico id suggest going back to sotenbori and doing the cabaret club around this point once you get far enough into that youll be able to earn a ton of money which youll need for some of the better weapons and of course their repairs also the weapon shop guy has this function thats not actually explained ingame when you sell weapons to him up to certain price increments i forget off the top of my head his stock of weapons will increase including allowing you to get weapons with infinite durability youre probably going to want to grab those before tackling the remainder of the bouncer missions sees that mountain of money well we can all say that goromi has been quite busy this past year ya whoever told nico to do those last 3 bouncer missions this early on basically sent him to his ducking death majima is best boy along with other best boys shuichi and yusuke if youre having money problems the best thing to do is doing cabaret stuff so majima in yakuza 0 encounters the white lady and now its kiryus turn to encounter with the red lady xd i spy with my leetle eye some spicyyy yaoi sushi in the intro good job nico i can hear the fangirlsfanboys screaming d looks awesome just beat kiwami now i am really running out of yakuza stuff to play as i beat all of the other games from the main series and also y0 i need to get this game little does kiryu knows kaoru is listing a lot of crimes that kiryu commits which includes destroying public property beating random people up even damaging stuffs jacking off in the video store obsession with majima taking photos in a gravure studio including me taking boys never mind the list goes on video store guy from the sound of it that guy is into some weird porn ive heard crying the lion like roar of ejaculation and cheering not to mention the bright light that shot into the sky kiryu nishiki you were supposed to be the chosen one my chosen brother ahhhhh video store guy sigh there he goes again 10024 10238 wow majima is so popular till he has his own horror movies majima damn straight the fans love me all for kiryuchan d sees majimas crotchshot manas often as he wears leather pants majima must sweat his balls off regularly i honestly think that kashiwagi would have been a good choice for chairman seems like hes got it going on in general toylets is a thing oh dear nico you have a long way to go to feel the worlds wind for the street bosses in majima saga decline their fights for extra dialogue it is fantastic you dont miss out on anything if you decline you can talk to them to challenge them again i was disappointed that i played the majima saga after i had played the main story there isnt a substantial amount of content and you cant upgrade majimas abilities here you get a glimpse of what kind of man terada was and how he ran the clan or attempted to run the clan anyway the more profits you bring for the tojo clan the higher up the ladder you will be under terada of course except if he doesnt like you lets table the issue for now well revisit the policy at the next meeting the rising from the shadows quest is one of my favourites because its legit creepy for most of the quest i freakin love japanese style horror fatal frame is one of my favourite series or was havent played 5 either way this reminded me of it this is one of those substories well i wasnt expecting that for bakamitai 12740 is that the mother fucking stone of aja everything is always a god damn jojo reference oh would you look at that the midnight channels back i wonder whos the villain here surely its not the one that has a voice of a vampire that can stop time and always saying muda and wwwrrrrrrryyyyyy you know when youre playing a game and then the date shows that its your birthday and you go wooooo well i dont because daddy majima decided to have his saga start the day after my birthday extreme rudeness is it bad i recognize the art in the intro 10555 yeah right and im the erotica genius i get the impression that majima wasnt that important within the yakusa lore that he only was the man that knew kyriu that the only reason that he got side mission in the kiwami releases is because he become a fan favorite a recap of todays episode majima got alot of money kiryu went to the bathroom a lot kiryu watched a bunched of horror movies based on majima and then he got cursed after watching a video and almost died to a creepy ghost only for the spirit of majima that eternally haunts kiryuchan to slay her i dont understand why that one time big payment is a big deal unless he can keep money like that rolling in repeatedly he shouldnt get the seat cuz he wont continuously be the big contributer and he just fluctuates to much if you give the position to a guy just cuz he did good one time instead of the guy that always does good your an idiot im not even gonna ask where you got that kiryuxmajima pic it was perfect lol 10723 i was hoping sarama samara would be right there at the elevator 11015 i was hoping for does the hustle majima can actually do his youre so pathetic move in this game you just need a full heat gauge to do it while fighting against at least three enemies btw nico when are we gonna see you do some karaoke i want to see daddies singing already xd hears kei voice dio is that you yakuza dead souls was the first game you could play as majima zero was the first canon game to have a playable majima its too ridiculous that this series has real ghosts in it but then again theres yakuza dead souls okay at 4729 when nico freaks out in the kiryu voice i dropped my phone i was watching this on my smart phone and it now has a small crack in the corner but thats a small price to pay when you hear someone freaking out like a ghetto sims character robbing some one also that haunted video tape side quest apparently in the original the woman was part of the scam but in this she was actually real i found that very interesting these nishiki references and flashbacks are getting too much for me destroy them majima hears ibuchis voice diooooooooooo go buy the eye of the dragon item from the weapons dealer you can stack it up to three times in your equipment and it gives you 12 in every stat it is extremely op thus the true terror of corpse party is shown it transcends even games and as the ghost girl sachiko finaly is about to embrace kiryu for being the amazing daddy that he is she is defeated once more by the biggest nemesis of all plot armor i love how people can just give nonexistent items into peoples pockets in this series comparing yakuza 0 to this i have to wonder why they didnt make any narrative changes they couldve easily made majima or daigo a true deuteragonist to flesh out the story you can see the difference in how the original story of kiwami is treated vs the new majima sidestory they couldve easily just jumpcut to majima after the whole meeting was done but they didnt they made majima walk in and be a part of what was happening that was a thing in yakuza 0 99 of the cutscenes involved the main characters directly it kept players attentions as we have a direct stake in things it made things clear and kept tensions high kiwami 2 there are so many random cutscenes of date and police girl doing unrelated things they never seem to come into the play until much later which breaks the pacing and tension it might as well be chickenscratching for all it matters it just makes it into a needlessly convoluted web that serves to kill interest when your brain just goes eh 3501 you can actually do that heat action in this game nico to trigger it you need to be fighting at least 3 enemies at once so is that yaoi pic in the intro because kiryus sad that yaoi of him exists or because he cant do it with majima right now p that yaoi pic in the beginning if that was to happen which one of them will be called daddy me oh goody new nico vid i wonder what the intro will be this time sees yaoi photo me 00 i shouldnt be so surprised but i am r u gonna credit the artist for the kazumaji in the intro tho is kei ibuchi voice by dio the dragon palace substory seems to be a reference to urashima tarou a japanese folktale urashima saves a baby turtle from being tormented by a bunch of kids the baby turtle turns out to be otohime a princess of a kingdom under the sea he rides under the sea on the back of a turtle and is brought to her castle ryuuguujou lit dragon palace where he stays for 3 days he starts to miss home after a while especially his elderly mother and asks otohime if he can go back she lets him go but not before giving him a little box that hes told to never open when he comes back to the surface he finds that 300 years have passed since he left and hes become a legend of the guy who disappeared into the sea one day oh and he opens the box and immediately turns to dust because inside the box was his true age 10915 she just erased that guy from existence is it really surprising that a knife does more damage than some shlubs fists terada dont worry everyone im not promoting my lackies im just promoting the people who have the most profits who happen to be my lackies majima crashing through the wall pantsless im calling your bluff the opening is gonna be majima i just know iiiiiiiiiii was half right but oh so wrong if you want more weapons from the guy in the alley you have to sell weapons to him and youll get more purchasable weapons that way the first half of the episode is nico having a few dozen majimaorgasms i mean who wouldnt am i right is it just me or is kei ibuchi voiced by takehito koyasu dios va it really sounds like him ok waiting for the intro picture bit who are we seeing no oh god what have you done 3637 ding dong ding monokuma a body has been discovered in a few moments we will cond majima shut the f up throws monokuma out the window monokuma explodes majima huh that was easy monokuma reappears monokuma i live b you think you can get rid of me the monokuma laughs majima oh for f sake theres more of you how do you like my little comedy routine i have to censor it a little because you know youtube hey nico when u get back to majima can u do the karaoke regarding the last few bouncer missions theyre meant to be played with a fully leveled end game kiryu with overpowered weapons and armour equipped the very last bouncer mission is the hardest fight in the entire game i just love how the hint of where you need to go is written exactly how majima would say it pls play fist of the north star after you finish this game remember that orphanage sub story nico it will come up in future game very important nico the majima story will go further as you go on with the main story they will be unlocked as you do a certain amount of chapters to also clarify majima sadly doesnt have much of a moveset or any type of unique heats asides 2 of them this feauture also concides with kiryus adventure if you wanna get more money once you beat the street bosses in each chapter they will drop plates silver gold platinum which you can pawn off of course afterwards you can donate in a atm in poppo so that when you continue playing kiryu you will get something the items will be usually stored in serena can be pawned off imagine if that lady on the tape was actually just kokichi in disguise making his ultimate terrifying facekiryu would really lose his shit can we please get to skipping more fights that arent story related theyre starting to overwhelm the parts a bit late but daddys home you think it was kei ibuchi but it was medio best intro ever 1010 terada so ive noticed youve been falling behind on your earnings majima whats going on majima hides human sized traffic cones zombie outfits and kiryu body pillows majima uhh nothing going on here im not drunk enough for the second half of this episode i dont even drink but i feel like i have to just to get this crazy and overly japanese weirdness uh oh here comes the yaoi fans nico the reason the demonfire dagger was in tojo hq was likely as an offering to chairman terada when majima left remember how kuze told kiryu to cut his pinky off at the beginning of yakuza 0 majima may be crazy but he is still yakuza and a high ranking one at that so he probably gave the dagger instead of his pinky when he broke his oath and left the clan that definitely wasnt the intro photo i was expecting these gag openings just never cease to amaze also yeeeeeeeees its finally time to follow majima again d i love kiryu but theres just something extra funinteresting about majima being the protagonist oh yeah about the back alley guy who sells weapons the game doesnt tell you this but if you sell weapons and equipment to him it unlocks more things to buy off him some of them are pretty damn strong toylets eh this brings a whole new meaning to pissing about in a game pulls on thug life majima eyepatch heh hi five brain i actually s c r e e c h e d at the intro picture holy buttfuck moral of the ghost girl story even ghosts like daddy kiryu ya gotta love some good daddy on daddy action am i right so i believe the north wind and the sun minigame was based on an old story about the wind and the sun trying to prove which of them was stronger their method of doing this was to try to blow the cloak off of someone the wind tried blowing on him super hard but he just held onto the cloak much harder than before but when the sun shined brighter and hotter the man took off his cloak of his own free will basically the moral was work smarter not harder the stone that had its power imbued by a spirit medium lets you see when somebody is lying by seeing locks form arou oh wait wrong series 10056 btw the video that u just watched is just a fun reference to jason voorhees when kiryu said this ones about a masked masked man hunting people with a knife the reason kiryu left the yakuza life behind was all for little haruka to live a normal life just for her too bad toylets wasnt a game about shitting nekomaru wouldve been the grand champion of that game im sorry kiryu but you dont stand a chance against him nico please you got to do majima mini games on his side because theyre freaking hilarious and funny please nico please ive just realized nico all your voices are your personas maya cqme out and made the intro for this part this qlso means that donald was a part of you all along nico que persona 5 boss fight in nicos heart against donald ok nico you have to dial it down a bit with the lewd photos and then tone it down a smidge and then step on the brakes for a few hours and then come back with the next photo ok no please i give you an imaginary cookie sees intro and sees yaoi ahh i see that maya does nicobs editing now dear god me yes a new yakuza vid time for some shits and giggles opens up video watches the intro and my mom walks over mom hey what are watching mei have no regrets tip about the kamiyama works if you sell him weapons and gear you can even buy his and sell it back he will begin to sell more stuff and youre going to need it to beat those bouncer missions nice to know sachiko has upgraded from paper charms to vhs although that said where the elemntry school she move to an apartment or somethin i dont knowthat being said o just imagined the corpse party characters as yakuza and i can see it after that intro nico i am betting the fangirls are writing so much fanfic heres probably the opening kiryu majimasan what are you doing in here majima were gonna be highkicking all night if you know what i mean kiryuchan kiryu eh sure haruka needs a second daddy anyways wheb youre a jojos fan and realize ibuchis voice actors the same as fucking dios i love those substories with supernatural elements in them its nice to know that majima still has his lord of the night powers of financial wizardry at his beck and call nobody knows more about turning insane profits in hostile working conditions than him although i did find it odd that the nishikiyama family was nowhere to be seen on that slide show especially when theyre supposed to be a significant part of the tojos manpower postkiwami being a merger of two of the largest families or maybe shindo is just a terrible businessman or something also ibuchi basically has the exact same design as takashima did in the original yakuza 2 and is actually voiced by the guy who voiced dio in jojos bizarre adventure which is why he seems to always be chewing the scenery in any scene he appears in heads up that bouncer mission is hard even after getting all the op weapons post game level 20 is no lie man i think maya has been messing with the intro a bit 1050 apparently after he got out of prison adachi joined the tojo clan with a family called the dojima being there why am i not surprised when kiryumajima beat the toylets mini gamethe buildings gonna need a new bathroom i think the clan captain is usually chosen by which among the clan has the most experiencebeen in the gang the longest unless theres something really important theyve done i think the whole point of the empty lot in 0 was the family head who could get it would be become the clan captain since kazama was in prison i cant believe kaoru followed kiryu throughout the entire episode from toylets paranormal weirdness to finding a puppy that some guy kept a taste of the daily life of the dragon of dojima at this point i wouldnt know if she wants to leave him behind or stay with him longer crap i havent finished the majima saga yet maybe i should skip this for now eh i can watch the beginning previously on segment i should have skipped it after all yeah nico you pretty much figured out the whole problem with teradas system organized crime is a lot like a feudal system people who are under people who are under people all owed loyalty and all that stuff for example the tojo clan is made up of different families with a chairman at the head usually chosen from the other family heads theyd be dons in standard italian mafia lingo particularly someone who was named in the last chairmans will so that power is transferred easily and theres no vacuum and struggle the captain is essentially the right hand man the chancellor or vizier or whatever you want to call it so in a criminal organization you would want your right hand man to be someone who gets results in this case money but you also want someone who can be trusted and is loyal and can both be trusted as well as command respect from the other heads now someone who would command respect would obviously be someone who has proved themselves t majima running past everything to get to the bathroom majima ah shit pizza la makes me run kiryu hey majim majima kiryu chan theres no time today ahhhhhh proceeds to wreak havoc throughout the city to find a bathroom majima ahh i made it busts down door sits on toilet puts door back in place majima ahhh finally i can shit in frog hey save your game majima screaming as he runs out with toilet paper im actually eating cookies n cream right now lol and that ghost girl was spoopy 040 i thought yakuza would still pure but i was wrong i shouldve known it was that lie kei ibuchi aka dio for yakuza majima basically jonathon joestar and kiryu basically joseph joestar terada since theres no further obejection i here by declare the uematsu family the next clan capta door comes flying majima objection daddies only as clan captain so get the hell outta that seat terada terada but you dont want to be captain and no one else daddy enough is here clothes come flying from the hallway dunban sorry to have kept you hears kei ibuchi start talking nani ddio maya put you up to that pic didnt she nico kei ibuchi is that dio the majima and kiryu relationship is one of the greatest relationships of all times nobody can stand up to it in two years people will ask yumi kazama haruka who but everyone will remember majima majima is king majima is mad but most of all majima is daddy i swear nico if you dont play yuzkua 6 song of life i will get maijma san on you just when you think everything is getting too borring at a meeting its time to call in the mad dog i was not prepared for that and now back to terada picking the clan leader based on profits pretty much guranteed that one of his yesmen would get the position of clan leader that would only tighten his influence on the clans future though whether or not that was intentional has yet to be seen 1303 that guy on the right is smelling like he already knows whats coming sees intro in detective voice finallyafter so many years of findingi couldnt understand the meaning of thisbut the aliens send me a messagehere come the fangurls and daddy majima knows whats good what does this mean friend it means ur an idiot wow you actually got my last name right im just impressed by that about 5 minutes before every video i try and guess what the previously on will be and what picture kiryus thinking about nothing could have prepared me for dad on dad action ibuchi how howd you get this much majima what can i say money comes easy when i actually try a little ibuchi then why are your numbers so low on the chart majima i spent most of it on a passion project last year do you know how expensive traffic cones are nico still hasnt forgotten the power of yaoi i see gooood goooood let the gay flow through you another video hell yeah waitwhat was that baka mitai imagenicob what have you been looking up lately edit i found the sauce in the description and i can say that my pasta is definitely satisfied now i feel like ive drinken some aha water aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa man these yakuza need to relax so much serious shit they really need a yacuzzi 042 oh god no just no maya would love it though edit 1032 majima is so low xd also adachi is there welp maya has been showing kiryu her yaoi collection and hes dealing with it the only way he knows how by getting drunk and singing bakamitai majima part of a balanced kiryu breakfast this video might break nicos record for the fastest demonetization you ever wonder why kiryu holds on to haruka and majima went to construction true haruka doesnt appear to play a role so far right now in this game but it seems to pick up a theme of building or rebuilding of sorts its interesting to me when things did fall apart in the clan and their personal life there are pieces laid out for them subtly in the game to become stronger and closer to a coming of a legend i know kiryu and majima already earned their titles but with 6 games in the main series you know this game will build the way for them perhaps even one day find happiness and resolve things they pondered in yakuza 0 when the time comes for their final appearance in the yakuza series did you let maya edit the intro nico holy shit i think kei ibuchi may be voice acted by dios seiyuu he sound eerily familiar sure he might not be going full crazy but that voice is extremely distinct edit i just looked up the voice actorand it is indeed takehito koyasu the legendary voice actor behind dio brando i knew it had to be him but know for sure is really going to make it hard to not break out into jojo references it maybe useless to resist with my feeble efforts you control majima in the spinoff dead souls nico how did you not immediately go to karaoke as majima ibuchi is here to snuff out the joestar bloodline wait what series is this again oh yes this is good this is very good the majima anguish is in motion random fact kei ibuchi is voiced by dio from jojo small da worldo huh 1052 looks like adachis cabbage profits are dwindling 1807 i always found it funny that even though he was in jail for 10 years for killing one of the patriarchs kiryu still became leader before nishiki ibuchis va sounds familiar edit oh hiiiii dio nice to see you here the yakuza life fits you like a glove seriously i thought that majima x kiryu didnt exist i thought the fanbase was more mature than thatthen i watched nicobs video and i wonder what is google history looks like watches the intro okay who let maya edit the video sees the intro photo i am loving this running gag judging from the opening picture i think telling nico about kiryus voice actor doing yaoi was a beautiful call reasons why majima is the best character in yakuza hes goddamn majima thats why if you disagree your opinion is objectively wrong majima walks in fangirls mom honey weve got another one brings out shovel 622 is that fucking dios voice actor well that opening was certainlyinteresting honestly i was expecting the traffic cone you thought it was yakuza patriarch kei ibuchi but really it was me dio fun fact in addition to having dios voice actor from jojos bizarre adventure kei is also the original character model for the omi alliance guy you have as part of your majima construction team ryo takashima however because kiwami 2 decided to motion capture the new voice actors for its characters ryo now looks like a 65year old fogey rather than the younger guy wearing glasses he was in the original game so they gave that look to kei dont trust that ibuchi dude nico i bet hes a vampire does kiryu have a copy of that picture why nno reason oo majima exists kiryu chan kiryu hey there majima later on in kiwami 2 majima gonna give you some experience kiryu hustles intensely away no majima appears under manhole kiryuchan kiryu sprints away kiryu eatin some ramen majimas voice psst kiryu kiryu looks down into the bowl to see majima majima exp kiryu ahhh please send help nico your vids have affected me too a much insane degree did not see that art coming glad mom was not around when it pop up i wonder why is the new nishikiyama family captain shindo not shown when they meet in the beginning of the majima saga can somebody explain why he is missing and they didnt even show the familys name on the board man whenever i hear ibuchi speak i just hear dio and ozymandias nicob how does he not recognize that incwrrryyyyyyydebile voice of ibuchi 043 and just like that this video was demonetized dame dane dame yo dame na no yo nicob for life man now more uploads nico senpai stop slacking off and get more pf changs its time for majimas bizarre adventure to begin once and for all terada the best system for choosing clan captain should be by their profit majima rolls in like a boss making hey guys you still looking for that 10 billion yen we lost last year terada goddamnit majima why do you always have to ruin my plans majima i fuck with everyones plans man nico is still butchering these names i really need to remember not to drink things when nicos bakamitai intros come up jesus christ hey nico figured id give you an actual extreme heat mode heat move list since the game doesnt tell you how to do any of them and you have 90 of them already unlocked these heat moves are devastatingly powerful and will destroy most enemies easily while in extreme heat mode standingwalking triangle and then triangle again once the heat move icon appears running triangle and then triangle again once the heat move icon appears standingwalking charged triangle and then triangle again once the heat move icon appears running charged triangle and then triangle again once the heat move icon appears grab an enemy must be surrounded by 3 enemies and then triangle once the heat move icon appears grab an enemy from behind can also grab the enemy from the front and then press l1 to turn enemy around must have 1 other enemy near and then triangle once the heat move icon appears dodge whilst near an enemy and then triangle once the heat move icon appears this will give you a so nico had to search that steamy picture the was in the beginning i would imagine he took his time with that 50 views and 60 likes and 44 comments man notification squad works fast what do you call majima if he says no to everything majinah nico what the hell was that in th intro 726 kashiwagi is just asleep with his eyes open 040 why nico why best opening photo so far majima x kuryiu fan art yes there is god in this world insert jojo joke here because ibuchis va is the same as dio sings the majima construction anthem these majima chapters are kind of like the nishiki cutscenes in kiwami 1 in that they were added after the fact and not in the original game except the nishiki scenes were a lot more plot relevant and less fan servicey but fuck it its majima so who cares p bit conflicted about comment of the day ngl its getting a witty comment to get attention idk sees notification omg yes fistpumps punches wall by accident owowowowowowwwww fak still worth it d they said shinjis name out loud so im sure kiryu knew he was impersonating him ah yes another episode to fuel my crack cocain yakuza addiction thank you nico for enabling me d 042 nico did you make the intro for this episode or did maya 044 maya oh god the yaoi pearl i still dont know what yaoi is miuathena mmm its some good shit titless gets my girls ready if you know what im sayin ahahaha bleh shuichiapollo and yet its only half as gay as the stuff i get put in sora and riku yeah tell us about it pheonix and edgeworth making out in the corner we dont see a problem here 042 wtf i dont remember that from the previous games that is the best goddamn intro yet no comparison oh i kinda wanted you to save all the majima chapters til you unlocked all of them but eh its fine while its nice to see majimas classic style to be back lets just say that its not reallybalanced in this game yet at the same time it was downgraded like his heat mote where he attacks three people doesnt insta kill them anymore but on the other hand you have the circle move which not only stunlocks enemies but does ridiculous amounts of damage when are you planning on getting back to the cabaret club just in case you were wondering nico yes toylets are 100 real i guess when you live on an island nation completely isolated from the rest of the world you start to get bored and make some crazy shit lol edit i just realized sega makes them as wellwell played sega well played deep in sleepless kamuro on the edge of the western sky above fuji we will look down as we we build a bright new day its a school where youth all gather to learn lifes mysteries smiles are what we create majima construction majima majima majima majima majima construction each and every nail

kingdom hearts union cross story update finally for those who dont know the last story update literally came out back in august of last year its ridiculous how long this took lol but oh man this new piece of lore is really juicy hopefully you can react to the cutscenes sooner or later nico and i mean at some point before kingdom hearts 3 is finally released seriously though the anticipation for nico to react to these mind fucked revelations is killing me aww the yaoi porn i know this day would come wow nico it seems youve been spending time with maya xd sees gag intro oh oh no here come the fan girls oh boy these photos are starting to get uh steamy time for another question yuki or kaoru majima is best traffic cone aye aye captain crunch im really sorry about the lack of uploads the kiwami 2 crashes alongside my friend visiting me this week for my bday has made getting videos up this week much harder best intro pic ever kiryu this is the woman i terrorized with my ability to destroy furniture point is you repaired this shit remember ps4 is trash for casuals and underhumans you just used wrong device d pcmasterace gang nicob please please play yakuza 3 remastered its out now 3451 that is the most anime thing ive seen kaoru walks out of the shower and drops the towel not even caring that kiryus in the same room as her even if we dont actually see ta i wouldnt be surprised if this had gotten demonetized edit 5630 and theres the demonetization back to watching porn with nicob nico god these crashes have been a pain in the ass game were sorry have some porn to make up for it nico the ultimate unlucky student finally my favourite segment watching porn with nicob has returned that recieve you remix tho i had that happen to me too with kiwami 2 disc probably the dragon engines fault thank you lord that games like this can exist even on youtube xd kiryu got called as big sister is where i cross the line bwahahahaha xd rip nicos wallet phone rings majima this is majima construction we kill as we build how can i help you kiryu i thought we didnt kill anyone majima majima its for you kiryuchan some american songstress calling about needing you as a wrecking ball for her music video to be continued 736 corruption is back with vengeance mother fucker my biggest question is how old is komaki hey nicob are you ever going to play yakuza dead souls kyriu activates summon item demonfire knife a wild majima appears more photo shoots xd so much power that it breaks the game multiple times and now for the continuation of nico bs yakuza kiwami 2 frustration edition now with more majima kiryu chan if the first sdr2 trial is anything to go by than nico might have some trouble with that photo shoot minigame maybe the game keeps breaking because you keep breaking stuff in the game ono michiko has joined nico wtf a glimpse into the futurenico but for real though how does kiryu keep his shoes in perfect condition all the time my school shoes get worn out after less than a year and i didnt do jack shit unless hes buying the exact same pair every single time id like to know where he gets his shoes and would like to order a pair 10820 toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooornament arc cough i think nico will love what will happen in the next episode just imagine seeing this 6 foot guy come into a store with 5 thugs chasing him down and he proceeds to beat the shit out of them in front of you and he comes up to you just to say i want a burger ono michikos head looks like a waffle the despair has now consumed me whole that statue guy is the same as the one in sonic adventure not identical but the pose is the some can you carry him too i was initially excited for kaoru to join forces with kiryu but after seeing her in this episode my hopes are definitely not as high up until now shes been passed out on the couch mostly i know it was after taking a bullet but honestly it was a way to get her out of the story and then they just had to go and give her a partially nude scene women especially women tagging along with strange men do not strip in front of them that is a male fantasy i wish would go away im curious as to her backstory and im glad shes fighting alongside kiryu now but really the yakuza series needs to step up its game in regards to its female characters after every crash we he just gets stronger miu well she knows how to go full commando with that towel but i can beat her on that better with my tits and all the sexy stuff ive learned from that mr libido guy hahahahableh shuichi ah damn it miu why do you keep doing that miu thats because im just that damn sexy gonta miu is just weird real sexy ones are gontas butterflies squash them and gonta will mimic daddy kiryu on your ass miu hahahableh jokes on you cause i was one of that sexy prosecutors butterflies gonta himiko which i still cant understand i still couldnt figure out what kind of maaaaagic was used kirumi even i couldnt get an understanding of how such a crass woman like miu could do that miu oh yeah thats the stuff talk dirty to me angie atua wants you to shut up as he wants to see his second church of followers the order of munan chohept onast as atua heard that they were defeated by a oneeyed man who did the hustle hoo boy that kaoru fanservice scene she truly is yakuzas best girl and my favourite ship with kiryu btw when fighting alongside kaoru there are two heat tag team moves you perform with her also when you get to sotenburi find and talk to an npc a man in a suit near outside near the sega arcade youll get

out of place in the picture taking minigame how majimas introduction shouldve gone its been too long kiryuchan the second kiryu heard that he knew who it and soon wished he didnt when he saw who came out in front of him what the fu sayama uttered as she felt the urge to claw her eyes out at seeing the person standing before her standing before them was a man a blonde woman wearing a revealing short pink outfit fishnets and heels its me goromi do you remember me maji goromi said in cutesy voice towards kiryu to think you come all the way down here for more of my service goromi hostess of the majima construction sayama slowly turned her head to kiryu who was face palming before noticing her look hes not usually like this most of the times sometimes there are times i got nothing watching nico play the photo minigameon the meat bone nico oneesan no im not your oneesan me knowing a slight bit of japanese wait when did kiryunico turn into a woman are you goind to do an lets play on the spin off hokuto ga gatoku a yakuza game set in the universe of the fist of the north star yuki mars venus mercury jupiter moon long ago the sotenbori cabarets lived together in harmonythen everything changed when sunshine attackedonly daddy majimathe manager of the cabarets could stop it but when they needed him mosthe vanishedyears later i found a new managera lieutenant daddy named kiryuand though his managing skills are great he has a lot to learn before he wins anything in the backround kiryu runs around an office room shouting at the top of his lungs breaking everything that isnt bolted to the ground before he clumsily smacks into the wall and flops over yuki but i beleive kiryu can win the gran prix intro credit for daditar begins the peerless tile is actually a pretty good reward use it during mahjong and you will instantly win i like to imagine that komaki is watching the tournament and as kiryu and majima walk away with genuinely happy smiles on their faces he yells not even my sharpest blade could cut through all of this sexual tension kiryu and majima flip him off in unison and keep walking i cant stop looking at of your cleavage this should be the new on the meatbone the guys at 108 arent idols theyre hosts like the ones at stardust 717 sushi zanmai is a real chain restaurant with the same statue there is one in dotonbori behind the clown kuidaore taro 11227 asian youth lol i believe hes trying to say euthanasia get it youth in asia 11402 bruh majima is getting it i love how kiryu calls him majima oniisan at least in the cut scene nicos gone for a few days and now hes having kiryu shoot porn demonitized lol oh well it was a funny section yknow when nico set up a patreon i wasnt expecting him to actually use that money to make porn shoots ah yes finally you know the pain of receiving a proper komakistyle asskicking im glad they make you fight him fair in this game they made him way too much of a pushover in zerokiwami kind of takes away from his cred as a martial arts master just wait until yakuza 5 though thats where the real komaki bullshit lies that said you actually did really good against him especially since this is hard mode you even managed to beat him legit i had to resort to a super cheap exploit to win although thats partly because im a masochist who hasnt leveled their attack at all you know what this right here this is why i watch nico play yakuza it isnt daddy kiryu it isnt the fantastic story it isnt even nicos amazing voices its this segment right here watching porn with nicob i noticed nico recently bought dragon quest xi nico please do an lp of that after this or xenoblade i think you should stop playing the game when it is downloading data because ps4 cannot handle in game data download woman a man in a white suit came into our restaurant destroyed everything mugged everyoneeven stole our chicken wings then tried to steal a car but forget how to open a car door operator well we cant do much pretty much all we can do is crash the world woman do it something about that fight with kiryu and majima was just veryi dont know all i know is i have sweaty palms lmao can mr on the bone meat himself overcome his crushing fear of coherent sentences for the reward of sweet titties find out next time on lets play yakuza kiwami 2 i want a rubber bernienow that would be lit even better we need

i guess yakuza 2 kiwami new majima everywhere is save file corruption everytime watch the real solution was to get to majima because doesnt get any screen time till this episode majima somewhere in the background saying kiryuchan be coming to this point soon and so will i nico the hostess ono michiko is a reference to the mascot ono michio in yakuza 6 sayaka waiting for kiryu to get that underwear for 8 days she would stink a lot 11400 majimas entrance i need to fan myself and dump a bucket of ice water on myself what would i do for a klondike bar buhgawd and the wrestling entrance was pretty sweet and it tickled my nostalgia bone all in all i am going to demolish this timestamp kiryu vs fat ugly bald man kiryu kicks his ass kiryu vs his own bro kicks his ass then sees him blow up kiryu vs majimamajima everywhere kicks his ass after a zombie apocolypse being assualted in any store or place he goes to by traffic cones car ambushes and even manhole covers as well as beat his ass in any game he plays him againstcomplete win kiryu vs one crashy boi nico and we crie evr tiem for the dark god of crash and buggy glitch can never be defeated easily and can take away all our progress one thanos snap away i can only hope you can find a fix nicofor only you and the power of the picky penguins can defeat this evil villain known as the glitch of crash we lend you our poweeerrrrr okay now that ive gotten that cringe out of the way maybe i might be noticed by the penguin overlord known as nico while i deal with dishes ha im invisible no one can see meeee sudden death or asian youth which would be better i think nicos save must have messed up because of tht one time the game closed on its own for an update game decided to update and it closed while running i dont think it was saving at the time it closed but something theres must have corrupted the save file cuz thts where it all started to break here is an interesting thing you know the pole attack you love so much the heat version well the heat action isnt shoving the pole so hard into their testis you are shoving it up their asses you are tearing them a new hole guess you can say they should be happy he didnt use the other end its a bad omen when you start seeing people who are identical walking together very bad i like to think that during the sub stories kaoru is just silently standing in the corner judging kiryu someone please make a yakuza 2 gta mod that nico said should be made in the early bit of the video that would be hilarious xd though i guess that would be really difficult for these games huh nico i know going through the game again was kinda tiresome so i just wanna say im grateful for your effort and i appreciate it that you would go to those lengths to continue an lp i just wanna thank you cuz sometimes we just need to hear some support from others its been a yearand busters japanese still sucks majima is seriously the best i love how the writers are handling his relationship with kiryu especially after the disjointed experience that the last game ended up being i dont understand why nico is getting these crashes my copy hasnt crashed once and so returns the mad dog of shimano though now that shimano is gone doesnt that make majima the mad dog of majima so majima is the mad dog of himself eh makes about as much sense as his thought process nowadays wain dojimas gone too does that mean kiryu is the dragon of kazama or would he be the dragon of tojo damn it dojima why did your last name have to start with d oh right its cause you were a dick lets hope daigo ends up better than his dad did hes already doing better in the looks department no joke when kiryu and kaoru entered the florists old office i legitimately thought they were gonna find him dead just blood and giblets all over the place i expect shit to go down anytime they enter big rooms like that especially in a game like this this come a bit late but happy birthday nico also welcome back to both you and daddy majima we missed you both it must be frustrating as hell having things crash on you when youre trying to make content on it hell its just as frustrating even normally but you still came back to it and played over so many things and made back all the progress even if you like playing a game having to do things like that become a real chore and really burn you out so i just gotta say thanks nico for not letting it put you off and still giving us a great video appreciate it man show me anguish more like show me errors m hey kiryuchan i heard you were back in town so i picked you up a few things k let me guess majima it some sort of weapon so we can fight or some sees rocket launcher what majima what is thi m i wanted to make sure you got an explosive gift badum tsh now lets see if you know how to use it rips out dual rocket launchers m why do i even bother trying to come to you i could totally see kiryu going in there saying to the cashier ill be buying this in his and inside he would be blushing like crazy no worries about all the game stuff thanks for putting in the time to get back to where you were im not sure if you can but now that you know your save is safe i would create several save files just in case hey can you upload a fighterz video for the hell of it its so out of character that kaoru doesnt shove back whenever kiryu accidentally knocks into her dont worry about the inconsistency have a great birthday week with your friend i feel like reyn may have something to do with this reyn it crash time thanks man for going to all that effort to replay the entire game to continue the series for us picky penguins the way you continue to hold yourself to such high standards of creative output even when in a more stable income place now due to patreon is really heartening and a little worrying its your birthday week youre totally allowed to have a life and relax right now i hope getting to see majima again was worth all the hours of grinding back up enjoy your time with your friends and family and remember that were a very forgiving bunch of people your harshest critic will always be yourself you wont hear such impatient criticism from the people who truly love and support you thanks for working so hard for us for so many years bro you deserve all the good things coming your way hey nico i guess majima came in like a wrecking ball i will always love majimas entrance in the ring in this game and the original yakuza 2 they felt the porn in the last game wasnt interactive enough so this time theyre letting you direct it next step starring in it who cares about the girls itll all be for daddy kiryu i think what really happened was the game just couldnt handle majima so it kept crashing until sega patched a nerf on majima there are many ways to unlock new heat actions this time other than going to the acupuncture clinic and komaki most of them you just unlock by reading primers here are some ways on how you unlock them by completing all the tournaments in colosseum by completing the clan creator storyline not all missions just the main story ones by beating all the street bosses in kamurocho and sotenbori by purchasing primers at the batting center im sure there are a lot more im missing you also get primers from completing substories love the game you are awesome the stupidness of the save file that totally suck but you are amazing and hope you keep doing what you do it make my day guess who got persona 52 years latecoughsme kiryu there you are majima ive been looking for you for the last 24 hours majima did you just say kiryu oh god no so kiryu is running a caberet club and now majima is doing real estate wow theyve switched roles from zero you seen aya hiranos t shirt which said did you cum twice too at a concert so yes that does happen nico 5503 what am i seeing aaaaaaaaasaaaaaaand demonetized nicob good thing you have support outside of youtube if you havent seen nicobs patreon please take a look its one of the best ways to support nicob besides sharing the his funny videos from the danganronpa series oh sentenceforming thing its like the elementary school students have no trouble creating coherent thoughts from jumbled phrases but nico struggles 3 full of episode of all gravure studios photoshoots it will totally be a good idea its fine nico dont worry have you seen the launch trailer for this game its awesome i guess the charm of ono michiko being a hostess is that smile and her fruity personality not sorry for that pun they basically combined the video watching and the phone mini game from yakuza 0 congratulations on solving the game crashes as a reward you can now take erotic photos nico does intro and today guys we will be playing some karaoke plays bakamitai but the game freezes and the music plays all laggy and corrupted nico oh for crying out lou video gets demonetized viewers happy belated birthday everyone majima just needed time to prepare after all it isnt easy being a knifeswinging maniac right nagito plays russian roulette at the hardest level on the spot genocider jack plays menacingly with scissors easily majima wait why are ya pairing me up with these freaks kiryu goes far far away from the scene majima wait kiryuchan come back please dont leave me here with them runs after kiryu nico wait come back the episode isnt finished yet save file corrupts as bakamitai plays in the background nico komaki keeps tiger dropping me not fair every enemy from kiwami 1 tell me about it kiryu enters a room and starts destroying everything but then he went thru a wall and broke the matrix itself now finding himself in nicobs ps4 dashboard he proceeds to run and crash all his save data files and data base all while going rraaaaaaaaaa it took a while but nico uploaded on my birthday nonetheless thank you nico for this wonderful birthday gift you really cheer me up in the darkest of days and i have been going some really dark and harsh days also im delighted that my birthday is at the same month as you early happy birthday nico i love you and youll always have my support had a nasty migraine all day through all my college classes and the commute back home then i saw that nico posted a new video as soon as i heard his screaming in the previously on the migraine stopped was i experiencing withdrawal for the last 5 days hope you had a happy birthday nico kiryu walking into restaurant while having majima in a head lock cashier ccan i take your order clearly scared kiryu yes i would like some fried chicken extra spicy clearly not phased majima hey kiyru chan i want a hamburger still in a headlock but smiling kiryu no your not getting a hamburger the cashier puts the friend chicken on the counter majima aww why not unless are you gonna give me the kiryu spec majima was instantly cut off by kiyru slamming his head into the spicy and hot chicken majima ugh its in my eye i see weve gone from watching porn with nico b so shooting porn with nico b somebody make an art of both kiryu and kaede akmatsu wreaking all kinds of shit nico should play tales of symphoniatales of vesperia definitive edition when it comes out lol new pervy stuff yay kiryu this is a yakuza then there is the power beyond the power of a yakuza uses yakuza 0 dragon of dojima style this is a super yakuza then there is the power beyond the power of a super yakuza uses dragon of dojima style from yakuza kiwami lets just call it super yakuza 2 and this is even further beyond haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 2354 but you can just call it super yakuza 3 nico at the end of this chapter you are on chapter 5 right you will unlock part one of a certain something that will be accessible from the main menu knowing you youd probably want to check it out right away but i highly advice to wait until you have unlocked all three parts of it before checking it out majima kiryu chan kaoru kiryu chan majima oh we had historywe dated so many times last gamehe made me happy kaoru so funny little fact regarding majima canonically the original yakuza 2 was the first time where majimas tattoo was properly shown as the irl tattoo artist that designed everyones tattoos horitomo noted in a yakuza encyclopedia made for the series 10 year anniversary a few years ago proof of this is the fact that in yakuza 1 and presumably any cutscenes from kiwami directly taken from that game majima never actually takes that gold shirt of his off it is unfortunate the scene loses a bit of impact in the remake unless the player starts with this game so majima and kiryu have basically switched jobs kiryu of tachibana real estate has become a club manager and sotenboris lord of the night has become president of a construction company didnt see that coming one of the future ones on the photo shoot is on the meat bone and it is an instant win nicos bizarre adventure part 4 yakuza is not crash well its great that the yakuza series was thankfully saved from annihilation nico does the photoshoo community guidelines strike demonitized banned sotaro komaki is kiryu from the future lol every single time kiryu or majima fights komaki how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man yup those two photo girls much like the obtainable cabaret girls are porn stars my god that majima scene was so freaking amazing also i hope your kiwami 2 stops crashing from now on thank you for being so dedicated to replay the game just for all of us 3 you picked a real good time to open up that patreon of yours nico because after that photo shoot youre not getting a cent from youtube p nico that lady is back 715 look i think we can all agree to never question majima he can be wandering on a spaceship in the year 3281 with aliens while the enslaved human race watches and no one would question him im not sure where kiryu has a hard on is it because kaoru sayamas body or his battles with majima youve graduated nico we went from watching porn with nicob to making porn with nicob reminds me of trying to play watch dogs on the xbox it also kept crashing for me saying something about a disk errorexpect that it was always at a specific spot so i couldnt even progress and it was a new game so it was the disk i think and i eventually got it digitally on steam and it worked perfectly sorry about the bullshit you went through hopefully this never happens again what another way to come back from a great 2 day break with daddy majima i hope had a great birthday nico majima construction proudly presents filming porn with nicob now 90 guaranteed not to bluescreen before climax the bane of a gamers existence oh game crashes 5900 ahhh its my favorite segment watching porn with nicob comment of the day welp theres dead souls in a nutshell nicos friends 1 soyou made voices and scenario for each character nico yupand to the point i talk to myself nicos friends 2 iseejimcall the hospital 450 there already is a mod of kiryu pulling a random civilian out of their car and beating the shit out of them its called grand theft auto after majimas crazy entrance into the ring kiryuah same old majima holy shit guys we finally see daddyb and mommyb also i wonder if the friend is the same person that nico always talking about in somw of his vids anyway latehbd nico komaki kiryu hit me with all of your strength and dont hold back kiryu star platinum finish him star platinum ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora hours later ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora oraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa komaki kiryuwhere did you find sucha powerful attack komaki died that day due to kiryu and star platinum and so began a long blood bath for kiryu more than ever picky penguins lets help nico get another copy hey nicob thanks for uploading another episode hope you enjoy your time with your friend next pic should be majima doing the hustleand then the song gets interrupted by 24hour cinderella and kiryuchan followed by kiryu yelling in horror xd kiryu majima san now that your rejoining the tojo clan whats going to happen to majima construction majima dont worry kiryu chan i have found the pefect replacement kiryu chan door opens kiryu no it cant be thats impossible nugget skwaks it has been 40 yea sees thumbnail oh god what xd 5510 when realization hits xd and it already happened nico is too overpowered for where he is in the game again of all the things a porno actress cares about proper grammar and sentence structure is way up there the final boss of this game is going to be a blue crash screen specifically for nico hey nico figured id give you an actual extreme heat mode heat move list since the game doesnt tell you how to do any of them and you have 90 of them already unlocked these heat moves are devastatingly powerful and will destroy most enemies easily while in extreme heat mode standingwalking triangle and then triangle again once the heat move icon appears running triangle and then triangle again once the heat move icon appears standingwalking charged triangle and then triangle again once the heat move icon appears running charged triangle and then triangle again once the heat move icon appears grab an enemy must be surrounded by 3 enemies and then triangle once the heat move icon appears grab an enemy from behind can also grab the enemy from the front and then press l1 to turn enemy around must have 1 other enemy near and then triangle once the heat move icon appears dodge whilst near an enemy and then triangle once the heat move icon appears this will give you a theres a story mode about majima and how he left the tojo clan i love how komaki fight is basically i can tiger drop and you cant bam nico reaches the final level a plot twist he never saw coming on the horizon from offscreen approaches a most deadly and dangerous foe kiryu my godits you the camera pans up to reveal that kiryus greatest opponent is game crashes nico baka mitais irl your commitment to your lps are invaluable nico happy birthday super grateful for your high quality lets plays nothing says a good construction worker like a crazy yakuza with an eye patch and a penchant for cross dressing and stalking the game probably cant handle both daddys and there destructive power the fact that kiryu has to form a coherent sentence around hot girls is utterly hilarious nico you gotta abuse the power of charged light attacks kiwami 2 knew nico lost his best segment watching porn with nicob so they decided to put the porn back in first day on the job okay dont mess this up as long as nothing bad happens itll be okay kiryu throws a thug through the window why does this happen every time i get a new job nico majima just cant stay doing any one thing for very long me if majima gets bored so easily then is he a distant relative of junko me realizes what he just suggested majima dont lump me together with that murdercrazed slut junko your one to talk hot stuff me mind explodes is it just me or did anyone else feel weird and kind of sad when the camera kept cutting to majima with his arms around those girls goro majima x makoto makimura forever majima when he heard kiryu was coming alright men and fucknuts its time to prepare for my kiryuchan get me the ring the karoke the sexy girls the booze my kiryu photo collection and mostly importantlymy idol outfit kiryu and kaoru enter purgatory kaoru wtf kiryu theres a photo strip of you with some eyepatch guy in the back on the back of this note which reads my one and only kiryu screaming internally anyone else here think that a ryu ga gotoku studio developed segata sanshiro game would be the manliest thing ever 5632 watching p0rn with nicob season two photographer boogaloo in this season no lady is safe from this mans lens and extreme focus both hikaru aoyama and rina hashimoto are literally gravure idols a gravure idol is a model that shoots for magazines photobooks or dvds in which they show their sensuality with provoking poses and outfits like swinsuits or maid outfits sometimes their works have themes like a date with in which the camera act as the pov if the viewer so this girls are not porn actresses but theyre basically what in pokemon language we can define as a porn actress preevolution i just leave to your immagination how comes i know this stuff but it was nice to hear hikarus voice for once so shes supposed to be a detective working in a professional capacity just dropping the towel like that ahhuh totally not a no sense making fan service call on yakuza game development teams part seriously wtf talk about misplacement of time and place what the crap was that she was nervous about even asking kiryu to pick up panties and then gets naked like she could not give two shits what edit im still irritated about it why is no one talking about this low key hoping bowsette gets included in the intro picture komaki so let us first ensure you have not rusted like a blade in the beating rain show me your strength my pupil kiryu you just want me to attack you cuts to komaki holding a shotgun yes you little shit and then komaki killed kiryu the end on my first run of the game when i came across mr try and hit me i hit him the very second it started i thought it was intentional it was absolutely hilarious which made the fact that the whole crowd decided they could take him on made the whole thing even greater your game has been corrupted because majima was planning too many things of how to make kiryu fight him by the end of this playthrough it will become meet the demoman kiwami featuring kiryu from the yakuza series nico what is this a porn game oh no nico i mean imma still play it tho imma still play nico only you can prevent loss save data everybody you saw watching porn with nicob and you thought that was the end but now you get to see the next step making porn with nicob be warned nico u need to complete all bouncer missions for some of the heat actions and battle skills be warned and when i say all i mean all versions time for more dadyness and bad ass stuff also some care club shananagans nico should do a giveaway for the physical copy hey nico sorry to hear about the stress youve gone through with the crashes maybe this will cheer you up though if you havent seen them already see persona 3 and 5 got dancing games after 4s did well enough and sega decided to put up polls to let fans decide which costumes from their games would fans like to get as dlc for the two groups to wear and while the p3 group got virtual fighter for their suits fans apparently felt that the phantom thieves would look great wearing the clothes of another certain group of hooligans while you wont recognize yusukes and makotos clothes as the characters they belong to are from later games i think youll still get a good laugh seeing which thief got what to wear httpsiimgurcomqeyvq4pjpg httpsiimgurcomj9fcumojpg i hope youll have a reyn good time with your friend that didnt even make sense but seriously i hope you have a good time and happy birthday kaorus complete lack of bashfulness after getting out of the shower was hilariously amazing in this episode we see all respect kaoru had for kiryu dies as he photographs porn stars while she watches on the bright side the return of one of the channels most popular segments watching porn with nicob damn nico im sorry your save file fucked up majima i will keep it fair n square smiles and takes his knife while kiryu is barehanded i love this man so much you will need patreon with those minigames hayyooo takes picture of girl demonitized komakis theme is his kiwami 1 version its called takumi 2016 also fun fact the song takumi originated in the 2008 samurai spinoff ryu ga gotoku kenzan like a dragon arrivesyakuza arrives which was a graphical gameplay test for yakuza 3 which came out in 2009 outside of 4 5 6 and the kuro hyou series the song is remixed mostly whenever komaki shows up nico i feel ya man that happened to me recently with my skyrim disc and i thought there was something wrong with the disc itself but apparently my save file just got corrupted somehow i didnt know this however and bought a new copy i only found out that my file got screwed up until afterwards so i had to replay the game all over again from scratch with the new disc just goes to show that even the best games still arent perfect majima better wear my goromi get up again ill be part of kiryuchans host club oh and at 350 and 355 its the same girl like she phased out of the scene when she cane too close to the camera then she reappeared on the pavement a little further back clone or teleportation damn these games now have supernatural forces in them happy birthday nico d get you a guy who looks at you the same way majima looks at kiryu i love japanese women kaoru kiryu what the fuck are you doing kiryu im taking a sexy picture of real porn star kaoru fuck it you two under arrests guy why do you bring her here man kiryu you bring her here too asshole hey nico happy birthday its my birthday too october 2nd bros during that photo session i can imagine kaoru going wait so is the mad dog unleashed referring kiryus mad dog at 5925 because that would make my mad dog unleash if you know what im saying 3 komaki is truly the ultimate daddy tbh kiryus ultimate nemesis is bsod kiryu who can be this dastardly opponent ive never heard about majima its the game crashing kiryuchan kiryu wha yakuza kiwami 2 has stopped working the third loudest fbomb in the world can be heard from one nicobs house i guess the true mad dogs were the crashes we had along the way 11753 wow wouldnt it be awesome knowing you were friends with nicob things might have been hectic for you nico but remember that it wasnt your fault you played through this game a second time for us that alone speaks volumes to us picky penguins you deserve some time to yourself friends and family just like everyone else just remember that you a person before you are nicob wed wait even longer if we have to you thought you could get monetised but it was i porn and majima is back i had an eargasam at the kiryuchan and man that fight was hot nothing beats two half naked daddies bonding in a intense fight the game keep crashing because it just couldnt take the awsomeness that is majima majima alright kiryuchan ill help you out youve gained goromi as a platinum hostess kiryu wait what that thats not what i aw screw it lets do this cuts to cabaret club grand prix trouble at table 3 goromichan is trying to stab a customer majimas been busy fixing ps4 issues okay so the the american trailer for yakuza kiwami 2 trailer is called the majima construction anthem and it is a full on live action choir singing the glory of majima construction as you can no doubt imagine it is glorious i highly recommend that you check it out if you dont mind some minor spoilers it would be great if nico could react to it at the end of the series tbh im actually surprised that the localization team didnt take out that takingpicturesofhotladies segment of the game for the western release of the game i was kind of expecting them to remove all hints of even potentially sexual content knowing how butthurt certain activist groups get in the us and europe the real life equivalent of a boss battle is hearing your parents walk around outside your room while a sexy photoshoot video is playing on your computer ah kiryu a true god of destruction what we thought yakuza be about tough men awesome fighting incredible lore and character what yakuza is about hot daddys smashing through object taking care of everyone karaoke and watching and creating porn nico points out the three guys that look the samethe game see the glitch in the matrixscrashes and the men are never to be seen again nobody noticed the floating shotgun it happened when he defeated the first shot gun dude training with komaki anyone anyone is this true demon daddy power am i the only one who would listen to a japanese scat music style group rip nicobs ps4 may it rest in peace kaoru ohby the way someone left that package over there for you kiryu yeah it looks rather suspicious is that all there was kaoru no there was also a this letter hands letter majima via letter long time no see kiryuchan i heard you were doing some damage to some poor little offices i left you something that could do some real damage i look forward to seeing you again ps you know where to find me kaoru is it from someone you know kiryu shakes head but smirks yea an old friend kaoru a friend who gives you rocket launchers kiryu yea one that gives mwait what now that you have extreme heat mode there are numerous new extreme heat actions you can do you should try preforming these actions while in heat mode 1 the 4 combos with a double triangle finish 2 both the regular and running charge attacks 3 quickstepping towards opponent away from opponent and to the side of an attacking opponent 4 regular running attack no charge 5 reverse light attack square while holding the opposite direction 6 stand near a stunned enemy 7 lone stand attack just triangle alone 8grab enemy and punch them with triangle extreme heat mode also has a permanent autograb ability where youll automatically pick up any weapons or objects near you in heat mode you cant die your health can be reduced to 1 but you cant die as long as heat mode is active you can deactivate heat mode by pressing r2 again the photo shoot minigame is an evolution of a minigame from yakuza 6 in where you pick from two porn stars who do a striptease for kiryu while he responds in incredibly pervy ways whilst staring at the girl with the same serious face he always has it has no purpose other than to be a minigame for 100 completion that you can gain exp from as well as getting to see the models in incredibly revealing outfits whilst laughing at kiryus expressions the entire time in short its a game designed for hormones and funny bones also you dont know the half of english being said that makes us people go what like a famous vine of a japanese baseball game where the announcer yelled out this ball is long gone just like the ex girlfriend who would never return home run im glad you fix that problem whit the crashig adn dont worry we wont get angry about you not posting due to fixing the problem and your friend visiting congrats you finally escaped the crashes but will you ever escape majima majima bgm uses receive you the prototype which was the opening for the original ryu ga gotoku despite being remixed for kiwami as receive you reborn wheres the real kiwami 2 with receive you kiwami reborn the prototype kiryu its been a while majima majima actually ive been watching for a long time kiryu wait what since when majima what day is it oh yeah a year kiryu a year how majima i was able to get some of the florists cameras before he went to the cops got to say kiryuchan those pictures of you as a model theyre smoking kiryu damn it i thought i had those destroyed majima i stole them before they had the chance kiryuchan p kaoru as a teacher ok kiryuchan what did you bring for show and tell kiryu me running into everything i see as kiryu is running into desks and chairs yelling his classmates are running for cover when majima stands up majima and i brought my dance shoes that help me destroy everything i see majima doing his dance style helps kiryu in destroying the classroom while kaoru sobs into the corner i see majima has upped his stripper performance since last game you know what the next yakuza spinoff should just be a dating sim starring all the gravure models while youre also trying to escape majima crashing every single date youre on after you ss rank all the girls of course you get to ride off into the sunset with best boy goro himself the biggest plot twist comes up in the next part when yakuzas steelbox is revealed to be the main villain who was just trying to frame ps4 and save file for trying to take over nicos channel he wouldve gotten away with it too if digital copy didnt come in an tiger drop him ah yes the long awaited new episode of lets watch porn with nicob the quality content we all subscribed for d komakilets begin your new training kiryuok so whats the new drill komaki with a rpg komakiyou know the drill kiryu fucking old man why happy late birthday nico d now you are the same age as daddy dunban someone and for your long absence you now owe us a 24 hour video of kingdom heart 3 nico but the game isnt even out ye f von karma voice no excuses now get to work hyaah nico aaaaarrgg i remember there was a video where a guy went to japan to translate the english on some of the japanese peoples clothes one woman had diarrhea written on her sweater something about nico giggling about majima makes me grin nico if ya have any further trouble just let me know or your mods and i can give them a solution to any issue with your electronics i am online almost 247 doing research on games and errors so if ya have any future issues i am willing to help something i didnt know until a few days ago is that holding l2 while fighting heat actions wont pop up this is useful when you want to store your heat also kiryuchaaaaaaaan edit i also find it hilarious that nico will always say kiryu chan because of majima lol now you can feel the pain of all the guys you tiger dropped last game was that a random npc for the opening there is two different shivers and hair rising sensations a good music movie or cuddling a love one and hearing after a long time the infamous kiryuchan3 and for some reason you get pretty aroused by the second one and im a male thats no god damn shame i feel really bad about all the effort and expense you went through to try and get this game running for us you really do a lot for us and were incredibly thankful tell you what id be happy to reimburse you for the digital copy of the game and any of the other expenses you incurred trying to get it running just let me know where and how youd like me to send the money and ill send it your way asap with enough time nico will be able to unlock the ultimate model to take pictures of and make a porno with thats right nico will grind for hours on end so he can make the ultimate porno staring majima himself featuring dante from devil may cry and knuckles has anyone told nico about the majima construction trailer if not someone needs to show him i really hope the game no longer crashes on you it kind of sours the experience when it does ono michiko is a reference to yakuza 6 play yakuza 6 to find out more but not before playing 3 4 and 5 the photoshoot is similar to 0 where you view videos but theres more interactivity and yes those girls are real porn stars you actually have a second heat action with kaoru but i only got it once in my single playthrough of the game i dont know how to trigger it i know its probably silly but i find it cute that kiryu calls majima his niisan the battle with majima had a remix of the old dragon style i know that because i heard that song a freaking lot dont worry about the bouncer missions all of them except for the last three are pretty much the same boring stuff over and over but if you play until you get to those last ones be sure to record them trust me youll understand when you get to them honestly i love the gameplay and all that but if it gets too much of a hassle bc of the crashing just stop i and im sure most of your fans will understand that explains a lot dont feel bad nico my brain would short circuit too seeing that alright nico with extreme heat mode come many special heat actions most of them dont have names and these are all of the ones that i have found there is the basic combo finisher where you need to repeatedly press triangle if you quick step to from to the left or right of an enemy to can trigger the essence of fast footwork note this cant be used on bosses if an enemy is behind you and you quickly turn around and attack kiryu will hit them with the back of his hand hitting the enemy with a heavy charge attack if you hit someone with a running kick if you stand still and just do a front kick this heat action need you to do up to 6 qtes the button you need to press will always change every time you do this move to do this heat action you need an ability call fist of fury it allows you to do 3 light charged attacks back to back and if you land the final hit you will have to do 6 qtes the qtes for this move will always stay the same ps when you get the max ou fun fact nico kiryus voice actor has done some yaoi voice acting which fuels the kiryu x majima fanfics like nobodies business if you have to buy each game twice for now on i guess its a good thing you made a patreon page in todays episode kiryu leaves the yakuza again to become a pronstar photoshooter majima kiryuchan noooo i was watching the photoshoot scene in my college class a someone was staring at me and i was like whats up i like girls so question for yam nico why is it that you pronounce disciple as diseyeful because whenever i heard someone else say it its always said as diseyepull its not that big an issue but ive just been really curious about it me time to buy a vr set for yakuza my friend yakuza has vr why would an action game like that have it me looks at my friend nervous nno reason puts on vr and goes on the photoshoot minigame as much as nico may not like nagito his powers are just the same he used his bullshit luck powers so much during those past lets plays now they came back as bullshit bad luck all in the form of crashes and corrupted save files im kinda just imagining someone telling nico that being a youtuber is easy after his yakuza crashing saga and he just kinda slowly looks over at the person and then tries to run them down like kiryu runs over office supplies coming this fall magic majima xxl 5710 i cant wait to take your beauty im fucking dead heres the official english translated majima construction theme song deep in sleepless kamuro on the edge of the western sky above fuji we will look down as we we build a bright new day its a school where youth all gather to learn lifes mysteries smiles are what we create majima construction majima majima majima majima majima

majjiiiiiimmmaaaaconstruction so theyre finally here kicking ass for you if you know the words you can join in too put your hands together if you want to clap as we take you through this yakuza rap huh before it was watching porn with nicob now its being in a porn with nicob 130 i mean i wouldnt doubt that considering that in tokumei sentai gobusters or power rangers beast morphers if you prefer one of the rangers say oh shit in english twice i normaly always make 2 of the same saves just incase how long has it been since we last heard majima scream kiryuchan i dont know but the wait was definitely worth it time for a million fights with majima again so you know that thing you mentioned about a japanese band thinking english is cool and naming a band wrong with english thats what the band bump of chicken did they wanted to call their band flight of the coward but then they spelt it wrong and went with it kiryu vs kayde which one is better at destroying all that surrounds them nicob after you finish with this playthrough you should play valkyrie chronicles 4 you dont need to play the first one to understand the story yes good nico learn the ways of best waifu kaoru im still loyal to goromi chan though the wolf among us protagonist at a bar gimme whisky bartender puts down a glass bigby smashes it bottle yakuza kiwami 2 protagonist at a bar gimme whisky bartender puts down a glass kiryu smashes it crate an alternate means to summon majima kiryu all right no turning back majima majima majima thunderstrike a karaoke version of the beetlejuice theme plays majima appears in a cloud of smoke majima ah ha ha ha ah its showtime hearing you talk about japanese bands with weird english names made me think of this one band their name was supposed to be cooler but there was a mistake in translation and they thought it was so hilarious that they went with it and theyre called that to this day bump of chicken well that was unexpected didnt think my comment would actually make it lol thank you so much d yes yes im been waiting for this welp i guess now with the new disc nothing can go wro 734 oh dear seeing daddy majima come back is worth all the game save data being corrupted and having to play the game all over again majima lets do this fair and square kiryuchan so hold on and let me just get my knife and hard hat kiryu wait but majima too late mad dog screeching intensifies 5609 oh my god wwhat god that entire sequence cracked me up 732 the return of anguish kiryu in the street majima in the sheets majima looks fine in the new engine truly he is hot daddy material kiryu i got you the stuff you needed kaoru thanks kiryu a package also came for you kiryu opens the package kaoru what did you get kiryu a new rocket launcher kaoru what the fuck kiryu later bitch kiryu then runs out of serena to blow up kamurocho in search of majima is this grand blue no ok goddamnit youtube where was my notification oh and happy late birthday nico im surprised nobody told nicob this nico every game including xbox to pc will update constantly yakuza kiwami 2 doesnt handle ingame updating so you have to wait it out so it doesnt mess up i think its common knowledge but never ever ever play a game while its downloading something for it majima man nicochans gonna be so happy with this epic surprise entrance i planned for him wait what his birthday was yesterday well then what the heck am i supposed to do with these fireworks wait kiryuchans here perfect timing that is totally what happened hey nico i dont know if you heard this but yakuza 3 has gotten a remaster in japan and it might be a while before it comes out in the meantime you should check out fist of the north star lost paradise sometime after kiwami 2 its developed by ryu ga gotoku studio the same team that developed the yakuza games the game is called hokuto ga gotoku in japan to celebrate the combination of fist of the north star and ryu ga gotoku its a really fun game that just came out today so you should check it out if yakuza 3 takes too log to come out netflix and chill is out all we need is some kiryu and chill now majima also shouldve become a dancer also happy birthday as well on the one hand im happy it is back on the other ill miss nico vs crashes saga on twitter maybe we should do a death counter for this game not for nicos deaths but for every timethe gamecrashes regarding kaoru as a travelling companion shes decent as a fighting companion but lacking elsewhere there are two heat moves you can pull off with her that are pretty cool however kaoru cannot participate with kiryu in any of the substories or minigames like karaoke darts etc if you try shell just conveniently disappear until said substoryminigame is complete on a bonus note i checked your patreon and damn looks like youre under your editor goal now did the big donaters withdraw or is patreon being wonky again wow kiryu is really starting to cry over really esoteric characters whos next mr shakedown kiryu majima where did you get that helmet majima i got it from 20xx where a blue robot kills other robots i was summon there to help the young robot and save the wo kiryu majima your stories keep on getting more ridiculous just say that you got from the store majima let me have my moment kiryu chan two months later and eight crashes later nicob is now a mad old man crazy thinking hes still recording for someone whens not and thus the world war three happened goro majima is a majimess but he does his majibest kaoru comes out of the bathroom kiryu duuuude i just took the biggest dump kiryu kaorusan i dont wanna know about that and put some clothes on blushing not looking at her kaora dude chill its just my body jeez dont be such a pussy sorry i had to xd hello nico satan here you dont need to apologize your save state just decided to crap out on you which sucks i cant speak for everyone but most of us are patient so you dont need to worry about us thanks for going through the effort of playing the game all over again just for us youre cool beans can i get an f though for nicos save file these comments of the day are like how daddykazuma

nicos back and with an early video too now i can watch the whole thing before i feel like i have to go to bed and it has majima ive been craving me som mad dog shenanigans damn it really keeps crashing doesnt it thats getting to be a real problem it would be sweet if the game could just spontanously fix itself edit nico youre a star for going through all that hassle to try and fix the game i really hope it stays fine from now on kiryu curbstomped so hard he curbstomped the game data 50 views but 70 comments good job youtube at least it was worth the wait ladies and gentlemen the moment we were all waiting for best boy majima has returned to us what is sleep anyways digital is the best way sorry nico i think there is something wrong with the disk in general not your disk just the disk as a whole everybody seriously if you can donate some money to buy nico a digital copy il practice what i preach and give some money via his patron hopefully he can use a bit that we donate to buy another copy of the game but digital summon the penguin shaped confetti summon the chefs of pf changs and hot dogs summon majima this episode summon the picky penguin hugs summon the waifus summon the everlasting darkness summon the doughnuts coffees bagels turkey sandwiches waffles sea salt ice cream etc summon the hope and despair summon the picky penguins love happy birthday nicob also

nico get your head out of your ass nico shut up kiryu kiryu cocks gun want me to shoot your office up like i did when you played 0 oniisan is for big brother oneesan is for big sister also invite majima to karaoke they really should add kiryu in smash bros what would the conversation between current majima and current yuki even be like nicoyou didnt make your corrupted save data the picture in the bakamitai intro this truly is the worst timeline nicos resorted to trying to make us fall into despair d nah im just joking in all seriousness its good to have you back d godot yup the last days have been good for my little business without their daily dose of nicobine the picky penguins had to go for a cup of my special coffee as a substitute what if nico breaking so much stuff is the reason why the game is broken you know what time it is nicob karaoke time im a simple man if i see yakuza with majima i click because if i dont i will probably get stabbed the more you smash the boxesthe more the game will crashwait a secondnever mind i forgottotally for everyone reading this im part of a team making a fangame for nico if you want to be a part of it and think you can help with the art or just sharing ideas feel free to join anyone is welcome to be a part of the team and we could really use more help discord server link httpsdiscordggnnk98a you can find demos in httpswwwdeviantartcomhanzostenger majima its time for majima everywhere 2 kiryu chan kiryu no majima why not kiryu you gave me so much experience last game even after i reached 9999 exp you still kept fighting me my exp bar exploded because of you i had to ask yakuza 6 kiryu if i could borrow his majima sorry kiryu chan il give you all of it back kiryu what no stay away from me announcer kazuma kiryu is fleeing the battlefield shameful display the winner is majima goro majima now the score is 5 to 1038 im catching up kiryu chan 1 happy birthday nico 2 sobs in the cornor rocking back in forth because its been so long really happy to see you back up and running fine hope you had a great birthday now if youll excuse me snorts up that yakuza goodness he lives finally the return of majimasan now well be able to hear the kiryuchan in this brand new game engine added 35 more mad dog nerfed eyepatch by 15 does the picture in his intro change each time just the image alone of majimas hard hatglove wearing knife wielding barrelchested ass strutting down the entrance way like the big goofy mad dog peacock that he is somehow makes me giddy like a little kid and love every second of the experience happy late bday nico what i love is that there is a sense of respect between kiryu and majima theyre rivals kiryu is amused by majimas personality and majima respects kiryus strength and when majima said about getting a drink kiryu smiled and agreed which showed that they have a friendship that can be considered close happi birthmas bicon looks like some of the insanely high patreon patrons were lowered not by too much but were right under the cov goal again 732 bumped that man so hard it crashed the game is our favorite stalker back in action seems so important nico in this game you can invite majima to go karaoke with you when playing as kiryu yes the mad dog social link is canon so i suggest you do it whenever you got the chance majima will also have his own brand new song too majima this was totally worth the wait a wild video appear its super amazing will back to the grind play crisis core feels good hey the legend is back bois hope you had a nice birthday nico and im hyped to get back in the swing of things majima just needed some time to prepare is all you think being a knifeswinging maniac is all fun and games happy birthday nico now that youre 30 do you ever see yourself stopping playing games or watching anime because of age when i was younger i thought i would never play games or watch anime past 30 but im 27 and still doing both ive never been so happy to see a video before when you click the notification so fast that it says the video is private yeeeeeeeesssssssss i have been waiting for this absolute moment thank god kawakami is absolutely ready finally ive waited so patiently for the new yakuza d i hope you had a rad birthday nico 33 nicob 001 kiryu kiryu smash starts smashing everything woman whatever this is completely normal here daddy majima is home now kiryu its so powerful he can smash troughs so many thingscardboard boxes desk chairs the save file of yakuza kiwami 2wait a second yes my withdrawal symptoms are fading anyone else feel like the kiryumajima rivalry might be the new phoenixedgeworth levels of awesome the fable son has return welcome back nico yes mad dog time and well i checked yes theyre porn stars apparently theyre pretty top quality ones as well you learn something new every day he he he first and so yakuza finally returns i really appreciate this a recent development in dragon quest vii has left a bad taste in my mouth so seeing this series again after all of the previous difficulties definitely helps brighten my day just out of curiosity this question is for the other people in the comments is the recent lack of tips and info on the game in the comments a result of the games recent release its been 17 years wooooo the wait is over happy birthday again nico deep satisfaction sounds why cant majima find happiness tt my poor psychotic puppy im so fucking pissed man i dont know this feeling but fuck im so pissed majima deserve better fuck that old doctor but its also for her safety this really break me apart i went to sing shiawase nara ii ya right after getting out of the clinic what music plays on 125 ok but why all of a sudden the video becomes so blurry and my face so wet i originally say this before playing yakuza 0 and now coming back to it after beating it this scene has alot more impact majima has still been my favorite character since i started playing the series though it sucks that he wants to be with her but doesnt want to drag her back from the suffering she endure he gave up everything just got for her to be happy even heart warming she kept that watch he even gave her the same strap model before she left shame she found out when the plane fully took off so i currently played this scene too and i really struggled not to scream in my flat for ten minutes straight fucking majima why are you such a moron punches hole into wall uhmyeah i really wished he wouldve revealed himself after i know about majima married mirei this scene hit me in the gut more majima also want to let go and move on like his first love makoto but mireis abortion doesnt give him a break or even be a chance to drop his mad dog and be a dad i play cabaret club storyline in 0 many of majimas hostess said he might be a good dad majima despite his demanor is a gentlemen to opposite gender and concern the woman welfare even some of them trying to shoot him the only woman majima was hit is mirei after he know the abortion and thats the only line he was cross i said majima is really has a bad luck with the women every girls he love end up he leave them because he doesnt want his love one to be involve with yakuza may be he might be better with any of his hostess he was groom yuki is really become a big name in her career after 0 at first i was a little saddened there wasnt much between them and that majima couldnt say anything but the scene on the plane cheered me right up crazy bastard is a big ol softie he knew exactly how to let her know her waiting paid off without endangering her is this the game to play after yakuza 0 and this is why goro is my fave character i really love how makoto has such fond memories of majima despite at least 70 of them likely being her being blind and terrified while only hearing eeeeeeyeaaahhhh and yahoooooooo constantly while men scream in fear why im i crying i dont even play the game i didnt cry at the end of 0 like i expected but fuck did i bawl like a goddamn baby at the end of the majima saga when she realized who he was im tearing up just thinking about it hm is there any pain sir obvious sounds of pain finally there is a good ending for both of them one of my favorite majima moments the part that gives so much more depth to the character i wonder how didnt she recognize the outfit from the ending of y0 though i like how she didnt recognize his eye patch like how many people have it in the city tears running down face god slams desk damn slams again it again yakuza i told myself i wouldnt cry but i did my heart my soul it has never been so fulfilled and so broken at the same time well i now know that majima has very sensitive feet okay then you can see the sadness in his eye why am i crying like a bitch just beat the first kiwami and zero and i just couldnt help myself i just had to know if majima and mokoto would ever see each other again after the emotional gut punch that was 0 anyways i cried like a bitch wait so when she got the color she knew that majima was the one who sent it and knew that he was the one who helped her i was hoping to hear makotos watch go off when she opened the gift majima left her i love the expressiveness in majimas voice tone depending on who hes talking to it really shows that his psycho side is a character that he always controls and pulls out whenever he wants he is the polar opposite of kiryu so this video hits me hard for two reasons first well majima reuniting with the woman he loves second when i first saw the title of this video i still thought that lee was makoto so i thought that meant that he was still alive during kiwami 2 and didnt actually die with the bomb took me a long time to figure otherwise its weird cause if youve played yakuza 0 this scene kinda doesnt make but its still good non the less part of me is still furious he didnt pursue her was this jailed partner of his truly worth it goddamn you gave up a whole lifetime of happiness with a woman you loved just to remain yakuza that is such bullshit she wouldve chosen you over that boring doctor and you know it i recently finished yakuza 0 and stumbled upon this video since i havent finished majimas part in kiwami 2so ill be damnim just sad from watching this this might be heart warming but we cannot forget the sounds that majima is making when his feet are getting massaged i cant believe he is really sweet guy makoto did more damage to him than all of tojo clan why am i crying at the karaoke club rn shoulda put his big dumb face in the clouds lmao this shatters my heart but then puts it back together again there should be a ntr tag on this video is it normal im going gay for majima its weird this is not on dragon engineyet kiwami 2 game is shit if i got into a relationship with makoto id break kiryuchans heart im crying poor majima but no worry u have kirrrrrrrryyyyuuuuuchan 823 852 it honestly looks like makoto knew on some level before connecting the dots on the plane she has a look of anticipation after asking majima if theyve met as if hoping hell yes it is me after all and majima is probably keeping himself from doing that against every fiber of his being he shoots it down and she looks disappointed at first but when he looked at her watch she smiles back at him so she at least has a feeling is in fact him the feeling is confirmed when she gets the old strap 404 he looks fucking real holy shit like a snippet from a movie 2nd time he meets her and doesnt let her know who he is in 1988majima ever say that one of his eye is blind to makotoso that she in 2006 ask majima that did they ever met before who put the onions under my eyes majima has been beaten stabbed and shot 100 times but cant handle a massage when her husband woke up i hoped shes already disappeared but its not the case here ye i cried so what if only she saw that hanya on his back majima told her that he only had one eye hes the only person shes ever seen with one eye barely suspected him i wonder if the writers of majimas storyline in 0 watched gungrave a lot of his storyline is similar to brandon heats my heart breaks why i have watched this not done yet with y1 meplayed kiwami before experiencing 0 woahmajima is a freaking madmanhis story must be a crazy meafter playing kiwami 2 and realizing the mistake i madenothing but mad respect for my manyoull always have kiryu chan your daily reminded that majima deserved better yooo is that sawashiro miyuki as the va it pains my sooooooooouuuul i played through yakuza 0 before playing kiwami 2 and when i got to this part it hit my heart like a jackhammer on concrete why do these games give me emotional whiplash we crying currently playing yakuza 0 and finished chapter 4 youtube likes to spoil things for me in my recommendations what is this movielike game never heard of it pop out in recommendation i usually dont support ntr but goddamn why cant they just fuck after playing yakuza 4 5 0 and kiwami 2 i think its pretty easy to understand why majima is the way he is this man went through so many heavy shit that would definitely break a normal mans psyche easily the feels goro majima had some moments with makoto makimura aka makoto tateyama but i dont know why he doesnt wanna see her anyone knows 354 anyway its so fun seeing him feeling pain i come here after finish yakuza 0 because want to know about makoto and that make my eyes hitting by onions salute for you majimasan hope that they will meet again in other yakuzas game this is so sad alexa play 24hr cinderella he should have talked i already imagine that dialogue majima also had another love story with another woman that ended badly in yakuza 5 there was an older woman who coach haruka to be idol that woman used to be idol she got pregnant with majimas baby they were married at the time she didnt want baby because she wanted to persu idol carrier getting abortion ended their relationship and her idol carrier didnt go well i loved this scene this hit me hard hope she would get back to him if she had remembered the details her savior had talked about losing an eye and was a yakuza the eyepatch silence and tattoo wouldve gave it away with just one scene majima gets solidified as my absolute favorite character in the yakuza series dang it poor majima here i thought makoto was gonna be with majima forever majima needs a love life too i thought makotos emi terasawa they totally look alike first time ive ever seen majima in so much pain lmao i wonder if that watch is available to purchase online or in store to ship on over seas im touched and i havent made it nearly this far ahhhhhh im so fucking happy they connected after so many years i almost fucking balled ahah yakuzas the shit would be hilarious if majima starting majima creepy everywhere where he decide to annoying makoto 247 not crying not crying the line that still kills me to this day from yakuza 0 is when makoto said he is a keeper to the takoyaki chef they would have been happy in another life but fate is cruel he really loved her and not even 20years could fill the hole she left majima should get his own spinoff game can get stabbed and walk away like a bad ass goes to massage kryptonite this game has one of the most incredible stories ive ever been through 828 turn around and say yesdont make me cry video gets recommended to me right after i finish watching yakuza 0 thanks for ripping my heart out how could she forget the time majima knocked out two guys saving her from getting assaulted and talking to her soontobe husband but never to her directly you dont forget a stranger saving you and you definitely dont forget a janky dude in an eyepatch and snakeskin blazer man this is torture to majima it is even worst than a physical beating why the fuck you guys cant reunite these two damn you yakuza and she is also married now imagine majima drops his own name third person style and then stayed quiet i think this is one of the few times a video game has made me cry it hurts going through this i really wished majima would talk to her but we already know the future events of the yakuza game and there will never be a majima x makoto love story in the future games so sega i love you and hate you for doing this to me for sliding this one in in the plot i am not crying just a crazy yakuza cutting onion out there this was such a complex scene to read my initial reaction as she looked out the plane was disappointment as many of you probably felt i was like really she would be happy after that but upon a rewatch from the episode screen it became quite clear to me that this was the perfect ending lets not forget that she finally got to say thank you to majima but that is not all due to her profession she even made physical contact with him for 30 minutes this can be quite therapuetic between two individuals never mind about two people of opposite gender who probably had romantic feelings for each other for almost 2 decades now sorta like a hug effect all in all i was so sold on that final scene compared to yakuza 0 and 1 kiwami 2 left a lot to be desired for me in terms of story and cutscenes but this scene was of an exception is the whole thing with majima and makoto was mentioned in the original ps2 games or they only added it after yakuza 0 im not crying what are you talking about watching this makes me wanna offer majima a hug of course minus the chance of getting sliced by his dagger or head whipped by his pummeling bat no one cant stop goro majima except makoto shes the second god hands imagine how she must have felt opening the gift and realizing she unknowingly thanked the person she was waiting around for 20 years and that he chose to silently hide his identity for her sake me wow the majima saga sucks the story is short and forgettable he doesnt have any other upgrades for mad dog style and this scene exists me fuckin god 1010 when makoto said she wants to meet majima for the last time and says thank u she did it and she saw majima even she didnt know he is majima sega u always show up a great story for us even its heartbreaking 853 im glad makoto makimura is so much happier compared to yakuza 0 where the poor lady is always sadscared or crying and she hasnt aged at all i definitely wish hed come out and said it but at the same time i think it was probably better he didnt at that moment for all she still cares he did just vanish without a word there may be some uglier feelings there too and if she had any romantic feelings itdve made things awkward with her being married majima still does have romantic feelings so that would also have complicated things i think itd just be a reheartbreak for him and for the fans maybe wed view her poorly despite the situation and majima having left first if she had to let him down or outright reject him i dont know how happy id be i think the way they did it was probably better awww majima why give her away man fuck makotos husband for stealing her from majima my fuckin heart the mad dog of shimano not that mad is this a game or movie majima despite all appearances is one of the nicest doods in the whole series well if youre a chick kid or civvie another story entirely if youre yakuza or work for him maybe majimasan could have married her does anyone know the soundtrack from this scene its beautiful is almost 9th in this month and kiwami 2 release on pc im new comer love this game why do i feel like im watching one of those korean dramas but better yakuza you are suppose to be a crime drama game fck u sega why u do this to me i cant i cant be crying for this scene fck ive been playing through yakuza 0 just got to the end of chapter 4 with majima havent been using youtube for guides or anything just searching for trailers on the teams new game somehow youtube chose to spoil the cliffhanger ending of chp4 with this video in my recommended feed thanks for that always appreciated my heart is broken and i want to cry fucking yakuza man i was just about to punch my monitor because he didnt say hello makoto long time no see to her but then he clued her in with the watch band so she knew he was there and heard what she said well played mad dog thats the sort of closure money cant buy uurrgg this made me so mad look her in the face damit damit maji this made me wellup as badass and crazy majima is most of the time reuniting with makoto shows his vulnerable softer side of him that we dont see all the time another reason why majima is the man the reason why i do prepurchase on steam is because majima story he is the man and more interesting than kiryu omfg watching this scene when you olayed yakuza 0 is so emotional i started crying for christs sake argh the tearsdamn this is so touching to memajima giving up his chance for happiness because he truly wants the best for his love damn that shit hurted she still never learned his name how is yakuza writing better than tv shows i wish sega had kept majimas hairstyle from zero as well as his butleresque outfit ohhh nice tattoo sir yes i just happened to knew other 2 guys with just one eye just like you that some way or the other look related to the yakuza but i never question if they were the sameeven when i should always remember one of them gave it all for meoh do my watch bothers you sir i gave it to that man that had 1 fucking eye just like you and he gave it backfunny that it bothers you also an other funny thing the other guy with just one eye that i knew looked so sad when he sow me i wish i remember his face because then i was notblinded anymore i dont like you makoto tt that foot massage how to beat the mad dog of shimano essence of foot massage goro is sad boi why am i crying in the club rn why am i crying at this good game guys both of then deserve the best too bad it wasnt each other notice how he subtly tries to keep his eyepatch from lingering into her view she definitely noticed but hes doing it so it wouldnt draw attention still hoping she wont even suspect hes the mythical cyclops that saved her so long ago why am i crying crop out all the parts with makoto and see how the mood changes the controller vibrating like crazy during the foot massage was a nice touch heartwrenching truly heartwrenching majima my man the whole part made me tear up was so happy when i played it oh fuck mad dog of shimano more like sad dog though this gonna make me cry this gonna make me cry just finish majima saga an hour ago and my eyes r still red goddamit tt how suck this is why iam watch this i think this happy ending for majima but what this is suuck why iam watch this suuuck you real man majima how did you get this up didnt think it was possible to choose majima thismake me really touched damn it the onion ninja strikes again so she not blind i only wish makoto didnt have that stupid mole near her mouth characters with face moles are just ugly wry she use takemura thank you and also fuck you sega for such a good story i mean true closure only comes when the musical box is ringing in that watch then its closure my heart im not crying youre crying from yakuza 35 always hope i can play as majima and dev deliver with beautiful story this is a lot better love story than twilight shit majima story best his story was touching its so sad that majima couldnt even say anything to her or just tell her he was the man she saved 20 years ago if he did that people would chase her i find it even sadder that he couldnt show her his face she knew already what he looked like im still glad majima gave her a farewell gift at least now he knows she will be safe sorry makoto but majima is in love with kiryuchan now god damn it why must this game bring out so much feels thanks for the spoiler u cunts the feels i even didnt play yakuza 2 kiwami but the tumbnail is just so interest me to watch the reunion between majima and makoto 354 all the torture he went through during his time in the underground dungeon in yakuza 0 none of those seem to be comparable to this one im not crying you crying just finished yakuza 0 and maaaan i couldnt sleep i was really bummed about majima and makotos story was really expecting a happy ending with both of them together i shipped these two so hard through the game ending made me soooo sad aghhhhhh majimaaaaasaaaan ill fight u to make u happy 354 really man ive had someone do that and it didnt even hurt im not crying the video is just blurry due to buffing oh i like this a lot deep down the mad dog is still the guy from 1988 majima is a fucking romantic guy i found this while searching for the yakuza 0 ost im so glad i found this cause after yakuza 0 i felt so heartbroken that they did not stay together and she didnt know who he was and no i feel way better knowing this happened coooolll we now know that majima has a weakness dem feets i didnt think it was possible this is the most beautiful shit ive ever seen in my whole life even if majimia decided to tell her who he is what could he do shes happily married with a child it sucks but the most he can do now is be like itachi n watch from afar youd have to be a monster to not tear up during the plane part where you wonder if majima finally mustered up the courage or not to let her know you see he did it in a way to not cause a ruckus she never got to speak to him the way she wanted to though such a majima move always selling himself short youre not a bother to her majima san but she knows him knows hes the type to silently watch over her majimas a stronger man then me in that sense id have to reconnect more then that hes a true lone wolf but at least she finally has a face to put to the memories theyre cute together shitafter done yakuza 0 i instantly watch it you know majima mean something when he use his real voice the real homie majima if i were majima ill tell her get yakuzas tailing on her ass again make a run together again do some nostalgic shits and finallye she will broke up with her husband and choose me yey that feeling when you want her to know the truth but are also happy for the life she has now damn i just cried cuz of this video can she actually see this guy is man of the man i like how she realised who it was when she opened the box with the watch strap i just finished y0 i cant help to spoil myself so i watched this the love story of these two is unforgettable bittersweet indeed time to wait for pc port feb 2019 so i guess the true heroine is kiryuchan ive never had a game make me tear up but the relationship between them two from yakuza 0 my fav to y2 tugged on my strings lol fuck makato youre just a girl who act like a romantic unicorn slut and fuck majima its been 10 years since i played the original on ps2 but is this scene also in the original i may be late to the party but is the reason why majima likes to bother kiryu is because kiryu helped makoto and is his last ties to her really ppl are you shipping them this relationship as cliche as a soap opera awwww how touchable to be honest ive become estranged from majima after playing yakuza 0 i wish they never created a character like makoto he reminds me of hiei and his sister im not crying i swear yakuza 1 we play as a young kazama and his kyodai is kashiwagi and we learn more about the tojo clan creator makoto tojo this should be awesome and a young kiryu and nishiki secret boss the first time i met majima in yakuza kiwami 1 i thought he just a crazy and lunatic everytime i fight him but after watching this video i felt a kind heart on majima for helping her he really a man who respects a woman he love wish him if he could find a new love why am i crying in the club rn this scene bring back memories from yakuza zero and was the best time ever when i first play yakuza damn this scene make me cry not gon lie i still feel sorry for majima all he has done majima is a real man couldnt tell if he wanted laugh or scream during the foot part feel so sad watching this having just played 0 then kiwami and knowing what they went through together def playing kiwami 2 as soon as i can really hoped theyd meet face to face lol guess some dreams just dont come true thats the beauty fuck i didnt complete the ending of 0 cuz of this but now need to play this one just played yakuza 0 in pc compared to yakuza 0 yakuza kiwamis facial expressions are very stiff i hope theyd fix it for the pc version majima looks dead in this version this part was really good but i feel like a big chunk of the majima saga was just like memba yakuza 0 i memba im not crying youre crying a real kick in the dick majima you smooth motherfucker this is a very well made scene and the fact it took 3 games to complete this arc helps built up the anticipation in the form of a tear drop 1038 i love this side of majima hes a human after all thats why majima is the best such a great character also on the plane i said to myself she better cry great scene just finished yakuza 0 in pc and seeing this its very sad it hurts closure is really hard i just hope they do dlc w majima and makoto son being goro stopping makoto son becoming a yakuza wo knowing the reason why makoto son wants to be yakuza is to take revenge for killing his parents by liau gao and chinese mafia since 1988 her appearance still doesnt change wow as a newcomer starting on 6i know a mistake and that moment when she opens to box oh man i get the feels great scene i love that ending when she realises what a touching emotional ending god dammit sega you cant just do a heat move on my heart like that glad that she moved on to a happy future but i get the feeling that deep down inside majima is still her 1 if he spoke to her then and there it woulda just stirred all kinds of complicated feelings inside her and cause friction at home he did the right thing now someone hug majima he fucking deserves all the hugs in the world those two need to be together arrrrrggghhh i cant stand it i just need more majima cuteness in my life you know if hed actually told her it would be much better now i know the reason why majimas personality completely change from a true gentleman to a completely insane mad dog because he is sick only becomes a puppet like a dumb tool in yakuza 0 goddamnit whos cutting the onions both majima and kiryu never get to be with the ones they love this is so sad man i never thought he scak like a parrot why doesnt he want her to know its him oh man my eyes are sweating crying like a baby through the whole video dont tell anyone my heart is broken my ship has sunk and im pissed off yakuza made this story line just to fuck with me as i slowly pinch myself to keep me from cutting myself as the depression hit harder than nugget cashing checks she traveled to the us to teach massaging to the american police gorokun such a good man despite his mad dog personality i just started playing yakuza 0 4 days ago now i know what majima was like when i played yakuza kiwami i thought that majima was just an insane person but when i see majima in yakuza 0 he is completely different and i got to see that difference in this scene his high pitch voice was not used in one part and i saw the real majima thank you sega for making these games its touching moments like these is why i like the series even more one thing that bothers me how come makoto didnt recognize the guy who beat up his subordinates for harassing her and her friendin 0s epilogue im not crying youre crying dont worry lads hes got kiryuchan nicobs reaction to this entire moment on his lp of this game was so worth the wait anyone know the piano music thats playing while shes talking about the watch the whole time i was like just tell her who you are i absolutely love this series one minute your saving miracle johnson from zombies while he moonwalks down the street then you fight 30 guys like a badass bruce lee the next minute your fighting back the tears this franchise is amazing and im so glad i stumbled upon it after 20 years and their reunion makoto finally knew it was majima that saved her kinda sad it was too late tho but glad they met each other again so she recover his vision after all im playing the 0 and i this got recommended in my videos man i never though this game is gonna make my tear like a bitch call me selfish but i probably couldnt hold back my feelings if i was him im only human after all the instant pain you see in majimas eyes when he sees makoto kills me everytime i wonder if her husband is that doctor we saw his old personality jump back for at least a minute there thats how much he cares for makoto question for you guys did goro turn into the guy that took the bullets for him in yakuza 0 the story of majima and makoto from yakuza 0 to kiwami 2 is story of true man story of true love and sacrifice for happiest of woman i lost it when i saw makoto again the story between her and majima was so sad though incredible voice actor and scene tears of joy bro tears of joy let majima be happy you goddamn cowards also a version of him singing bakamitai so sadbut there is no other choice i be crying in th e club for r e al is it possible for makoto to still love him even though shes married in zero i like majima storyso much feeling and im happy makoto finnaly have good life thats the first time i saw majima with real sad look but also happy at the same time fck u sega im not crying i swear i just finished 0 between the ending and this scene im sad angry confused and other emotions that their story didnt have more to it after how emotional makotos life was in 0 and eventually majimas involvement seeing the ending to that game kinda sucked so many ninjas cutting onion no im not crying youre crying shut up current mood awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww whats the piano soundtrack playing in 450 1045 this scene right here made me cry so hard now that she finally knew it was him she has no regrets no ninjas in my house legit crying like a real man this literally everything else over in majima saga wait makoto can see probably i need to finish the game first to know the rest of the story ya worked out some knots ive had for 18 years omgjust fininshed yakuza 0 and stumble upon this clipcant say i come across better love story in game industry cant imagine sega did it well done gotta love how his voice changes when he spoke to makoto got rid of the high pitch and returned to his 1988 self majima the manliest man ever stop making me feel my feels goddamn i love the yakuza series bought 0 on pc now im picking up a ps4 for the rest of them ive got a bit of a man crush on majima i cry at almost nothing yet the part on the plane had me blubbering like a baby perfection to be honest i was really let down with the whole majima chapter the interactions with makoto were really the only interesting moments getting a massage from the formerly blind girl we were supposed to kill weve all been there good times great use of the sim song and great scene and damn right in the feels right in the feels i think my eye is leaking a little hey you yeah you anoying fuck cut an onion does anyone know the guitar ballad that plays around the 553 mark i have to admit i laughed out loud at the part where she massaged his feet lol still the rest was very sad though g damn i love this series just wish you wouldnt need a phd to get all of the story meh one day ill play all the yakuza games i missed out on buuut not today heres to you majima you truly have a heart of gold feel majima and makoto love story feel ah when you tube recommended videos spoils the game youre playing the closure doesnt feel that way just feels like dying guys in case you are moved without understanding japanese your heart would be squeezed by unknown emotions if you knew how well the dubist speaks she speaks with innocent and somehow exciting tone about her present life but the voice sure makes us feel her everlasting gratitude to one man who protected her costing his life majima feels happy and satisfied understanding that she lives in a brilliant situation but with full memory of him while his soul feels a bit bitterness majima is doutlessly a real man and makoto is a woman who made him a real man why majima didnt tell her the truth in the ending of y0 this was good but not what i was expecting you are getting blueballed the same way you got in yakuza 0 plz say something anything etc i love how majima chooses not to speak during the massage because she might recognize his voice damn yakuza cutting onions this is why i love majima more than kiryu man nothing against kiryu but majimas characters are more fleshed out and hes fitting to be a yakuza main protagonist rather than kind kiryu majimas story is very well written and he deserves more love sega definitely should make a game of his own she has changed her last name i half expected to see majima dong the hustle on the wing of the plane it probably would have made me cry less ya worked out some knots ive had for 18 years that line omg i love yakuza 2 and kiwami just had to put this in my hart i cri tt no youre crying baka props to majima for swallowing his feelings for makoto just to see her happy the tears they do not stop flowing i love this series i hate how it makes me feel god damn it majima why are you my favorite character a guy wont feel pain while fighting got hurt by foot massage xd majimasan is a one of a kind character if they do a remake of 345 for ps4 jp uk au us they do so much more but almost have the same storymode n sidemissions n more collectables n im sure underground fight tournament but why cant they put yakuza 3 on ps now so very bittersweet i just finished yakuza 0 and you can tell he really cares for her but knows he cant drag her into the life with him this is the perfect wrap up and truly ends it in a great way seeing this after completing 0 makes you wanna just curl up into a big ball cry your heart out man even if it was just for a short time they got to see each other again aww this was so fucking touching i teared up alil ahhhh i just finished yakuza 0 with kimiwari not being on pc yet but damn son i have his scene to look forward too for perhaps 34 years good for him the ending on zero made me tear up anyone here from nico b hes probably gonna cry when he gets to this part even though i did want him to say your welcome as he left its still nice that she realized she finally got to say thank you to him in her own way someone hug majima the man needs a hug feels gun shoots repeatedly ow stop ow ow mofoker why does youtube recommend a spoiler dont cry dont cry dont cry can someone lend me a napkin please fuck fuck fuck the moment she said she got married and got children i cry so hard it not her with majima oh god i cant tell how majima feel when he heard that i feel like the everything after 0 is just him acting my heart it bleeds its 1 am and im trying not to cry out loud because of this and im kind of failing because theres tears in my eyes and god imso fucking emotional rihgt now fuck me i have never played a yakuza game before but this has sold me i actually just teared up at a scene i know no context for nor do i have any emotional attachment to these characters am i just a wuss i love how at ease and how excited you can tell majima is to listen is at 557 you can easily see that hes genuinely happy and then at 803 theres just something about him that you can tell that hes that much more happy the writing in these games is so good that nearly made me well up this makes me so happy the feels the feels she finally got to see what majima looks like after 20 years ah yakuza will tear your heart out with scenes like this then next scene youll be doing some wacky shit that puts loony toons to shame poor girl shes definitely earned her happy ending i finished this part this morning and now im at work depressed as hell haha aww man what an awesome story that was rude sega if you bring majima to karaoke there is a mv on the relationship with him and makato so knowing majima had a wife after 0 does this make the scene more awkward cant wait til nicob see this so i cried doesnt make me less of a man majima is the man giving up his personal feelings for the sake of the woman he loves it ends where it started actually i hope that the story would be a bit more dramatic than this like shespot on himsome time later after thereunion and story goes on to when she can finally thank him face to face but ah well this is still a heartcontent for me i love how makoto hasnt aged at all this made me cried and i just finished yakuza 0 man seeing how happy makoto was brought every tear in me its just so touching how they tied a loose end which wasnt even that loose even tighter in the end makoto managed to thank majima and he can rest easier knowing he left her in good hands ya worked out some knots ive had for 18 years yeah just fuck my shit up completely fam and i just finished yakuza zero i have no words just like their first scene in yakuza 0 i think one of my most favorite additions to this is the skill substory finder i love this skill so much please do a playthrough of the whole cabaret sidestory is it demo version release already on asia server review copy he had to skip every fucking cutscene us for us that never played yakuza 2 ever thx for that 1141 why you skipped that its a fundamental moment to see kiryus close friends sacrificing themself due to betrayalbloodshedand power in a nightmare one

fondness to s level to unlock all skills im glad that now the west is caught up with like a dragonyakuza ps4 releases how are you able to get this shit early man teach me your ways leon that guy can handle devil may cry fight but not yakuza fight why sad excuse of a fight you arent even bothering to fight cause the only thing you do is just use the same running attack your job as a content creator is to make content that is worth watchingwhich its not posted in 2018 947k subscribers currently and only 36k views on this video and even less on some of the other videos the numbers speak for itself painful to watch your makes this game look horrible the bow looks horriblehow come the japanese themselves made the bow so messed up hey hey lead keibusanfix ur collar firstu r putting a bad example for all the keijisan tachis this game seem horrible lol at the ryuji boss fight you can see the broken sticks pilling up on the floor from all the times he used the heat move with sticks the player is terrible at least throw punches instead of running every few seconds stupid players detective kaoru sayama wants the d lol why you got many hate i wonder 3 kaoru sayama should have been a dlc costume for makato in persona 5 this guy pick throwing knife grenade flashband but most of time only use bare hands wtf ryuji is a warmonger when it comes to his ambitions wow english sub thanks but his not selling guns in mine have you ever tried infinite rocket launcher i want that weapon what gear are you using what does the icon on the upper left corner of your gear mean and how to get it im talking about the yellow one that seems like a chain 139143 they shouldve implemented active ragdoll or something theres no reaction getting punched and the time space defying cut scene switching 226228 the head rotation and character controller rotation tech is old like 30 years old ya might wanna rerecord this fight that lag is really distracting other than that holy shit dude beat up two tigers was that a komaki tiger droo shot at the end like what robin williams said never runaway from a big cat whoever is playing this sucks why it seems kind of lagging the baby fighot was more epic

few mistakes but cool video btw how do u have 5 cards at the start i only have 3 and its sucks cuz i always run out if them thank god its free i love this game how are you seeing the rank of yourself and your opponent is that a mod i need this game on mobile so hearthstone but all cards are military units always excited to see your videos especially this game and of course the military rts games very interesting would love to see more is similar with wot generals nice register in the alpha asap httpswwwkardsccgcom before your slot is taken hope you guys enjoyed this video and are looking forward to this game i made some mistakes in the video about explaining the game but this will atleast get you up on your feet good luck in your battles later today fellas o7 if it can fight in the snow to the front it goes this looks like one of the best games ever if you play the german fraction you always loose p that alpha thing was bugging me and distracting me from the whole video dislike almost all of phlys viewers do t know he made this video i tried the game cuz i was curious but didnt like ww2 so it didnt stick sry man its nice to meet a fellow lover of ww2 pokemon cards in the 1930s be like kards que red army is strongest of all if only they had more than one song that makes me lose my mind just 8 more likes till the war begins xd minor faction cardsis in game 1926 poster for the life insurances this is a rare piece of shit without a game balance where the winner in my experience is the one who is just lucky and not the one who calculates his moves ahead the worst thing that can be done there is to take several cards of different nations and get a complete imbalance this is the only game in the world where you can see the japanese from the city of tripoli attack stalingrad along with the germans but you can still see how the ussr player fights with the ussr player wtf and i ask the same question soviet use gulag along with starvation i want something that is like pokemon but the cards are like this game i have the closed beta access to this game hope i dont f this up it is a kinda fun to play but be aware of that this game is completely broken after about 200 hours in the game i can tell that it has huge balance issues yes it is a beta but they sell already packs go and check it out but i would not buy anything yet just my 2 cents ahahha nice game p tanks destory aircrafts yeaaa good game p ahahahahaha no matter what card you have p tanks destory aircrafts its rll realistic p phlydaily i dont like fantasy based games this kards suits me then uses ussr with their german allies 1 credibility phlydaily this will be cool when its a physical card game they got a lot of inspiration from hearthstone this game looks really cool hope i get to join the beta so some units show 3k cost to play and then a smaller number below 1 i would assume this small 1 is an upkeep cost or movement cost im so freaking out because i want to play so bad and hope i can get on the closed beta for sure just found out this game existed like 3 nights ago and have been needing out something aweful lol the mechanics are really similar to hearthstone which i no longer play but way better and the frontline feature makes this game superior to any other digital ccg i wish and hope they bring this to a physical format im already sold and willing to spend money on this game and i never spend money on free to play excellent video and excellent job describing how the game plays have registered for alpha can help with concept and art if you like have worked in digital art for 10 and art for 30 years google xadrikxu or xadrik xu if you would like to see some of the older stuff hope to play soon i love tcgs and have studied ww2 since primary schooli am 43 i may be able to provide some insight into australian involvement in ww2 that may not be easily researched such as zforce make more videos of this game plz loved it is the alpha test free raptor ture face i am shocking been playing this a lot the last couple days be careful of playing orders which raise all of empire type because if the enemy is using that empire it raises their units as well i swapped those out for all friendly units orders been doing a lot of training missions to get experience and have noticed there are not many people on at any given time playyy more for us thank you teaching me about this awsame game those are actual propaganda posters from the period not necessarily artwork created by the devs i should have clicked off the video i had stuff to do i hate myself now am i the only one who gets a ton of bugs each game how do i get kards on my phone oh man i got addicted to this game because of you please make some more of these i for one am in favour of more of these if thats something that youre considering japanese cavalry unit against bt7 seems familiar better ww2 game than cod lol great video for a great game thanks man phlydaily can you do more of this on your channel this is absolutely awesome i just need this game gosh phly dont tell me how to live my life you preachy naive gamer loving this game play keep up gd work so its hearthstone but with ww2 cards and mechanics sign me the fuck up i want in ww2 magic the gathering to anyone who has ever played hearthstone this is basically the same game its got the same cars layout and everything its just a copy of hearthstone but i love it cause i am fascinated with war and stuff i was hoping that ull make a video on this game do more plz and tell your friends this is the only kards video out in the realm of yt play and record more of this did anyone play world of tanks generals i registered 11 hours ago and i still havent received an email not even one saying i have not been accepted is there a reason for this can we have more videos with kards the art work on those cards tho did he say this was for mobile reminds me of wot generals i stopped watching stranger things for this i think these are legit propaganda posters the rising sun card was a legit picture from australin news papers as we feared the japanese would invade us completely we actually drew a line from brisbane right across the whole country called the brisbane line and this is how far we were prepared to give up to the japanese similar to magic the gathering cant you attack the hq from the frontline you keep skipping attacks wheres war thunder gone i need help with my british tech tree phly please play wolfenstein more sorry not my game challenge take out the 88mm half truck with full load of he shells and use it as an antiair gun attempt 5 welp im failing algebra 2 are my ducks in a row eh i mean its just a card game guy so basically a ww2 version of hearthstone this game looks awesome this reminds me of heartstone you should play world warfare its a fun and addicting mobile game its alot like hearthstone but for ww2 nerds love it i signed up lets see the kpz in war thunder and a plane of ur choice will this ever come to ios andor google store just i quick comment before i watch the rest of the video phly nailed my issue with fantasy settings perfectly i mean since its a fantasy setting the heroes can just cast the all powerful spell of instant victory and then call it a day the question is how much pay 2 win will it have phly it would break my little heart and others too if you did not play fortnite battle royale we want bomber crew pin this or u will be sent to gulag phly yes i know this is a cheap way to get pinned more please interesting rendition of playing in the background wow that is some nice intercontinental artillery soooo its a hearhstone rip of this is when phly turns out to be a yogioh great game to livestream the order card with the words verdunkeln is a propaganda poster from germanyuk the hearthstone of ww2 i like it philydaily i understend you must eat and your bmw but come on i like your channel couse ur uploading each day wt gameplay and your funny sometiems but not for this content different strokes for different folks did you learn that on one of those bad pornhub videos where they actually act out instead of just fucking rip hearthstone my uncle made this game i am not lying do more of this game phly play men of war pls moremoremoremoremoremore i need m o r e this looks similar to world of tanks generals why exactly are there mixed nations those are basically predefined classes which should totally be kept that way without russian bias lul or is it because its an alpha and there arent that many cards yet so a new world of tanks generals its seems like a new german missal light tank in war thunder in 173 like the looks good love the art work only negative for me is having things like the axis and allies work together would be cool if they were separate other than that great game 1444 ooohhhh a hundred and five centimeter artillery 105cm1050mm thats even scarier than the 420mm guns of the h41 the 460mm guns of the yamato class and the 800mm gun from the schwerer gustav ia m pretty confident that some of those cards use art from original ww2 propaganda posters which is pretty cool i love dis watching u play dis game can u pls do more vids about it will it be coming out for ps4 i highly recommend you playing memoir44 its a board game online also exist as a board game irl about ww2 with context of historical battles imagine having rare cards from rare countries that participated in the war portugal fe sry for bad english phly how do you even find these amazing games btw it reminds me of wotg if you get my drift p hearthstone remastered ive been waiting for this day my whole life heavy artillery support is required take out the sturmpanzer ii and hs 129 b2 to support your allies attempt 5 im not too smart so i got lost at about 001 but good video anyway phlee perfect more reminds me of magic the gathering waitrussians and germans allies that makes sense d phly our sources indicate a increase in luftwaffe air superioritythe queen wants you to take out only the best that is why we present you the firebrandyour goal is to obtain five killswe wish you the best of luck lovingtheunloved attempt 29 great game soviet aa should be rifleman aiming at the sky i am early b0ss isnt this just world of tanks generals i just binge watched season two of stranger things for 9 hours all in one go but hey phly uploaded the fucking nap can wait love the unloved the emperor needs your help do the very honorable thing and take tier 1 kami and d3a1 veeeery honourable shit im early again loved it hi phly love your videos love from algeria first letter of alphabet is a first i just found this game a few weeks ago and am terrible at it but i havent stayed up until 4am playing a game since red orchestra came out in 2006 haha only one comment edit oh wait 2 now without watching it all yet going to call it now gearbot wins it all been waiting for him to play it again perfect reasons why this game gave e headaches british force is way too strong is this available in mobile why dont you make a deck with the greyhound tanks and artillery in the back since they will gain damage points from the greyhound and use guard units so they cant focus down your artillery play foxhole1 its ight apollo cant always get the w total appalo going idiot on this game look at what you did at the end of deacons game could have one it if used to attack target differently hoi4 plsif you dont know how to play just react and learn that way looks great hope youll play that game more often plz so some of the ones that didnt get to join and then let them join they updated call of war but u have to make a new map britain is probably my favorite because im a defensive player who are you and what did you do to the shieldbiter pixie poo the more cards you can get in your hand the better always have cards that bring more cards to your hand apollo apollo apollo can we start the game lol is it available on ios or an other sort game you need to focus on the headquarter u suck at this if i may be so bold if you guys want a chance for some free kards card packs head over to the giveaway

till the commonwealth cards played i hope you figured out that the rocket trucks ability is to deal 0 or 1 extra damage that is very important to know thanks for showing this looks alot of fun even though it was so painful to watch all the bad moves xd stupid that a card game cant even get macos compablity i cant play tried the game too some weeks ago now im really into it and reached first field marshall rank without buying packs you already get plenty of pack just by playing the game i like this a lot how about some more kard was many who wanted that plz plz plz do a ultimate general civil war confederacy campaign could you check out this gametotally accurate battle simulator card games always pay to win even irl if you dont buy the newest pack you will probably have a hard time playing against everybody else into the motherland the german army marches well i must say i like this can you talk less please game is awesome but im not able to run it for some reason i cant figure it out sucks total war pl0x i beg you fight for middle earth please give us more italy deck poor inf shitty tanks but pasta i play a britishsoviet combined deck i actually think this is one of my favorite videos when you said it was free i freaked out do this more i love it under progress you can claim the things you have managed you press claim on the ones ready for the gold you get for free you buy booster to get more cards each is 10 gold you earn gold by winning games good fun i have played some months now and i really liked it i havent bought anything for real money but doing ok anyway its not really p2w because the standard and less rare card are ok to play with but of course the more card you have the more option you have and easier to make a good deck ill write some small basics after a while you need to make your own deck since the starter deck is not that good it is really easy to make decks when you play it is good try use all kreds must of the turn so you get buck for the money but sometimes dependning on hand cards is better to not use all also good cards to have is those that draw more cards is not good to run out of card on hand you play a major power and also can use a minor country in your deck its usa good economical and air russia good at infantry tank and artelleri japan good at air and cheap infantry brittain good at defense and orders german good at tanks cheap and expensivethe minor nation you choose can on wow this was actually really good plz do more of this loved the game thx fun game but rampant cheating or zero card abuse abounds at higher tiers enjoy the way up but at the top it sucks ass what game is this would love more kards pretty cool game wouldnt mind seeing a couple more videos not to be nasty but i hate it really enjoyed this love ww2 stuff looking to download id like to tell everyone that every single card game is paid to win because you need damn cards this game is way better than hearthstone the frontline mechanic makes it more complex and overal more difficult to find the most optimal play btw its not even close to pay to win i have actually made it to top 100 in oficier club with a low budget deck playing the game for one week havent bought a single pack not even for gold the deck runs no elites and only two special rarity cards can work well even with just one tank you for showing me this new game ima get it now but where can i find this also another video on this please thank you for your videos till next time he lost on purpose for making video historic i want more i love this make som more do napoleon total war 3 its a nice mod and it was update to version 84 i could make you a medieval card game you helped me get through 6th grade keep playing really good game got me good so far thinking of downloading it make more empire total war stuff or napoleon i like this game can you play more of this game in the future and maybe put down the link for the game so i play it why didnt u keep whacking the hq who cares about the rest pixilated join the 1st massachusetts cavalry company in war of rights really good company to join the game looks kinda dope and i am not gonna lie looks like u arent that good at strategy card games i mean kards literally p2w like star wars battlefront 2 at its launch man this is such a good video you should do a voice reveal hm wwii hearthstone xd more this game looks amazing pls stream 2007 yeah because you werent aggressive enough in the beginning of the game and you should have used that blackout card when there were actually air units looks like a great game going to get it to prove i can play better than you also check out hearthstone for practice can you play lord of the rings is this game on steam i am downloading right now this game looks awesome and i am eager to play thanks pixie watching you play and hearing vera lynn singing in the background what a nice combination loved it pc only loved it i didnt like it sorry but not my thing

come out on phone and tablets you should play as japan your kamikaze tactics seem to p like that of them hey pixelated there is a game call hoi4 you might like it is a ww2 rts game it is really fun dont forget that if you surrender you lose if the enemy surrenders you win its also possible to win or lose that if you or the enemy run out of cards and have no options left but to surrender a hundred mistakes were made against an ai great game man tried the beta in a games con loved the vid we miss company of heroes way to different from all you uploads funny game italy crying in the corner do more of this ww2 game too pssy to give the nazis a swastika flag pass i dont care for these types of games ever but u never know it could be cool this is the of me seeing it and im not that far into the vid yet but hey it almost has my name in it did anyone else notice how he could have attacked the headquarters in the first game but just went after the arty instead theres logic to the way each nations play style is set up its pretty much a reflection on history warthunder reflects this really well ha its kinda spelt the way my name is spelt whaaaaaaat they forgot an r and an e hearthstone and hoi4 nice ww2 texture pack for hearthstone people complain that a card game is pay to win all card games are pay to win its natural watched 12 mins downloaded the game played a couple

content uhh 112 is soviet a nation wasnt it said that contributors should be respectful while this individual creates a video where he is making fun of his opponents i jumped to this after getting kinda bored of tesl during moons really enjoyable great historical verisimilitude and attention to historical detail the thematic abilities that so many cards have related to their history just tickles my brain great time to get on the kards train with the new expansion dropping last month i had played for 5 months and only getting 5 new cards the cardpoolmeta was getting so stale people are still figuring out the meta with allegiance expansion in the calculus looks playable interested to see how they make it replayable great game when you were talking about other games i was going to mention it to you however in that same video you mentioned how you were reluctant to play mythgard as it not well known or something i really like the mechanics of this game but i have not got too into it for the same reasons but definitely keeping my eye on this yeah def want more of this very interesting hey i just tried this one a few weeks ago i enjoyed the mechanics and the art style ill be honest though the lack of diverse sound effects kinda turned me off the game i swear half the reason i stuck with legends for so long is cause of the memes the voicelines and sound effects created between my friends and i oh i am so fucking in looks like a badass tcg hopefully it comes to ios soon btw do you have another way for people to donate besides patreon the art and effects are pretty cool also digging the music fun looking game but whats the deal with the music i know its from the era but holy god it is obnoxious nice game im so excited to play it a lot new cards look fun when you wear sunnies you look and sound like a 70s porn star wwi variant as well maybe this game is sweet 168 liberty ships jazz wheres the big fat cigarr and the whiskey glass cherbourg my town hey raptor ive been watching you for sometime now i just found this game myself its for both pc and iphone its a good game would love to see u play its by innogames grepolis please go look it up and hopefully youll like it sry raptor missed 2 live streams in 1 day i was busy mowing but keep up the great work bro i played this deck i was already field marshal with america germany and russia this deck took me to captain with japan fairly easily i will grind it out the rest of the way when i have time great deck ive noticed some lagging indeed but its still totally watchable very nice i think the community needed that because sometimes you find yourself really struggling against opponents with all elite decks want to support kards please vote for outstanding visual style steam awards nominations httpsstoresteampoweredcomsteamawardsnominations also shoutout to both spooz gamermengel who both had a clip in this episode show them love by following them on their platforms spooz httpswwwtwitchtvspooztwitch gamermengel httpswwwyoutubecomchannelucykcluhps3yttghouu4yzq smol i miss you you play new game how is alissa doing btw my favorite hired me into fbi few months back xd wow what a triple kill new card revealed in this video gb turtle ftw i like it one can have a lot of fun to buff them however it is not a op card because there are removals available as shown in your video nice video and nice card you revealed ive learnt long ago never avoid attacking the brits hq especially when they are close to 30 ohhhhhh the salt this is good man my name is rdmandy hope to see you in battle you seem very sweet and cute do you have a discord 057 thanks for the game i rattlecrate really thought i had you 028 the first time i played that card i made the same mistake lol nice the last game was epic i wonder whether the opponent threw his computer out of the window soup man the clip with the marder oh my sides xd i was pissed off at first to see that planes can get hit by ground units but then i realized that theyre on the ground 999 of their lives if they only have extra defence while in the air frontlines that would make sense more kards please so good to chill and watch erepublik is still alive strategy game httpswwwerepublikcomenreferrerratkovo he triggered me that he didnt read the rule on the guard at the end hope it comes to android nice playlist im a beta tester for the game i got to check it out before it for released good video or stream whatever nice men loving this game and pinto with his insta act artillery thanks to the devs at kards for sponsoring todays video i have liked this game for a long time so happy to play it again getting into a collectible card game is actually fun so long as you like the context wwii is perfect if you have the knowledge like i mentioned you can play for free here httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp544810 more of this an expansion is out well youve got encircled and too confident just like real life germans wwii the gathering just started playing kards thanks to raptor love it so far what a shame you can finish the game 2 time and finaly you loose waw that backfired its getting interesting lol seriously i want this game too i played it awhile ago it was to hard for me raptor doesnt like magic the gathering glory to raptoria you were right about to card art man and the animations of them too i might have to get into this game myself here from kards community showing love 3 literally hitler no we can divide our forces and still win hahaha nice game love your content d hah wait witch is this comment second third you shouldve finished them off with the blitzkrieg wow i played this game as a play tester was lots of fun new game love when raptor posts videos first good game rampant cheating and zero card bullshit at higher tiers this is a fun change of pace nice video thanks for sharing also wanted to say that im loving like the variety of content on your channel keep it up been playing this seems to be a few random bugs such as troops randomly dying its fun but definitely still a beta the game is fun but i dont like faction mixing it really spoils the immersion and just becomes a play the best cards to win i think the arty w smokescreen cards are kind of strong nice change to watch play more good video just getting into the game and love playing japan with the british as allies what drew me in was a love for history and a game like this drawing from the vast amount of events and strategies employed during the conflict i can only hope this grows even bigger hope to be in one of these vidz at some point xd with game suck low system require like this but cant not reach 60fps while the germans arent the most popular nation to play these days its hard to deny the power of a double blitzkrieg ok he knew that the opponent doesnt have britain as ally i played a random match where the enemy used 2 blitzkriegs in a row and said gg but i activated national fire service wasted for newbies struggling remember not winning every game doesnt necessarily mean your deck is bad even advanced players who have strong cards and usually go on a winstreak also get on losestreaks sometimes your classic talk radio video games streaming guy wow i came here so i didnt have to hear that name please for the love of all you find holy dont mention his name again you know who 5408 markiplier had him on his channel i dont watch markiplier anymore i hope the game gets more attention i think it is pretty fun and it doesnt have terrible graphics ah i gotta hit tha sack hope its a good one ww2 hearthstone rampant cheating at high levels do not buy or spend money this game is boss not even my kind of thing usually i wish the cards were real there should make it where it a real kard game where you can buy at a store and stuff i watched pure cancer memes and i got this add and boi im here downloading the game d wow love this game lol raptor for once i am ahead of u field marshall for soviet union already please keep doing this series is going to be grate first pack opening ive ever enjoyed watching i love the game great video nice game love youre vids keep it up man is this game for pc damn im never this early great game nice btw first im also first to like my own comment first like and comment episode content timestamps lets play matchup one german panzer card deck httpsyoutube3cwrc1twxwt302 lets play matchup two german panzer card deck httpsyoutube3cwrc1twxwt736 953 you could have attacked with the panzer hello friend how do you get so many cards i just join this game for a few weeks when i open packs they always give me the same card good game by the way the subtitles in your intro said you were going to play with your german dick is this true this game is made by complete retards for complete retards if i didnt hate card games since i was little they give me anxiety somehow id be playing this i might give the game a try this card game looks like its right up my alley this actually seems very interesting use cheat ale for new equipment hoi4 waiting for the evil dutch empire dlc to play it this game has so much potential for memes very nice episode content timestamps my british commonwealth never give in deck httpsyoutube3rpq0dxjnzkt195 game of the week lets play ranked matchup httpsyoutube3rpq0dxjnzkt530 nice video although i cant shake the feeling that you pronounce the word deck as dick d who was the voice actor in the intro section mengel so it begins never give in gg so you dont know the difference between great britain and the united states hell yeah that looks awesome actually to acquire more card packs most of the time you have to buy them in the shop you tend to get the currency for these by winning games against human players or by completely daily questsmissions in games of this sort also you probably would have had a faster game if you read the cards and thought about what order to use them in more carefully such as deploying the 1 attack to infantry tank before you attacked with your infantry or maybe sacrificed your deal 2 damage on destruction infantry to kill the churchhill tank that was guarding their hq i think between its 4 damage and 2 damage on death it would have killed the enemy tank and thus opened up the hq for attack by your other unit you could easily take it a bit slower and actually read the cards hey nook could you this weeked play some rimworld it would be awesome doesnt the cards say tanks can move and attack during the same turn why did you only move them and end your turn with 2 points left how it works is that you can fight with and against anyone and you can be allied with anyone yes you can re write history and make usa allied with germany or any other combination of main nations looks like fun should give it a try it might be fun if they work out the balance problem between opponents 0157 this game not finished for sure 0535 brain dead ai watch the matches from fenrirs point of view here httpsyoutubelo9mpvktp8y i really feel like there should be a limit to number of elite cards u can place in deck overall game is nice why i have to money in this game only draw you wasted a couple of blitzes there mate thanks looks like magic but the art is awesome this is exactly the type of vide i want to see about kards i hopes this comes to ios are you done with wargroove until they nerf the pikemen or what 5456 happened two seconds ago 2253 yes its visible in the top left of the card together with the spawn cost of the card for example your aa guns did cost 0 to attack but you t34 costs 1 to attack thats also what the one american card you did say you didnt know what it did did it set these costs for all cards to 0 until the end of turn pretty obvious that you are not a regular player of card games especially not frontline based ones but you tried pretty good this is an awesome game great video but your audio cuts out for long periods of time and then back in cant wait to play beta if i get an invite japan has no background music disappointing this is the best game play it again please raptor please try out emervenyc on steam pitting out fires and saving lives play more farming sim 17 whens the next time your gonna live stream eco when are you going to be doing truckersmp atsmp thanks to you for sharing this great game looks fantastic the devs found a niche i willingly to put money into i want as many gorgeous looking cards as possible the possibilities are almost limitless d hope you will continue the coverage of this game you seem to have really enjoyed it great stream to watch 218 thst acsent tho is it rasist to call british brits man you need to attack his units lol they become abrams because you let them sit the entire game i like this game hey raptor hope i get a heart again is it from steam or where is it on mobile raptor have you checked iron harvest that game should be interesting fin cheers thats a pretty cool take on the burn aggro deck i like it also great editing that intro was fantastic nice intro editing btw d this games poopy did anyone else look at this and think it plays similar to magic the gathering glad you chose your own nation what about merica pls more of this game there was actually a small indication of the card could do something the top left number would turn from gold to gray a small detail but its there i would like two see the last to decks edit i cant spell really enjoying this game next video can you please try japanese or soviets looks good will give it a try this is a cool looking game i have not been much of a card game player since the magic the gathering days of my youth but this video has got me interested so i just signed up for the beta and will

suddendly popsup an error black screen of unreal engine 4 play more man this is like a reskin of hearthstone or magic the gathering gwent but with communism dear stalin ive been playing for a while and there is a real problem with the balance between opponents in matches im a private with only 3 wins and have been up against captains and generals so there is no chance of a win and therefore no fun been playing for a few days best card game since hearthstone and is better too specially cause of its deck progression and a much deeper strategy couldnt theyve added nation like china italy or some of the commonwealth nations i know its a lot to ask for but maybe in dlc very similar to hearthstone but with a ww2 skin honestly that isnt bad ive signed up for the beta dont move arty up keep them in the back so it is heartstone its written on the card type 95 hago has 3 attack against infantry thats why your infantry dies cool loving this game sucks that they just nerfed soviet rush decks

kards is a freetoplay ccg digital collectible card game set in wwii httpswwwkardscom available on steam httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp544810kardsthewwiicardgame the artwork and ww2 theme is stunning the frontline mechanic is a great addition this could be my new favorite card game i love the historical theme to kards i like kards because of the historical theme strategy and the history of the cards in the game i like ww 2 elements game especially card games ive tried almost every digital card game but i keep returning to kards probably the ww2 theme that i like so much im looking forward to the december expansion kards is a historical hearthstone great game yo nice channel fellow boet must feel good to be picked up by kards devs kards is sweet because of ww2 setting and frontline mechanic i just love seeing all the cool historical tanks and propaganda posters being made into cards i hope we get a tokyo rose card in the next set i play kards as i used to play world of tanks generals and after they shut it down i resorted to the boardgame version of wot until this came out i like kards because i like ww2 seting and frontline mechanic is very good i like kards because i find it really fun and enjoyable with its ww2 theme and how there is a lot of strategy on how to play the game always been a fan of wwii games and when i was younger used to play a lot of magic the gathering this game is a perfect combination of the two i switched from the randomness mayhem for kids aka hearthstone to this very promising looking game theres a lot of things that make kards superior to hs most interesting three lines of units and units activation cost all we need now is descent comunity of players im starting to play right now i appreciate your work because you seem regular in addition i find it good to reward several people the idea of making a gift on this game is really good thank you very much and continue your work i think i like kards just because of the art style other than that i suck at playing card games im more of an rts guy but that doesnt stop me from enjoying a good game i like playing cards since my parents lost their jobs and i used to play a lot of strategy games but cant afford any i love cards because its a great historical game that is free to play and involves a lot of strategy kards is an outstanding and incredible game with informative historical content and the theme itself is great i especially like the subtle music playing in the background and the animations from the played cards kards the card game with ww2 genre and is diverse and strategic i like kards because its not overlycomplex it makes for a more fun relaxing game as opposed to something like magic the gathering i like kards simply because theres no other game quite like it in the ccg genre the frontline and unit type mechanics are innovative and the beautiful artworks are the cherry on top hi mengel i like kards because of its great game mechanics and balance and the ww2 setting of course i like playing cards because the resource system gives unique choices when deciding to use active assets or invest in the board hi mengel my ingame name is rattlecrate and im from the netherlands i like this game being a magic player and a ww2 enthousiast ps keep up the good work with your vids you motivate me to keep on trying when i have a bad streak of games well i was already a subsriber of your channel d the reason i like kards is because its just the best ccg in the market ive played magic hearthstone yugioh faeria duelys and kards is just the best it involves a lot of strategy thinking ahead and there is a little rng and were talking about the core set only when the new expansion will be released it will really show the real potential thats all for me isenberg im a fan of card games in general but i also love learning about history and kards is the perfect mash up of two of my favorite things i play kards because its hearthstones evolution with an incredible historical setting the art is amazing kards is the best game jai jou avec toi hier et je suis perdu my nickname in the kards is bormych im a fan of strategic card games so i enjoy playing kards a lot i like playing kards because i used to be in the army3rha so i like to use a lot of artillery units in my deck i like playing kards because of the historical theme and its gameplay is hearthstone just much more refined episode content timestamps kards golden cards explained httpsyoutubewmnxriyjct47 game of the week lets play ranked matchup httpsyoutubewmnxriyjct651 my british

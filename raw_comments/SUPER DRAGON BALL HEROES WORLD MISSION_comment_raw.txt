huh so they ruined dragon ball ultimate x great the graphics look like budokai 3 xd which is cool basically its like dokkan battle on switch my brother got me this for christmas and today it was his birthday and he had a bad day because of something i dont know and i played this and it made me feel like my brother is still happy your video also makes me feel happy i just hope tomorrow my bro will be happy this makes me sad to think about because it was his birthday keep making the good work happy new years combo of pokemon and dbz if there was going to be a dragon ball xenoverse 3 who would want to have custom avatars on androids supreme kais and dark demon gods with the already known races saiyans humans namekians frieza race and majins leave a like if you want to see that one day lmao the game is worse than the promotions that spirit bomb looks like a giant snowball i played the arcade in japan long ago looks boring lol im not sure if he realised it was trunks special bit pricey for a card game cool though the lobby reminds me of the splatoon 2 lobby you kinda saved i from buying this i thought it would at least kinda be like xenoverse but it kinda looks lame honestly this game is so lame who is the villain that looks like silver from sonic at 0033hes the coolest lookin character ive seen since janembaomega shenron how come this game price is to high the way goku yells hiyah always made me chuckle his voice is high instead of a bit low 3ds graphics hahaha thats what it looks like pretty sad this game looks fuxking gay as fuc i came here to see the game play because i got the game notification to download it but im disappointed by the game its just stupidity so now im going to download xenoverse2 i was hoping to hear the actual dragonball heros theme song butbeggers cant be choosers i know this song herovoltsy which is most of your favorite pokemon dragonball mine is both this game is shit who wants to sign a petition so this people can stop making shit games like this seems cool but i dont see how the battles will be much different from one to another wouldnt this get repetitive quickly you can use different cardscharacters but its the same basic strategy for each battle creeperaw man omg 2019 and we have still do read all this fuckign shit while we are fighting why cant them just speak humankind is so braindamaged huh your eggvoltsy is playing something other than pokemon that game is cool its meet dragon ball shin budokai when dragonball meets my hero academia or seven deadly sins or one punch man or yugioh why in the hell they keep making dragon ball like a board game really fuck him kill him who made that fuck of dragonball how he can change a super game into a fucking yu gi oh mode 56 minutes of gameplay and it still has less adds then morgz 20 minute videos how do u record youtube vids on nintendo switch what a shity game games nice but not worth 80 has me thinking of yu gi oh also cheotic made me want to play dragon ball z collectable card game like if watching without socks is this actually better than jump force need fighter z grapic play in normal mode dont edit the video kodathesnake got me into this cause of his gameplay now im watching all the videos i need some help good job man so its yugioh in dbz form so this is a glorified mobile app game for the nintendo switch it would have been better if this game had more thought put into it 543 theirs no human race now thats must up this game is not worth 20 and its def not worth the 60 they are asking for it its worth 5 bucks top as a mobile port why the heck does trunks keep getting beat on vegeta is turning over in his grave gogeta vs vegito still waiting for this to actually be in the anime the 3ds games gave me such a leg up on this the game is a joke lol does it matter what race you use 5601 idve named him giru but youre the one playing the game so lets go the graphics in this game are a bit underwhelming but the gameplay feels nice right 4727 i see what you did here bandai so the card game from dragon ball xenoverse 2 got its own game its literally hereo colesum this game has the worst animation is everyone enjoying this game so far i am thinking about buying this tomorrow d download it for free at igg game is it possible to customize the appearance of your avatar the dialogue is sooooooo cheesy lol time to finally buy myself a switch also im really hoping it has froze been waiting ages for this series what took so long for db heroes to come out in the west honestly this game looks kinda trash so that is trunks the scouter is broken cause its over 29000 basically dragon ball xenoverse 2 hero colosseum looks lame i really like dbz but i dont like card games rather have a open world game that walks gokus path from db gt to db super why cant somebody make a yugioh game like this is the great saiyaman 3 here trunks himself at 5537 he looks like rotom so call him wing rotom how do you record switch gameplay o his name is giru thanks i wasnt sure if i want this game i like a battle system like xenoverse more but it looks really fun and there are so much cards to collect now im sure i will get this game soon i hope dragon ball fusion get steam version too enter the game sounds like sao to me interesting concept very very interesting concept does this play like the physical dragon ball card game i purchased the digital version and it said it includes the power pack anyone knows where to redeem them this is extreme fan service and i love it wasnt that trunks move got the game today i am buying the japanese version does this not have an english dub option i dont see any credit for funimation on this this game is going to be my top priority for the rest of spring when i get my hands on it 5546 should have

first one cool video first one first like too first one from sweden newest first plz cheek after some hours and say first who do you guys want to see next all ssj4s or all vegeta blues let me know below an if you enjoyed the video drop a like thanks is it weird that they dont change gokus hair when ui in this game im pist off they didnt change the hair can we get a full look at all the abilities of goku in the game like ultra instinct smash was one but what else is there what can xeno goku do 036 the gokus about to slap the hell out of universe 6 what is that song that starts on 612 whats the name of that outro song shit is fye why does ui goku sounds like he has no energy left to speak 5 ultra instinct gokus charging a spirit bomb someone getting their asscheeks spread 231 250 does 3000 damage broly all that just for a drop of blood i havent played yet but i swear to god if my first allies are tien krillin and yamcha im selling the game for making me work 312 final galic kamehameha i just realized they are the psp design but its still good the character models look like the ones from budokai 3 someone better equip yamcha with these attacks before i do i dont even play this but ok omg they actually recreated the scene where goku got mad cuz hidden tried to hurt his friends can somebody tell me if this game is worth it or not the models themselves suck i cant tell the difference between base and ui omen goku when looking far away this game needs improvements why tf i started shivering when he transformed fuck the game look like roblox so now goku can just punch reality co summon an ally hr mui goku is too op in this game lol damn vegeta did a final galick gun 313 and ultra instinct got crazy moves cant wait for a ui spirit bomb in the super series when it returns in a few months cause im sure we will since the new villian is a ex god of destruction and really op that takes away ssj powers or just any transformation i dont understand why they dont always leave that ultra instinct aura on 408 how do you get him 300 how do you get him 005 how do you get him heroes really loves ultra instinct look how much detail they put into it compared to any other thing in heroes we have a goku gt card who turns ssj3 but if you get a perfect for the sliding you get ssj4 i think a similar card with ultra instinct sign and when you get a perfect mui would be really awesome i want your outro looped like a billion times more hero or xnoverse 8 ultra instinct gokus give all there energy into one big ass mofo spirit bomb 2400 damage 158 where is that goku from when the only teammate you need is yourself 237 imagine if this happend agains jiren 207 a reffrence to the episode so going ultra instinct destroys your clothes and gives u bruises eh please somebody tell me wtf is going on if only they made a budakai 3 with these characters can you do xeno ssj4 gogeta and dark ssj4 time breaker broly what does caa mean 111 119 okay that was pretty awesome so much effort putting genkidama and god kamehameha on max only does 3000 damage like wtf is it even worth putting so much into those attacks if they do literally no damage at all or was that just type disadvantage that happend there 506 that multi ultra instinct gokus spirit bomb combination was sick even the grandpriest wouldnt stand such an attack lol why does the fighting animatio still looks ass do some online matches damn hit got it straight in his nuts lol what is this really ultra instinct goku lowkey overrated asf mui goku stomps any other anime character ever so epic i wish i had a switch notice that shi and then freakes out no fair i just have the demo 1341 shout out to the next year 3 ndukauba i have requests since u dont have all the cards could you start summon videos and you have the sealas cards dont you why dont u use the vegeta beyond blue 2243 who gunna tell him the good cards he getting are cards that came from the hero edition can you read harry potter books to us i played this game to much i already have ssj blue anyone remember god of destruction chiaotzu frieza fell into that owareda i want to see people play this a lot more so i can watch people play it cause i dont have it but im planning to get it save any tickets cos we are getting a update thatll add uvm 5 and also maybe uvm 34 aswell your supposed to put beat in the space it waste 2 energy to transform oh my ndukauba read the comments take off your the ring or the earring and then you can transform reeeeeee why do you gotta introduce everything in such a cringe way its like a 5 year old or one of the weird narrators exact same models of the old budokai series from 2004 with also new charactersbut with xenoverse file structure cause its for pc and switch rather than playstation low key super shenron needs a snickers yo kauba u know u have the ssjb evolution vegeta the one that can use gamma burst flash like so he can see this video gave me so much luck i pulled gogeta from a daily summon on legends gokus super attack was clean he decimated frieza resurrection x 2 if this nigga say nice and perfect one mo time it makes me cringe so much im surprised you didnt put evolution blue vegeta on the team he didnt put gogeta on his team heres tip use red 4 star vegito blue if u have it it does 30k90k dmg and its the one of the best card can anyone tell me what the experience you gain for the arcade is for by the way you can press the x button when youre looking at a gacha set to see all the cards you can get before you draw from it bro use evolution vegeta and ui goku and gohan in a same team wow dude ndukauba literally after i saw this video i did 2 multis got the ui goku u got and a secret rare one just wait till you get the transformable base mastered ultra instinct his super attack lit i wonder does kauba even check the comments section this is how you know he aint read the comments people have been warning him for a hot minute youre able to put things like gal gun and kamehameha on beat but nothing else can u put your face cam when u play sdbh the next time tfw you get a bruh moment for pulling dyspo but overlooking the super saiyan blue evolution vegeta with final gamma burst blast smh hope he realizes that he pulled evolution blue vegeta now try to find these guys masked saiyan dark broly ssj4 dark masked king masked vegeta xeno bardock ssj3 masked grand priest ssj4 vegito if only this dude read his comments hes totally screwing up beat lol guys i have a trick to get dragon balls easily in this game first into custom missions and go to the world wide missions that other people made and if the name of the missions name says farm it has a dragon ball in it not only that but its relatable so you can grind dragon balls as much as you want i hope this helps that vegeta you pulled is the one you were looking for he does gamma burst flash put him on team with the ui goku that is a amazing team got the game the other day an that charge impact bar makes me hesitate forever and i never manage to press it until last second cause i have to dark shenron has a amazing design all of the videos you make are super crispy wait isnt this video pre recorded 1120 how do shop work simple you hop in and buy stuff and then you leave wait until he gets the goku beserk card then souls be snatched hey guys got a question im playing on the switch and im having trouble with the fps especially in pvp i have the feeling its 30 instead of 60fps anyone else has this problem you got the ssbe vegeta that has gamma burst flash put vegeta ssbe on your team he is very good please see i knew set 1 would work there is another ultra instinct goku which has 8500 power and starts of mastered ultra instinct i have that card and the ultra instincr sign goku too d he finally noticed the only problem is he didnt realize it was battle cry i think the graphic of game is really bad i will not say nothing if is on mobile but not its on fucking nintendo swich who is price over 300 thats huge for that trash games you can buy build pc and run every game i got the same mui goku today too tho i was hoping for fu im also trying to get beserk dark goku gine and grand priest you need take off the lock mode how long is the story and can you new game plus dude you are so lucky whit ultra instinct goku broooo stop talking and go right to subject man you talk to much but i am not rasist or hater i just say my oppinion best dragon ball gaming content on youtube change beats ability was this man about to say s i dont think he realized how many ticket pieces he got from those multis lol that ssbe vegeta and mui goku work together in combined ult attack though you need base adult gohan and 10 energy to do it you got blue evolution vegeta brooooooooo you missed him i recommend you put him on your team i remember that video where you and kaggy kept saying jr half of the coments i am seeing are people saying you messed up beats stats and i cant disagree lul that vegeta you took is ssjb evolution he is very good i recommend you put on your team goku super attack is clean especially with that owarida you need hero energy to transform beat that vegta u pulled has gamma burst flash ndukab you said shit in the video during ultra instinct takeoffthelock onability from beat bruh how could u not put gogeta boi looking ready to destroy what about blue evolution vegeta tho u dont need to go up to super class take of the potara ndukauba it only has to be items on beat to stop the transformation otherwise right now since beat has no items on him he should transform you have to take off his lock on to make him go ssj kauba you have to make a custom card there extremely good also yes you can get ui gokus moves but only on god boss missions with super attacks as the rewards best way to get them is to find a god boss mission on custom missions better way of getting them is by farming ndukauba i have a theroy when u get the triple mode and when u pick your units try to have all 3 units the same type it should have different animations and buffs reason you didnt transform is because you have battle cry equipped the camera is good for arcade mode to capture them super shenron said he tired of us ningens thats why he angry when you have a bunch of accessories but dont use them to power up your team legit those moves of kabra crack me up the names of the elite and berserk heros are erito and basaku you took the items off goku not beat aye i think your messed up your stats for beat because your supposed to max out before u class up ans it gets copyrithed from the god kamehameha now beat lookin crispy crispy the reason you cannot go ssj is you most likely have a potara equipped everything else is fine to equip but potaras replace transformation abilities which goku vegeta are from the official time line in heroesalso why does this game remind me of db fusions xd 2 views 10 likes 5 comments great youtube damn love your vids cant wait for live stream first one on i dare you to react to cbr dragon ball z vids hi im the first one this game is good i wish this game was on the ps4 hope theyll release it on the ps4 in the near future on ps store think they got napa from team four star man this game only released only in japan is it me or is this like db xenoverse 2 in the hero colosseum havent seen any comments saying this but the xenoverse 2 figure battle is the hero colosseum is that yugi db version damn it release this on xbox and ps4 pleaaaase bandai ive been playing this for years on the japanese arcade machines can someone invite me to the discord its invalid wish you would have continued like a playthrough should i buy it it looks fun but 60 is kinda crazy every time he

english version and not dfree great stuff truth you make me wanna play this game hmm this game is a little too hands on the advantage of dokkan is that its basically a tactics game you can play at your own pace this looks like its a twitch based timer demanding your attention which isnt useful for a mobile device ya know im tempted to buy the game just cause of this sexy nappa keep uploading more of this stuff id be down to see more sdbh vids so truth didnt pre order o those graphics are horrible though you can make a drinking game of this video every time this dude said and stuff like that sarcastic voice were not going to pick a human or a namekian fucks wrong with namekians lol so basically this is the battle simulator from xenoverse 2 when you dont buy a switch for smash ultimate but you buy a switch for a dragon ball game face cam for lets plays gamecube graphics please more super dragon ball heros the game is cool but design of the characters looks like shit rip to his wallet it was already suffering from dokkan now this is there anyway to get the game without spending 200 freaking dollars please tell me if so and howlink so is heroes coming to dokkan global or what this is irritating me lol this new mod for dokkan battle looks nice i would loveeeee if this a daily series i can not believe people are paying for this i think in eshop you can get the 11 card

i dont like the dokkan content but itll help truth spread out his dokkan content quick questions since i heard ingame music i plan on recording borderlands 3 but do you think it would get copyrighted

great saiyaman 3 2942 did you really just pronounce machine like that this game is sick im so glad i finally get to play it also im enjoying watching you play yo dragon ball heroes is one of my favorite dragon ball series im not paying 60 for a game that plays by itself why jiren trynna fight uim he knows damn well he would get his butt whooped what console is it on seriously 311 i can hear the yoshaaaaa from here this game is too freaking amazing 100 am buying a switch next cant wait to play it myself i thought sayaman 3 was a robot its a whole new world we live in make all these

kamehameha 304 i like the music is base caulifla and kale in this game caulifla and kefla are baes i was about to say until i saw part one you know how many characters are in this game gurl i didnt know 21 was in this game hol up yo what is that outro holy shit 219 masked broly dope come to dokkan i had my jiren turn into ssgss with a transformation orb so maybe thats just part of gameplay so this is going to be a mobile game bro kefla though what did they do to her what the actual fuck has cell jr turned to these graphics hurt my eyes wish dokkans combat looked like this let me guess goten is gonna turn into goku black to me this is basically budokai 4 and i love it whats the outro song called this isnt the one for the switch is it 546 wrong year those graphics 2010 ugh just a few more days so many games so little money frieza with a sword who woulda thought you already know im doing the demon realm team im so hyped ultimate mission x was awesome and now this this game looks awful 242 geekdom101 breathing heavily frieza with light saber give me ubb absorbs gotenks and becomes super buu gotenks absorbed what dimps forget this digital cardass foolishness and give us budokai 4 already in case anyone is wondering yes you can customize your characters to have different special attacks or transformations i was just as freaked out when i put a special potara item on my kid goku which made him transform into frost on the second turn it is very fucked up but can happen if you dont know how to use all of the many accessories in the game didnt help that i cant read japanese in ultimate mission x for the 3ds one time my yamcha used god final flash this looks like fucking shit lol i wonder how this will work on pc most of gameplay its touch like how can we suppose to do is there any way to unlock nico in the game httpsdragonballfandomcomwikinico all these good characters wasted are these things frmo the character creation thingie when will this game come out this one of those games you see your kids playing and you asked could you try and your kids look at you like because you dont have half of a clue of wtf is going on so many moving parts and shit hi i was able to buy super dragonball heroes world mission yesterday and a youtube channel specializing in sdbh wm has come up with a lot httpsmyoutubecomwatchvvv79cejwcvet272s the game is great but due to lack of time i was only able to play it for one day lol this game has budokai 2 level of graphics who ever buy this u just wasted your time toppo just fucking dies to ss4 broly lol im ready to pre order this game on nintendo switch eshop but i still dont see it yet on nintendo switch eshop does anyone know when this game will appear on nintendo switch eshop how does this game work someone please explain is majin android 21 a character 408 412 why ubb absorbs something and turns into buu gotenks 417 420 why pan transform into kale berserk im wondering how the real life cards will be used as seen in the gameplay im looking forward to this already preordered to get the extra dlc and bonus stuff when does this game drop so excited to give my life to im beyond ready for this game to drop 415 whata fuck check out next sdbh series releasing next year httpsyoutubegad26mq4f8 wtf belmod his voice at 545 not normal sound like a bitch i found a video from another channel identical to yours i think he stole it from you the link httpsyoutubenu3lmbv1ke my team my avatar ssj blue liquiir gyn iwan quitela bs arack and goku mui summoner my favourite character liquiir is really strong like in anime i cant even believe arak justflicks his opponent in the face its honestly awesome how this game put any other characters in the dragon ball its really awesome and new ones too this game is crap casually hurls 6 planet at a planet and not blowing that planet with the other planet soooo much confusion is this ps4 these attacks dont make senseread the manga goddamnit where is yamcha the only god with majuscule is jesus christ they should add a dbz god of destruction dlc pack for xenoverse im guessing in heles universe gensokyo exist cause them bullets look oddly familiar why do the voices sound so weird even if this game is canon these gods cant beat thanos if i were in a game i take em down but not to be a god but be the toughest fighter in the universe if i were in a game i take em down but not to be a god but be the toughest fighter in the universe the second one use touhou bullets 210 and i didnt even need a silly infinity gauntlet to do it there is one god and is allah i invite you all to islam the only true religion liquier sama its the best wonder if toyotaro will ever reveal the other 6 gods of destruction tacos are good trash ive been seeing alot of people asking on videos like these if this stuff is canon to put it simple in america no in japan yes and xenoverse 2 cant give us the rest of these guys in a dlc because i wonder if the anime maybe the manga as well will show these attacks itd be nice to have the goda actually fight a demon realm arc showing off god level demonsnow that would be something id watch one cheat please how o can get liquiir card guaranteed gambit the strongest hakaishin awesome models in this gamebeautiful colors perfect hakaishins all damage numbers are the angels for each god of destruction in the game either as regular cards or custom cards that you have to get the stickers for can you do a compilation of ultimate units nobody have done that yet liquir is the god of destruction awesome and my favorite character from the dragon ball universe as i wanted to play with it but without the nintendo switch i can not neither my pc works much lack of consideration they do not launch to the 3ds version this has some bit of lore whats the first clip in the outro when we will see the body change attack i saw it as a skill name of song for outro hurl a planet uhhhh when did they do that if you love dragon ball and card games then play dragon ball dokkan battle its amazing sounds like it may have potential but i dont think its for me when i play dragonball z games i expect straight up fighting games as a fan of dbz i love the characters and the xenoverse story not interested i rather take that 60 and spend it on the dlcs for dragon ball fighterz really like the what if stuff for db anyway i like the game alot and you can farm exp on simple custom elvels make your custom cards and so on but sometimes even tho i read the effects of each card i simply do not understand what is going on as usualy a ton of buff and debuff effects go on xd like the leader and teamate scenario and such or the chase scenario from the suprmeme kai not sure but i kinda wish it was packs that you opened instead of a gacha but it is fine as well i do feel like the promo gacha is the best to fully collect as it seems to have waaaaaay better stuff then most of the collection also it is really shitty that the extra music is dlc just like in xenoverse 2 as you can costumise your the songs you want to have all in all it is really addicting 7510 for me if the price was lower then it would have been an 8 or a 9 for me the animation is so bad its like 2 generations in past i just cannot find the appeal of this game coming from a card game lover and lover of dbzsuper i just think this game is trash take out the meters and add more depths of cards and a less lame animation style and maybe id give it another shot god im glad i bought this game dude name ashley im not sure i could trust you well this is a pass weak and pathetic vegeta goes ssj3 in the saiyan saga level i was like hold on now this game is fire people try this game is addictive asf i dont like the anime idea of heroes but for its own game and card stuff i love it i know its not a z game but at least it has your cool characters and idk its just addicting a lot of combos qtes in a strategy game seems weird to me kinda stops me from buying the game right now its a card game and an arcade game before being a dragon ball game its not a fighting game like fighter z or something if you dont like strategy games or card games you wont like this game if you like strategy games card games and like dragon ball a whole lot youll most likely like this game the game is god tier anyone who doesnt like it is just either retarded or bad at the game dont talk trash if you have not played the game its actually really fun can you change your class and super in offline mode this looks so annoying ashley im sorry you had to play this im also sorry to anyone who actually likes this game but it just irks all my game sensibilities ill stay with fighterz epic did not swoop in swipe this up in their store must be dreaming this game is 100 worth 60 bucks it has over 200hours worth of content and will be constantly updated with the anime if you like dragon ball at all you will enjoy this game your name is ashley isnt that a girls name that intro was pretty dark and scary man like youre about to five up on life almost i love this game thank god i player the japonese version so i could understand better that intro was amazing i love it 1010 can anyone spot the a hat in time reference i dropped in the video bruh i bought this thinking it was like legendary suoerbsaiyan warrior lbut honestly i have no idea what in doing i guess fgo arcade will come in two years time too id rather play dragon ball fighterz which is already on my steam wish list the tutorial is faster then you could say frieza i have no idea what is going on but it looks amazing maybe this should be yu gi oh game 2019 wasnt good start for anime games get bored easily dear mojoplays you surprise me with this intro what the f this 211 goku and his square mouth what does br stands for where are the new missions probably should of gave big bang attack to god vegeta and galick gun to blur vegeta can you show the summonstransformations like great ape broly great ape gogeta etc do you know if were gonna get a super saiyan broly card from the movie at some point 214 oh so thats where gogeta got that craziness from where are broly super saiyan and super saiyan full power and gogeta of db super normal and super saiyan 1 what the title of the outro song that you used fuck yeah come watch us smack open dbs cards galick hoe which is better the ssb gogeta or the ssj4 gogeta bruh whats the outro called how to download the updatethe dlc did somebody noticed the goku ssb from the broly movie has a different face than the normal goku ssb look from minute 207 why cant we just have budokai 4 still waiting for ssj4 xeno vegito probably in the next free update i wish dimps would go ahead and use this engine and make a budokai 4 why they gave ssg vegeta galick gun tho maybe i missed it but is super saiyan broly not in this i see his base form in the video but his transformation wasnt shown in the video why theres no sound effect during the new action card of broly characters i mean when broly and the enemy start a melee combat what the hell is this hope this will be fixed where the ultimate attacks at dragon ball has the best powers nasty breath xd where do i go for the new missions hopefully we get another update soon and maybe theyll acually give us all the cards from uvm 345678 and not halfass it and only give us like half of the cards fromthe sets im just glad they made gine a fighter instead of support and ssjg vegeta in the game big bang kamehameha shouldve been in the movie what is the name of your song from the endings of your video 603 i wonder when they will launch the rest of the universe missions packs and yes saiyans were hurt to make this video 1 like on this video 1 more safe saiyan first tra what happened what what have you wouldve use a new dragon ball the drywall gaston for a new powers if im not in an argument could become different but how many did you do that anyway hes new jersey but the driver knew which as you know you knew which is you know how do you get the shadow dragon attacks is the number of stars in a dragonball important do i need to get all of them can anyone please confirm for me that the shenron medals works only vs cpu offline and not online matches i only have 2 so far and i was thinking of grinding some if it will help for pvp online if i chose change my avatar will i lose all the current promotions why those dragon balls in the thumbnail look like banana slices im hungry how do i put my final explosion on i was a saiyan race for example i change my races to frieza races if i switch back to the saiyan races again will the class and the level be saved i think it is slightly unimmersive that you cant wish for something that would make sence like immortality or infinite zeni or infinite shenron medals or just wish all evil in existance away can you make a team building guide for heroes please equipment guides dfree really relying on you lol whats the transformation for all the races you should also try to get legendary completion so you can more rewards and exp saibaman fight was a god boss fight so u can farm god items jaco is a typical super boss dragon balls farm promoting class sets u to level 1 with an avarage out of ur stats before promoting so the higher level u are better stats u get its good to open all module slots and make urself a set with exp on final round and camaraderie multipliers on round 4 for example because the bonuses apply anyway and rarely u will get to round 4 of fr its a fast way to farm those while farming dragon balls the higher the score after battle the more exp u get so its good to build your team for max hp because u get bonus score for hp left after battle when u farm and go for ultimate and legendary wins with good setup u can get around 700 800 exp per run thats what im capable of right now if you are looking for farming missions its good to check rankings in custom mode the farming missions mostly has a lot of scores team building guide plz im kinda mad that it didnt keep my god class on my avatar when i changed my avatar to the female version i wasted my time farming my dragon balls 5 times to get there anyone onow when yoy can get the custom ssj thing for creating a card it was in the japanese demo as a accessory but i havent seen it yet since release would love to see some deck building videos if thats a thing in this game because im still just putting random cool high tier characters in my deck a please make more i got the hero edition and redeem my code but didnt get any of the 11 dlc cards bro how to make a good team in super dragon ball heroes like yours pls make video how to build a team thanks for the great video much appreciated i dont think level matters for class up the stats come from camaraderie this is a good video i had some questions 1 for shenron medal once you hit 250 is it permanent or do you have to use the 250 medals and farm them all over again 2 what is the max level in here i want to do that before promoting to super class 3 what happened to your upgrade to super saiyan option is it because your avatar is not a saiyan note from my expeirence i have done 4 battle module rewards it is random no choice so far im 4 for 4 on only getting capture modules camera icon i stopped after the 4th one because im not a fan of the camera module you want to wait till your character gets to level 99 every time before you class up more heroes been enjoying all the videos man keep it up the main thing about promoting your class is that when you level up max 99 you level up and unlock new race abilities as well as leveling up existing race abilities its highly speculated whether it applies extra stats or not but all signs point to no its just to unlock the abilities with less grinding theres different effects and transformations for each class female saiyan base hero class can wish for a new ability to unlock ssj1 super class new outfit higher stats can wish for a new ability to unlock ssj2 ultimate class new outfit higher stats can wish for a new ability to unlock ssj3 god class new outfit higher stats lose access to super saiyan 1 2 and 3 permanent super saiyan god red form gain an ultimate attack like dragon fist ex super god class new outfit higher stats gain a bunch of new abilities permanent super saiyan god super saiyan blue form sidenote female saiyan berserker ultimate class has an awesome full i grinded jaco specifically to get all my module slots i dont want to get a good one and have to discard it what is he using to play the game i already made a wish i watched this just because dfree is the best 1 good thing about this game i no longer have to travel back to japan to play sdbh 1 bad thing i cant use my absolutely stacked deck been having a lot of with with heroes lately first if only budokai 4 would come out and have as many characters as this reminds me of budokai 3 with the cell shaded graphics this is nostalgic for me 809 is that you jiren when i get a nintendo switch this is the game i am getting oof dickalitiy to goku black at 0021 255 kamen rider called they want their finisher back what the music 0000 i honestly wanna know if maybe these models can be ripped and put it in the budokai games i mean these seemed to be based off it it to heroes why is ultra instinct sign using the move goku used in the super 13 movie what is that dope ending theme to me this looks like a 2000s game but still i just wish that the game had a little bit better sound effects it really just sounded like the resident evil 2 games and just had a little better graphics i also wish the game had a little better graphics instead of just looking like it was made 2009 you guys can hate on me but these are just my things i dont like about the game and are in my opinion i hope you all can understand 149 as a fate fan i was sad that vegetto didnt say spirit excalibur poor goku black was turned into a punching bag whats your outro 3 rare tickets n 2 min hope it helps farm farm farm d httpsyoutubebqaugrxtnvg hoping one day budokai tenkaichi 4 gets announced with every character from everything dragonball herossuper etc id throw so much money at that how come goku black on goku destruction looked like he was so happy to die im glad the super manga is referenced in this game im pretty sure this is the first and only time goku hakai goku black being that ass that he is survive damn no way it looks like the budokai games the attacks look simalir just updated characters im listening a little too hard but those are definitely sound effects from the dbzbt series very cool nothing makes me more hype than dragon ball black kamehameha turns blue thaaaaats so disappointing hakai is trash in this game better make it one shor ability but after it u gonna take x2 dmg and cant attack for 5 turns and unusable if only 1 enemy left 810 cool guys do not look for explosions whats the name of ur outro its bruh who made this budokai mod dimps get this man on your team ffs yoooo whats the name of your outro song they should make this game play like budokai excuse my spelling dat budokai music though this is literally budokai 3 they are not everithing love the song you used brings back memories 043 its just me or goku blacks hair style is alike a super saiyajin 2s hair style what card name and set is that goku which does the hakai in game of pc 425 evil blow looks like neros buster arms wait where is part one why does goku black look and sound like hes getting off while being hakaid i really want to know that outro song why the outro sound like shinys intro ps360hd2 make good content but sometimes i just click on his video to see his outro lmaoo so are the graphics done like this on purpose whats the song name at the end there is gokus hakai and vegetas gamma burst flash why not ss12 goku black and manga fused zamas whats up with the graphics cant wait to give videl the hakai 801 allmight i love seeing some manga exclusive stuff did god buu turned into gilgamesh oo i love the insanity of the whole db heroes universe nothing special uh hu uh hu bam golden cooler if the game adds more cards it would be through free updates or dlc reminds me of bodikia did mira just do a fucking rider kick 830 i dont have this game but can your custom character have this move seeing budokai character models made me miss the old games not gonna lie i used to think dbh was just toriyamas fan fiction heaven for the fans with ridiculous characters but you gotta admit this shit is cool outside the anime and manga the gods attacks go all out im astonishied those finisher are dirty why cant ps4 get this i want another 2d dragon ball game please sooo anyone want to tell me how to get hakai goku in this game or if it is a custom attack can anyone tell me how to find it why does ssj4 gokus kamehameha times ten look purple instead of either red or blue fucking ssjg goku got a more red kamehameha and in that form goku literally didnt do anything impressive technique wise cumber straight up pulled a iori yagami super now i really like this saiyan you didnt show the super animated attacks like blue goku and vegeta combined attcak which destroys a galaxy i honestly love this animation 830 thru 842 148 origin of vegitos level 1 super in fighterz i think i herd jjanemba said gebay gibby from icarly xdd 234 can you please add the super attacks of demon goddess towa and demon god salsa next do a compilation of ultimate units 718 manga reference 640 is that a super sayian nappa base form kale is so cute she is scared to attack 808 chills fuck legends we deserved this on mobile what goku is the hakai goku what goku could do the haki i wanna get him on my team anyone know the music used in the video where is the body change i saw it as a skill point blank galick gun lol not flashy but im feeling it am i the only one that wishes for another budokai game after looking at the graphics so glad goku black and zamasu are the test dummies will be confirmed in the future of dragon ball super goku blue will use hakai xenoverse 3 should defintely get some inspiration from sdbh in terms of ultimates but also characters introduction like more xenotime breaker and villains pls tell me which blue goku card has that haki move i hate how they made goku forget he can use the hakai why he didnt use it againts moro its like a filler in the manga why cant xenoverse have such nice things goku has destruction in the game my aim is trash today i died against sealas so many times and it took me 4 days to beat him what should i do to change my frieza standart form to an elite form note and froze are both lv 15 and after i got lv 15 i changed my avatar to later hoping to play as elite frieza but i have no idea how i csn find the button to change the forms please help me i wished for the ability to transform into a super saiyan and my avatar is at the ultimate class already am i doing something wrong because nothing online has helped me at all super shenron taught beat how to make his back tingly you when you try to get to college and your a smart kid but you get too confident 313 when my character turns super saiyan his hair style stays the same but yellow is this a glitch fixable wait when beat gets a new form can he go back to his old forms like if i have him in super saiyan 3 can he go back to ssj2 or 1 i think the audio is desynced can some ine give me the code i know how to get ui goku you go to the shop to normal summon set 1 my character is stuck with the supersaiya man 4 costume youll get beat by beat cause hell beat your ass came up with that in 12 seconds but i think you need class up to get ssj2 gohan i need an adult vegeta i am an adult vegeta kicks in the gut im honestly downloading this now ima pick the demon d why arent you using a face cam for this but you use it for other games should u lvl beat all the way before ranking him up so he gets the most stat boosts watching this while my copy is getting delayed in the post is depressing but your jokes help me forget lol is it just me it did the sound de sync towards the end of the video hmmmmm super shenron from the super dragon balls unheard of i just got finished watching your last video nice video kauba but that audio is out of sync at 2827 a youtuber called crazymitch uploaded a video on how to get dragon balls quickly so you can get super saiyan blue beat quicker try summoning for ssj4 bardock wait how do i get golden fries race form apparently super dragon balls dont make super shenron everybody dont take this to heart guys ndukauba dont forget to use the exchange shop the game handed me evo vegeta off the break and i just did a bunch of spins and pulled the 100 ui goku whos a god damn beast but i was wondering how to get ssj so ty you berter equip ss to beat like to who have the nappa scouter in dragon ball legends whole time ndukaba can be a voice acting your ingame audio desynched near the end although your voice seemed to be okay any idea what happened finds all 7 super dragon balls is surprised to find out it was super shenron ndukauba is the type of guy to walk into a bar and order a milk bro i got ultra instinct goku my dream came true so a realtalk tip to people who are going to play dont bother with the super saiyan wish when you promote yourself to super god class youll permanently be super saiyan blue without needing to transform just wish for class ups and module slots shenron is a pokemon graphic like ps2 game 207 extra damage never hurts we humans make logic but we never use it feel like im lucky as hell got ur ss4 gogeta and ur ss4 broly in the same multi and it was a normal multi i just unlocked super saiyan so its strange this video came out right when i got it unlocked ughhh can u go back to legends dang bro you really out here making beat transform so soon dont you know that makes him weaker if done before level 50 yo my man dont forget to go into sets 19 when u summon youll be able to get that vegito blue u had in x and plus some others have the dark dragon ball broly and janemba grand preist super kaioken xeno vegito berserk goku etc does anyone here who plays legends think that shallot needs another transformation like ssj2 or 3 super saiyan blue or super saiyan god or a new super saiyan that once existed but over time the saiyans that had that blood lost the ability to go that form bit since shallot is from any older era he has tje blood and so does giblet and that is what they were talking about when they said they need each other to get stronger it would be cool for shallot to be able to get a super saiyan that noone else can i have the ssj transformation unlocked but i changed my hero class saiyan to a berserker type and my ssj ability wont stay someone help the sound is way off i mean of course fused zamasu would sound bored hes fighting king cold xd can you upload twice today please the anticipation for his pulls is real anyone else notice that the audio at the end desynced my copy is coming in tomorrow ndukauba can you find a way to fight kaggy in this game or dragon ball legends evil sayian is top tier on sdbh nobody wants to hear you read 5 hours of dialogue ndukaba the super dragon balls are reacting also ndukaba oh its super shenron i did not know there is some sound lag with the video i have to say im a newer subscriber than others and this is the first db heroes playthrough i saw but it is you are the perfect youtuber and you dont even need to absorb any androids happily with the question i think youre playing a game switch nintendo console but i do think about this idea what you think about this idea ive been google i view my id my fishing and couldnt think about this idea i see you dont believe youll do your feelings mobile game car game opening stuff like that thats would be two very cool yeah that would be cool i think i know what youre thinking but that would be very cool to have im going to slaughter youtube everything what happened what time in the morning what time in the month is going to be released yeah i really think a lot of beautiful swans a game to be released in color scheme okay thank you again i just want to say thats kind idea is the demon race character named after sean schemmel sorry if i misspelled his last name also putting this out there xeno team is were its at the grind is to real im at super saiyan 2 ability and super class had the game came out i pulled a sec fu that is insane he gives a 20000 power boost to two allies at the end of each round i think hes from sdbh 6 i got the ui goku so good luck getting him yo so the audio kinda like is not matching with the video suprised no one said that the audio desyncronized near the end your are the chosen one kauba literally pulled the ui goku form set one of uvm if only it was set 2 still hyped tho i love these sdbh videos i binge watch them atm wishing about getting a switch how do u turn super sayian 2 i just got done with the video lol hey kauba i found out that you can get golden cooler you just need to do set 2 of super dragon ball heroes world mission ndukuba do you think there will be a dragon ball fusions 2 apparently idk if it happens to the main player but at lv 15 i saw two of my allies level up in class can any earthlings or saiyans like tora or turles or raditz learn super saiyan do you ever feel as if they will include dbz heroes characters in dbz legendsie beatnotefroze etc if so that would be totally awesome manlove your dbz legends content btw uvm set 2 is the best set can i friend u in dragon ball legends but youll have to give me ur friend code where is dragon ball legends and why do you do a double upload to this game and not dragon ball legends im not gonna watch ndukauba only until he makes legends content unlocking super saiyan ha thats cute im already golden supergodclass first bro im loving your contentkeep it up and shout to ssj beatbtw i love dbz heroes despite not playing it and my favourite dbz character is of course beat lets go the legend of the super saiyan has begun lets go been waiting this series is awesome hey ndakuba my account got restarted for no reason and i had to leave db legends yo i saw the title and im like yo im almost at the next level my g great video bro your skills are to good for this game 6th comment that dragon i dont even want to power up past red blue is silly but red looks cool too bad i cant get an ability to transform to red during the match its half the fun your allies promote to higher classes at levels 15 30 50 and 75 so yeah it takes an awfully long time to get them to super god class b e a t can i summon super shenron in demo put galick gun back on beat and change note super attack you do know you can get new super moves for beat using the super dragon balls right ndukauba they is a goku mui will silver dragon flash anything thing special for a kai avatar how did u get the ssb should i wait to level 99 to go to super class or should i just go 3115 superme kai of time was the world and goku was dio and together they do a za warudomuda muda muda muda muda damnit i wish they added or fixed the auras on pc it doesnt look right without it you know what they say 910 equals twentyoneeeeee and i also think im going to stay a god read for a little while im moving too fast for the gaming and i need to appreciate a form that we rarely see im literally god red and it only took me 3 days to get it thats because i wasnt trying but on the last day i wanted to try and it took me 20 minutes cuz i had to get the class up and then i had to get the class up again anyone else had difficulties with the training with goku level they have a habit of staying at max power often breaking 15k to 20k and also making your ci speed to fast for human reactions your cutting into my earrings kid lmao earrings ui beat i think you need to get note to level 30 so she can go up in form he needs a more balanced team beat im blue dabadidabadie dabadidabadie ndukauba please address the problem with pvp in a vid of urs more big tubers like u need to speak up wait that ultra instinct gokus supet was from the anime 1005 he had faith and prevailed 1222 looks nice but i wont spend 5999 on it you need to keep berserk goku in the team because of his ex dragon fist attact it done a 20 thousand damage alone am i the only one screaming because him not putting in ssj4 gogeta no hate red hair looks better hope you can change beats super attack soon i wish the tail changed heroes need to add shallotzahhagiblet to the game so when are you going to go back and go into those purple portal things it leads to extra story and it really gets crazy sometimes do you know you can also change the super attacks for your allies like note and the others if you want to use the camera module you have to play in arcade mode and use it to capture the enemy you choose the stronger the enemy the harder to capture after you capture the enemy you can use the enemy your capture to be an ally at only the round he was summond at and after the round ends it disappears yooo ui goku super attack animation is the best dude if you use deck 1 with this beat you have 2 god kamhama right try using items yo is my character not supposed to look different when i promote my class pls switch xenon goku with ssj4 gogeta yes you got an new move when he transformed use froze for some battles we want to see his decks maybe you can even do some network battles 536 after i separate your jaw from your skull a pretty gruesome thing to say to a kid tbh if you think about it you can teach him ultra instict move i have yet to buy the game on steam but just from seeing what ive seen i find the game more enjoyable to watch than xenoverse 2 by far the cyclopian guard should be with metal cooler note and froze get their next class up at level 30 that moment when you realize mercenary tao is stronger than sealas cell x golden frieza and dabura that ui goku just wants to punch the living oof out of everyone as soon as you said clearly see my junk went to 144p bro the ending tho curious here is there a way to level up the other members of the heroes u have high bond with note and froze but not the others so i cant tell if you can swap them out or not so uh beats super move when is that gonna change can the video be longer ndukauba if u go to custom mode on creation mode and go to ranking u can literally lvl up beat faster and also get tera items from it too jus giving u a heads up my boi o and u also get gacha tickets too am i the only one who just enjoys the way this man says smack lol yo ndukauba has some real life dialogue problems xd i lost count on how many times he was like power arrgghhh go get em beat begone smack readyfight they should make beat black this game is on nintendo correct a couple videos ago ndkuba im just better when the ci speed is faster also ndkuba of course they would raise our ci speed me wouldnt that help you my best down team is goku berserk vegeta blue s unit version trunks future rage xeno ss4 goku potara and xeno vegeta ss4 with gine you do know if you upgrade you avatar at lvl 99 at every promotion some of you strength carrys over so if you want the the best avatar do that beat him up and dont hold back youre just going to have to find some way we can actually see kanbacumbers super attack if anyone wants to know when note and everyone else levels up to the next level its 30 and then maybe 40 idk im planning on making my secondary avatar my main temporarily until i get some good modules and then delete my main avatar and replace with a kai for the stats lvl it up some and replace it with dark demon god elite since my stats are low due to picking the android and quickly classing it up bro finally beat is up there super saiyan blueeeeeeeeeeee beat oh ya how many times would i need to collect the dragon balls to get that class ss4 team ndukauba super class note to sayain god it will be so cool and awesome love it i need that ssj4 bardock which set does that come from its not super saiyan blue its super saiyan god super saiyan player hero energy and stamina breathes enemy im about to ruin this guys career its actually pronounce super saiyan god super saiyan can beat learn kiokenx20 is going to talk about jojo then you should play eyes of heaven next video try to summon for ssj4 gogeta xeno if you dont have him here is amazing because if he is the lone attacker he will get 10000 power and attacks 3 times you can try linking him with someone who gives him his super and you can how do i say this oh yeah snatch all the souls my only disappointment with dragon ball heroes is that they could easily add in super saiyan pan and yet they didnt by 2nd round beat and cumber legit just be chilling in the background my man pulled a fast one the elites be like enemy having health never heard of that you will see it in your eyes i like your videos have you ever try using the other oc characters i like your videos have you ever try using the other oc characters i see that beat has a gokus dna blood line biggest lie ndk will tell i need to change beats super move tell me kauba how are you a god and how did you get 7 super dragon ball battles in 2 hours early ultimate is level 30 for note i finally got gogeta after 2 weeks i finally got him just as you uploaded i got him ndukauba its taking forever for my allies to level up in class or maybe you broke the game by rushing to super saiyan blue before you were supposed to for absolutely no reason im guessing for the other avatars their maximum level has to be 50 or so i feel you bruh this game be giving the cpu the charge impact what level should i rank up avatar i really dont wanna grind to 99 each time i feel that despair to dude god status has been achieved it is time im still wondering why you still have energy wave with beat no views and 8 comments youtube is drunk again notification squad here to see your amazing video i stopped watching ndukaubas first sdbh world mission livestream on twitch just to see this so early its in 360p who remembers dragon ball fusions i wont some dragon ball legants o my god you gather the dragon balls quick will u stream today can u look at my comment on last video about the counter to blue gogeta in dragon ball legends green super trunks on a future teamhe does decent damage to gogeta wassup first first first cool how can u get ssj4 xeno gogeta in super dragon ball heroes world mission and here i was just using cards i liked cause just because of who the characters are thinking if i try hard enough to get perfect on ci literally fail almost all of them replace trunks with android 16 fighterz version um2fcp5 and replace gogeta with putine sh257 your welcome so when a card says pwr that means damage and when it says pwr lvl that means speed ive discovered one of the most op one man army team and i had to come back to this vid to tell you and its a 1 star hercule and i know it sounds silly but hes pretty much god tnx now i know gine can be use with gogeta i use feint ability 50 enemy team power ability eternal fusion warrior5000 team power while in support equipped to some other heroes and whis with sideline support link 3x super attack gets the job done round 1 unless in super god boss where computer always gets perfect charge impact lol thanks for this just imagine if jiren does that 3 times in one movie his beserker card does 3x damage its pronounced kamayhamayha thx for da info it wodo help of you told us what pakc yoyu get gine in so we know whe to look i dont have the gine card and i hve the ss4 gogeta card the some oen you do but he cant attak 3 times lieky uo said he aigna way is that which is better for this deck gine or grand preist most of the teams found online use that gogeta and support link strat guard first round and go all out 2nd round mainly a matter of who goes first and whos better at ci lol the blue vegeta with the ability to power level by 1500 for each attacker helps a lot and i like the gamma burst flash vegeta too the one with 5000 own power for every 5000 of own team if you slow it down to 25 you can see whatever cheat he is using to get perfect ci everytime i have two units with sideline support coudl yo make any xeno team build d i like them a lot if your playing online rank with this deck dont suspect to win everyone in rank is running cellxeno which stops 1 round teams like these he makes any damage done round 1 only hit for 1000 then theyll just counter one shot you next round this is only good for pve slo there was a sdbhwm online battle featuring a team with ui goku vegeta ssgss evolved and gohan kai outfit they could kill the enemy player within 3 rounds using universe 7 ulitmate unit i think the other cards used were dark masked king fu 20k pwr to 2 allies and vegeta 1500 pwr for each attacker but i cant remember the other two cards used to complete the deck any chance you could recreate it the other two cards may have been gine and mechikabura but i am not 100 sure its good but i have a better team that wins in two rounds but winnig un one round makes there is no fun to play and this is why i regret buying this game online is all 1 turn games boring and shit everybody got play just to win not have a epic battle and have fun my team can domination win within two turns 90 of the time but if i cant i lose within the 3rd turn unless the enemy is too weak lol maybe i should fix that flaw who in the world thinks this is a good idea that gogeta has such a high ci speed that there is no way to click it to win against anything i just tried this team and it did not make it a turn 1 ko another addition to this would be demon goddess putine sh257 when shes on standby she can reduce cl to your lowest characters if gogetas too fast for you i doubt it will work in every scenario update i finally got all the units after countless failed summons mainly on the promo banner in my attempt to get ssj3 gogeta and now im about to finally watch the video to see how to use this amazing team how to get cucked round 1 xeno cell what if someones using xeno cell where do we get the trunks and the gine demon goddess putine helps a lot when shes in support it makes everyones ci speed the same as the person with the slowest ci put future trunks on ur team for damage decduction in supporter barely take damage the first attack also you can use mrsatangt for super attack link line yo i googled db heroes world mission decks pressed this vid and did a normal on set 8 when i got to 055i just busted one i made a team with the elite super saiyan blue vegito as the leader then had ssj4 gogeta xeno berserker goku prisoneer 4 star trunks golden cooler with the last two being xeno super saiyan goku and xeno super saiyan vegeta which fuse into gogeta and honestly wasnt a bad team does anyone know why i cannot create a gine card i have her sticker yet cant ever create a card for her this team is useless vs dyspo i recommend using goddess demon puntie on this team she is an 4 star from sdh set 2 her ability when she is a supporter she makes all members in your team to match with the lowest ci in your team which is absolutely helpful how do i get the trunks and gine sec ui goku from universe set 1 can also do this but he gets 3x power instead of 3 attacks can you tell me on which sets did you get all those cards what do the super dragon balls do when you get them all hey which that trunks in wat number store i have a similar set up in concept but with ssj4 broly he gets 1500 guard for each enemy attacker he attacks 1 to 3 times with bonus 1000dmg so with gine you do over 3k as chip damage without power ups also i have cl lowering and enemy raising supporters unless a enemy ignores guard i can usually tank several rounds of agressive enemies if you run into anyone with xeno cell or any other card that will help you survive turn 1 this deck is useless tho just a heads up if you still havent broken 500 000 points try equipping a different potara earing than the one giving you the burst effect i cant remember the name of the one i use but it lowers opponents guard to 1 and up their ci now you wont 2 hit ko them but you dont want to you want gogeta to use all 3 turns because as long at you hit 2 supers after the 2nd one she is always stunned and the 3rd super is uncontested and massive damage when the points are added you have over 100 000 hit points and you clear 500 000 ive cleared 500 000 a few times using this method you gonna showcase for dbs broly when it drops right a 1 turn win set over kill but have you cleared any of the arcade modes like the android 21 ones can you unlock her card images and the majin from card or are we gonna have to wait until dlc as long as were talking about team building you should swap out some of your useless cards for support units that decreases ci speed it looks like you could have as many as 3 do a berserk goku team please where do i ge tthe trunks or frieza how do you clear the saibaman custom misson in 1 round maybe make a guide on that theres also a towa card that has the same ability as suit freeza that allows you to instantly do a super as im watching this i pull xeno gogeta im going to join your channel when i get paid next amazing content my friend keep up the amazing work are u gonna upload more decks ddd new suscriber you know sometimes that they can make it so gines ability is useless where do we summon to get these is this team works in online there is also an elite towa that has the same effect as the beserker trunks i wish gt gogeta were good too btw what happens if stuff like god kamehameha fail to be executed me ah shit so many good teams need gine hopefully i can pull her pulls gine literally 10 seconds later off a single me alright so now that thats donelmao what i have geni and i think i have that trunks i can do something similar but i can make a team that can reach 99999 maxed of power level and by what i tested everyone gains a very high boost in power level individually as well as my character being the only one in the front line having 61738 of power level but this will only be possible from the third turn finally i got the great priest and with fu also on my team oh boy round 2 is best round for me xeno gogeta is the goat cant wait to use him online the umx chiaotzu of sdbh remember the chiaotzu that did like 100k also if you are fighting a person with under 25000 health then you can replace gine with the bulma from pack 1 if you win the first ci then that bulma can do a super attack that stuns enemys wich pretty much gives you a free hit and then if they still not dead she repeats it after you win a ci and still does it if they are stunned so you can also get that third super attack in for free ayye i have the deck with the same concept but not the same characters only the gogeta xeno is the same would love to see more of this i think there is a tien and gohan that lowers your ci speed these are good options as well to sub in the rare chance you see freiza wearing a suit oh you did the gine over grand priest seemsgood knew it would work never mind its her lol is that gene thanks for the info i have a new idea my is a fusion build in cace your wondering my main team is a xeno team so any type of xeno unit will already be a buff to my already strong team im gonna save this video for later when i have all the required cards so far i only have the 2 trunks so wish me luck with my summons as i try to prepare this team how do you get gine anyone can we get the ssgss transformation for our custom card if yes plz tell gogetasuper saiyan 4im the mightiest of all gogetasanyways thats so dope hey solo how did you collect all the card in this short time here is my op 1 round win is gogeta ss4 xeno dark broly ss4 gine goku mui vegeta ultra blue last one is optional warning this is just 4 fun but also is a high risk high reward tipe deck thank you slo for this great tutorial video and also for the other units like xeno gohan xeno ssj3 trunks and ssj3 gogeta you can replace them with any other unit right is the game free i think you wrote the title wrong slo good vid tho slo i have a team what can need improving and can i show you it i saw you starting this team on stream shouldnt it say how to win in 1 round for the first part your so lucky to have every card even though you used a cheat engine congrats man this dude got all the cards ingame gg first first you have a mod so you can do 1 an endless power level 2 endless super attacks 3 endless stamina 4 and endless perfects can you bring back the ancien background theme please the bgm 318 of db hero just search this theme is uploaded on youtube cool video btw wow this free update released at the same time as global dokkan got the sdbh cards what a coincidence 1025 outro music name plz i was confused btw is that a piece of gear that allows you an instant perfect charge or is it modded is this on xbox i finished this game my main team is avatar ssj blue liquir gyn iwan arack quitela bs and goku mui summoner amazing team not to mention that this game is one of the best and liquir is my favorite in the game and in the anime what is this for this is cool thats cool todoroki to beat are you gokus secret love child or something you are wicked my dude wait so if beat is gokus decedent doesnt he technically keep the powers can you do the side missions so are we sure heroes timeline is the future of xeno gokus i mean beat goes ssb while xeno goku only knows ssj4 we sure the heroes timeline isnt the future of the dbs timeline why you are not uploading any video and please play pokemon light is our heart fire ash gets updated on the 28th so will episode 64 for fire ash be up around that time since the story mode is finished can you do something other than story mode i was surprised youre main character is gokus descendant though ether all its badass sellout in a game lul i know exaclty what ndakauba will say when he sees tkot transform supreme kai of time lookin kinda thicc find it extremely funny kaioken goku is rendered entirely pink i would definitely enjoy it if you continued with the game there seems to be a lot more content to be discovered is there online battles wow i think dark broly is really op so we all just going to ignore the fact that this man survived on 1 hp and won everybody pray for sdbh world mission 2 gooogetttaem i know i have a problem with puns gohan in the suit will give u a super attack if linked try him out would you recommend the game im not sure if i should pick it up yet i am usually into card games and dragonball games though just not sure about the combination of the two do extra story mode and tournament so you gonna do the side stories and possibly arcade mode just heard the dragon ball heroes theme tune during the second battle with sealas around 30 mins will you make custom cards play arcade mode or battle online in more videos basically anymore content for this game there are story for note and froze and a secret chapter to and please make a video on dragon ball z the legend of z rpg voltsy what will be your next walkthrough first just gotta say i love your content keep it coming if you get the new added card xeno goku and vegeta and fuse them into gogetayou can get alot more power orbs good fight here is a little tip dont even bother with the ci manipulation against the ai in this game because mo matter how high the speed is the bastards will always get it pretty damn high and get a krillin or the demon princess that reduces your own speed drastically but since we gotten these game i hope we get zenkai battle royal and i dont mind if it comes for the switch yha i like this game cause it teachese people that you should not get used to the same cards cause some missions you need requirements to beat certain missions also who has already gotten their avatar to ssjgod or at least ssj god blue i just gotten blue fu on support with a ci speed down ability equipped is where its at i also have someone else in party with an enemy ci up on my main deck im running my avatar ui goku ssj2 berzerk goku ssj rage trunks ssgss vegito with fu and grand priest on full time support fu gives two random party members 20000 attack every round and grand priest buffs the whole party with 30000 attack once on start by round 3 when all of my shit kicks in im doing 25000 damage a person for most party members god tier missions are a cake walk im trying to see those other teams you got in the back 900 that actually sounds funny hey dfree i had the same problems as you with ci and maybe even worse then you i run mui goku the one that summons vegeta and cumber and ssj 4 gogeta and goku and they had really fast ci and i also use ssj 3 raditz and he is not that bad on ci but there is a a item called inner eye and it permanently lowers your ci for each character you put it on and its like one of those rings you get it in the shop under accessories and now even cumber and mui have speeds as low as our character i love it i sucked at ci to now but im fine just wanted to let you know and i just found it out this morning so ya its really helpful and there 5000 zeni each i bought the max u can have 7 and i love it on my team what does ci stand for this game reminds me of db fusions for 3ds that game was good you should put base adult gohan on this team him ssbe vegeta and mui goku have an amazing unit attack though you need 10 energy and round 3 for it from my experience zenoh orbs guarantee a dragon ball nice db world heros content u should do som pvp or friend some people in the comments and steam fighting them just an idea you do what u like tho dimensional pressure is a bunch of bullshit can i get a krillinit for krillin doing the final attack on cumber truth at 109 ready to take some fat l s and every other person who plays gacha games same here love the sbdhwm vids also loving the game more than i thought i would hopefully we can get some guides of some sort soon also favorite card right now has to be ssj3 raditz you should do fake eza for mask saiyan dude the ci is stupid ooof that cypher pt4 intro tho its firreeeeeee on those super fast ones try to get as low as u can and ull get close to perfect iv gotten perfects like that from what i see you are trying to get the ci bar to land on the perfect by hitting a the second it hits the perfect range when what you would want to do is hit it prior to the perfect range that way the natural slowness of human reactions will be able to get you closer to a perfect ci or you could try and build a team that drastically raises you chance to get a miracle ci planning to buy a switch just for this game someone count how many times he said alright in this vid love the intro dfree its back the intro is back i got module with a gold shenon face does that mean it a secret rare does anybody know all these videos in 24 hours are spoiling me sheeeeeeeesh dfree if youre looking for a crazy consistent deck to use i highly recommend giving the chosen warriors cards from uvm2 a try you have used the android 21 card with the 50 sta passive before but the others are really good too the chosen warriors passive is incredibly good for applying early game pressure enables 1st round sas and can potentially kill your opponent with little effort basically the deck consists of the goku vegeta android 16 android 21 cell android 18 with spousal combo passive and best of all krillin with spousal combo passive full sta 1st round get your power level to at least 18k to enable sas and if you get your cis right its an easy win if you dont win the first turn all sorts of other passives kick in to give you even more of an advantage best of all because chosen warriors gives a guard up youll take fairly little damage in return give it a try and see if you like it this would be fun as a race with people like ndukauba or rhyme i look forward to every video of sdh keep it up dude try to beat god boss android 21 i gave up man i just gave up pink waifu is too much woman for me man the question is what would you do for a klondike bar i actually want to play this game now damn dfree what have you done krillin with the finishing kamehameha krillinit fourth summons at 738 if you dont want to know about the cards abilities and special attacks no i agree its just that we are in a time where people just dont like to read thus everyone is creating broken english i lost my game and im trying to find it so i can get that free update dlc yo slow back with the prisoner shirt uh will you be doing a walkthrough of dbzkakarot once the game comes out or are you going to stick to making xenoverse videos i think you should do the walkthrough it will be cool yo slo do you know that mod which makes vegetas hair green yes there is glich that i just found to keep vegetas green hear go to photo mode when transform into super saiyan green hair part just pouse and restart there he is stuckable vegetas vegetable form sorry for my bad english is just cool man dont get me wrong but the super attacks were trash nothing new ssj2 vegitos render was in the game already i remember making a custom card with it hey thats me yo why gogeta in ssj in vegitos clothes lol it boy vegito the graphic tho slo its me jayshon i made a new google acount so this is for nintendo hey dude amazing video as normal sorry i havent comented for a while how can i play this amezing game like you do 1135 so no one gonna talk about this shin budokai reference this game is copy of dragon ball shin budokai 2 i got them all and ill continue to do so glad someone still plays this game kinda sucks it died quickly but its a good game with alot of things people havent showcased such as the custom card making though it is extremely unlikely itd be cool to see either ss2 gogeta or vegito in db legends itd be some great xenoverse 2 mod material that hairstyle looks sick hey slo great video

untouched id make an exception for microtransactions for new costumes and levels if it meant fresh content is being pumped out just make sure that soundtrack can be switched out if you catch my drift so its basically that game bulma doesnt shut up about in xenoverse 2 but more enhanced or make kefla people go super saying 4 in stead of blue i want free stuff for these idias 19 11 27 happy thanksgiving why dbz insist on making a card game not worth 60 is akira toriyama even involved in this seems entirely japantiese creation of international heist quite a talent ahh it seems boring almost like capsule corp card game in xeouniverse 2 why tf are games getting worse these days 130 taopaipai rules is most powerfull to ultra instinct xd wtf with the new db games this and fighter z are so stupid game play why dont they just develop the budukai series it was the best of the best why is this not available for playstation this game would be a lot better if it was more like a regular fighting game or tenkaichi i see their making hero colosseum its own game just with shittier graphics animated card game wack this games story is better than all of super ok so do you control your character with button combinations or do you enter a command and then watch the characters respond at 256 vegeta does a masenko followed by gohan doing a galick gun umm no thanks thinking ofthis or import beyblade burst switch this seems like a nobrainer if i can get it for under 40 fun fact did you know that the dragon ball heroes franchise games uses the models from dragon ball z budokai 1 2 3 and infinite world maybe we should use budokai voice samples i just watched general tao defeat mastered ultra instinct goku i have now seen everything a good idea is to use amiibos instead cards how about an actual fighting game lmao a weird experiment between yugioh and db gone badreally bad how is this game can i just buy the game and enjoy or are you expected to keep buying card packs or something this a glorified mobile game people complaining about people complaining about the graphics are the worst this looks super oldfacts deal with it they is so wrong for not putting this on ps4 wasnt there supposed to be an open world rpg dragonball game coming out this year wheres that at lmao people complaining about the graphics what did yall expect it to look like am i the only one that had trouble actually hearing the guy explaining everything over the music why tf you complaining about the graphics if youve got a switch the dated budokai 3 graphics are actually pretty charming apart from the dodgy models it looks pretty tight so far this game is so damn good the fun part of this kind of arcades is the interection with the real life but heres all digital am i right so half of the fun is already lost reminds me of budokai 23 soooo why couldnt they include all these characters in dbz fighters they should have picked tao pai pai on the universe 7 team to defeat jiren brings me back to the budokai days okay i get it graphics arent the most important thing in a game but like this just looks extremely unappealing also to those of you who complain about graphics may i recommend stop complaining and just appreciate the game at least we can tell who is who thats whats important when it comes to graphics be glad they gave us this game i personally and super psyched about this this was edited in also admit it the super attacks whatever you wanna call them look dope you know im right those graphics little bitchies always complaining gtf kids so is this kinda like that card game from xenoverse 2 this game is mainly for the people in japan that play the arcade game lol is this yugiball z i dont care at all for this game except for the fact that this games been using the budokaibudokai tenkaichi graphics for years so its a nice change of things i still play budokai tenkaichi 2 to this day i wouldnt mind the graphics if the game wasnt 60 wtf is that a 60 game wow not my cup of tea all i want is cell for a second i thought this was a video game version of the super card game fuxk this game its a app store game at best years waiting to be able to play heroes overseas and when we finally can people wont shut up about the graphics fans dont deserve dbh world mission uu the graphics is realy cool its dragon ball z budokai 3 like this was always my favorite dragon ball engine when i was younger so seeing how well its holding up with all the modern stuff added in makes me more excited to try it out im really looking forward to finally giving this game a chance here the more you spam less people will care for your game will this be free to play an ultra instinctultimate gohan father son kamehameha could that beat the ui kamehameha to keflas face from the tournament of power this game looks more complicated than chemistry homework cards id take any budakai game from ps2 over this i thought this was some kinda rpg game but since its a card game i will have to pass as im not into card games but its nice to see they are giving north america a chance i wish they would give us super robot wars i have wanted to try that game for a long time thats in 4 days this is the reason i bought the switch im so hyped for it what a waste there is a game just like this for free for cell phones wait its in english editdamn that narrator sounds calm af and blizzard doesnt bring hearthstone on the switch maybe this is my alternative way of an trading card game to play on the switch quite interested to play this makes a change this game should have been for all the consoles and mobile felt like this was a mobile game but was excited to know that this was a console games but should have been for all xboxps4 and switch if we have cards from the arcade machine will we be able to use them so does it work like the arcade machine in jp do we get to buy cards and scan them on the switch to make them appear in game wait so it comes out next month would wide or in japan dokan is better and sub to pewdiepie hope this game comes with a story mode looks nice but every game needs a story this is the same system that made breath of the wild now counter this by saying ooohohoh its nintendo that made that game this game is on this switch and either bandai and toei want to save money or this is gonna go on mobile what is this mess im going to get that game so basically this is hero coliseum but you have to buy it could care less about the graphics but the game really doesnt look fun kind of sad about it i might gamefly it to see if its worth it but doesnt look like it will be even the person talking voice sounds boring just imagine general tao beating ultra instinct goku yee cause that what i want from dragonball a digital card game mui goku and ultimate gohan father son kamehameha hype what if i told you every dragon ball game is behind on graphics its a little late to complain now lol nice welcome back gamecube graphic switc should stop doing ports abd start getting games made indie games are great but what is compelling me to get a switch rn i hope the single player campaign story is the one from dragon ball heroes ultimate misson on 3ds or similar because i always wanted to play that i remember years ago i watched a playthrough of it and thought the characters you fight and locations you fight them at was very interesting i just hated i couldnt read the japanese text dialog before a battle to know what was going on in the story lol but now its in english so thats good is it free db legends has better graphics lol i thought it was going to be the dbz card game but animate leader characters on the field i guess not but its looks cool hyped that i can finally play this game in english and just soooooooo dbh content for global dokkan confirmed so pretty much legends but for the switch life hack want to feel inferior play online took them basically 9 years to give us something here they couldve done like a 3ds demo or something earlier but i guess this works too ill play if its free know what funny about people we are never satisfied this game has been out for years only in japan and weve been begging for the longest for it to come to the us then it finally does yall bash it lmaooo they should create dragon ball heroes mobile game soooits a more complex version of the battle simulator in xenoverse 2 this game is perfect i think the complain is coming from new players base on the comments not a lot of people in the west have played this in the arcade or on 3ds this is the third installment if i remember correct it s amazing what they added and finally it is sub in english thank you bandai definitely picking this up i been asking for this for years not sure why people are clowning the game why does this game not use the animation fron xenoverse it would look way better looks like the old budokai games still cool though so as soon as we get in the game were gonna get the hero packed that comes in with gogeta blue i wanted this for so long this looks like the mini game on xenoverse 2 personally im excited its a shame people care so much about graphics these days gameplay means everything not how the game looks where pokemon tcg in switch im pretty ordering this game today lame you will never be the new cool card game gtho this game is boring the switch has more power and can easily make the graphics look decent but the game was built on budokai 2 and 3 engine by the way i am not a nintendo fanboy 101 i see broly so do they have dbs broly and gogeta blue cause i see dbz broly will there be cards for the game where i have to go to the store and buy these cards wait its full price tom gives it an 85 out of 10 yes i am buy this game it looks like a ps2 game in 2019 why is this going to be sub only hahahaha you know nintendo is such trash when mobile phone games look and play better this game looks awesome ive always loved budokai graphics anyway but its also awesome knowing how much content is gonna be in this game a dragon ball video by nintendo goku for smash confirmed if only you could play this on android that would be awsome 10 years of waiting and we dbz fans finally get to play dragon ball heroes dbz heroes fans yasssss everyone else this looks crappy dbz heroes fans death stare the person explaining sounds like he just got up 15 min ago and havent had his coffee yet budokai graphics hit me right in the feels i might buy this game just for that ironic during the arcade era arcade cabinets were basically the prime way to play games with some of the best graphical quality ever especially compared to consoles which only started catching up in terms of graphics during the ps2 and gamecube era now were here where 95 of arcade machines dont even come close to anything on a modern console i dont like this game i tried it on xnoverse 2 so its just a remodel of dokkan battle but on the switch quality ideas nintendo the ultimate dragon ball collectible card game dbs tcg wants to know your location the quality is worse than a nintendo ds game bruh honestly i dont care as long as they have those crazy enemies like super oceanus shenron or black smoke shenron or even cell x then i would be more then happy with this game why is it a card game this could be another budokai game and dont get me wrong though the game can exist as it is and that but iirc this game had the the first time patroller thing at reveal so i feel like i have to buy it to reveal more about the time patrollers from xenoverse 12 but they couldve easily just made xenoverse 3 and people wouldve loved it thanks for the video now i must go and play animal crossing new leaf on my nintendo 3ds why is nobody thinking about how this could mean therell be an english dub of the super dragon ball heroes anime so its the mobile game on switch basically dragon ball legends on mobile looks better than this i like the budokai art direction for the dragon ball heroes series at least we know that style didnt die out after those games just fully payed mine super stoked being dragon ball heroes i expected to see some characters from heroes hope they have all the characters wait can they transform tho because that would be great if you ask me do not buy this game funimation doesnt deserve any more money istandwithvic i get that its cheaper and faster to make but how come they didnt use takahashi or shintani for the card art so we will need real cards this is what jump force should look like this is just dragon ball legends everybody support this game if you want them to bring over every db game from japan ive done the same to support the digimon games and they have been releasing one each year since their return to the west tao beating ultra instinct good representation looks fun can they please make gamecube games available instead of snes or lets just have both add gameboy too people complaint about graphics this is how the fame has always been we all asked for it so they gave us it this is always hows it been long have i waited for this day certaint team combinations can unlock new ultimate attacks anyone else thought of naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 4 paid game or free to play when does the pre order for this on the e shop come out yay i am super happy i want this game i thought this was on gameboy what is up with those models came straight out of the psp ok thats cool and all but is the arcade machine coming to america anytime soon i love how there are more people talking about the people complaining about the graphics than the actual people who are complaining why that game looks exactly like budokai 3 i guess we are not getting the arcade games usa would fill it with crappy cards forcing you to buy packs and hope for strong cards while japan gives you what you need to make you keep playing what to do with my comiccon deck now that ill never use them hey i bet more people would be interested in a new budokai game instead just saiyan dimps the models effects and animations all look like early ps2 era lmao i know its a port of some arcade game but i feel like they could have remastered the models with modernera polycounts and effects interesting completely disinterested the second it talked about cards dbzs but with carrrrrds just what i wanted ok a little bit if background here since people either dont know or dont bother looking this up heroes is a card game with arcade machines over in japan it uses the budokai engine hence why its so similar looking the game itself is years old at this point and has been updated many times xenoverse drew inspiration from heroes not the other way around so yes graphics look dated because its simply a port of a long running game and the characters arent borrowed from anywhere this game is where they came from to begin with why are they using budokai models it was on the wii you guys i wish that it was the dragon ball super tcg one piece world seeker for switch why cant i pre order the digital version it on the us store its not up yet i hope i dont have to buy a physical copy give me new yugioh game konami and nintendo pleaseee i have been wanting this for years 038 vegeta you looking pretty buff there at first i thought this is a sequel to the awesome fusions game but nope i not even into this but look interesting from the weakest to the strongest specifically stated by the thumbnail why is this not a simulator of the dragon ball super ccg aye bruh yall can say watever u want iv been waitin for this on switch why not for ps4 this game has a lot of good characters the gameplay is just trash i wish they would treat their actual fighting game rosters that good so how much will this game cost will it be f2p with microtransactions or is there a set price this is just dumb i know we can get a better game then this the graphics freakin suck mui gokus hair stays the same and beat looks like your emotionless player from pokemon for a switch game this needs massive improvements with graphics ahd especially sound effects why ultimate mission 1 2 and x no eng ver dokkan battle on switch cant wait the graphics are bad kids chill the graphics are fine not every game has ti have amazing graphics wtf no i thought that was a goku smash trailer and i was about to cry i would have prefered a remaster of tag team nobody asked for this goku looks like voldermort in the thumbnail so no 3ds would have been perfect for it tbh this means global dokkan will definitely get the super dragon ball heroes cards how come we never got the 3ds copy of this game localize and theres like 2 or 3 yugioh games for 3ds that never got localize that are the good ones who even talked about this game on youtube beside nintendo not interested because it wont have a dub stoppanderingtoweebs not my dragon ball fusion 2 but ill take it anyway son i could sell this fanbase a dbz game made for a texas instrument calculator and theyd defend it to the ends of the earth 1010 graphics 60 for a card game lol nah flopworthy theyshould really pay me to design a dragon ball game its crazy that they only manage to pump out trading card games or very average fighters lol are idiots really complaining about the graphics it looks almost identical to the arcade versions from japan boring looks like something that should be free should just be a phone game pre ordered and ready to go english dub can you play multiplayer using the same switch someone needs to add shaggy as a mod this is one of the most chill totorials i have ever seen lmao lol this generation scream graphics graphics look bro i just want a amazing game graphics are nice and all but their are reasons why some old games are still held in high regard despite not being the most visually pleasing the style aynt even that bad if ppl can sit here and defend tenkaichi to this day lol i dont wanna here it imagine if they still used their budokai voices in this game because it looks like the budokai games in hd on this game i just want to have is majin buu vegeta and goku xd so cool that the us is finally getting this game now you all better support it if you like dbz and yugioh and fusions this is fhd game for you cx i would like to hear more about the custom moves i know that we can give other characters certain iconic moves such as giving jiren the kamehameha heres the thing this game has weired graphics and its a frekin statergy game go play fire emblem not this sh its anime dbh suckss even more i guess you cant use the physical cards in this game its weird seeing budokai style models still being a thing but a less blocky especially around the fingers the models seem fine but they have some kind of weird filter that makes them look old or something i dont know how to describe it wasnt this an arcade game in japan its now on switch look i just want a hd update for the bt series i mean we got it for the other series i kind of wanna play it horrible no transformations not 1 goku with transformationskill nooo maybe they give us 20 cardversions of him dont like it 60 dollars tho why is it a card game mobile dragonball legends looks way better just make a good game instead i see more people complaining about people complaining about graphics than i do of people complaining about the graphics so does this open up the door for a zenkai port just add more offensive and defensive options last dragonball on switch was full of dlc thats why im not interested in another greedy move about dragon ball thanks akira continue sucking money pls what a shame of game remember 257 this is out in my birthday dragon ball legends looks better than this game so this is dokkan x legends this better be free how about for bandai namco make a drsgon ball trading card game reader for the nintendo switch i have a feeling this started development on the 3ds then the developer panicked and realized the system was on its way out shin budokai graphics in 2019 goku for smash plllsss they really like dimps and their budokai engine dont they i know this question isint related to this game but can you put stardew vally for new 3ds xl i want a castelvania game for switch online game or offline si si muy bonito todo pero donde esta el dragon ball proyect z yes yes the game is beautiful but where is dragon ball proyect z can we use the physical dragonball heroes cards on switch worthy to buy this is wack just play dokkan battle i hope all of the spice boys and turless crusher core and all of lord slugs clan are all playable is it free finally we get a heroes game why is there so much burter in this trailer on a scale of lots of burter to no burter this trailer is rocking the lots of burter section damn theyre finally bringing heroes to the us people dont realize this is an arcade game from japan brought to the switch this looks more like an android game than nintendo switch game i think dbz games have taken a step back after battle of z xenoverse12 and fighers of z were not fun to play nani im glad i have a switch its a card game wtf wish we got the arcade card scanner still a good surprise am i the only one asking myself if cards based ob dragonball super broly are in the game why they cant get naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 4 on switch people dont understand that the reason the game looks like this is because its a port of a very popular japanese arcade game that uses real cards and a field where you would place the card on a scanner integrated in the machine to move your characters on the field i am very excited to try this out after seeing it in many videos in the past i think the game is about 10 years old cash grab you jews please nintendo do a captain tsubasa game on nintendo switch that was all i want i want this game is this what are we waiting for if there was a tv series based off this game like there was for mega man battle network yugioh and pokemon id watch it gameplay cool graphics suck nothing out of the ordinary it is a port of a constantly updated arcade game for those in america who wanted access to it its not supposed to be a revolutionary new game also making all the characters in updated graphics would take an insane amount of time its a fan service game that rapidly makes unique characterforms please do storm 4 for switch everyone wants it the game will have the same graphics that they have in japan machines and its good is this an arcade game edit nvm i was just predicting wrong before the trailer ends card game well that a big mid fin to us hi ps2 graphics we meet again ok just rip the models and mugshots out of budokai why dont yall so theres no sameconsole two player offline battles this feels like a free mobile game hope the game will be in full english you know with goku not sounding like that or at least the option to have those english voices everyone is complaining about the graphics im just wondering how vegeta did a masenko and gohan right after did a galick gun i cant wait to finally be able to play this game day one purchase for me nintendo team up with hasbro so the fans can play my little pony games on the switch couldnt they at least use another engine instead of budokai 3 engine best birthday present ever thank you bandai very cool this is literally just a free to play what kind of smash bros is this the graphics is based on some dragon ball old game right ooooh ad some cat ha games for switch and you get a gold mine nintendo nobody wants this after the amazing visual and graphics style of dragonball fighterz this looks very average like an upscaled ps2 game the narrator reminds me of steve blum a card game zzzzzzzz waiting for project z instead gaming intustry welcome to the game of who can milk their series the fastest while i do have a nintendo switch id probably buy it if it were on pc since pc is at least free to play online charging to play online was a really big mistake nintendo shouldve been f2p on mobile do amiibo dragonball cards and i am in that moment when super dragon ball heroes gets better advertising than dragon ball fighterz when it was ported over it doesnt even compare to xenoverse 2 but where the hells pokemon tcg what joker form presona 5 gameplay trailer in super smash bros ultimate dlc is just kirby hat star ko final smash truath dizzy persona 5 stage like cashio pit easter egg o i know what joker easter egg on every character hey its on my birthday this comment section 85 people complaining about people complaining about the graphics 10 people actually complaining about the graphics 5 people saying they want goku to be in smash whos gonna buy that its even cost 60 dollars for a card game no thanks for those that dont understand this is a japanese exclusive arcade game with 10 years worth of content addictions finally released in english in the west people have literally been asking for this game for a decade nintendo i salute you all we want is basically budokai tenkaichi with updated graphics and roster is it that hard lol the ps1 graphic you expect me to pay for this it has the gameplay of a bad free mobile game and the graphics i mean come on you can do better bandai am i the only one thinking how bad their naming sense is 040 father son ultimate instinct kamehameha lol this looks good enough for a mobile game i dont about the graphics ill still want to play this v cant wait for my gaming channel to get so many views cause i got my switch ready and now i just have to wait for the game to come out nintendo land for the switch i love this db games the game is wack ok so this is free but you gotta pay for the hero edition right am i the only one who bloody well feels that this should be free im not mad just surprised they didnt go with xeniverse 2 graphics would have made a bit more sense if you cant stop tseries i dont care what your powers are me ah finally a cheap dokkan battle stranger but dokkan is free stupid me uh yeah sure it is asmr the game trailer can this guy just come to my house and talk until i fall asleep lol such a soothing voice give us shaggy new db games sucks i can smell the microtransaction i want to create a ssj4 raditz that be dope i love the characters creation and move creation mode 350 characters and maybe more are coming maybe dlc i think its awesome goku have custom move to do a piccolo move lol lol ive pre order it looking forward to it im a huge dbz fan and im just gonna say thisgame looks boring af i just want pokemon tcg is that too much to ask for fans yugioh for switch nintendo what hmmm dragonball card game it is i am seriously curious how they will balance custom cards so they arent op unless a good idea could be have only custom cards be in custom missions so then its fine if theyre ridiculous bruh the cards arent gonna be subbed cmon other then this game looks absolutely fire now i just gotta save up for a switch and the game uh ill wait for that yugioh legacy of the duelist sequel this game is trash despite the ps2 graphics and the gameplay being somewhat akin to a card based phone game it actually looks kinda fun miiiight pick it up who needs a tutorial when this explains the game well on its own also who cares about the graphics did gohan used galick gun who wants this good for you but most want usual dbz type games but hey keep on with the dbz thing bandai httpsimgurcomadrivbgi nappa ssj confirmed take my money looks pretty cool for a ps2 game im so ready for this cool whens mother 3 my only concern is do we have to buy cards and packs from nintendo or do we unlock them via game play im gonna be honest here this looks like a ps2 game budokai 23 to be specific this is a phone game not a switch game ffs stop i is that gohan calvo in the thumbnail lol at all the newbs complaining about the graphics as if they were bad budokai 3 is peak dbz aesthetics theyre finally bringing this game to the west thank god im in tears i thought i had to import the japanese version and figure it out i am so happy i might give this a try i was hooked at 1000 cards unlockable lol am i the only one to see doctor phill for the vido imagefunny bug i promise im not crazy we really need a yugioh game on switch was this made for an arcade cabinet first it reminds me of a really old dragon ball z card game on the game boy color you would have one character at a time but you had a deck that the character could pull from that would activate their abilities except this looks a lot better of course and the cards are the characters themselves rather than the moves if this is 60 dollars im going to laugh pretty hard this game would do really wellon ios graphics look better than jump force at least general blue is best card can we get project z on switch instead of this game tactic dragon ball is never that fun beside the game looks pretty bad the switch can do much better than this ps for people who said it is an arcade game so its graphic should be bad look ip for fgo arcade and see the difference im so disapointed this game even worse than dragon ball legends on mobile a paid for card game that looks exactly like nintendos free ios games content is more important than graphics personally this game is ugly for a switch game this looks like a ps2 game will buy it at 39 79 bye its a scam for those complaining about the graphics i think its interesting theyre using budokai 3 models and making new ones in budokai 3s style hi this looks great hmmmm i dont like these kinds of games and then it costs money to get cards it will take a few weeks everybody knows what is the best card with the best mod so its that card thing they added in xenoverse 2 was this narrated by solid snakedavid hayter so this is battle coloseum v2 the battle coloseum in xenoverse 2 is already ok and its freeeeee i dont understand why people who has no interest in heroes are complaining both xenoverse 2 and fighterz are on the switch if you want a more traditional dragon ball game so its not even like switch owners lost something in exchange this graphics look old and why would anybody buy this if you can have fighterz with a better graphics and more action in the mix this isnt ps2 graphics this is mobile phone game graphics like holy crap guys the please update the graphics the switch has way more power and space than a ps2 i should know i have both is kyle hebert narrating lol well this was an major bonerkiller this doesnt mean he can get into smash bros now does it nope i wanna fight i dont wanna think 304 mega mewtwo xs ultimate attack in pokken tournament dx cooking mama for smash ultimate to be honest who really cares about this game i am serious aside from its looks what is the actual gameplay this just looks bad and a waist right now after jump force and both dragon ball fighting games can u put a app so i can stream or upload gameplay to youtube or twitchmixer what ever i just really want to stream and upload to internet instead if 30sec or to twitter or facebook this looks great keep up the good work namco luffy for smash damn this looks like it could be really fun loving these budokai 3 graphics also end of z goku ayy we finally got db heroes in english goku in smash confirmed im actually excited for this can people stop talking about the graphics it a port of an old arcade game we never got in murica is this that arcade game to be honest i didnt even click on this until i realized its a new game i thought it was an old gameboy game on switch i swear the ps2 just wont die still putting games out for it cue the people moaning about the graphics and that it isnt a straight up fighting game while true fans are more pissed at piccolo beating up majin buu and cell still buying this though cant wait awesome i love dragon ball this is stupid as f just make fighting game httpsdiscordggm7m4gvt this is a nintendo discord isnt this just hero colosseum in xenoverse 2 i wish people would stop judging this just because they cant pick a character and fight someone head to head its a card game if you dont like it ok but some people love this i had no interest in playing the card game but apparently if you put the card game on a cartridge im buying it if you really loved budokai back in the day you wouldnt mind the graphics you would enjoy them insead cool but not 50 cool graphics looks like the budakai tenkaichi graphics such a nostalgic feeling look at that budokai 3d models reminds me to the old times with my ps2 lmao looks good to me maybe im not a sophisticated dragon ball taster like you guys tf is this nintendo switch must be underpowered af why do many complain about the graphics here okay she is not the best but please be happy to see another dragonball game for the switch i know for todays conditions the graphics are bad but i do not care im looking forward to the game the moment they said card i wrote this down and left shin budokai graphics great looking graphics for a ps2 game standarts this one ill pass ui goku and adult gohan father son kamehameha ok but what with the ps2 graphics tho even infinite world for the ps2 looked better omg i want it and i want it now ugh more freemium games on the switch everyones complaining about the graphics and im just over here getting hit with the budokai tenkaichi nostalgia subscribe to pewdiepie animations attack and character models in battle screen looking very shity i swear if the game is in japanese with english sub isnt this just the xenoverse 2 mini game so basically dokkan battle on the switch i love dragon ball but its getting dead wheres shaggy i preordered my copy in february this looks horrendous this is so dumb i love it i cant wait for tfs to play this how are they using the same exact assetsanimations from the budokia games lmfaoo people complaining about the graphics and im a just thinking how awesome it is to see new characters in the old style from good old budikai ill consider playing this game if it gets a dub version remember the sub game in xenoverse is it bad to realize that this was just a larger version of that stop complaining about the graphics lower graphics means more content why have 5 4k models when you could have 1000 low quality models thats how they fit all of those cards whens jojo on switch meh cant go back to stuff like this after fighterz kid goku can use the power pole flying nimbus after image technique kamehameha not as strong he used it on a car on the fire mountain episode and the giant ape form he can totally work in smash bros give us a game based off a good anime the narrator is the guy from honest trailers ah still lookin like the ps2 i actually perfer the low graphics as a budakai fan of 1 2 and 3 on ps2 i thought it wouldbe free to play guess not even dragon ball z ultimate tenkachi looks better than this this sounds like david hayter can i preorder it already kid goku dragon ball for smash can totally work use the flying nimbus for the up recovery smash ultimate can be giant ape form why wasnt this just a dbs tcg game id rather play dragon ball legends on the switch dragon ball is getting outstanding representation on switch the best for a nintendo console since snes ill just wait till black friday to get this literally no dbz game can compete with dragonball fighterz arc systems made it impossible to top why not naruto pokemon z with ultra instinct shaggy this game is basicallyl what the figure coliseum mode in xenoverse 2 is based on too might as well make yugi a dlc then your gf hes probably thinking about other girls you a dbz fan how could anyone kill ultra instinct goku yes coming to america baby looks lame what a disappointment let me know when you decide to remake budokai tenkaichi 3 bandai look at dem graphics yes i was waiting for another card fighting game said no one ever interesting how many ppl are complaining about the graphics this has a nostalgia factor for me so i love this style but if graphics are all that matters to udont buy itits very simple eew it looks gross xenoverse 2s card game looks better eh too many rpgs how do you expect alot of us to stay interested when were dealing with the same combat just more flashier i am absolutely pre ordering the hero edition who else is dfk is wrong with the graphics budokai 3 models still the best models sweet its not dubbed with all the crap funimation has been doing it makes it hard for me to buy db stuff in the west i mean im interested but screw sean schimel and monica rial ill get it if it doesnt have english audio now i hate subs but sean hayes his fans and what monica is doing to vic is wrong if he didnt actually do anything is this for free it doesnt look like a

announcer prozd graphics look like ps2 budokai or sumn but the gameplay look kinda fun nice ps2 graphics this game actually looks fun over 1000 cards meaning over 1000 characters to choose from pretty dope im surprised were getting a heroes game in the states wow these really are dragon ball z budokai 3 models nothing bad with its graphics i like them i knew yugioh could beat goku since he is the king of cards games card game gtfo is this some kind of dragon ball z super saiyan densetsu no gonna lie looks horrible didnt know the switch was this bad nice ps2 game is it me or its exactly the minigame they added in xenoverse 2 for free in xenoverse 2 nintendo is this gonna be a jump force and one piece situation aint it wheres gohan blanco tho this is exactly like the board game somebody knows because i have wanted to play the card game for a long time crazy that this game runs on the budokai 3 engine loved that game to death so i dont mind the way this one looks look at those ps1 graphics cancer oh now they release a dragonball heroes to america finally a lot of dragonball fans have been dying to try one of these wow i seriously never thought id see and english release for this game now only if arcades where still around like in japan i hope the hero anime follows can we get the 3ds mission x game for america please remember when power levels in dragon ball were bs english dub confirmed id rather wait for the new dragonball z game coming out game just looks really boring good thing i own a switch what a lazy game if youre going to make a dragon ball game do better than this yamcha for smash confirmed send your favorite dragon ball characters to the shadow realm 113 dislikes came from people who dont know what dragon ball heroes is this aint your average childrens card game ist it for free cuz it looks like a ps2 game this is killing dragon ball z in my opinion who in there right mind looks for this in a dragon ball game everyone here complaining about the graphics and im like how the f did general tao defeat ultra instinct goku 60 buks are too much btw those animations made me cry mercenery taoim sold i thought dragon ball heroes was japan only ps2 graphics hahahaha game looks confusing honestly i think that a 60 dll price isnt it if its 60 but still i wanna play it can i choose to play as someone besides beat edit nvrm we can how many characters there will be dragonball games is died with this game nah thats okay funimation pretty much ruined the fandom for me goku for smash dlc confirmed is it not a free to play fun fact thayer has been a lot more dragon ball card games one of the first nes dragon ball games was one is shaggy in this game cool but i hope we get the dragonball jrpg i love jrpgs okay this is epic dont fret guys this is just a mobile port as others coming to the amazing nintendo switch nothing major niche audience oh a ccg nevermind r we back in ps2 era what is this do i have to buy the game and buy cards to play the game or will the game be free but just requires cards not my cup of tea what about project z this guy has a nice voice i hate card games leave that crap back in 2005 please if i wanted to dick around with cards id play canasta at the old folks home to those wondering yes the game is supposed to look like this its basically the equivalent to the japanese exclusive arcade game named super dragon ball heroes and so this game will be a test run for the series of dragon ball heroes in the west eventually yes if this game does well we could easily get a xenoverse art style triple a dragon ball heroes game in the future also if your completely in the dark make sure to check out the official dragon ball heroes promotional anime which you can find on youtube they can waste time on this but no budokai tenkaichi 3 remake oh come on just give us yugioh for switch really really miss the dragon ball rpg play on fc and snes years ago oh boy do i wish dokkan battle had accounts then all the money i spent wouldnt have been wasted when my phone broke okay been away from dragonball for a while can someone explain the white hair goku to me this was an arcade game in japan right this game looks like dbz bt3 with modded characters this killed the hype for me sucks this is wack xenoverse is better if anime characters arent allowed in smash then why is joker going to be dlc the image of tao killing mui goku makes me happy ps2 graphics wish they did this for pokemon will reggie still see me in the battle bus creation mode intriguing i have mixed feelings it looks pretty fun and i feel like i would enjoy it for some time especially out of love for the series but for like 20 maybe 30 this game is listed at 60 no thank you legendary super warriors for gbc meets gwent d why not i like protip if you want people to stop talking about goku being in smash dont bring it up simple seeing mercenary tao take down a mui goku made me sad i cant be the only one who noticed that the models for the characters in this game were taken straight out of the budokai 23 games yeah i mean thats fine if they wanna save on making models from the ground up for this game but its something i couldnt help but notice edit yes i now know that this is how theyve done it in the arcade version i had no idea until somebody had informed me lol i wont lie this aint great chief this game is good fight me so basically an arcade game ported to english on switch what is this card wars it will have local multiplayer looking forward to finally playing this game i want this games but for collection i thought this was dragon ball not yugioh i am sorry but this just looks like a mobile game it would be better if you can use the real cards on the game so is this the confirmation that mr satan will be in smash this looks awful stick to fighterz im so excited for this ive waited so long for dragon ball heroes to come to america what is this trash give us a good dragon ball jrpg thanks this is the closest we will get to budokai tenkaichi 3 hd mercenary tao new meta how much im so excited for this does this game work with amibo cards will they release dragon ball amibo cards dragon ball heroes anime is so bad and very short episodes im really confused on how is this connected to dragon ball super series now they coming out with a card game that looks bad doesnt seem fun at all and even the guy talking about this game doesnt even seem happy talking about it bleh thank god this will be on pc ok this is epic nope not feeling this goku will never be in smash nintendo please rerelease legacy of goku and its sequels for the switch or the 3ds pleaseeeeeee if someone says goku for smash i swear to god im excited for this im a huge fan of both db and tcgs so this is a perfect fit some of us played ultimate mission x a db card game alright whatever wish you could pre download i would like one piece world seekers on nintendo switch im gonna be honest here this looks like a ps2 game budokai 23 to be specific its literally the hero colloseum from dragon ball xenoverse 2 but worse xd looking forward to this is this free guess whos coming into global dokkan battle baaabbbyy lame card game ill stick to dragonball fighterz finally been waiting for a long time since japan only had access this but now i can play it well now i know how hyped everyone is make sure to l e a v e a l i k e notification squad does this mean goku will come in smash bros i only want this game because of dokkan battle lol is it out probably should have watched the whole video wtf is this wow that does not look good budokai 3 graphics the amount of awesome cutscenes in this series that i wish were real is over 9000 what to bad im poor af for the 1 of people who see this if you would hit that like button it would make my dayi hope you a bright and good future i am a youtuber myself and im not asking you to do anything but i would love to hit 29000k by the end of the year thank now i know if gogeta is cell disgusing is this custom cards i hate when the ci bar is going like 500 miles per second you need a have a miracle to win it when its going that fast jesus fucking christ the creators of this game have an imagination than its 9999999 im at that part im stuck the final boss keeps greeting perfect or pixel more than me on the ci gauge at times i nearly beat him for him then survive with 1000300 hp then one shot me due to reason above i understand its final boss so it has to be hard but this is mostly bs and your cant stun him either 333 cell he knew he fucked up wait what how the cell did cell change into gogeta what is the song in the background 644 can you please explain how this makes sense the ending was heart warming oh shit cell final form revealed he was really xeno ssj3 gogeta the whole time your name wtf this game looks boring and way to flashy glad i didnt buy it i just want a open world dragonball z game what objects you use when did goku have a spirit sword which platform which this game will work steam version i noticed some super attacks dont even have sound damn son you played the shit out of this game i wish i was this dedicated to one game will be the case with the release of world of warcraft classic poggersss amazing character reactions theyre all most dying and when they talk theyre fit as fuck i love how they gave so much credit to the transformation ssj4 xenoverse had no screen time 1240 i havent heard this theme in a while looks like a freaking ps2 game come on now already so i assume that dbsh is what happens after gt in that case it fits perfectly so no voice acting in this game the best thing of this game is that they reused the models from budokai 3 how to change music to this and it took them years to actually localize this gem of a game that music is so good the story fucking sucks there i said it how do you get ultra completion i beat him using abilities like awe inspiring ssj3 and other pwr lvl boosting effects yet when i beat him it didnt give me the ultra completion any reason who else was at the last battle then couldnt beat it so you looked for the end who did you use in the team il give this game a go if they ever decide to do a remastered version how the fuck dose cell turn in to ssj3 gogeta pls man i need it i want to know what abilities did u use im at final battle right now how much chapters are there how you win the game in some days reee how many chapters are in this game what chapter is this in my lord i will never get tired of any incarnation of gogeta kicking ass that cutscene is just beautiful and whats this hes their strongest fusion is this modded just asking lol what kind of abilties did u used pls i need to know you know it felt off when berserk goku used hopes swordand cell turning gogeta for some reasonthen again this is hilarious what level were you by the time you reached the final boss amazing a ton of dragon ball characters but really disappointing game and gameplay all these characters needed to be in xenoverse 2 and fighterz not a goddam card game what awaste any way you can list the cards for your team id grind for that cell also which item allows you to take maximum 1k damage that skill is op is that the music in the game if so im turning off my sound effects wowthis is so awesome their recreate the scene where cell x turn into ssj3 gogeta why are something black cover cell x pickle how many chapter please how i get to the final chapter another day another game finished a gacha game with no iap this is what lifes all about boys i played dragon ball heroes long ago but i didnt know it came to the us im surprised does the community still play this game need to know before i purchase it going to pick it up am looking forward to it i love the graphics personally suits dragonball visual fidelity man thinks he is digital foundery im gonna buy dragon ball hero and yugioh for switch this black friday both good card game i play the jp version of sdbh world mission and i know how to make good designs for your custom characters so this is a card game just bought it for my kids i do not like people who collect action figures so i will never subscribe to this channel collecting useless figures is just like drug addiction i think you reviewed everything except for gameplay i love how you can create your own cards 60 dollars is too expensive for this quality i wish it was a card game i was duped tried it this game sucks i dont see the appeal at all this is babys first strategy game 36 dlares right now i played the demo today and it was so fun im gonna buy it soon bro why they gotta use dragon ball z budakai 3 models this is hero coliseum from xenoverse 2 what is bandai doing shakes head i dont play the tcg so i waited till someone on ebay would sell it at a good price just got it for 30 so im happy gonna wait and see what the big fuss is about lol qestion can i play with a friend in the same rume on 1 swich or most my friend get a switch and super dragon ball heros played the demo and was surprised by how fun it was picking up the full copy of the game soon that gacha machine i will spend a lot of time with me i dont really like this game i think its bad everyone its so much fun im gonna grind so much me well oh shit here we go again im thinking of getting it on pc ive been a hardcore dragon ball fan but i see mixed reviews on other sites saying its worth just 25 outta 5 and 4 out of 10 but looking at this video and comment section i can say many fans love this game i dont have any problem with graphics or gameplay as long as its fun and money is not the problem do you guys think i should go for it iv been playing the demo and its pretty good in a word yes if sdbh is using budokai graphics then that just proves how good they were back then because sdbhs graphics to me look as good as xenoverse 2 and is on par with allot of other switch games like smash ultimate and xenoblade chronicles 2 7mins in and you havent said shit relevant what ever happen to games like dragonball gt final bout how is it for the pc can i use a controller for it dont like using keypad and mouse this is my main issue with the game i was well aware this was a card game with some graphics and stuff before release my thing is i dont think it is worth 60 dollars i would say 30 would be more appropriate but 60 for a new card game no yugioh and even magic the gather even though i dont play magic has always been about 20 to 30 dollars for their video games the dragon ball series was not recognize for their card games because there was another one they had and the anime the dragon ball series has always been known as a fighting game now i am interested what they are planning for an rpg game coming out at a later date but i have to see more first before i buy so for this game it looks like it is a cool card game with some extra feature but i dont see it being a price of a full new game it should be price as an arcade which this is what it is that is between 2030 dollars not 60 my biggest concern is that the price will turn people off and that not many people will be playing online nintendo switch that terrible db gt final bout song ugh i get ptsd from that shit this was solid review the kaioken 10 blue is cannon my biggest complaint would be how avatar transformations were handled they should let you pick ss1 2 or 3 and make the god classes similar to previous ones letting you transform into ssg or ssb instead of always staying in it just subscribed you got any tutorial videos i feel like ill love this game more when i figure out all the abilities and such i honestly stopped caring about heroes they waited almost 10 years to take this outside of japan and about 34 years in i got tired of waiting just like dragonball online and phantasy star online 2 yall have fun but ill pass on this is it worth it every game is worth it as long as you enjoy it for that is what they are made for whys his hair look normal when you look at his face but when you look at his hair it looks weird 5 ads in 17 mins jesus looks good but personally ill wait for a least a small price drop its like dokkan attle but with more mechanics but little bad graphics but the most important thing is it has no fucking mycrotrans so yes it is worth in my opinion and im gonna buy that this game is cool i have it in the pc and touchscreen is supported if you have the hardware pvp is broken turned me off from the game im enjoying it still trying to understand all the mechanics but it been good so far if u interested in dragon ball heroes but theres no dragon ball heroes arcade machine avaiable i can assure u 60 is more than worth u need to think how much money u need to play on arcade and the amount money needed for physical card u want to buy since i believe its rng too in real world its such a beautiful yet simple concept with such a basic style that all real and honest fans of dragon ball will love it especially if you liked the look of budakai and enjoyed dokkan and legends its like a very beautiful mix lets make a playstation version happen d i need help which dragon ball game should i get this or fighterz i really need a response game quality is complete shit in my opinion its such a fun game no no microtransactions for a card game what if the dlc is free then this is in my top 5 switch games gonna say no i like the gogeta cards that came with the game but they werent enough to make my purchase feel like it was worth it maybe if it were like 30 i might say kinda at the current full price though no i mean really its a glorified gacha game that could probably be easily ported to mobile not saying its a bad game by any means im just saying this doesnt feel like a 60 game everyone on about the graphics but have you seen vegeta blueevolved gamma burst flash obviously not all the characters are like this but game has its moments this could have been like any other card game without the battle animations plz banda port budokai 3 to the switch 2 me graphics dont make a good game its the play ability and story can you make through the first few missions and are you having fun can you understand the storyline to me thats what makes a good game we give this review an 1110 is there any different between pc and switch version i have to thank you for your review you settled my mind on purchasing it its definitely more worth than a 90 dragon stone pack which is nearly equivalent to the price of the game u need to be ready for something new no fighting game you need to be ready to be more tactical its a good game story mode is meh select variety is great with the extra possibility to create your own card its a fun game but as a dbz fan who nearly buys every dbz game heroes is not a game i where i would spend my time on grinding rather finishing the story and play it from time to time i wish we had the arcades and the physical cards short answer no this is a 2010 arcade card game its not worth the price its asking wish the yugioh game coming to switch adapted the menu and hub style anybody else having trouble with there i just bought the physical copy and my game shut down on me sayingthe same thing my digital copy was saying the software was closed because an error occurred i actually like the game i didnt think id like it this much of course youre going to say its worth it you got it for free i dont get it how does one justify a 60 price tag when it has ps2 graphics and team building with qte gameplay this is a 20 game its ridiculous the lengths people will go to just to get their own favorite db character meanwhile a free game on ios db legends actually has better graphics i honestly wouldnt be so mad if the graphics we above average a 60 price tag almost always implies that the graphics will be at least above average graphics whatever ill pick it up eventually when its on sale and maybe ill the justification for the 60 price tag my only complaints about the game is that the switch version doesnt support cloud back saves so 10000 hours can easly be lost if your switch breaks the second complain is that i wished they had all the missions and cards from the 3ds versions but i guess bandai is saving that for the next dragon ball heroes game on the switch just started watching this surprised kids watch this as it shows him nude i like the show so far lol it reminds me of rainbow brite but for guys with raunchy stuff theres a lot of series and episodes so well see if i can get past dragon ball after that i think its z idk its funny so far i do see why people like it this game looks cool too yes it is worth it this game gives me that throwback yugioh legacy of the duelist feeling but ofcourse with updated visuals and fast paced loving it rn is this game playable on mobile the one thing i am still trying to figure out is how does this game actually work the graphics is heavy nostalgic for me so that has me sold it is dbz so that is also an easy selling point but i want to know how the card game works what is the winning and losing conditions how does a battle take place like i go full on attack and then go full on defend does card placement have a huge role in this is it victory determined by who has the strongest fighters or is there is a deeper mechanic involved things like that i downloaded via data transfer from a laptop so i can play on my s10 it actually runs fairly well on my phone in desktop mode 710 game will continue playing this would be my first time playing something like this but it was the card creation that really peaked my interest is it possible to construct a completely customized deck the game is a lot of fun when ever i see these videos my first thought is too late this could easily be a phone game of people are bitching about how the game looks they clearly didnt play one of the best dragon ball games ever this looks so trashy how many cards are there in the game and is there a chance they may add cards later i am curious because im debating on getting it now or later i just have so many games im wanting and honestly xenoverse 2 on switch is more in my budget at the moment hey whether dragon ball heroes cards will be in europe i actually am super excited to get the copy i ordered cus it has pretty much any character you could think ofwant to be playable even if youre like me and you like non popular characters like oceanus shenron pure evil buu baby etc and the graphics arent horrible if you grew up with the older games one of my all time favorites was budokai tenkaichi 3 hi nano and everyone just a quick question do you guys get the free 11 cards from the nintendo eshop version cause i didnt and would like to know how to get them thanks can you play2 players on the same switch is there like a reward factor like events etc to get good cards i just hope its a challenge like in a way dokkan is something to gain maybe then just do the story until youre bored idk anything about the heroes games the ideas are so much better than xenoverse freeproduct currently stuck on training with pan 5 trying to get ultra completion dang its tough sdbh wm blends a mix of tactical combat and rpg elements with fighting it reminds me of the dragon quest rpgs because of the turnbased tactical combat it is also a digital card game where the player has to spend time editing and creating cards this can be a bit of a turnoff for those who prefer pure fighters with the number of characters 350 and beautifully rendered models i would have liked to see dimps make budokai 4 or a sort of spiritual successor i think everyone loves the budokai graphics and feel because it brings back memories just imagine if they made another budokai installment and it was online multiplayer id rather get straight into the fighting rather than pay 60 bucks to stare at cards all day and play repetitive minigames theres no english audio if its cards you want to play you could just get gwent for free i think that most people who get free copies and try to say if its worth x amount doesnt really know because they didnt have to spend the money themselves not knocking the review in any way but i just feel thats what some people give off wouldnt it be great if dokkan and legends were like this no microtramsactions just earn everything by playing the game yes my hard worked money my mom duh looks like dokkan with less to do less characters worse graphics and less portability but you get to button mash so people who like those sort of games will like it i cant believe this game actually sold out in my city i had to order it i got super saiyan 4 bardock last night and i screamed ive already put more than 20 hours into this game and i can say ive got my moneys worth of enjoyment out of this game hey im nygg i play dokkan and db legends too come and see my channel ight nano i trust you i like card games and love dragonball sooooo ima buy it tomorrow ill send you a pick tomorrow on twitter does the world mission in the title denote that its not a full version of the game from japan or is this the same full game but just on a differemt system is this music from the game i have been really interested in this game i just dont know whether to buy it on pc or for my switch thoughts should have been a mobile game tbh isnt worth 60 bucks reminds me of supersonic warriors 2 on gbc i loved that game i honestly feel like its worth at most 45 bucks but shit im down to get it if anyone is looking for a friend on switch for this game my friend code is sw007584542718 this game looks super wack i think ill get it when it goes on sale steam sales can be fantastic and also it comes with 5 free gogeta ssg cards i see that this has gacha and the only game that had gachas that i have played is bleach brave souls are their any similarities between the too thx cant wait to buy the game ive seen so many people say oh this game shouldnt be an 7080 game but i mean if you were to play the arcade machine in japan youd be buying physical card packs so paying 80 to potentially get 1000 cards for free and the game not having micro transactions seems fair to me also since afaik the arcade game is ahead of the current switchpc game theirs definitely potential for future content in the form of free or paid dlc i dont have that game yet but it looks amazing thx for explaining nano so i was playing dokkan and i seen yours and rhymes names where you pick a guest character could it possibly come out on ps4 but for 60 thoughidk its amazing i feel like the combat in the game is lacking i do enjoy the characters and the card effects tho its deceptively addicting the only thing i was wondering is how tall is rhymestyle damn i love the game but i hate the fact that my charakters attack my enemys completly at random i get the attack order of my own charakters but you cant tell who they are going to attack except when there is only one enemy type on the enemys board mines downloading once i get off work its game time tbh it looks like it should be a phone game and it could likely easily run on a phone the only issue with that is there would likely be microtransactions after 10 hours of game time i can honestly say that if you dont have it already then youre probably good not getting it the game is fun at first but it becomes really repetitive farm tickets summon farm summon and dont get me started on how hard it is to get some of the higher tier units like it is a single player game why not make the rates better for the sec units if you really want to play this game then i recommend waiting for the price to come down and if you dont have a switch just get it on steam since getting a switch especially for this game alone is not worth it imo dont believe all the youtubers since they are sponsored by bandai and are probably paid to give good advertisements for it i bought the game last night yet whenever i start the game it shows a picture and a blue loading bar but closes a few seconds after i use a dell windows and i have tried a few different things to get it working unfortunately nothing has changed my star wars empire at war loads and plays just fine i really would love to play this game but it just doesnt load can anyone help it would be greatly appreciated i wish it was a game for ps4 and i dont live in japan just got the game the other day and wowwy wow im hooked lol well after getting into dokkan before this still new to dokkan as well but yea totally worth getting for sure tho im having sooooo much fun playing the storythe cardsthe charactersthe other stuff is all awesome d really enjoying it very much becides that i just pulled for more cards to see if i can get more playable ones then the ones i have and i just got the dark king lol if we buy the game right now do you still get the dragon ball super card game cards this game is fucking amazing i wanted heroes games to come to us for a while and theres so many characters already in base game and theres gonna be more added i can play as super saiyan 4 bardock and all the gods of destruction like bruh the game just looks to poor for me to get into it most importantly it has all those wacky ssj4 brolys and your ssj3 gogetas and all that one of the best dragon ball games period can u tell everyone legends to add kaioken goku animation and it has vegeta with him and both kills frieza it is worth it for sure do a dual summon on dragonball heroes why didnt ign or any other big company review this yet great game for fans totally worth it if you like card collecting and dragon ball i already have a game card similar to this as addon on xv2 but i still prefer dokkan i always wonder how much does that arcade machine cost it will be much better than the switch lol shorthand version for me at least hell yeah it is saw the launch preview of the game on the news tab of the switch as a dragon ball fan i was pumped i bought it almost immediately and started it up first impression uhthis was 60 bucks really and what is this battle system and why are these graphics not like fighterz i was disheartened i really regretted my purchase but i kept playing and did my first multi summon and then my second and then my third and i pulled that first secret rare and then another i got so invested in the characters and the team building that i didnt realize that what i initially thought were flaws of the game didnt bother me anymore eventually i started to like them appreciate the different super attack animations the different types of cards everything grew on me needless to say its worth it nano whats whith the serious words whats the name of the music at 031 to 047 ok thanks people in the comments down below ill now buy the game just bought itthe fact i like yugioh and dragonball i hope to keep me busy many hours lmaooo pulled ur android 21 on a uvm banner normal gacha ticket i like that you are trying to take your chancel and expand it to do thing like reviews instead of just dokkan but please make sure you are spreading correct information when you unlock a path in sdbh wm it actually takes you to a whole new map where the changes get even bigger spoilers in the first chapter the second map has all 3 of the sayins going ssj3 and this is where the harder matches take place in the story play it dude i like how everyone here has the game and im just like i have no moneyno pcno switchwell i guess ill just watch nano play it then good morning people on youtube i have a question and would like an honest answer please i got sdbh for the switch but while im waiting on getting my own switch soon a friend let me borrow their switch so my question here is if i play sdbh on my friends switch would i be able to play on my new switch with the same data or is this game not cloud based sorry for the ignorance lol i got a switch to get this game for starters and will get mor eventually aha dokkan battle should have a creation mode too i wish they would bring it to mobile just skip out on the cooler multis youll be fine it should be released on android and ios too i like the graphics and now i will wait to have money to buy this game thank you nano 3 why are most people playing this game is it that good goku leaks that should some proof that he might be coming and super dragon ball heroes are only a exclusive to switch and pc but this is small info i know this isnt related to much about this video about but there might be some chance for goku to be in idk why but the game reminder me the tv show chaotic you knew from the beginning of this video that you were going to say that the game it was worth ityou were at bandaihellonext time just start with the truth sheesh17min i will never get back lolgreat channel thoughand yes you got me lol if i play a lot of dokkan do you think id like this game legends graphics are better lol this game looks so garbage for the big hype i already ordered mine cant wait until it gets to me protip if you get the switch version find yourself a switchcompatible stylus its way better than using your finger how does this game calculate damagelike i have it and love it i just dont understand how i can know who to use to guard and how much damage theyre guarding and when im in attack how much damage ill be doing does anyone know is the pc version worth buying if i dont own a switch its reallyyyy fun if you can ignore the bad graphics for a 2019 game why does it look so bad looks fun but looks so bad will you do a series of this game do you need online to be able to enjoy the game what race did you go with bruh i pulled the ssbe vegeta ability mui goku on my first day i pre ordered this game picked it up on release day and i dont even have a switchyet lol what im seeing is if you have no expectations on what it should be like youll enjoy it so whats recommended switch version or pc is it preference im assuming it is thank you for this video it helped me decide wether or not to get this game cant wait to play how can you tell what your card rarity is idk if this has been confirmed or not but only reason why im waiting before buying is cause i want to see if they update the game or is it gonna be left as is heroes in jp is so good cause rhey get constant updates w new arc and cards but if the switch versiok dont get updates then idk could you speak more in depth on the cards and their effects like how do i know which effects are god tier and which ones are just average only for switch for pc its not worthy can you do a giveaway for some people to have a chance to get it cus there is people like me that is going through a hard time like is my case my mom hast to have a brain surgery and we haft to save are money im not asking for a copy i would just wont people like me that are having a hard time to have a chance to wine and keep making vids you make my day so much better and if you read this thank you for taking your time thank will buy it with nintendo switch on black friday i brought it just so we can hopefully get more games like this in the west and i really enjoy the game quite a lot an actual online lobby would of have been alot better in my opinion and if you were able to actually move you camera but other than that its an amazing game thanks for this this game is great i been doing some puzzle challenges and they really help me learn the in and out of this game plus not to mention they offer great early accessories my advice is to always look at the specific details of each card because one move can turn the tide of battle game is freaking great getting summoned so essentially this is dbgrand order 0 that sounds e p i c if we get uvm gachas from 3 to 7 game gonna be fire i love this game but for me it has one major flaw and that is pvp the current meta is really boring in short you get one shotted left and right the game is guaranteed over after round 2 if not decided at round 1 there is a limited amount of things you can do against this strategies with only 7 cards in your deck and the fact that you cant look at the enemies cards to see what they can do not even after battle i just hoped that the balancing is better for a card game that is around for 8 years adhoc i see that networking degree showing itself are you going to stream this it looks pretty fun but theres no way im spending 80 for it hopefully if in years or so if super dragon ball heros sell well they might come to ps4 and xbox i would love that and for steam moders make a yugioh pack please that would be a cool mod ive collected the japanese cards for a while now and i have some pretty amazing and rare cards some are even 80 dollars worth i hope i can use them with the english version cause im still good with just collecting the cards cause there way better quality than the super ones yet i still collect both versions lol its reallt fun now the thrill of pulling new cards and tons of customization for the cards but eventually itl get boring because once you have almost everything unlocked what do you do then i was born in japan and grew up there but 3 years ago i moved to the usa and i miss this dragon ball card game a lot i wish they can bring this card game to the us my only question is when are you and rhyme gonna duel each other i cant buy it on nintendo because im poor i think they should give dokkan battle event to sdbh and if u got dragon ball heroes cards in ur colection so u can use ur dokkan id to transfer dbh cards from dokkan do sdbh and it would be very useful for every player which starts playin this game on switch pc this game is so fun love using the different teams and unique supers can you run a full ssj4 team if so does it work love dokkan hate heroes let me down big time maybe with dlc i can enjoy it more but i know they are just going to try to get more money out of us yes it is till a certain point but now that the game is in english and i seen loads of opportunity i dont think i will be bored plus this is the first ever gatcha game where you dont have to spend real money on it so people should be glad about that bought it yesterday played it for 12 hours straight this game look awesome but i have the doubt if i need to spend real money to get the cards how do i turn on dubbed voice on pc how do u know the rarity of cards wish this was on ps4 bro can u do some gameplay of this game nano is heroes worth getting a switch for now that sdbh is released world wide will dokkan throw heros on global if so will they try to hit us with it before globals 4yr banners only times will tell lets face it we just wont these cards on global dokkan bruh now i need a switch lol for this game im not gonna be buying this game the now because my reason is that i have never ever play the actual card game itself and i have got a butt load of the actual cards that are just for collecting and im not gonna fork out 4699 for an arcade slash card game so ill stick to assassins creed 3 remastered for the time being i may only be 7 hours in but i love it omg this game is amazing can you use the cards you make offline like it arcade or maybe story and play the missions you make not gonna lie this is the best dbz game i have ever bought in my opinion an it might be my favorite one i ever played i hope the add the backup feature to this game because i noticed that u cant backup the game data on a storage card idk why but still fun 910 i was actually gonna cop this but i wasnt sure on the gameplay really helpful review thanks the answer is duh dokkan can actually learn from dbh and put pvp in it with similar gameplay to this i think i didnt know nano was that buff how does card customization work can i use it on any mission and pvp or no nano will there be gameplay videos on heroes from you dude the legend of zelda ocarina of time n64 looks better than this hahaha is the only problem for me about this game so much fun but looks like shit lets be real nano is life really worth it its time to dudududuel im loving the game and a couple units have some seriously powerful abilities without spoilers the ability to steal hp in this sort of game is justamazing alright im probably going to pick this up can we have nano vs rhym super dragon ball heroes fights this game is a lot funner than i thought it would be and i thought it would be pretty fun browsing around 90 of criticism is the graphics like yeah it doesnt look great but its also easy to look past that i can get if this kinda game aint your cup of tea but its sad to judge it only on the looks edit browsing around steam and other stuff and seeing why people dont like the game it seem a game for who love db i need it i might get a switch cause of this game oof my boi nano so glad i purchased this game im enjoying it so much if it was 30 it would be a lot more compelling dammit i got yoshi instead of this cause there was barely anything that showed the game in depth do you guys think theyll keep supporting this game with additional content like dlc kinda bummed out that i cant use blue gogeta or movie broly but not saying im not enjoying the game but hopefully theyll add free dlc later on rhyme has 1000 day goku which you and datruth dont have therefore rhyme wins its dokkan battle with an upfront cost and i cant play it while im at work so nah what is um2 do you mean uvm brilliant game think i might get mario odyssey instead its so cool cuz have budokai models if uve played budokai 1 2 n 3 the graphics should have not bothered u in the least bit trash game bandai namco been releasing alot of garbage lately like one piece world seeker and this old 2010 dbz game thats 9 years old now good review going to subscribe i getting it cause its a lot like dokkan and i love that game to death a gacha game w no transactions looks like dokkan got bested do multi battles with rhynestyle save up 10 gacha tickets and use a team out of those 10 on a team and fight glad they didnt decide on microtransactions 3 might pick it up now dang man i want to sell my csgo knife to buy this game on steam but i cant bc i got my phone stolen so i have to wait 15 days for me to be able to use the market again feelsbadman im super excited for this game when do you think super dragon ball hero banner coming back to jp my only worry was mirco transactions but since it doesnt have any ill be buying this game d hey nano why dont you stream some sdbh on twitch noto nano fam whats happening i dont have a switch or pc havent played it yet but definitely going to buy i do wish it had interaction pad like skylanders and we had the physical cards but i play yugioh used to play wow card game and played the dragon ball super card this looks so fun and worth the buy i dont think its worth it for 60 dollars ill wait 6 months for it to go on some kinda sale and pick it up for like 3040 of course nano will say yes if he doesnt bandai wont send him anymore games for free lol yes absolutely so stop scrolling in the comments and buy it after you finished watching his video oc who wants to donate a switch hey guys can you check out my amvs i really work hard on them even though i am still a noob not asking for a sub but just your thoughts you guys might saw me commenting in videos of nano rhyme and others so i am not a random person i am a loyal sub just asking for appreciation beacuse i have been suffering from critism lately i hope you guys understand nano i like that video where you taught us how to play the game freeproduct again im here early now thats what im talking about aside from fighterz the budokai series has the best looking graphics i cant get the game my mom kidlikesdb wont get she thinks its inappropriate game is not nanofam freeproduct the game is so much fun with potential 10s of hours of gameplay and being able to collect cards is great i hate when people complain about the graphics personally i love them because theyre like budokai and seeing these characters in those graphics is pretty nostalgic and i just love it i mean not every game has to have absolutely amazing graphics so hyped to play a nonfighting dragonball game ok i am grinding metal coolers event in dokkan while watching but still dude anyone reading this and even likes dragon ball but can afford this game even if you wont play go buy a copy it will help support the brand which means dragon ball will be more mainstream this game blew away my expectations im loving this game making me a ssj4 team got ssj4 gohan last night this game it too much fun bandai invites nano to play with ndakuba and ryhme nano is it worth playing sdbh world mission bandai triggered like im already sold on the game yes its dokkan but more in deph and has more unique characters some features arent available in the initial tutorial game might seem simple but its a tad deeper than tje first bit shows i love card games so this game is very entertaining for me touch still says touch on pc but its very simple left stick to move shoulder buttons to switch cards bruh the budokai graphics brought a nostalgic feel back to me that i thought i would never feel luckly free stuff i also want yes from me seriously im pretty darn convinced that dokkan was somewhat based off heroes and might even have helped them decided to give is wm after all these years im loving it wouldnt have watched you rhym and kauba tutorials if i didnt think so so absolutely i love the game some excited to see you play it hopefully gonna be amazing if you do lets go can you do some gameplay for us all bring hero coliseum back with rhyme and this game please freeproduct i can see why people are on the fence about price but honestly its worth it the graphics are like an upgraded budokai game over 350 characters thats waaay more then tenkaichi 3 and its a new weird fun way to experience a dragon ball game idc if its a budokai animation style i love budokai but as a card game not quite sure hello it looks like yu gi oh at the start i need more heroes content please play this game on the channel i know someone gotta know by now the fastest farming method for gacha tickets what is dragon ball heroes thats easy its that series of cards we want in dokkan and xenoverse bruh where the name v rhyme heros vids at ima be controversial maybe notgames better than legends and dokkan lets play mor dis bitch edit just mad bc i got cucked on both those games so much lol dude yes it is worth it its a fun rpg styled game except with card mechanics and the supers are incredible to look at plus its bound to include the prison planet saga as dlc or thru update everybody its so much fun nano is it worth to buy me i pulled ssj4 gogeta and mui goku on my first summon it should be cheaper im too poor to get it but i will still continue to support you even though i envy you did this boi say is it worth it of course it is never mind our support did help im really happy that youre reviewing this game nano i was skeptical on it but i think if going to get it now thanks nano uses wifi on his switch im going to get this game and it looks pretty fun to play was kinda hoping a ps4 release as well but guess not when does the arcade game come to america i enjoy it greatly but want english localization badly is this a port from an arcade game graphics are not too much of an issue for me kinda like the hero coullaseum im not terribly far in it yet and some of the mechanics are still a little goofy for me but i like it its a fun change of pace plus i like seeing all the random iterations of characters that have come from this series 057 i knew it didnt even watch 20 sec of the video and you have a copy short answer yes absolutely hmm id honestly play it casually than get really deep into it what are you talking about nano your going to get it when it come out wheres the legends pvp videos at though lol im so hyped about the xeno characters especially xeno vegito nano always bring the best content once again dude i got to get this game great vid man now i need it love the channel nanofam nano rocking the retro nanogenix shirt yes it is got it on pc and im loving it this game its like dokkan battle with steroids i didnt know rhymestyle is talker than you i always thought you was taller btw you and rhymestyle should do a dragonball parady i think my issue with this game is not so much that the game is bad or anything like that the issue is with the price this game just doesnt scream to me as a full price triple a game i think that if you arent crazy about this game but want to try it out i would just wait for a price drop of some kind near 40 imo i dont have a switch so its definitely not worth buying one and then getting a game that is basically 10 years old imo i love the super dragon ball heroes anime better though because its just straight fan service good job nano keep up the great work keep up the great videos man i got the game too i am loving it are you gonna do gameplay videos on it i want it but have no money freeproduct been waiting for dis yes it is first will nano heart my comment love the vids i watch them everyday please like my comment i dont got a switch but ill still watch the video ive only been playing for like 5 hours but its honestly some of the most fun ive ever had with a dragon ball game first its worth it if you like playing a card game and dragon ball z short answer yes was waiting for that bell ma boi first plus i have it on switch i bought the game and it seems pretty fun so far is there an easy way to get the vegito which is the strongest card in the dlc pack thats great video my friend can you help me how to get collect battle data accessory anyone know how to get torrential magic is anyone else kinda disappointed with the new ahms card why cant we ever get a good goku black rose card there all trash towa looks hella thicc xeno ssj4 vegito and ssgss gogeta togetherthe strongest fusion teamup in dragon ball i want the game so bad like literally are we ever gonna get that transformation rush dbs broly love that xeno vegetto keeps his black hair instead of turning bright red or brown give ssj4 xeno vegito havin x10 final kamehameha shine if not atomic blast fuse with final kamehameha the cards from uvm911 u might seen like broly dark unmasked towamind controlled laggs godslayer hearts more xenoverse 2 modders where you at galatic sword and god big bang kamehameha vegito as godly as slo i got gogeta on my first summon but still trying to get vegito but awesome demonstration wait the dlc is all ready out nani i got gogeta blue now all i need is vigeto ssj4 and my dream team i complete what is the stat boost accessory you are using damn ss4 xeno vegitos japanese name for his super attack was called galaxy sprint sword i like that name better than the one here i really want that xeno vegito card it looks great is the update out for steam yet slo how do you get torrential magic btw love your video bro your amazing bro i think theres a goku card that summons shenron that doesnt do the wish thing it does something different and theres also a vegeta card that summons super shenron im happy cause i finally have db heroes dont mean to be obnoxious but first and that vegito is godly what a shit gameplay soo stupid i finally gotten past chapter 31 that i was stuck on for a long time strictly speaking that is the bardock bardock and the old one now isnt 2346 um attacking with perfect cell and get a perfect on other attack coincidence i think not black mold is a mold that you have charges up and the other one allied a boost i got all the broly cards last week i still only have about 200 cards out of 1177 this will take a while lol if anyone sees this im having trouble getting goku and vegeta to fuse i have goku br and vegeta br on the same team but when it reaches round 2 the fusion screen doesnt show up does anyone know why i hav eall the charaters i know how to become a berserker in your avatar broo of course you lost no items on a custom deck one handed gohan kamahahahmeaha i hate how the added characters can only be summoned with rare gacha is the brasil deck ok gogate blue is good but lets say it all toghever vegito ssgss super is op and have a big chance of one shot realy it a move that if you land your prosent to win is 99999999999999999999 how to update the pc game version stop saying street fighter moves bitch you should have watched video i have the game but i only have god goku and vageta but god no i have blue goku n vageta its sad im tellin ya being a gamer is hard but funnn in the end you still suck just like the story mode you got owned by universe 7 were you able to pull gogeta blue i actually pulled all the cards the day it came out 3 i dont know why but my game hasnt updated please help me i really want to get the new cards so the character stickers are random one question is it the old dragon ball heroes cards will be dlc for this game just sucks you have to use rare tickets because i think that was dumb because again its so easy to get the cards you want i got them all in an hour i personally like the transition to 3d looks nice the best way to get tickets is by beating the secret boss from the tournament mode finish all tournament form d to s then it should be unlocked the first time it will give you 3 rare tickets and 100k zenis everytime you beat it after it gives 3 rare gasha tickets again 200k znis and 3x xp capsule ndukaubanever heard of him you can download the update manualy if youre conected to the internet without online i got normal and fury broly goku bluevegeta blue and god vegeta on my first multi summons now you know how i feel in legends wait hold up is he right are all of the upcoming dlcs free legends is on the phone right but its graphics are better than xenoverse thats amazing cuz xenoverse is b o r i n g i have everyone from the added cards set except goku xeno bardoc and cheelai god vegeta card looks clean anyway to gold tickets faster just farm on arcade mode i get alot of rare tickets from competing the arcs i think the best way to beat that team is to use the exact same team lmao where do iget thi game help lol guys where i can download update from i cant find it anywhere i am playing on pc its jine you write it gine but you sey jine my question is why do u have two switches gine looks a lil bit too happy to be kicking ass and getting hurt i thought gogeta blue was in legends for a sec if only i swear man he got gogeta from dragon ball legends and supers hero world mission i like the video very cool viedo oh and first person to see the video ndukauba what units do you want in the dbl anniversary nice and powerful yo im 1st can i play on windows xp isnt it time to get rid of these disgusting ass budokai models card deck games garbage hard pass its sad this has more content in it than fighterz man they really went all out still think this isnt worth 60 though 60 for a game with ps2 graphics qualitynope is there character customization looks really nice just hoping youre not getting every charactercard from the beginning of the game but since they say collect over a 1000 cards in the trailer im sure that wont be the case yes please release it also will it only be available on steam or any other retailers maybe physical copies trash people who compare this game to ygo have actually never touched a ygo card in their entire lives jaw drops mommy i want that i cant wait its basically db legends and xenoverse 2 coliseum mixed together those graphics are complete early ps2 poop and that giant disclaimer on the box is unsightly too but i appreciate any trailer that actually talks about gameplay why not on xbox ima have to buy a console just to play this game cuz i dont got nintendo switch this is the least hyped and enthusiastic trailer voice over ive ever heard may as well be saying buy the game or dont i couldnt care less nnnooooooooo i will have to buy a switch to play it these comments are a little surprising it seems people have never heard of dragon ball heroes bro these graphics are something outta budokaitenkaichi 3 it looks old and uninteresting from the new dragon ball games how in da fuck can general tao do damage to ultra instinct goku my dick measures up to general tao wheres the yugioh version of this i wonder if theres gonna be a english dub with it im 90 sure it wont but the voices are fine the way they are this game is trash its dokkan and dragon ball legends mixed with worst graphics tbh anyone who waste more than 20 on this is a fool tbh like it looks fun and strategic but not worth what theyre asking im sure this looks like final bout for the playstation 1 this looks like a modded shin budokai rom for a psp emulator this looks like final bout for the playstation 1 so its basically that mini game in xenoverse 2 i never been into these type of games for some reason i just want some new info on project z i hope the next one has actually nintendo switch graphics free interesting but why the game has playstation 2 graphics so is it free to play or must i buy it and when yes how much dokkan players are most excited for this look at dem graphics better than xenoverse 2 battle crap is there going to be a demo i really dont want to take the risk of purchasing this game as the gameplay is a bit questionable and kind of confusing in the trailer so much content at launch d yess why still we cant pre order it on steam lol isnt this basically that card game in dbx2 how much will this cost i think i might like this game these character models look like they were pulled straight from an old boudakai game xd httpsimgurcomadrivbgi nappa ssj confirmed take my money this gameplay looks like complete shit holy hell what is this for console pc what some of the card effect translations seem a little engrishy holy hades its dragon ball meets yugioh cannot wait 50 decks holy shit i really want a new fist of the north star game or maybe a grappler baki game wtf the graphics look like a ps2 game just give us the rpg you have activated my trap card kamehameha wonder what will be missing since ultimate mission x had over 3000 and this has 1160 also whats up with android 18 in a tracksuit hoping we can also unlock her in her regular outfit im not really into card games but itd be interesting to see how long this holds my attention just like the adventure time card game ultimate mission x has prepared me for this moment its like hero colosseum budokai 3 if it was on steroids and was a card game this is just dragon ball legends with more feature is this a mobile game is this narrated by david hayter guys you created fighterz last year i think a game where you can barely control your characters and looks not nearly as good might feel a bit underwhelming all the people how complains about the graphics stfu omg why so emo i hate to be that guy but this game already looks dated i have play v only switch and pc not stains i cannot find this on steam is it a region think or it will come out eventually looks like it wont be dubbed since the text in the game was in english and the audio wasnt would have been awesome to also have this on ps4 reminds me of legendary super saiyan warrior the real ones remember i dont see my nigga cunber and people were thinking fighterz graphics are terrible lul same crappy look as xenoverse dragon ball z budokai tenkaichi 3 the card game thumbnail reminded me of shin budokai 2 is there a reason its not available to pre order the digital version yet its not on the us nintendo online store yet only the japanese store very serious question since this is the first installment of db heroes to be localized will it include at least a plot summary of what happened on the other games the graphics xenoverse better than news culdcept for switch please i hope bandai namco entertainment to make dragon ball xenoverse 3 and new anime crossover games aftersuper dragon ball heroes world mission and jump force this trailer makes it seem like dragon ball heroes is something thats only just come around to existing while its existed for years in japan i was hoping this was an open dragon ball world free roam online game but its a phone game so basically dragon ball z turned into a yugioh game i need this game yesterday ago now do this but yugioh how bout we get super dragon ball heroes roster with the tenkaichi gameplay are we going to ignore the fact that the character models are ripped off from dbz budokai 3 and altered to fit new transformations 254 what quit making such crappy games just give us new budokai so its more like tactical turn base rpg instead huh dragon ball legends on android so is this really the arcade card game they have over in japan what a shit i though it was a real fight cooperative gamenot a fuck shit cards game to the people complaining about the models looking old its a card game with over 1k cardsof course the models arent going to look amazingthe fact that there are models to begin with is already great im actually eager for it no english dub yes buy dragon balls japanese dub is so much better than the english dub so thank you for not wasting your time and money on it japanese goku english goku this game is gonna flop and then they are gonna blame arcsys and take away tournaments again how lazy their literally using the same character models from the budokai series i am all of the hype bandai please fix the constant crashing in the jump force game seriously this come first i want my dragon ball xenoverse 3 finally i hate how game just make ui goku hair same like his base form hair cmon ui hair is a bit different its stand spiky like a horn a bit very cool finaly im going to understand this game we have companies that r getting shut down for making one bad game and yet bandai namco still hasnt gone bankrupt after making so many shitty games is pretty mind blowing for android pls pls mercenary tao beating ui gokus ass is a sight create a card mode exists me jeice with dragon fist vegeta with special beam cannon frieza with kamehameha broly with supernova etc dragon ball x yugioh cant wait to see dark magician to make a special appearance didnt expect to ever see that game in the west cool this better be a phone game cause the graphics look shitty games fo bleach pls games fo bleach pls games fo bleach pls games fo bleach pls yo this is kinda clean i dont play card games very often but this looks pretty cool why is everyone dissing out the graphics its not all about graphicsfor example db fighters and jump force have the best graphing but the story was terrible strongest players on dbrb2 httpsyoutubeg8vipevch7u can yall make a website to make your own card and order it that would be fun trash game not a real db game lmfao ive waited years for this im so excited gonna buy it once it comes out on steam ive been waiting for years until dbh comes to the west and it finally happens what a time to be alive thank you very much bandai namco d please dont tell me some cards will be taken out from the japanese version best new feature filter and search for cards its missing in the nintendo 3ds games its difficult to create a deck when you have more than 1000 cards and cant filter im curious how the power up motions will work without a touch screen or physical cards things like shaking the cards to power up or moving the card in a kamehameha motion ive played a ton of the 3ds games and have even played the arcade game a few times so im used to those sorts of controls now also glad creation mode is back from umx i thought majin buu had his eyes opened on the thumbnail for a second lol he looks so hilarious when he opens them should of been free to play so glad that the switch gets this and the ps4 and xbox one gets an amazing looking rpg so happy to only own a switch best 30 player dragon ball xenoverse 2 kingofxenoverse2 not among them httpsyoutubehmony0zgahy or and just spitballing here you make a dbs card game for mobile instead of just a tutorial will this game have the english voice cast i know bandai never dubs anything except dragonball because theyre cheap but im just questioning how cheap they can get to not have to get the english voice for a smaller dragonball game i enjoyed so much ultimate mission ultimate mission 2 and ultimate mission x and i am sure i will enjoy world mission to the fullest if only i can speed up time to already get the game faster im pumped for this game my only hope is that we can choose what race our character is going to be cause who knows maybe i wanna be a namekian again youd think they would up the graphics with the technology we have today honestly thats my only gripe about the game right now until i physically play the game if the graphics were a little better it would gain a lot more attention long live dragon ball im getting this game love the db franchise this game free or not what are the difference between db heroes and super db heroes world mission dragon ball project z is going to be trash drop xenoverse 3 instead i ws saying to my self like whos bright i did was it to make dbz a card game wat a down grade interesting it would be sweet if they made a version for playstation and xbox if only this was a xenoverse 3 i am first hit like plz and nice game first cool when will we get a new trailer of dragon ball project z you would voice dyspo just for your notice the ss4 module is a shenron module you can wish for them like how you wished for super god class how to get super blue with a boy you could probably voice uub nothing racist or anything im black too jst saying i can see u voicing dyspo youll be voicing probably the evil sayian definitely seeing you va cumba my dude i could see you voicing sealas because why not i would say that you could voice dispo i dont know if i spelled that right kaube voicin paikuhan and ion wanna hear anything else probably sealas can u try froze team in the next vid berserk super saiyan goku is the most op character my guy one of the namekians from universe 6 i could see you voicing piccolo tbh instead of evil saiyan try cell xeno the old days why you dont yours fros gets asked why he doesnt add variety to his team fights the very boss that would punish you hard for not having unstunnable units like cumber on your team its almost like this shit is scripted lmfao i do know how much you like beat as your main avatar but can you switch beat to someone else like i do want to see the others do some action i want to see chamel in action bro ndukauba i think you should your original created character kauba jr or oren from super dragon ball heroes universe mission 8 i think hes in ndekuba could play moro you could change super vegito to one of your ssj4s i think that would be quite nice anyways love your playthrough of this swap ssj blue vegeta with ssj blue evolution vegeta and cooler with ssj blue goku or gogeta i can see you voice acting a kai you could definitely voice seelas if you actually did it every time i see seelas i would be like ndukauba i see you i hear you hands down shu yhea bro change some of your unit because your ci is too fast and you need more hero energy for unit like evil sayan beat bro you have so many better teams you could make why keep this team not saying to switch everyone obviously but ive seen so many other channels with op teams i can see ndukauba voicing moro or dyspo chamel thanks for continuing the story i could actually see u voicing a dope trunks forget one that doesnt speak english why not get a brand new one like kaggy i been watching your video for as long as i can remember this series of games got me into your channel i think theyre fire and i made a channel recently and would love to get the support and subscribes so i can be like you someday like the vid kinda hope you switch the character around though lol it sounds like the evil saiyan is saying olaaay with the new arc coming i could see you do moro if you make your voice a little deeper this is why u need cell x he takes only 1000 or less on 1st round voice maris from the galactic patrol when dbs 2 comes out i would say that i can see you voicing zhaha idk know how to spell his name 2149 i honestly wanted you to be the voice of belmod form universe 11 you would probably voice uub honestly u should voice zahha shallot and zahha on a mission yh that would be cool i love this game but i tell you that zamasu is in this game trust me i have him beat is my new stand bro nobody would mess with me if he was my stand i still remember when ndukauba played db fusions kauba jr oh so great those old times were read the title subarashii intensifies i would saymaybeyour voice would be good for kagyu the namekian berserker hey man love your videos and use god kamehameha goku for10000 damage dont ever say a streets fighter move in dragon ball heroes world mission bitch ndukauba i love your channel but i love gogeta equally if the two could be together ss4 gogeta on the team in place of vegeta that would make my 2019 you can keep berserk goku and cumber but 2 vegetas y tho i thought it was dragon ball legends can u make the next vid later today a full team of 4 stars ci will go like a ferrari and can someone explain to me the kamehameha of discipline wisdom and pride i think i know it has to deal with the hero elite berserker classes but how else do they differentiate why dont you change your teammates or you fine with just note and frost pls switch one unit in your team to ssj 4 gogeta i have a team that can do 50 thousand damage lol if you look at his twich channel you start to realize that he did all this a long time ago i love your videos but can u upload 2 videos each day cause i love watching ur video me to omg i thought this was gonna be in dragon ball legends i was so hyped first still no full power broly huh sigh i would love oozaru cards of every saiyan with tails thanks i want more cards ready for next one now we have so many transformations but we still dont have a base form for future gohan even as a sticker this bugs me so much i need this in an update just for completion sake whack who are the cards at the banner what happends to the lauguange in spanish hopefully when they bring out big bang mission for the switch that all these cards from world mission are added and we get all the cards frrom the previous sets as well theres a mistake on the trailer to know the mistake you have to see 876tv ok 876tv 119 124 the enemy is king cold and the damage is 1490 bandai namco america 120 124 the enemy is dr gero and the damage is 1207 you guys have to see the channel 876tv bandai of japan because it published the trailer on december 22th 2019 unlike this channel that published this january 9th 2019 trash update this is nonsense gtfo no more repeats please there are tons of survival tournament characters that can be implemented as well as characters from the galactic patrol saga ssj2 gohan and vegito are pretty great not gonna lie the fact these keep coming out at a steady pace and are free deserves respect however ill admit that topping the quality of update 4 is going to be very hard while this update was a breath of fresh air for the game i feel it missed the mark namely in the cards most of them are either outclassed by um cards or just seem out of the blue i do have a suggestion for the people over at bandai should they see this and that is for them to create a poll asking players to vote on either a theme for the update or simply the cards they want to see while i dont expect any cards from um 11 and onward to be selections that still would leave many fanfavorite cards such as um8sec2 ssj4 gogeta with ssj4 vegito summon um6sec fpssj broly um4043 ssbk x20 goku um3sec ssbk vegito and um10cp8 transforming android 21 just to name a few if this happens i think it would be a great way to both bring people back to the game a i think we already had enough gokus and vegitos but its free so i cant really complain cooooool trailer is this for mobile i really like this game basically bought a nintendo switch because of it but this update doesnt look good where is super saiyan broly of the new movie this has so much potential in arcades if you brought it over to the us there may not be as many arcades in america than in japan but you have plethora of hobby shops and a few arcade places not to mention you still have card collectors here too free update okay who are you and where is bamco how much is the ransom what are these graphics hope to god youve fixed the aura issue for pc users please make a ps4 version of the game please idk why people keeps hating this game knowing that they are the ones who complained about sdbh being only in japan theyre making free updates the game has massive content its fun stop hating youre fucking annoying next time dont leave out local multiplayer on pc and i might buy it skipped it just for that can i have a 5 stars yamcha plz ssj broly come on bandai please im glad this game is still getting dlc would have bought it if it had this from the start you want me to unsubscribe so bad itd be nice if dimps made another dragon ball fighting game perhaps covering the original z super and gt i think the last one they made is xenoverse 2 so i guess they could at least keep up with the dlc more often i feel like there is something wrong in the thumbnail i wish it was on ps4 or on mobile like dokkan and legends i wish all dragon ball games from now on were subtitle only like heroes world mission i dont have to worry about a dime of my money going to evil companies like funimation or their scummy mediocre vas ill only be renting dbz kakarot or waiting for used i dont want a dime going to them love how these devs keep calling them free updates like they expect us to pay for support of a game past the initial sale watch updates become a service too kind of a weak update but at least its still being updated still hoping for super saiyan full power broly how nostalgic it is budokai 3 assets this game is fun but a sequel to dragon ball fusions would be great graphics amazing for ps2 128 that is edited so wrong in so many ways i see you bandai you think you slick d saiyan saga and they give goku the large genki dama as his super did they even watch the saiyan saga cause i dont think he even was able to gather that much energy plus he used the fusion genki dama yessssss free content 054 that was the weakest kamehameha ever cumber cards please any tips for beating android 13 in the story mode actually started playing this game again forgot how fun it was just wish there were more uub cards in the game without having to create one its 2020 make a good dbz game already theyre are reviving the gamehuh i sold it cause i got bored the more updates the better third i gave the game a long break it wasnt exactly going anywhere please bamdai this game for ps4 put on crossplay for pc and switch this would definantly please alot of players pretty weak update compared to the last one hoped for more original characters like ssj3 cumberssjlssj broly from super movie or metal golden cooler ect oh well i hope they put some of them in next update when come out dragon ball exnovers 3 honestly im impressed they keep updating this game especially considering the pc version is pretty dead please make a ps4 version of the game please arent we getting big bang mission soon so why are we still getting updates for world mission aff no ps4 i love how the graphics look like budokai 3 yo i swear this game looks exactly like the dbzb3 version impressive addon only card i hope gets added soon is super broly from dbs also a higher drop rate for tickets zeni and exp after you beat the game you should have access to unlock everything with ease without having to grind for hours on random drops at a low first dude is that nabba lol trunks making everyone call him master beat and note rhymes on the same pattern as rock and roll from capcoms mega man series ok thats pans daughter and gotens son thats definitely trunks i died datruth put the robot name as dokkan this feels like yu gi oh here is a theory in xenoverse 2 your main character can meet great saiyaman and you can become the 3rd saiyaman it happens in the hercule world i believe what if youre cac in xenoverse 2 is great saiyaman 3 in world mission is goku ui priest in the game uk the funny thing is lml they got the goku where he got ever form 1blue and u can transform like cycle through em thts the best part lml finally my boy is playing this again time for the eng videos to come out is it the full game or the demo can we get full powered jiren in this game this makes me remember the time that you played super dragon ball heroes god mission x too much time has passed 2615 oh yeah i remember that time it was still fun to watch the double attack animation is getting claimed left and right i did a three hour livestream and got three claims on the double attack within a 20 minute period oddly enough triple attack did not i think it might be because this is remnant from ultimate mission x hey ndukauba i love your videos and i been subscribed to you ever since your gameplays on the other dragon ball heroes and tbh ever since that i been really into the game and when the game got announced to come to switch for us i got extremely hyped and i preordered it last most so i want to say thank you for introducing this channel to dragon ball heroes and i hope you

annoying to ultra complete even with cards that make it easier to do voltsy ur channel is the best ima name my new account on the android voltsy fan im on iphone btw use the boy because your starting to annoy me vegeta has never gone ssj3 ever in the entire franchise so this is pretty wack good luck and please tell me how i can get this game this game looks awesome and dragon ball z xenoverse games are amazing as well but wish this game had english voice anyone know which banner is the best to summon from i hope you use gacha in later parts god what corny dialogue anyone know how to beat puzzle mission 11 i love the was how the tails move im watching this as i play and i have no idea what im doing i did tutorial and dont understand when to put characters where lol man its been a while last thing i watched was dream team you were about at 80 k subs yeah even more sdbhw tip use gatch ticket to get cards vegeta doesnt have the ssj3 he never got that power up hes never gone 3 in the anime 2540 its over 9000 wait is this the full game use your tickets hey voltsy can you make a video about how you make your pokemon gameplay layouts i wanna know how to make thosehope you somehow

like this that made me love dbh the fact that it is everywhere with who and what you fight i cant wait to get this game i cant believe they want 50 dollars for this mobile game i have a theory so after that guy from the beginning show up they create the game world using the dragon ball and use dragon ball story as an base keep playing this game it is really cool question did you preorder the game to get those 11 characters in the beginning cool i was just watching the first ep of this please keep it up man i wanna see how strong sealas is hi hero your my favorite pokemon youtuber i didnt even start but i love the first eps keep up the good work legendary super warriors still the best dbz card game babyyyyyyyy wow a game worse than xeno wow a lot people seem to be very ignorant about heroes rather its dokkan or xv2 rip off its more yugioh inspired than anything else just make figherz 2 with more mechanics and take away all the bullshit ones thanks good day ill pass on this one chief i played this 2 years ago its in xv2 what if dispo and beerus used the fusion ear ring will great priest work instead of gine where did you find that game where can you find those cards can you show a video of all your current decks in one video thank for the help you explained this so well and made it so much easier for me appreciate it 3 rare tickets n 2 min hope it helps farm farm farm d httpswww youtubecomwatchvbqaugrxtnvgt17s man im glad you told us that they copyright transformations because i was wondering why my episode 3 was copyright claimed i was so confused you can also get shenron medals from the roulette game in the lab there is one tarble card in this game and its a cp from sh10 i believe and it gets 2 hero energy every time it gets hit so yeah thats a thing any tips for the hero stadium its very nice but i think i can do more in 2 turns no xeno cell that is an oof for pvp ceo lets make an a very out there game in a genre that dragon ball hasnt ben before bandai employee but demonitzise youtubers for showing a energy wave in a series about battles with energy waves ceo yah that will sure ring in some new players any good teams for dark broly final one in arcade sorry man but that dyspo seems like an odd choice wouldnt it be better to run a unit like say four star vegeta blue from uvm 2 who gives you 1500 power level per attacker on your team to ensure youre going first therefore triggering vegito blues skill that demolishes the enemies hero energy before they have a chance to attack edit or like golden cooler for that guard reduction so that vegito blues immense damage output can only be stopped by straight up damage reduction instead of stacking guard i been trying to get gine since they game came out lol shes bae hey im trying to start a channel on this game too and i was wondering if you wanted to do a race with our teams or a dual summon video or something if you dont want to i get it ill still keep watching these for ideas cause i love all your vids on this game i already have a few videos on this game and i try to post everyday do a video with either dark broly or evil saiyan bro the first time i used my vegito did 42k 2nd round and i was shocked how did you get the hero of japan module can you do a goku ui team guide that focus on him to win in first round plz and thank you before i get this game i want to know how a ginyu force deck would work thanks my fav character im gonna have to try this team thanks 613 what i said i was looking for 518 what im really looking for beautiful models and animationsdimps is a great company but the card gameplay sucks what 434 gogeta uses soul punisher gogeta do it again gotenks uses victory cannon gotenks do it again trunks tell his father to touch tips to become vegeks why cant they fix the way the characters look i feel like they didnt try i really want to see mastered ultra instinct goku and super saiyan blue vegeta fuse why cant we see it i have that goku and vegeta will become mui blue uh those who have no history of fusing just fuse like android 17 fusion to kefla oh not that bad fusion to ssj4 vegito oh super cool i guess fusion to ssgss gogeta your fate is sealed 1313 throw the fusion away right now 002 whats the fusion i need to know what does the fused card do jiren and hitto should fuse look at goku hes surprised 210 why cant we see ultra instinct goku and vegeta fused as their limit form with gogeta just one peek pls should just make a new raging blast and have this roster or make this a mobile game then i might try it out but ill be damned if i paid for game like this charge your 307 zamasu is either the dragonball version of ff7s sephiroth or narutos madara uchiha sub back bos i have some questions 1 what happened when ultra instinct mastered goku fused with super saiyan blue vegeta 2 i heard when you fuse mira and towa in their super forms their fusion temporarily gains wings is that true 3 what happens when you try fusing blue gi buu saga gohan with purple jacket future trunks did i just see super 17 as a blonde vegeta and trunks voices dont work as well together as they should 046 the most magnificent thing ive ever seen this new games graphics is kinda bad is this on mobile barely all the voices come from budokai 3 xd i need a switch asap this game is amazing awesome fusion its weird how ss3 xeno vegeta and base xeno trunks turned into base xeno vegeks instead of like vegeks stuck in ss3 but with trunkss hair color and maybe bangs like when ssr goku black fused with zamasu and blamasu was stuck in ssr but with zamasus hair color and bang super blonde 17 18 absorbed super buff 17 19 absorbed super armored 17 cell absorbed super 17 doesnt deserve any absorption fan service forms whatsoever they all look stupidly eyesores that moment when final fantasy appears as a final boss in dragon ball waitwhat did the first fusion make ultra instinct evolution gogeta 132 when you rewatch the final episode of dbs with a bunch of other characters ui is a fusion of badass and godlike looks so im guessing this is a mobile game so i made a custom card which was ssj3 gotenks then i made it transform into a lssj broly this game is so weird i allways wanted to know how a vegeta and goku fusion would look like this game never ceases to amaze me and here i thought super 17s couldnt get any worse both power and storywise wait what was that weird machine thing that fused cell and frieza then black and hit but what was the result of the first fusion i kinda like the idea of this game but this just looks flat out terrible i wish that with the potara accesory in game it would just fuse the two characters and form a new fusion instead of fusing into vegito kefla or apparently super 17 absorbed cell this aint heroes this is a budokai one of them hit could never use potara earring because he has no ear ultimate exxtremely fans service okay but why do zamasu and black each have 2 potara earings before they fuse i thought there was gonna be a hit and goku black fusion yugi muto hey hit 848 hes still black enough to keep his form and hair but the second hit leaves its different any reason as to why he did not take any damage from any of the enemys showcase attacks look at these cool new fusionsshows ssj4 gogeta 5 times 736 what your probably here for 1120 what im here for honestly zamasu should have been in the tpose right after he fused why does fused zamasu stance in the first appearance have a ricardo smile in the vegito stance xd 852 lmaooooo i thought yugi was actually in this game burning impact might be the most genius thing ive ever seen goku black with the black genki dama tho i activate polymerization this game looks dumb i need more dlc already 402 why didnt they do that move when they were kids zamasus creepy ass face dear god its funny how all fusions have vegitos stance goku black getting his body stolen oh the irony lol what is that first one super dragon ball heroes world mission best character fusions transformations ultimate attacks sdbh which fusion is your favourite pharaohenterprise on instagram best memes on the planet hands down theres more cutscenes that are animated but they use the ingame 3d models you have to play through the game to see them ow the sound quality for the last one was so bad it hurt my ears when i put it on loud i honestly think the graphics must have fix they looked like they didnt shower for 10 years this hystorie was better to xenoverse 3 is it just me or does sealas have the same voice actor as funny valentine cumberit means there will sequel to this game better be better than this game trunks still gets his cheecks clapped awsome there is cumber what im curious on was why kanba was chained up to what looked like a half broken red xmen symbol that was epic am i right im honestly hoping we get universe missions 37 as updates and i lowkey hope cumber was that teaser but only time will tell it seems i will sleep and snore on krillin any day of the week yamcha and tien on the other a dangerous they just need the same attention also asspulls that krillin and roshi have cumber sounds like he is saying alright after getting the pursuit chance waitso is there 2 universe 7 here do the another sections please 3 so i went and did that event at 3100and i won attacked second and did enough damage the second turn to win i wonder can kale can transform into berserk legendary ssj the evil saiyan is cumber yeah we shoulda had trunks over tien he wouldve been just as valuable as frieza or 17 maybe even more so depending on how he trained beforehand realistically xeno vegeta could take both blue gokuvegeta on and win since this is their super variations and not the dragon ball hero capsule corp variations doubt hed need ss3 considering how astronomically broken heroes power scaling is i would like if you played other missions it would nice to know more about the other characters stories and might get super saiyan blue and golden froze at some point damn almost forgot how huge cumber is why tf is zeno larger than the grand priest would love to see the other stories tbh it is apart of the story ndkauba can you do the side missions please its funny how when i played this chapter i had trouble with the cabba fight and the next fight went on like nothing your experience was the opposite of mine is it me or do i think zenoh is like a little kid fanwatching a wwe ppv you should do the side quests for the story they got surprises in them you need putin on your team and some unit that gives you hero energy damn who is this girl leggings man that beat hoodie looking cleab i had no problem doing this fight you need better units like now hakai goku is super bad doesnt offer anything to the party cooler needs support which he isnt getting and so does evil saiyan family galick gun vegeta is a bad unit its something i would use once to see the family galick um2034 vegeta is also bad may as well use mechikabura instead i get to both have fun and beat all the content in story mode with this build that has interchangeable units so there no excuse i have been using 2 teams 1 for turn 1 kill and another for turn 2 turn 1turn 2 my favorite characters in the series avatar sh3sec3 vegito xeno um1sec goku unit that hits with pwr or dmg multiplier sh7sec bardock unit that hits with pwr or dmg multiplier um119 vegeta this could be any unit great priest sh4sec2 dark masked king sh8scp5 trunks xeno ss3 can you do the side mission to and by the way you voice acting is amazing do the side quest at the end kinda like post game please do the other sections and battles that you have not done on video yet ndukauba i would like to see you do the another modes because i think they might be interesting but if you dont want to its cool you do you ndukuba theres a special skill capsule that permenantly lowers ci speed ofc we want you to do the extra missions plus you love playing the game and we enjoy the gameplay i dont have the game myself but ive seen your ultimate missions gameplay keep up the good work with the videos yea you should do all the red side stories i already beaten the story mode i use my custom deck like i use beltearringswordsand rings and all of the equipment is rainbow hey ndukauba i just got the dumbest luk on dragon ball legends i did the hundred crystal single summon i got a hero but it faked out into a sparkling buu with no pods and small text hey screw heros man get your butt on legends and get that new gotenks and super buu thats what i and most likely everybody wants to see in super sayian blue form im a earthling bro go to dragon ball legends because there are here super bu ssj 3 gotencks do it after you complete the normal story new super syrian 3 gothen in dragon ball lengend now i have a question what would happen if hit and goku black would to fuse yea do them please this game is different then i expected nd your a game explainer ndukauba every round 2jesus would love kubas face when saw kales abs cause that reaction was hilarious you should use the god of destructions ndukauba do you see here abs me yes please use the golden death beam for beat omg ndukauba xeno goku and xeno vegeta didnt even participate in the top they are not the same goku and vegeta and trunks from the dragon ball super timeline theyre not even from gt theyre from their own alternate timeline that still had similar events like for example xeno goku was killed by towa but later revived so which ultra instinct goku u like the most in this game mean pls summon for bus and ssj3mgotenks yo plz do a unit overview of sparking yamcha in dbl ndukauba your videos are always awesome true rating pg original ratingcontents lowfantasy violence threat and language for ages 8 and up or more where is the settings so i can change the difficulty been playing this game for weeks now its so good is it possible to play on androidlaptop can the character change gender they really should make it so your saiyan avatar can go super saiyan 4 not just god mode you do realize some people prefer super saiyan 4 over god and ultra instinct rightthere are some gt fans out there should give an option an not just please super fan boys it looks awfully awfull lmao is there a digital copy for the game i have a question in the game there is only the universe mission 1 and 2 will there be updates in the future to add the others another reason not to put my switch down and i hope the physical card game plays the same too how do i but this is not in the nintendo e shop does this have micro transactions if i spend 100 can i get op cards and stuff i never thought this would come to the west ive been watching videos of japanese gameplay for years and i am so excited to finally get to play it im gonna cry if i buy it at amazon uk will i get the physical cards hope it has the blue gogeta and the new broly will the game have german subtitles anyone know the recommended specs on pc yet unique gameplay not even suprised bandai allways making games that feel fresh and only any other ty bandai please tell me if theres going to be a english dub when the characters speak please help me why i can not buy this game in pc steami can the game not found why other game like doa6 and so on was 1 monat in the shopplease say me make an english release of super dragon ball heroes ultimate mission x i didnt get a chance to play it and i would love to horrible yknow something since the character models are stylized after budokai 3 does that mean ppl can mod b3 even better than before i mean think about it all the mods ive seen for it were almost always recolors i honestly cant wait for this i have never played any version of dragon ball heroes gonna do it this time im hyped how would u get this on pc i love the 90s when collect all those dbz cards they are fancy i wish this game had a dub version but i understand why they didnt do it since that would just delay the release date for this game and make bandai waste more resources on getting all the actors together to dub for the game my wish would have been that there would be a dub dlc for the game in the near future where it allows you to change audio to english but oh well i guess thats where modders comes in and can start working on replacing the japanese audio with edited english audio will we be able to get the hero edition to uk europe because the only way to get it is from america important today i played dbxv2 and i found a cheater on ps4 his name is jkslauhteurz on ps4 and faro loves satan on dbxv2 i have a video prouves and there what he can do 1invincible 2not unlockable skills 3 and more i dont know how to report so i write this here i want to make a deck with master roshi and have everybody else be a female character i shall call it roshis angels can i buy the power up pack digitally after the game launches less than 3 weeks to go cant wait i like this game but wher is dragon ball project z the reason why i bought nintendo switch recently was because of this thanks bandai namco glad this finally made it to pc ive been wanting to play this for years now we just need the system requirements for super dragon ball heroes so release the pc requirements this is amazing we finally get a dragon ball heroes game so will you be able to play this in tv mode im so happy heroes is in english now when is it coming on steam i loved dbh to sdbh universe mission and i always watched all of the openings to the game and its missions but i always wanted to play the games but i couldnt because it was in japan and i was in europe but now i can finally play it after a long time okay so they keep adding this when we have dokkan but still no sequel to xenoverse 2 and get dlc we havent asked for what else is gonna happen when can we pre order from the eshop yes its english are you kidding super dragonball heroes is coming to europe i thought everyone outside japan had been neglected the dragonball heroes games because we dont have the cards and arcade machines can we use real card too do you gain cards only through gameplay or is there an option to buy any because i dont want a disguised loot box simulator which even charges me 60 60 bucks sorry i will buy it on deal who do we state with can this be on mobile they finally came out with dragimon i still have my 3ds versions of this idk if ill get it on switch gonna buy it once it comes out on steam ive been waiting for years until dbh comes to the west and it finally happens what a time to be alive thank you very much bandai namco d if you play in handheld mode will the game play like the arcades just use your hands to move the cards heu guys make a version of this gamo for xnox one theres a lot of fans there i cant wait for this game wtf are these character models im actually hyped for this ahah man im dropping switch just for this game i cant wait i always think its a new gameplay from the new dbz game and hope it doesnt end up like one piece do you think that a ps4 version will come on day after dragon ball heroes ultimate mission x finally a new port of the arcade versions for consoles this time in english hype i may not be the first but im the first to edit my comment every anime game is always either a fighting game card game or jrpg im loving the budokai 23 vibe from the art 350 characters over 1000 cards freakin noice wadu hek where is the sequel to attack of the saiyans gogeta fusion wasnt even close lol does anyone knows the download size on the switch version im soooo excited i cant wait to play this game is like dragon ball xenoverse hero colloseum i have 1 nintendo switch 331 is this the dbs card game as a video game i dont understand that game play im just gonna stick to dbfz all i know im gonna get in this game is just goku getting pushed turning mui fighting with severely downplayed vegeta so in this one you dont have to bother to get all the cards you just have to chose nope not hyped about this i need a drsgon ball heroes for mi phone oooffff i hate ccgs but i am getting super excited for this hopefully this game doesnt have obscene monitization practices like those found in dragon ball xenoverse since they are in the same universe i am cautiously optimistic about this title kinda sucks that the game doesnt include all the dbh cards theres over 3000 of those and instead they opted to just include sdbh cards while at first this doesnt sound like a big problem considering 1160 cards future updates still sounds great i think youd disagree with me if youve played the 3ds games ultimate mission x by itself contains everything in dbh and even 7 sdbh cards added as a promotional update but well never get it in english unless translation patches are made which will probably not happen since this game is gonna be out i really hope that in the future the actually update the game with dbh content god mission and the shadow dragon missions have some of my favorite cards ever which are still considered top tier cards in sdbh that people use in the arcade machines and so i hope that content isnt forever cut from the nonjapanese fanbase part of me is also salty cause lots of characters that are in dbh havent gotten their own sdbh cards assuming this game lets you pick your race like the previous ones did im curious about how the presence of note froze and kagyu will factor into the story if you pick the same avatar as them youll probably end up looking like a clone fireeeee can you buy it anywhere wish the graphics were better so can somebody explain the gameplay to me is it like xenoverse or is it just a card came cuz that sounds kind of lame to me but i dont know 60 bucks for dokkan battle wtf are they serious does it allow all dbh cards inthe game cant wait for it to be released when you find a jp person ya mean owarida to you boy slo do you know if you can transfer umx data is this what we get instead of that new rpg i like heroes buteahehehahhaaauuh its in english yooooooooooo finallyyyyyyyy we are on 2000 im so ready for this game i really wanna day 1 this game need this trailer translated 77 characters on a team all fighting at once and it also looks like there are more attacking animations why is vegeta copying goku this is super hype only thing i m wondering is will we get any of the content from the arcade gm over the years i hope so even if its paid dlc packs would be a shame if we dnt get to experience all those stories is the gameplay of this similar to dragon ball fusions i know its not 100 the same but what im trying to say if this is a legit card game like yugioh etc to me it seems more like its closer to fusions do we have to play as beat id rather be note very intresting this will probably be the closest thing we will have to a yugioh game on the switch lol please be on the 3ds im not planning on getting a switch but ive always wanted to play theses games in english i want this game already p and these cards for my global dokkan account this game is in english i hope that we get a western release announcement on the 14th during all the db news bandai namco reveals the unknow carakter mui vegeta okay im just gonna say ssj4 bardock though when does t come out in japan this looks dope i hope it is coming to europe they should create xenoverse3 pleeeeeeeeeease let this come out in the west get rid of the staff april 4th is coming out can we use real cards so were able to customize most characters so that theyll preform the moves of others that is actually pretty darn awesome the only thing more awesome would be complete character creation but at least we have xenoverse for that hits clone finally stopped hiding behind some rocks can we get a budokai or tenkaichi collection instead of playing cards lol so hyped as fuck bruh all those characters this is like a dream dbz game for fans in terms of fan

httpsyoutubeaddmelhycrzisstg3rz34txgkirpgzby9sw u got better luck pulling the extremely rare cards with single summons ive pulled all of them with that there seems to be a bug or a glitch with it that increases the change chapter 4 the team im running is goten xeno trunks future evil saiyancumba caulifa can fuse with kale kale fuse with caulifa beerus trunks gt im using those units with the skill that forces sa with mui goku cause he have 3x to damage dealt in the first turn in some cases work as an otk cooler dont want nobody to be in the picture pvp can use sone adjusting my friend gets mad because even though i lose all my charge impacts i win because of the bs end of round abilities that do enough damage to win 2000 likes people for this mans 30 min video the content of this game is massive does it have all the arcs damn thats big i saw that a few characters are unsvailable like ssbk goku buff golden frieza baby hatchiyak sealas etc i hope theyll get added later on this game looks so fun and is honestly the next game i want does anyone know how to get the ssj custom ability for your creative cards i seen someone use it in the japanese demo but i havent seen it here i use my pc honestly im not looking for any particular guides or anything but itd just be cool to see you go through each arcade scenario wish this game was on mobile it looks like it could work is it me or is super saiyan berserk goku like the best card in the gamei have completed only uvm 12 but every other card compared to him feels underwhelming please make tutorials on how to get zeni farm exp etc ay g can u make the gameplay full screen not a square plz love u i got the preorder and this game is really fun i got the berserk goku and hes real good you have to have ur cac on the team for ur ui goku to be his best edit didnt watch the vid all the way through didnt know he said it what consoles is this out for legends is absolutely ridiculous im a top 5k player i had more than 6k rp ive spent hundreds of dollars on this game and i got a full season ban lost all my rp because people dc when im beating them ive never dced not once i forfeit thats it this is killing the game we need infleuncers to talk to bandai about this and people on reddit are suggesting to leave reviews on the applegoogle store so that ratings drop and developers make a change but we need large influencers to spread awareness please help i wanna see xeno ssj4 goku and ssj4 xeno vegito alongside kaioken vegito blue when you eventually get them its an annoyance but the reason arcade mode kicks you out after every mission is because thats how it worked on the actual arcade game after every mission you get a choice on if you want to pay for a card after which itll boot you back to the beginning of the arcade screen i had the chance to play on the actual machines a few times while i was in tokyo its extremely addicting ch 3 mission 3 they should tots add dragon ball hero characters in xenoverse 2 would be nice maybe xeno 3 if need be im actually planning to buy a switch just for heroes i hope they make a special switch edition best meta i use would be full ssj4 by round 3 the power level hits a max of 99999 definitely recommend it i would get the game but i only here in brasil is too expensive these dbh videos are so good loving this game can you make a video where you make decks that fit together with top tier cards noice wish could play it but dont have a switch lol really love all the sdbh content that ive been seeing from yall cant wait to pick it up soon this game is awesome love the video loving the dragon ball heroes content keep up the good work i would get this game but unfortunately i dont have a nintendo switch what to wish for damn thought id be first first 1439 that timing tho lmao am i the only one that thinks of boudakai 1 when i see him roll his shoulder i just hear goku saying hey you okay kaggy please used the cards all super saiyajins fours is that a freaking jojo reference 333 just a joke kaggy you sound like jaden from yugioh the abridged movie bonds beyond time i actually had to look up the va and i was like shit its actually him never took that seriously to be honest till i decided to go look that up xd your late fam but for future reference please make a team where know one has ever done before cause my gosh every time i got to pvp people has the same shit team that only increase power and someones ic i did the exact same thing as you im calling this that guy in the green armor is gohan demon god shallot one thing i realized in the whole of dbz to dragon ball super is that gohan never died undercover trunks i guess i can tell you the truth lets get out of here and head to a quiet place so nobody can hear us beat uhh i need an adult undercover trunks i am an adult hes new to the city and not being wary of strangers cmon now beat you should be more careful anyway hes ready to be the hero kathy pls react to anime house 1 and 2 by rdcworld1 not really you are just overhyped loser sorry but thats the truth lols hey when you doing dragon ball z kai tfs reaction yo kaggy i am an old fan ive actually been watching your videos from ince you made the minecraft dragon ball vidoes can you react to real death note by smosh yeah your right kaggy cant use sdbh cause copyright kaggy watch anime house 1 and 2 it seems its time to duel i like the games plot and cutscenes dont make sense during the beginning of the game but now throughout the whole video i can officially say im so lost me want to challenge you react to anime house 1 and 2 by rdcworld1 and video game house 1 2 and 3 by rdcworld1 you should react to anime house 1 and 2 by rdcworld1 they made when people take anime to far kaggy i love your narration hah just getting to it what a nerd im kidding i will be the kings of all one piece fake in case over 40 games i found the weirded video and i want to see what kaggy would react to it but i dont want

there is a away to make mods for this game react to anime house part 1 2 why does the main villian remind me of black when he said justice u should have called him alexander for 2 reasons reference to defender of time and he looks like alexander dbl needs an outfit of giblet for shallot hood on and hood off would be him for halloween xd shallot guess who i am cabba cabba emo guy me pretty true shallot are you guys stupid my brother so like why not name yourself zaha if youre a demon clan avatar wait that doesnt make sense how could beat have just moved into town when hes been fighting with them for years is this on pc and switch watch anime house by rdc world 1 is that a jojo reference 306 that was timed perfectly is this part 1 of a playthrough i would like to see you play the story mode and arcade trunks in an armor of great saiyan with a sword1 somehow future trunks made great saiyaman awesome and two he so got the idea from raiden from metal gear lol that wilhelm scream was perfectly timed yes finally kaggy is playing this im sorry but xeno trunks has gotta be weak af by now he tries with super sayian yet gets his ass beat outta hit if only he went rage mode if only he was super trunks silly kaggy dont you know that the king of dragon ball games is seereax imagine shallot actually being a card in sdbh that would be sick 224 you cant fool me kaggy i saw that oh yea yea dont buy this game i had 36 hour and spent 40 just for my save data to be deleted from the servers even though im not a modder and when i checked the files it uninstalled the game and gave me a blue screen of death you need to get passed ndukuba first how does he have a cursor if its a switch kaggy you the best young alexander please dont upload when im in school yo you honestly shouldve name him yugi use the heart of the cards i waited on watching gameplay until my boy kaggy came along ps hero collosium looks similar to this this kids name is beat shallot zahha and giblet needs to be in sdbh v comment if you agree sry for my bad english kaggy you should equip galick gun to demon god shallot what system is the game for was planning on asking if and when youd get to this game on whatever video came next guess i wont have to love your vids btw wow kaggy got the same as some others that one is popular even though i believe you have to be saiyan male beat to play woooooooo heck yeah he didnt choose a saiyan most youtubers just keep picking them btw message for you kaggy if you want to play as your little demon god shallot your gonna have to go to edit your teams and put something called a you unit in there i cant wait to play this on switch why not shu up the cinematic we all know shallot is going to have to join the game at some point shallot would be great in super dragon ball heroes well im early first one boi first uvm 11 dbs triple transforming broly in future update plz my god its full of cards i dont want filler cards like pan and uub cards nobody will use give us the best cards from the arcade version its what we want secret rare gogeta and basically every universe mission card is amazing keep doing that finally they are adding more of the old content from the arcade machines anyways why are you there anyways you were going to mow will listen carefully bandai i just buy a game for the tendo swish why wait amount anyway tomorrow anyway are you with me cant afford death im a lower cost you know im a lower cost you know somebody ate his routihat was last week ago ok about where anyway i dont see a switch game thanking about having a bell i dont need you about your cards and i have thought the same cover tower you talking is this out now cant wait for the 30th free update when can we get this editits already here just taking tumblr designs at this point sad where do i go to get this game i farmed 660 tickets for this update thank you bandai namco very cool would this fix auras on pc thank you a big thank you for this i mean it i hoping we get majin towa as the card when i went to japan ssj4 vegito is cool as well x cant wait for it now thats more like it i hope next updates will be just like this one the galaxy mission theme is perfect mmmmm i need better graphics wait bandai is giving us a free update with 99 new cards wtf bandai where are the microtransactions how dare you giving me stuff for free love this trading card game an since yugi oh card game anyone know what the gogeta does stuned front this new info and hyped yess another update thank you bandai keep it up i love u bandai for this beatiful card and update who singing the songs in this also the theme heroes for ps4 please hell yeah i never think i will have so many update for this game o yes yes yes i love you bandai thank you very much i knew this update was for the european version too hope there will be even more in the future if it only didnt take 600 years just to do 1 attack yesssss im always excited for more updates im just so glad the game came to the west cause imports were killing me so what do you think about the video explain do people still play this ps4 please hope its not too long to wait for more uvm characters like lagss i wish this came out on 2ds and 3ds so i can play it i dont own a switch 10th anniversary in 2020 the ultimates could be better that reused falling animation isnt a good thing and the attacks constantly evaporating to smoke on impact makes them feel weak raging blast type cutscenes would probably be better the cutscenes they would use when an ultimate attack was launched and connected on an opponent at least have the cutscene occur when the attack results in a finish now i think its time to get back into the game now this is the update i was waiting for ok this is epic fucking litty bois 99 new cards oh man im gonna have a field day with this update goddam this cool and all but can we get a fighter like a traditional fighter i dont want this gay ass card game no me gusto bring this to europe please i just had to fight my way through dragon ball heroes ultimate mission x with no understanding japanese the game is very nice but for the full experience i need english or german translations thats awsome i love this guys voice he sounds like hes constantly breathing helium they should put this on mobile game alsoooooooo which is better jump force or super dragon ball heroes world mission i hope we get all the cards from dragonball heroes ultimate mission x that shit looks like bootykai graphics nice highlights dweeb its english awesome they should take this and make dragon ball budokai 3 for pcps4 is this game for ps4 or pc not a fan of these types of games not a fan of these type of games does the game will be ineng if you buy the game in japan wait you have to touch the screen to do some movements where are u going to play the game switch or pc this game has so much going on with it lol geez i would get confused playing it lol still getting though im confused how vegeta had to transform into ssb but goku was already in it i need an explanation other than that it looks amazing is like if you command an army of fighters that can think and act on their own okay a couple off questions off the bat 1 at 003 they mention making your own avatar like in xenoverse so are we getting custom created characters like in xenoverse 2 does the game have english dub option cause that was a bit of a disappointment in jump force 3 i heard the game covers the first two arcade stories but are we gonna get the rest later on 4 is the play style enjoyable cause im not sure i want to spend 100 on a game on release day if im not going to enjoy it again the graphics still feel a little dated im sure the old style really brings out the nostalgia in older fans but as a relatively new player of dbz games i feel like the models should have been refined a little more somewhere between this and xenoverse less shine cause the switch can definitely handle better graphics than this no hate towards the game and those who play it i just want to know what im getting before i buy ya im just gonna stick to dbfz all i know im gonna get in this game is goku getting pushed and turning mui been dreaming of playing this game since it first came out in japan i dont have a switch but you bet your ass im getting this on steam xd looks cool how would we obtain the cards ingame though do u need actual cards to play but how is the ingame monitization and can i make yamcha so op that he can defeat broly looks like shit and it will be priced as an aaa game this is amazing so do you have to buy cards to download into the game or no 350 characters budokai 3 had the biggest character roster this game will have 350 characters i hope nakamura acutally gets alllot of money for bringing this to america and i hope my japanese cards can work on this too why is 1160 cards in 3ds theres more than that i need answers is a best game of dragon ball 3 how do we get the cards is this going to have microtransactions im playing dokkan right now and actually have some physical db heroes cards im really excited for this game will this game have a single player mode i dont know it doesnt feel like my type of game just like xenoverse i felt the sameway my favorite fan service games is the raging blast and tenkaiichi franchise fighterz is just too hard and i cant roleplay as good compared to the likes of rb and tenkaiichi so what i have dragon ball legends is bra playable in this game cuz i saw teen bulma as a playable i will get a switch and play nothing but this this is pure ass good thing dragon ball super broly dragon ball super new season and dragon ball rpg z will kick ass this game is basically something id download on a samsung because it did horrible on console release but when fusion 2 the creation is interesting this game sucks just like the wierdos who made this game popular im sorry but you guys probably have never played budokai tenkaichi for ps2 its better than this stupid game even xenoverse this game looks trash but im still going to buy it just because im a dbz fanboy this game gonna be a f2p or purchase game though mickey rourkey is reviewing games now huge dbz fan but not sure if i will enjoy this the only card based game i ever enjoyed was the yugioh ones for the game boy advance have to take a chance and see thats exactly what i want from such a fast paced actions series such as dragon ball a card game pass i hope the slide mechanic isnt touch screen based take my money dont buy his game its all shit and boring xenoverse2 full of hacking but he dont mind it how is all in english i guess the reason the game looks this way is because of it being an arcade game from 2011 im interested but a bit dubious can you tell me can i play this game offline 1160 thousand characters wtf it amazes me that no one expected this at the stream and that this is a lot of peoples first impressions with heroes i would like a full remake of dragon ball z budokai tenkaichi 3 basically something like that for ps4 whats this shit i have never cared for the card games or the mobile games i dont even play the hero colosseum in xenoverse 2 so while i see why people are excited im still really disappointed im down with this i love me some card games weve been waiting for a dragon ball heros game for years yo this game is about to be amazing i might buy but i gt 2 questions how does one acquire cards is it all in game or are there microtransactions how much is it gonna cost me this looks like complete ass which is sad af graphics and gameplay looks sboring idk why but im exited for this game lol i guess because its something different its like that mobile game but with more fighting scenes youre noobs 300 characters with 1160 cards im in cant wait for the world wide release april 5th plus for the online portion of the game i reckon the pc version will be alot better then the switch version but def the switch version for the portability creation mode is bae why does it have to look so cheap this reminds me of yugioh im looking forward for something similar to budokai tenkaichi 3 smh are they seriously still using the budokai engine for modeling charachters a fucking engine from 20012003 brah honestly in my opinion this just seems like a mobile game didnt we had a similar game on the 3ds though japanese only im fucking crying its gonna have an official english release this does not look satisfying dragon ball legends mobile game graphics are better than this riiiiight wheres xenoverse 3 this was nothing but a dream 5 years ago now this is a reality michael mcdoesntexist is that u i need to get this game 443 he does exist hes the barbarian zomasu killed in front of gomasu in the goku black art when gomasu showed zomasu the time ring idk why i remember this shit its completely pointless where is buu mouths in this game disturb me no one pointed out this quote so here you go its at the very end yeah barbarian is a real character search zamazu kills a barbarian on youtube that dude who isnt realis realzamasu fought his species 918 that hidden little gem at 923 dude that park when is pokmon x nuzlocke the shark guy is from battle of gods movie scott heard he was going to get eaten and started to pull down his pants i need moresuper dragon ball heroes street sharks can anyone who is a sexually or romantically to men help me out so i find most of the dragonball girls pretty much have a cute design but what about the dragonball guys like is there anything going on for anyone with super sayian 4 gogeta or no i could see gohan as sort of a looker sometimes but thats about the extent of good looking knowledge as a man to be honest even though i am a heterosexual man i have problems seeing women as attractive in general so i dont really care either but i know for damn sure 21 is bae as fuck in both forms with both personalities so idk cant wait for them to get to god boss missions and get the living crap beaten out of em xd so why is kirran so insistant on not knowing where the barbarian is from oo what fusion is that in the thumbnail ive been passively enjoying the fan fiction insanity of this game but my mind exploded when they actually let bulma be a selectable character xicor gets fishnets did this just become a naruto crossover kirran once again proves hes a filthy casual technically voltrongolion is a copycat of super sentai but it doesnt really matter both were made by toei they specialize in colorful spandex heroes with giant robots kinda hard to ripoff your own work i stopped watching dbz at the buu saga so all of this game is bizarre and hilarious to me i love grant and kirrans enthusiasm on the subject of extreme dinosaursyes that was a thing but fun fact the street sharks also had a crossover with those characters where they were called the dino vengers so we had street sharks and dino vengers as well as an extreme dinosaurs cartoon cell x gonna give it to you cant wait to get it on your own cell x gonna deliver to you knock knock open up the door its real with the nonstop pop pop and stainless steal to be fair to kirran its not his fault he repressed goku black im disappointed in this comment section everyone here is talking about the orange dino man who clearly doesnt exist yet no one is talking about how they didnt eat kaiser they clearly set up the rules and frankly i take it as a personal insult that they didnt eat him that dinosaur guy was from super his race was the one that made zamasu go crazy i was waiting until i leveled up to lv 50 to upgrade to super oh god trunks being incredibly racist to the protagonists android in game counterpart is something that will never fail to get a laugh out of me dfhfkgkg yeah i also try to forget the goku black arc btw class ups are power boosts for your character the super class up you guys got at the end of this episode is equivalent to super saiyan as im sure you found out when you checked out the saiyan avatars and they keep on going all the way up to ssgsslevels not every playable class gets some big dramatic change like super saiyan but freeza race avatars get gold form and the celllike android berserker actually gets god and blue forms which always amused me its so fascinating learning all of kirrans wrong dragonball opinions throughout this series less than 300 cards collected please do a gacha summon video or something am i alive the street sharks have escaped from tython liberate them i finally got all of the cards in this game and it is glorious okay why does our android protagonist just keep getting weirdly cuter every upgrade the street shark guy is from super it was from the zamasu ark the barbarian creatures that were slowly becoming civilized you can tell they know jack shit about heroes when they dont know who fuckin mechikabura is he is the arcade machine story mode hes a huge character avengers infinity war is most ambitious crossover ever dragon ball heroes hold my hetap its from a planet beerus went to looking for goku its real so far in and theyve only class upd once theres also denver the last dinosaur an theres dino riders barbarian is the alien present zamasu murdered i just binge watched the whole series to catch up to this 132 mechas in mech warriorikahburah im pretty sure that barbarian does exist that was the one race that zamasu wanted to destroy but gowasu told him not to cuz they were still evolving or whatever trunks exists every single form of fusion in dbz ever its free real estate awww man people who know extreme dinosaurs love you scott next time dr gero activates polymerization to fuse cell x cell y and cell z to assemble the xyz dragon cell i cant take gravy seriously not with that outfit kirran needs to calm down about super lest people start trolling him with more godtuber comments cool a super dragon ball heroes video on my birthday erm i cant tell do they realy not remember zamasu wanting to murder the barbarians isnt babarian one of the caveman looking things that show up in super when zamasu and his supreme kai go to the past trying to teach empathy to zamasu babaron is the thing zamasu killed when he time traveled i think the character interactions were the best thing about fighterz characters being forced to work together and talk shit to each other was great i mean nappa and gotenks talk to each other come on the big orange guy is a barbarian from a planet that zamasu wanted to destroy its from the whole lesson in how a kai must let the world take shape as it does i totally disagree on which series after z is better i think gt is hot garbage and super isnt terrible obviously neither can live up to dragonball or dbz but super kicks the shit out of gt imo the orange shark guy is one of the barbaric aliens that zamasu and gowasu were observing with the time ring catch any trout in those fish nets xicor day 4 of waiting for the suit team you know the funniest part nick picked fanboy and chumchum over adventure time they were both part of the same cartoon promotional competing to see which one will come onto nick your videos always help me have a good day get through work thank you so much babarian is the new tangela 426 does he not remember super i disagree with them about the fighterz story it wasnt just pretty but it had a lot of love for the characters and the fanservice we wanted to see the fighterz arc with 21 was better than anything in super story wise i didnt like the clone stuff but the interactions betwen the characters and 21 story made that arc for me a 7510 much better than the top the retelling of the movies the boring u6 arc and the mess that is the goku black arc kirran i get you dont like super but could you try not to act incredibly depressed unless you are depressed its concerning 9 episodes in and we are still seeing new stuff i love how much content this game has that barbarian is those fish looking people when zamasu traveled through time with master why the fuck is it a card i think alexander anderson should play a game i clicked as soon as i saw another db heros video hey awesome except when i use this team in secret battle the enemy always has 30k power and destroys the hell out of it even when blocking when i do this im only getting 7 hero energy im doing the right amount of damage but i cant get goku to lock on not exactly sure what im missing omg when you go to the shop to buy ultimate skill mastered and get the item next battle fml u have to add the daishinkan he give 30000 of power to every card guys you have to beat the story where are these how much of the story needs to be done why is trunks still master in this secret battle couldnt he use a sidline support character like cmon man 2x not 2 thousand son there is an item that gives you 30000 power lv when support there is also an item to make super always available no need for those 2 cards for hero energy and you can keep gokus 8 energy super be helpful to show us how to get the items unblockable bullshit just say xeno cell goodi found it now i can finally one shotthank you unblockable one punch team r1 auto win xeno cell im about to end this whole mans career hey can you help me get pass the s class tournament stage 2 i keep failing to get the 8th rank or higher psa this method doesnt work with the dlc god boss mission as one of the characters has an ability that nullifies damage multipliers where do you get hakai from what rank is it is inescapeble strike really available i am farming missions for tera secial items and i dont get a single copy i did over 80 missions and some items a couple times any tips for getting through the a s tournament i win but dont get enough points to pass i cant get goku to attack first i have done everything what am i doing wrong i have my own one shot team but i didnt know inescapable strike was an item how absolutely busted this is broken fun fact your name is actually pronounced havoheaye youre welcome you mind telling me how to get those items to make this team work can i buy the items or are they drops this is totally awesome deck gotta try this later is this deck suitable on story mode too wow is a nice build but is it still fun you do nothing in the game all you have to do is run over the opponent ha the video is fake the damage counter is a paid actor when the thumbnail even the dmg isnt clickbait 548 you need this item final hope to beat it every time otherwise you will go up against teams with a higher power level how do you get the items i cant see them in shop how did you get the inescapable strike then arcade any unit have the effect of prevent use of ci its jine goku mother how you dont now what her name xeno vegito ssj3 is so good i try avoiding using him in any other decks but that hero energy ability is too great this team is op however the downside to this is if the opponent has xeno cell like me it will cause prevent that one shot attack about to say scared there was a way to circumvent xeno cell in pvp my entire team comp wouldve gone kaploey does this deck still hit this hard even in arcade without custom deck items or do you gotta change it up what banner is gine on been farming all the time but those accessories dont seem to drop i have everything i need for this but i can never get enough energy for goku to lock on any ideas where does the item drop super super helpful gonna share this video with my friends i can not get the inescapable stike item to drop and im farming a custom mission specifically for that type of item how it feels to not have a nintendo switch why did you pirate the game tho i think there is a frieza with a suit that allow any unit to get an sa im really looking forward to getting this game it really looks like a run of fun to play anyone know how to lock on im on switch damn bro u been grinding but how do you lock on how do you get the hakai as a super move how do you get the items that is crazy good team make up note need to mention if you are fighting against only 13 enemy attackers you will have to get the sa up from hero energy or auto sa solid battle plan an item support module or passive to get the lock i should of explained this better in the vid i hope steam would sale 75 for this game wow somehow i missed this one drop oops wow so many new cards i havent played since update 2 after the broly movie i should really revisit this i never know why people find joy over buff spiky haired men fighting over different hair colors and xeno pan when loving the update having gogeta blue ssj4 vegito and some of my old favorites from dbh ultimate mission x like the shenron goku and vegeta and baby vegeta have finally returned i hope this is a sign they will keep adding cards from the original game alongside new cards we really need a full power broly card particularly the one that transform rushes from base to full power and the goku that goes through all his transformations up to mui but i wouldnt be opposed to that ssj4 xeno gogeta card that summons ssj4 xeno vegito for a team attack i dont like the way it looks for those looking for a release date its not extract its in early november if you didnt see the end of the video i would say 713 it will release its here boiz and i got gogeta blue on the first multi the update is available and yet nobody seems to have posted about it the 9 times exp is only for online mm idk if its still better secrete battle on colisseum guessing this releases on th 11th since um11 get it i like how it plays the galaxy mission theme then op 3god missionand universe mission am i the only that was pissed that they did not play the og dragon ball heroes theme still has not come out yet although i am looking forward to seeing ssj4 vegito and ssb gogeta on the same team gonna be awesome this there an exact release date man i really want it now please release naruto storm 4 on nintendo switch wish they could fix the issue with me not being able to upload any missions maybe cause of it storming that day it messed up my save cause it still is messed up even after i transferred my data to a new switch lets do this guys and broly br berserker and super saiyan when you realize ultimate mission x had 3300 cards all of the dbh packs at launch me disappointed they couldnt have just added 1 more to make it an even 100 my ocd is furious rn gand preast goku and goku fuse with gohan dlc i think its time to come back to this game this is the switch game right ive been eyeballing it for awhile is it worth it whats it like still no lssj broly dbs excited for the update but ive been looking forward for him to be added wasnt expecting another ssb gogeta really hope full power broly is

up finally got the shadow dragons time to build so fun teams with these new cards i love that its free its like they understand that not everyone wants to afford money for these cards wow i love trading card game since yugi oh game thank you such a awesome game when did they start doing the blue hair thing was really hoping for full power super saiyan broly but at least were getting such a huge update who is that ssr goku black look like at the end look like a cyborg goku black this just made me become a woman and lose my panties please bring naruto ultimate ninja storm legacy to nintendo switch wish online wasnt full of broken decks sighs this is such a great game so much content and more content is still being added for free i just hope you the aura not working bug on pc gets fixed still annoyed by a hard part in the story mode but perhaps i should redownload this game i love this game ive been following this series since its release in 2010 weve come so far ever since a few years ago an english version was just a dream now its a wonderful reality the graphics is in budokai 3 141 bardock ss4 so nobody gonna talk about how vegeta wrists look broken in the thumb nail i really hope there more sp cards like great ape baby great ape tora etc xone 33j4 bardock super attack is dope i guess its time to start grinding up some tickets im super hyped for these packs heroes for ps4 please bandai nice to have a dragon ball game not tainted by funimation wish future db games were sub only so i could feel good about buying them worst dragon ball game ever hurry up with a new decent db game on real consoles bandai love the support for this game personally i dont care about the cards from regular dragon ball heroes i just want all the universe mission cards please make a new budokai games with all those characters since you already have the models for it always nice to see a new update cant wait this is awesome please some transformed android 21 next im still waiting for ridge racer i hope this set includes the new gt goku card that was added into arcade a few months ago and can we get the arcade storyline next vegeta looks like hes throwing up gang signs in the thumbnail man i hope this game continues getting exciting updates i love it this game has worse graphics then dragon ball legends looks like we probably will get the dokkan battle x super dragon ball heroes collaboration cards that was recently shown i like the god mission and universe mission theme song broly in fighterz when wasnt dragon ball super supposed to be coming back also does anyone else think that cyberconnect 2 should also include dragon ball dragon ball super and dragon ball gt content in the upcoming dragon ball z kakarot game also when is dimps going to make a budokai game again its great theyre doing these heroes games but i want a new animefighting game by dimps i know they made dragon ball xenoverse and dragon ball xenoverse 2 so i guess maybe they could make a dragon ball xenoverse 3 god mission song is the perfect theme seeing gohan in his ssj4 form is a dream come true i forgot about this game tbh oof vegeta you should get those wrists checked out i think they might be broken was that ssj4 bardock 142 99 new cards oh man im gonna have a field day with this update can you play this on android no offense looks like 2004 the best update ever ui gogeta would be an insane card i love dragn ball hroes world missin you are the best bandai no one cares aboud db gt characters bandai you never learn one piece figthetz pls god mission is back im not trying to hate or anything but i havent heard anybody talk about this game since launch whats the name of the music that plays at the end of the video why dragon ball heroes isnt canonica i think the new character will came will be vegeta ui or gogeta ui this is hype we need more cards on cumber kanba i enjoyed universe mission more that tumbnail bandai release all the cards pls wow dragon ball is my love question how do i youse my cards with all avatars and how do i get more deck slots atm i can only battle with baet but i whant my team to inclode note so i have had great luck with building a deck with random cards along with actual structured thought out decks for both story and arcade and i find with what cards you have for the first 20 hours of gameplay unless you are extremely knowledgeable i dont see you having any problems for the most part its easy to get the basics but fucking brutal to get that perfect deck with rng gatcha nice video man liked oh i have payed for about 8 hours and i am new to the game i got the hero edition and i am never opening those cards or i could use sleeves with top loaders so maybe p i have 2 decks that are just more random teams but more like my favorite characters and some an evil based team jesus manthe ads in your video are beyond annoying made me quit watching you can use multiple of the same caataa in a battle you just cant use them on the same round except for some like gaint fusion shenron summon and a few others superkamigaming im struggling with arcade mode trying to complete the god boss mission of surviving the city pt1 with the ultra completion stipulation and its difficult any advicehelp i use this ssj4 team being 4 star bardock ssj4 ssj4 goteta ssj4 spirit bomb and kamehameha goku ssj3 adult gotenks hero card and tien 1st round i put hero out linked with ssj3 adult gotenks which recharges sta after then all out round two also have r3 robot with 15 sta boost after round if it isnt a wipe 2321161 cards sheesh use custom card with the caa inescapable strike abilities double edge and thirst for strength then remaining card with the sideline support xeno messenger and the rest with the support 50 power level and sp gine forgot the other ability that makes your opponent power level 5000 and wont go higher only xeno cell can negate this though hahaha and custom cards are so op lol can make 9600 attack mad pwer boost item 10000 x3 x3 with two abilities x2 gine 189600 who play in pc like hey superkamigaming a question for you im brand new to this card game but i was wondering how do you the exclusive cards you get when you get the game i got a super saiyan blue gogeta and others and i wanted to know how to put those cards and use them in the game is it simple or difficult i have 700 cardbut i dont know how to make a great deck in simple deck to counter dimensional pressurehelp me i hate when people say no 1 deck is the best thats bull the ssj4 gogeta solo deck clears every event effortlessly in 1 turn no less this deck is the best paired with entirely support units there is no match this deck cant handle look it up so im kinda new and really enjoying the game but a have a card question which piccolo is best for the namekian fusion avatar i know it doesnt effect the fusion its self but what are some good deck synergys so i know what to look what value determines my default ci speed and is there anywhere a list of all cards sort by the set i can find them honestly just slap grand priest on there hell make any team gd spousal combo 18 and krillin are pretty beast and easy to acquire as well i am making a lets play of this game and im not trying to look like a noob so imma watch this xd when i seen this video on my youtube home page i was like this guy is automatically the best dragon ball youtuber you are the only person who ive seen make a video like this best deck is just a full team of yamcha nothing else matters does the support trunks whose passive is permanently negate ci affects cancel the support tiens ability to slow down ci speed i got the game since release and i had no clue how to play this video helped quite a bit with that thumbs up why have i been reading the name of this channel as superkamigru lol the prison planet trunks has a link skill that does the same as towas sa support but it is repeatable id like to know what units to put on a fusion team because im trying to make one it is generally true that you cant have multiple caataas activate but that z ability is designed around have multiple characters with z so the guide to how to make a good deck is essentially do it yourself useful whats your thoughts on using you your avatar in matches i struggle a lot in the last cell x arcade stage his ci is nye perfection i cant practically use berserku since cell x decreases sta and i cant get the upper hand on round 2 and attack first even with mechikabura am i overseeing something obvious this games pull rate on summons are absolutely insane pulled ui goku and full power jiren in one summon ive already got a meta team that i can kill with on 2nd turn you can actually use multiple giant cards but you have to use the golden ape sp card it has a skill that actually allows this i used him together with kid gohan for example so i always had 2 apes on my field at turn 2 d the decks ppl use online with cellgogeta combo berserk goku etc you guys know the same teams everyone use can beat everything in the game so yeah 1 deck can get you through everything in arcade been playing since it came out learning here and there have somewhere around 200 cards and im getting overwhelmed with who to use now dark demon god buu any advice on building a deck around that card as a player that have been playing dbh for 8 years i can say that there is no stationary good deck each missionboss require a different good deck yo dude like you said cell x is beast but one question can you recommend a deck for arcade fused zamasu thanks for the help lad does english language include zeno trunkswhy are you always useless cant wait to try this series at last even if the main villain looks lame when are they gonna post the super dragon ball heroes universe mission theme song im dying from waiting i just love this jam the game of the year is here yall can someone tell me what is the age called i saw a trailer that is like 30 sec or less long and it shows dragon ball super card game cards bring it to mobile never have i wanted a switch more lmao more than a decade later budokai 3 still hold up today i make sdbh arcade game video on my channel from japan hey in this game fusion is available bandai namco please make the android 21 costume available to rest of us dragon ball fighterz and dragon ball xenoverse 2 customers around the globe never thought id see the day where gt goten is in a game xenoverse 23 take notes and add kid character models and more transformations and more customization options and better story lines lol bandai can you pretty please with a cheery on top drop the price to 40 im not saying you have a bad game im just saying that cause my steam price is at 40 ive been a fan for 4 years and read every manga and watched the openings and the anime could you please just for one day do it also i know that your game runs at 1080p60 a huge dbh fan just seems like an overall downgrade from xenoverse pass this looks dope the guy doesnt feel like he wanted to do this to ppl complaining about the graphics the first heroes game came out in 2010 the last budokai game tenkaichi 3 came out in 2011 so this game had outdated models then yet it is the most profitable thing in dbz history because gameplay and collectables i wish this was on ps4 i want this so bad still waiting for dbzsuper budokai 4 sold my next switch game jump force switch bandai i love you youve made xenoverse one of the shittiest games but coming back with this and hitting it out on the park and making me relive my budokai days i love you guys anyone playing the japanese beta cried when they seen the budokai dragon fist to people crying about the graphicsyall realize that this game is originally a japanes arcade game that has already been out for yearsus has been begging to get this game brooooo they actually have the mechikabura saga in this game holy shit im hyped as fuck especially if we can play as him in this as well just 8 more days will this come in italy ps 2 better graphics in the trailers weve seen animated 2d cutscenes in the heroes style will these cutscenes be in game or are they just opening astetic like the openings and trailers for each universe mission because from what ive seen most the story uses the 3d models it would be nice if they sprinkled in some nice cutscenes ps2 graphics wtf dark demon god buu that sounds like an edgy fanfiction 1 week to go cant wait a modder can create a pg with graphics of xenoverse 2 in 34 days and you cant create a game with that graphics 60 for this thats insane this is a 2999 game at the most how do i pre order for pc 040 edit stamp first form frieza pic is legit just taken from dokkan to all of the people complaining about the graphics stop for a second and think about this this game as well as the arcade machine this is based on have over 100 characters most of these characters have multiple forms and different color schemes which requires multiple models now can you expect a game to run at 3060 frames per second smoothly or even be playable if the graphics were as good as either xenoverse or to push this to its limits jump force there are reasons that they are using older style models its to have as much room as possible for every character and i didnt even mention the audio and locations which take up data as well will you need nintendo online for this where tf is xenoverse 3 does anyone know if this will be on the na eshop its not on the coming soon and when i search for it i get the xenoverse 2 dlc this game is cancer when are you able to pre order it digital whats with these ps2 graphics garbage this better not be one if them push the buttons to do a compo games already played the game pretty fun with 0 microtransactions so far its packed wth interesting ideas surprise a lot people mentioning budokai instead of comparing the heroes series to itself that tells bandai how many people didnt have a chance to play the game in japanese it good they finally brought the game to the west hah decks hahahahaha ill see myself to the rope my spleen nearly popped when i saw all those arcade sagas making their first appearance in english eh im not really interested in the gameplay but i do like the ideas that they have for the story mode i hope if they do make a xenoverse 3 theyll add some of them into it drangontly balanced as all things should be its not about the graphics its about the gameplay its a card game smh why it look like that i love that steve blum is narrating these trailers with his chilling voice why not just go full fan service listen up here fuckers i was playing dbfz and when a nigga dragon rushed i fucking pressed rb as soon as i saw so you better fix that shit or imma just shoot up you fucking headquarters idgaf about the graphics the sheer amount of characters in itself is way more than enough to compensate everybody is here the content the gameplay worth it all ah yes the dark demon god buu saga a classic am i right guys demo on the switch japan store sometime tomorrow when is the pre order on the e shop coming out funny how the budokai series still shines within these games games for bleach pls games for bleach pls games for bleach pls is there any reason this isnt on ps4 as well 13 why does vegeta have to be in the front dbz dokkan battle finally gets the dragon ball heroes cards on global its on steam when is going to start pre order for pc why is the quality so low these graphics look like budokai 3its actually kinda nostalgic i cant waiiitttt how are people complaining about graphics it looks perfectly fine goddamn this game is ugly italia hero will the game have german subtitles my predictions so much for you to do in the game and so many stories but gameplay is repetitive and can get boring at least theres some creativity value to keep a lot of us entertained for a while wheres gt goku for fighterz they need to update those ps2 graphics god damn oooooh man thats actually amazing that well be able to do a large chunk of the actual arcades stories ohh is giantification in the game then perhaps i can make a giant bergamo since such card does not exist in the actual game for some reason even though bergamo can become giant in the anime im sure its really fun but gahhhh those animations and char models yikes why i cant see the game in steam bamco please dont disappoint meee i will buy this is dragon ball and they made it look like how is that possible nice game this is a a game on sale when will a new dlc for xenoverse 2 be available new playbe characters single fight demigra merged zamasu and mira full power toppo dyspo caulifa kale full power jiren vegeta new form stronger ultra instict goku i got the hero edition cant wait what i cant hear u what about an item shop remove this game pls im actually curious to see how this will be on the switch though i think its probably the best console to have it on im looking forward to this project z naw pass ill stick to the arcade one and use actual cards i cant pre orden in steam c please in fighterz use pan for double dlc buying this game skipped jump force and world seeker for this check taimoorking will this game have the english voices cant wait for this game to release dimps has been getting a looooooot of mileage out of the budokai 3 models the god of destruction liquir is in this game ill definitely give this a try looks wack boring im still waiting on db project z this game looks so bad so when will the milking on xenoverse 2 end i feel like well have to wait for the next gen console to get xenoverse 3 kinda like how some had to do the same for xenoverse 2 yoo why not put it on steam already i want pre order it holy fakkk i wish they

farm tickets can u try out arcade mode how did u get so many cards yo i got ui goku jiren ssjb vegeta and goku and some other cards at the beginning of the game am i lucky or does everyone get that i really wish this was on other consoles too how difficult is it to earn rare cards i love that ultimate tenkaichi song in the backround i cant beat it i wanna try it out if only i could mod but this is great and i do like this series in this game did we have dbs broly card tbh this looks very fun to mess with berseker super saiyan goku is really good and fun to use custom missionthis game is too good attack type defense type balance type its beyblade burst would it work with the switch title i like the japanese version better guess ill have to go even further beyond i wish can mod sometimes do a mission with super saiyan 3s including raditz hey i just got the game but idk witch profile is going to get the extra content on the switch any idea on how does it work goku gets engaged with super saiyan raditz mission first first the that release date is agony when in early november will it come out aww yeah looks sweet also first cell and frieza interact in gt cell x was originally from dragon ball online he is cell who was mutating thanks to towa could that form of cell be from dragon ball super what does uvm stand for cell x and gfrieza absolutely destroyed me and my team why arent you using mui goku and other cards or you just like these ones i wonder are the sets based on the actual tcg cause if so does that mean that kale and caulifla from set 4 cell x is from dragonball heroes show us your cards cell isdummy thick dont forget super dragon ball give you a wish for the main character to turn super saiyqn theres gt where cell and freiwhy am i being yelled at with pitchforks you should try to collect all super dragon ball because you can learn super saiyen and rank up also i dont know if you know but dragon ball can be collected in the arcade mode and are you going to test the arcade mode beat can reach super sayin by using the super dragonballs also i noticed you skipped some dragonball stages you can redo stages with dragonballs just in case uou didnt know super perfect x is a more recent dragon ball heroes exclusive which is a shame cuz look at him hes amazing the cell form was introduced in dbheroes you cant know it unless you watched the dbheroes trailer dragon fist why are you having broly just sit in the back he cannot be stunned so he has no need for stamina just put him upfront and leave him there i call hacks that should of been a l when are you going to rank up your character what chapter does broly and kale show up dont use great saiyaman 4 costume you should evolve your character by collecting dragon balls and sdbh set 6 for the best cards im so stuck on this part hoe do u beat cell x n freeza you use a super shenron wish to upgrade your class which will alter your outfit also cells transformation is from the heroes game itself its not part of any other media cell x is from dragon ball online if i am right uvm set 2 is the best set 4643 you need to use the super dragon balls to rank up like note did however it will only rank your current type up going from hero rank 1 to hero rank 2 while berserker and elite stay rank 1 cell x appeared in in super dragon ball heroes dark demon realm mission and in the manga potara to get your avatar look change you need to use the super dragon balls and itll make your character stronger and return it to level 1 cell new form is exclusive to sdbh i think it would be smart to add a few hero class cards in the mix also you need to use the super dragon ball to get a super class up for your character man dark broly looks awesome and i assume he the ss4 broly i hope to see you fight cunber the evil saiyan in the future cellx is from dragon ball super heroes only and he was in no canon or movie of dragon ball z in my opinion here and face ss3 full power cunber be cool to see thought but i bet cellx is way more powerful then cell super perfect form 2 thought keep up with the good work am surprised u didnt get mixed up with the chapter of chapters lol not first first and of course first one cool video first one first like too first one from sweden newest first plz cheek after some hours and say vegeto is op if there was a ultra instinct vegeto in this game he will definitely be op they should have given him the sword people are being killed outside hold up let me mess around a bit does beat ever stop wearing that costume do not use great sayiaman costume is super bad and ugly please of course beerus is a beserker type have you seen him without any pudding were on part 5 and still nothing more we know about what sealas is up to u should should switch out nappa on notes team i always like your video everyday plsplease dont use gratis sayaman is best the hero avatar costume am i the only one hyped for the final boss battle i have an question in the hero lab what are the 5 6 7 door or are they just decoration ayeeee the best serious around keep up with the good work and of course first one cool video first one first like too first one from sweden newest first plz cheek after some hours and say first one why only the switch is this a good game is this a joke well its not funny please nintendo a remake of dragon ball z buus fury this seems a lot of dbz dokkan battles a more advanced version of it is this going to be digital whats with the ps2 graphics is this a mini game in a new dbz game graphics made me sneeze i love how people are bitching about graphic last time i checked graphics dont make a game but whatever and the fact this is not like the arcade theres a completely new story to the game you can customize and make your own cards you can also put the cards in game that you customize in the story theres character creation theres multiplayer online cards game are the worst thing in gaming why cant we just have budokai 3 remake just do a new budokai version the game was made for kids everybody relax dragon ball the gathering but honestly the graphics in dokkan battle look way better than this this game look to deep nothing for mobile tho im not feeling this game so basically hero colosseum as a stand alone game this looks like a ps2 game that plays like the hero colosseum from dbx2 just release the new ccg for mobile please is it available for any pattern just improve on graphics anyone know why i cant preorder digitally on the nintendo online store its available for japanese accounts but not the us one wait is this 60 this gonna be english dubbed doesnt seem like it cant wait i cant be the only one thinking that they have the right idea and this should be a console game but theyre making it dumb kinda like contest of champions developers have to stop having great ideas but bad execution introducing dragonball dokki mean heroes is the game going to be dubbed needs better graphics and please make it mobile on phones very interesting gameplay is this the mystery rpgs they talked about hope not is that steve blum narrating definitely getting this first switch game of the year for me can we not preorder on eshop looks simplified and boring we need xenoverse 3 im gona pass on this crud why does this game look like a ps2 game now i want to play the dbz card game for gameboy color again i think i like this probably not but ehhh this one looks more like an android game actually i hope this can be a mobile game lol even dragon ball z legends on phone looks more fun than this crap d nah get back to japan only plz left soon as i heard cards it still looks like a 3ds game they moved to switch ill pick it up when its on sale only because its a dragon ball game idc what people say i cant wait to try it out lol as if the over and over again fighting games from dbz arent old at all lol lol like i will spend a dime for this no animated trailer i only care for this because of the 8 min episodes in the short manga another cashgrab that is sad who asked for this for people complaining about the graphics please keep this in mind its expensive to render a lot of playable characters in hd graphics this is why dragon ball fusions features chibi graphics so they can pack over 1000 characters into one game this is also why pokmon games often limit themselves to 100150 new pokmon per entry sure the budokai 3 graphics are dated but it allows for players to have access to all these characters 350 characters in highdef graphics would be tough especially for a game being released on new hardware ew id rather play gt final bout i have created powerpuff girls in dragon ball view my channel to see i thought this was a mobile game no more anime games this year pls before i was a proud animemeter but now am imbarased to muc a card game with budokai graphics how much is this game i hope it is not 60 will this be for both ios and android i still cant believe that this is coming to the west and to switch the fact that its only on nintendo switch kills it for me since im saving up for the ps5 if it were on ps4 as well i might have been tempted hurmmm think im actuallly more interested in the lotr card game comming next month dont see myself wanting a bunch of card games either not terribly impressed by this especially with that price point this game looks like it should be free but i bet its going to be 60 dollars on the switch is this like that figure thing from xenoverse the question iswho asked for this plz stop using the dragon ball name to sell us trash games i bet this has mtx in it im suddenly feeling like project z will be a letdown ready for that p2w all the people saying the graphics are bad or compare it to dokkan dont even know this was a arcade game in japan from 2010 lol it looks like an mobile game with bad graphics but its actually for pc and switch for those of you who dont know dragon ball heroes is a massive card based arcade game in japan thats been running for over 10 years and that the world missions are essentially ports of the arcade games to console mainly 3ds also japan only so thats why this game looks this way and why its interesting to see them finally bringing it to the west 11m subs and yet only a few thousand views each upload what happened to ign this looks like a dsi game why bandai namco why give us a xenoverse 3 instead of updating xenoverse 2 alright its like the video game industry is purposely making games no one wants yes and not too long before i get my hands on this either sowhy couldnt this be a dlc to xenoverse looks like this game going to drop price withtin 3 months no thanks is this coming out for wow tao beat ultra instinct goku im floored who asked for this wtf does this game looks like the figure battle from xenoverse 2 oh wait this looks so bad now the hype is gone question is this free its basically dokkan console edition please do a yogiho version thats the only card game i accept wtf a card game why employee sir it appears that our fans want a tenkaichi remaster mr bandai okay lets reuse tenkaichis assets a decade later and make a card game same difference comes out on my birthday sweet this is giving me some serious nostalgia another half assed anime game like the last several minus dragonball fighterz another card game now this is what i call an actual failure and disappointment im glad i preordered it i cant wait to play ill just wait for the dbz rpg they announced a few months ago wtf is that better they made dragon ball z or gt like mortal kombat or tekken or street fighter a real fighting game looks awsome but the graphics are a bit meh how many people are actually are going to play this please make tenkaichi 3 remastered version dont look all that cool to me exsept for the characters trash i want an open world dbz game lol so basically dokkan battle for consoles looks like a phone game but is on switch the graphics are trash whatever happened to wanting to go super sayain and just wanting to fight it outthen there was a card game was this game made back in 2008 why not its awesome getting these in japan now playing stateside im excited cop 20th atleast i didnt lie huh 19th comment how much money cant wait for the game why not on ps4 yeah ign i bet you wouldnt reply me another card game cool cool dam im early early cp means campaign ya know im surprised they didnt put in a ssj3 broly card in this game just a little tip i say pay a bit more attention to the abilities word of the day refreshing aye i have the vegenks card irl can someone tell me what the rarities are rarest to most common i have no idea what im doing in the game either battle wise so im just patiently waiting for any type of guide video showing up here on youtube that trunks wasnt bad his stats were good and a decent ability especially for his cost which is 4 compared to other cards that have a higher cost where do p and cp cards fit in with cards that have star rarities managed to pull a cp zamasu and cp cell offve umv 2 i subbedp ive watched aton of your dokkan vids and just notice i havent subbed srry bout that keep in mind if youre doing the promotional gacha its harder to pull a specific rare card you should just go from set to set and pull whatever rare card you need one thing havohei if you have a card in the background that shows the fusion like kefla vegito gogeta you wont need another card that shows the background you simply have to have either goku fusion background vegeta no background or vegeta fusion background goku no background and they will fuse in the 2nd round the game is amazing full characters and fan services and the card game is so fun and challenging no wondering its super famous in japan maybe he will not doing that stupid thing here to crack the code so remember in this vid i just started andi have no clue what i was talking about lol big tip keep making a new game itll you get masked dark king and tun a full el team it destroys the game the freiza nappa and 21 were all fighterz cards i looked at the sets last night and uvm2 looks the best rn cant wait to get this game myself rose up to top of my to buy list youre gonna have the fbi at your door from saying cp so much its red 4 cp4 3 2 1 i think and p is just promos its all over the place and suggest for you to get ui goku or evil saiyan from uvm 2 first they are insane are you dumb cp means captain like in every other game ey just bought this game havo and im loving it so far i pulled dark mask vegeta and dark king vegeta and other 4 star units and i love that when i use them they just do random shit like king vegeta summons dark shenron like tf my research says it goes somethingcppstars finding information about this game is near impossible i pulled ultra instinct goku and fu both really really good cards havo i love you man and ill support but im so fucking done with db gachas seriously can another db game come out without inapp purchases playing dokkan and legends thats enough spending for me i pulled golden cooler on my 2nd multi yestarday blue tickets while most of the cards you got is ok not good not bad usable i guess the best one is rage trunks his sa is easy to perform and his caa is good btw do not assume a card is good because of no of stars there are many times where a less rare card end up being than a rarer card well now im definitely geting this game i just hope i pull a broly cp stands for combat power i gonna start praying that ssj3 kefla is in this game there is ssj4 bardock but ssj3 kefla would be sick havohei how can i download the game the stream was lit any recommendations on the ultimate attacks youd like to see next where did you pull demon god dibura and buu can you actually have that turles card on your team i want all for xenoverse 3 what set did you get the demons from it sucks demigras other form isnt in the game yet you missed masked broly wtf bandai drop something give is xenoverse dlc shinobi striker make coop online offline for missions we need stuff hell gate slasher more like gates of babylon what did you use to have power 99999 012 the name of this jutsu is called kiren with a thunder clap begone what about base demigra all the xeno patrollers why dose the demon characters have the dopest designs you can tell he never watched super lol gets ssj4 wow nice gets ui goku some of these might be trash whos master duh trunks obviously 809shenron why u do this to me i thought you where better then this lol you got the secret rare super saiyan blue vegito and you just said hmm ok cool he is one of the best cards in the game does anyone else think great sayiman 3 is trunks because in the first episode great sayiman 3 used trunks move he got vegito one of the best units and he just glossed over it like nothing also only pull on the 2 set because the 2 set has the best chances to get good cards please just friking get to the capsule stages it triggeres me you can get items there for free without having to fight bro gather all the super dragon balla as soon as possible so you can make your hero transform when you beat the guy you should have done the match again to get another super dragon ball ah another advice try always to get the gold capsule because that will give you gold tickets could leggings be the daughter of tightsand isnt that version of ssj3 vegeta from db multiverse sadly the game wasnt in any of the stores ig they soled out i have to wait until tuesday now you get ultra instinct goku and worry your getting trash cards ive watched all three parts and the story still hasnt progressed you dont have to pay real life money to get tickets for the cards do you i got this game just now and wondering i wish i could play this as well but im glad watching you do it i do wonder about your upload schedule though i cant wait to try out your new cards ill i do now just get super saiyan 4 gogeta for the super saiyan 4 goku and the super saiyan 4 vegeta frieza is icy cold but oldy gold not to be complaining or anything but just really matter where you put them theyre always going to be attacking and no matter what so you dont have to worry where you put them just put them in the attack area and theyll attack no matter what so you dont have to worry about strategizing so much just make sure you help doesnt go down you got good defense good health and good attack a finished battle in the snitch okay whats with people in capsule corp named after clothing lol and of course first one cool video first one first like too first one from sweden newest first plz cheek after some hours and say first one anyone wanna be a dear and find with gacha each of these are in if you uaed the grand priest wouldnt his attack be amazing lol where do you get the gine system hacks inescapable strike xeno messenger doubleedged superpower does anyone know where to find great devilman goten gt daiz and spopovic cant seem to find them what about giving the rest an hp boost more hp is more exp right even though i see it here im starting to doubt that doubleedged superpower exist i got all others within a few hours im rolling into my third day farming the ability mentioned above what set is that trunks in hey just a quick question where should i start farm those items i have like 12 hours of gameplay its good with normal cards but once you get accesories you can do create cards with x9 dmg get 10 hero energy in turn 1 lowering all enemys guard 1 and do 9999 vs any enemy all in turn 1 thanks for the vid this was a huge help now im gonna breeze through story mode lol your channel is losing subs lol this guy wants to know if you can play online if you torrent the game thx for the help it took some hours to get all the items but farming is so much easier now d hey im in a group and u are the admin i just wanted to ask if someone can do tournaments someone post something like that and got kicked he was gonna give the winner 25 one of ur moderators kicked him out thank you so much for this video man because i never knew about those moves and i had them already how you get your power level so high mine is usually 13400 like all the time i dont get it really helpful thanks i really miss watching your amazing videos on dokkan or other stuff keep up the great work happy to see your face dude all you really need is ssj4 xeno gogeta the trunks and gine the rest are just all optinal that doesnt matter can you do a deck for dark broly for arcade mode thats insane great video as always holy shit this is beast actually theo anyone can have system hacks it doesnt matter who has it just as long ad its on a supporter scroogemcduk in the house also use accessories as well as some of them can disable ci on the enemy or transform abilities that can increase your super saiyan characters an upgrade if they cant go any higher like i actually have my ssj4 goku transformed into ssjgss kaioken goku times 10 because doing transformation gives you extra bonuses hype hype ist wie yugioh 536 ozaru the predicter budokai 3 graphics for the win leude serie porfa dsimphony how to download free como descargarlo

have please have a look at this video httpsyoutube2r6refoi7f0 i just got sdbh on my switch and its kinda hard but fun miracle whip i found out the hard way that counter rush doesnt kill and then i died because i thought it would rip need some fs in the chat just purchased it a few days ago it was on sale and boy this game is so fun100 recommend i picked saiyan mostly cause the berserk clashs super saiyan looks really funnyi enjoy the game its a great pass time i have this game on switch who wants to buy it or trade to other switch games just purchased it july 4 2019 ping me on t plz do more videos on this game i just recently got it and i need some advice on how to play it good thanks for all the great videos keep up the good work i have all 3 uvm 3 red 4 star cards idk what else to call them can anyone tell me the name of the song at 1153 it sounds so femilliar but i cant place it i have no clue whats he doing havent watched rhymestyle in a while cringy sfx confirms i made the right choice just why dragon ball make god damm card games wtf just leave the game normal i picked a saiyan then might use the demon god class is berserker goku limited time or do i just have to keep trying on uvm set 2 because i dont see him on the list love watching u play this game rhym if only i have nswitch how many times i said give me great priest and didnt get him lol you get the pre order stuff anyways i didnt even pre order i bought the game for the cards inside i didnt even have a switch so i went and bought 1 a couple of days later since i had the gamd didnt think i would like it but its amazing i dont regret a thing i got this game for my birthday today rhymestyle this is the first time ive come across your channel and i gotta be honest this vid was awsome especially the fact that you use meme sounds plz keep it up and using those sounds aswell cuz you had me laughing fuck wish i preordered this game looks dope i forgot to say he attack 3 times in row speed your charge impact very much he have 40000 hp if you wanna to beat jiren in god lvl dont try that he did take about 9500 dmg in 1 round on me so thats god lvl for ya only a tip he build up defense too thats odd i preorderd the game but i did not get the ui goku that you use i hade to draw a diffrent version of him instead from a promotion gacha draw how did you get that card this game is old i played this game in japans arcade machine using scanning cards there are nice deals already i got mine for 43 dollars do some research on isthereanydeals so is it me or does rhyme not do the circle slowly what pack can i pull android 21 from really want that card lol u look like renley baratheon if you dont preorder then do you miss out on certain cards another tip when you use the cards its 3 types of cards red card are hero blue elite and purple berserker red is wel balanced card elite is a ki blaster some stun enemy cards and berserker have low stamina but take huge damage to your enemy so watch your stamina on berserkers careful when you use them yeah rhymestyle i can give u a tip if u wanna lvl up fast go to that mode there u can play others missions and pick that jaco mission it give u special items dragonballs and a whole lot exp and friendship points for ur other characters evolution blue vegeta counter rush ui goku can you please speak more slowly its a mobile game check the play store looks like mobilegame insteat of a console game i started with android because they didnt have human which was always my goto class in other db custom games berzerker got up to super god class basically turned into perfect cell but switched races to kai soon after because i upgraded classes wayyyy too fast on android and wanted to do minimum lvl50 before class changes to minmax stats game keeps encouraging me to take down opponents fast within the first two moves and spam the heck out of power builds but i really prefer my battles to be elongated lasting up to round 4 at least especially in online vs most peoples op deck builds break by r4 i love building completely wacky teams the fact that i can have classic bulma recover stamina for ss4 bardock is just great its great to see that someone else has the same level of energy and excitement for the game that i do in fact i spent a considerable amount of time last night creating a team devoted to ci control keep my team ci low keep the enemy ci high it still needs some work but its getting there love this game so much the possibilities are endless i chose god of creation im buying the ish out this game when i get back to my switch it looks fun but the ki auras look halfassed if you want to farm super dragon balls to max out your battle module slots use creation code zsjb3zz its a free win turn one match that guarantees a super dragon ball every time they should literally make a bt3 remastered for ps4 and xbox 1 it would be so much fun the game is 60 bucks on steam is that price tag worth it this game is so freaking dope i like the many different ways you can play this i myself been purposely straying away from seeing who is in the game so i can be surprised by the reveals when i use gacha been going early 2000s oldschool in my approach to this game would pick this game up but a 60 port on a game that released nearly a decade ago is a bit on the high side demon the race i choosed 256 might have unsubscribed i love it and i choose an saiyan can i get an reply please its my birthday and i have almost every secret rare cards i choose android race cause supr 7 i are a fan of dragon ball heroes i have watched all game openings and the anime openings and the most of the characters so i really love dragon ball heroes i did be so happy to see it come to other countrys then japan the whole time for the other dragon ball heroes game on 3ds are region locked you can order it via game sites or go to japan to buy them so this is the first dragon ball heroes game some come to west in 9 long years dragon ball heroes begin to maked year 2010 and now is it 2019 9 years to make it come to west but finally its here yay gave it a like for the fart sounds you beat him before he transformed the normal gameplay loop seems like an endless string of quicktime events i think ill stick to fighterz and xenoverse the random sound effects had me dying lol nice vid cant wait to see more also some useful info chose the android avatar this game is still giving me nostalgia with these budokai models i need a part 4 its hard for me to choosei sint have it yet but idk what ti be i think either saiyan dark demon ir freiza race of cource loving this game i chose a demon god as race i chose saiyan amazing video rhymestyle i chose sayian hope he can go super sayian 4 or god totally forgot to play legends after playing heroes lol hope you do a video with those cards this game is so great ive even played a jp version but i chose demon race can i ask how u got to stream this perfectly while on a nintendo switch with green screen and all of that stuff i bought the game last night and i somehow already had the ui goku ssgss evolution vegeta jiren hit ssgss goku ssgss vegeta xeno goku and a bunch of other 3 starred characters i didnt buy any special edition was i supposed to start off with them can someone tell me the sound effect of 927 i choose the supreme kaii hope they make a update that fixes whatevers bug that my game close whenever i do try online missiondeck building sectionand story mode berserk goku can be easily enhanced to deal 99999 damage but its a lame way to win those battles i chose the demon god bc i could gogetastar platinum the world before i go grab this game i gotta know is there any other way to get ultra instinct goku or only preorder should i get it on pc or the switch this game looks so lame i dont think ill ever play it dont see the hype about it only good thing is that maybe dokkan and legends have a new competitor golden frieza was a pain to defeat i tell you 825 is that a fucking jojo reference lol i managed to get ssj4 goku from rare gacha ticket so yay does pro controller work with this game your new intro looks so sick glad to see that i am not only one that fails at charge impacts lol just so you know the higher the rarity of your card the faster your ci bar will go so youre making it hard on yourself stacking all these good cards xd picked demon god as a race but i kind of regret it this game is going to make my real life dissappear xd this is absolutely one of the hardest boss in this game chronoa using the world was not something i expected to see today is this your first super dragon ball heroes video i came in expecting a rant video looks like that didnt happen you earned a sub dude love the edits i am still unsure about paying 6000 just for a glorified card game thats almost the exact same at its core as the hero colusseum this game is fantastic please create content for this my dude they have ghetto mario maker in the game the ed edd eddy sound effects had me dying frieza race for the win what does the androids get i love the game and everything this could mean i really hope we see love in other games as well not just in dokkan sadly sometimes i am just dog shit on the charge meter i actually tried this game but i was quickly bored since i was op af very early thanks to the promo gacha im in love with this game hope so we can part 2 rhyme i think im correct about this but the thing is with shenron is the stats you have before advancing to another class the stats you had are your base stats for that class so its a good idea to get max level then advance the class this is sold out in atlanta i will wait until lv99 to classup because it resets the character to lv1 but mantais some of the stats 50 i believe dont judge me but i picked the male saiyan as my first race to start the game i enjoy playing the game i just want to mash square to fight all this stuff just to attack so i got some tips for you i am not the best at team making but i would reccomend making your team of maximum 2 types like for mine i like to have elite and beserker i was waiting for that jojos reference charging full price for a game that has graphics from 2 gens ago is pathetic not gonna waste my cash on this ugly game at 808 you should have put za wardo 1999 to 2999 game paying 5999 for this game is insane and i love the dragon ball series i went with male saiyan i didnt really fancy namek or frieza its a fun game and different as well as similar to xenoverse this game is dragon ball fanservice incarnate and i love it its so addicting and i cant stop playing it do i need to be connected to the internet to buy packs d all my fellow androids where you at heroes giving you way more luck than dokkan i started with the saiyan male just for the sake of the story mode not looking goofy but you can very easily change so its fine ill probably play either saiyan female berserker long term to get my old boosts from umx back or maybe demon for funsies good stuff playing joycons detached secondcomfiest way to play after handheld mode handheld is the best way to play overall if only hero colosseum on xenoverse 2 could have been this good maybe next time would have got this game if it was on ps4 please do more of these its looks so fun bruh this game actually looks really fun i love the game and its fun but i choose namkian and it keeps failing to let me fuse with picolo and i cant figure out why like turn two happens and it doesnt give me the opinion i can get it to work in arcade and if i am playing as an ally who is namkian but it wont happen when im my avatarplease someone explain is this an bug or am i possible doing something wrong man i wish i had a switch love this game btw cell x is hell to fight game was sold out in best buy eb games and toys r us locally so best buy is mailing me my copy lol totes gonna play a majin gotta rep the pink blobs damn rhyme i bet you didnt even wait to max your avatar before upgrading his class hacks lol which race did i choose pffftttttt we saiyans out here fam been loving the game my self just got my saiyan to the super god class been wanting to play heros for years and honestly im enjoying every second of it i love this game i went with the demon race because im just different like that love this game more than xenoverse 2 im still tryna figure out the blue purple and redorange card meaning and their purpose can someone explain in legends terms lol you dont have the dragon balls to to dark broly mission was going to go sayain but i felt in my heart i need to be a android def would love to face you when did they add dio and jotaro to get berserker you need to make your avatar level 12 and before that you get elitel i think level 7 or 8 also to change it go to hero data by pressing when on board or herotown and choose hero data and press y and choose class and super attack this is the only way to change super attack for avatar i was sooooo looking forward to picking up this game after having played db heroes on the 3ds this gameplay disappointed me even more than anthem did once i reached lvl 30 i was expecting a battle system akin to the 3ds entry i honestly dont even think ill pick it up if it goes on sale lol the editing is golden honestly anyone mind trying my hardest custom mission went with the saiyan race and today i pulled dark broly on a rare ticket single i chose namekian but changed it saiyan because i wanted a super saiyan god avatar although i still dont know if its just an urban legend my leg classic meme ohohohoho frieza is nothing compare to zamasu try him lol i got all the pre order cards and gogeta cards without even pre ordering the game how do you like the game so far my boi can a brother get a full review please this looks interesting as hell honestly this and dragonball fusions are my two favorites great games is there any way to get the pre order ui goku without preordering at first i didnt think the game looked but but my god it looks fun now can someone give me an answer to a question i know if you preordered you get the hero edition with the cards in game and the actual physical cards but if you didnt preorder can you still buy the hero edition with all the other stuff included soo about my super duper virginity the character models look like there are from budokai 3 doesnt he already have ui goku we want morewe want more wait hold up you can use yugioh ost in videos without getting copyright cause no lie ive been dying to use passionate duelist i preordered mine a while ago its gonna arrive in like the 10th16th lol wait till you get sec vegito blue will start hitting for 50k to 99999 that mui goku art work though btw u should summon for dark masked king red 4 stars ui goku with vegetared 4 starsgreat priestred 4 stars the super saiyan berserk goku that u already have duhhh4stars and evil saiyanred 4 stars and golden cooler is also nice red 4 stars luv this game really enjoy your content please do more videos on sdbh boiiii iv been soo adict to the game already have a god tier team just need great priest and gg btw keep up the good work p my only disapointement from this game is that there are a lot of cards and arcade stories missing looks really fun but i hate card stuff games is this game local multiplayer i chosed the saiyan race i want that ssj blue i have four cards of dragonfist on my team lol i feast on the opposition i picked the dark demon god they looked so cool you should use hero ssb vegeta his passive really helps with going first how can they make dlc lol they got an every db character imaginable and you can create quests so why whoud they add dlc quest lol already have both from summon but im the god summoner ive gotten everything blue vegito berserk goku kaioken xeno vegito gold cooler dark sayin all ultra instincts every single card almost i actually got this on pc and switch because i couldnt wait for my physical switch copy to come in the mail haha ive mainly been playing story mode so i can unlock the additional avatar slots i hope this does well enough to at least get dlc to add some of the card sets that have been released since the game was in development i also hope it is popular enough to get future games in the series over here since i know we will never have the arcade game considering the state of arcades in the west demon god also i made a god of destruction goten card fortunatlyyou killed it in 2 turnits on the 3rd turn that freezy pop goes strong just so you know the cards you get from pre ordering are not exclusive cards they are just early unlocks i got that exact same goku myself i think i got him from a rare ticket draw i like the game even if it looks awful and has the most basic combat of attack or rest all the characters and attacks are fun i bought this game on pc and absolutely love it keep creating great content rhyme i bought this game expecting to not play it much by i love it i hope you make more content on heroes since we got 5k likes you probably will yeah plz make some more content of this im lovin so far why does this feel like a clunky mobile game yikes i went for uvm 1 and let me tell you those cards rock fu jiren and goku ui bottom cards of the list in 1 team are absolutely beast specialy if you can activate the link power of jiren and have god vegeta and u gohan in it aswel i choose the dark demon god race im loving the game so far hey im wearing the same shirt 905 i dont know why that meme is so perfect for frieza i choss android how did u buy it its not out for me yet i want to play this game so much moree dragon ball heroess this is an amazing game plz make more content still not sure i wanna pay full price for this game its a lot more expensive where i live and switch games rarely go on sale as is the ur blue vegeta is also an awesome card uvm2 his ability is attacker x1500 power level so you can get the first attack on your enemies easier i think the pc version does not have auras while the switch has maybe its just me but i have watched walkthroughs on both pc and switch and on pc i never noticed auras on the characters while on the switch i notice everytime 810 you thought it was ssj3 gogeta but is was me dio wow i need to get this amazing game edit damn its strategy based i commented too soon lol well to

actually sold out in my city i cant believe it i had to order it i hope it arrives soon i cant wait to play it i have a ss2 gohan with dragon fist i love this game so much i just pulled ss4 gohan more

like this are now possible in dokkan even if they release a yearly heroes dokkan fest that would be mad hype super dragon ball heroes was just recently released for the nintendo switch and well it also came to the pc i didnt think i was going to like this game i wasnt even going to buy it but i bought it and i love it but now im having a problem my female saiyan character wont go super saiyan anymore she used to do it after the second or third turn and now im 5 or 7 turns in and she will not go super saiyan can anyone help me summon videos when this game was totally worth my 60 dollars nano vs rhyme dual summoning video for heroes coming soon truth said do not promote your avatar to ult class until you are max lvl berserk goku is the shit i also have him in my team the sound effects in the background are killing me like always lmao best content creator im really struggling not to buy this game so is it legit worth the money edit you put in the ora oras but not ze worldo wth rhymestyle im trynna see more please show morepause looks like a cool game but the character models are just reskin budokai models its cool but kinda expected something a little different this game is pushin me to buy a switch lol neat i want more story lol whats that i can play hero coliseum on xenoverse 2 for a very similar experience for no extra cost sounds great heard there was dlc leaked so going to be fun paying 20 for new sets lmao an arcade style game is not worth 60 save your money and wait 3 months when it crashes fight ndukauba on this game i chose demon i dont know why but as soon as i saw it i chose it it kinda sucks how we dont have transformed android 21 yet its one set later i wonder if they will release a new game or update the sets via dlc i want all versions of 21 she ultimate waifu 3 female saiyan because there was no other female classwhich kinda sucks please upload more i love it who else wants sayian to bond with other sayains will it be released for ps4 an xbox will you be doing arcade mode in this game infuture videos he got 2 secret rares i 1 multi what sorcery is this please give us more of this game im in love with this game and cannot wait to get a copy of my own idk what i want to pick trying out the female saiyan i got the launch edition on switch and im still trying to find out how i get the cards i was promised hey rhyme you finall got trunks and mai ohhh wait why is the game so expensive dont do what he said lol upgrade your class once your character is maxed out the game looks fun but the animations are a bit dissapointing id watch summons of this sorry but i stole your profile picture and put it on my xbox account bout to buy the game okay about pre ordering the game to get those ypu didnt need to since their are hero editions in the store which come with the pre order cards this and the upcoming links awakening remake is really making me want to get a switch daaaamn boi fire multi in the end secret rares are this games equivalent of lrs btw so rhyme just got a fat ass double lr summon just to flex btw i loved this vid please do more sdbh content i chose the 3 legged race with my parrotwait wrong game i went android to respect mvp 17 i really like this game can i still get that ui omen goku if i didnt preorder the game i really hope someday the arcade game gets localised because id like to actually collect the physical cards as a collector i chose note seing a super sayian blue note and a base class not in part 3 ch 2 is weird i cannot believe this game released in the west i love it so much ive been playing it nonstop since it came out i dont understand half of what happened but this game is godly so this is the card game currently working on a set of missions where you fight my customized cards starting with cui gotta get farming for those 34 blank cards really loving the creation mode honestly ive already made 5 or 6 of my own please try em out my names zeo in game so look up my name to find them or just pickle boys in case you cant find my missions through my name i play on pc and its so fun its so much better than i expected i 2 turn super bosses with my current setup god bosses however nah started as dark demon god but switched to saiyan to get the super saiyan transformations im a supreme kai because i was hoping to customize the design but supreme kais seem the most unique on here besides maybe the android or some female looks idk too bad i dont own a switch lul frieza is tough i fear that green fusion dressed in all black ningen was the last thing i heard dio used his stand the word 815 i went supreme kai for my first cac saiyan for my 2nd and when i unlock the third slot ill either do a demon or android i didnt pre order but i still got the cards that game is dope i would be cool rhyme if you do more sdbwm content 816 is that a jojo reference free to play dokkan but better i was very lucky to win this boss battle after my second try with vegeta i hope yuou put more sdbh vids in the future pd 248 i see that you also have 21 and xeno goku just like my main team x3 put anyone with solid battle plan on your team and leave them down in support theyre decrease your ci speed and make clashes a lil easier for you i just got this yesterday i got to rep androids 3 hey guys btw the game already has 29 dlcs according to pc dataminers these include the music packs and the power boost nice to see youre not only back on xenoverse 2 but youre also on super dragon ball heroes rhyme just to share in sdbheroes i went after the demon clan avatar and ive been having a blast with his draw special ability it basically steals hp and damages the enemy at the same time one of my favorite teams is running my demon clan avatar elite demon goddess towa demigra and mira all together because they all have damage abilities capable of chipping away health regardless of the charge impact battle results basically i enjoy xenoverse character teams gimmick teams i cant wait to see what kind of videos you push out budokai had graphics that rivaled this why i wasnt sure about this game but now that you showed it to me my wallet makes a sacrifice today this game is great on the switch being able to use the touch screen for everything feels really good also cant wait to see you do some multiplayer content with the squad pvp fights and summons would be nice also something like you guys making missions for each other to take on could be cool going to have to pick me up a copy of this it looks amazing congrats on your summons aha i hope you do more dragon ball hero content on your youtube channel i think you know what you have to do rhyme its time to get nano on for some pvp i heard those oras nice i went for namekian because i thought merging with piccolo would be really unique it wasnt demon classss boiiii question is is it worth to buy a nintendo switch for it i chose female saipan bc you cant be a super sandwich if you cant go super saiyan i would love to see more of this you should wait until youre level 50 to class up pretty sure everyone picked male saiyan i know im a dude but im not afraid to admit that i chose the female sayian mostly because the berserker class looks very cool and just destroys everything majin racebesreker which is kid buu rhyme is it worth getting a switch for i love all the stuff in the game ive seen please do more of this i love it hows the replayabiltyi am still having mixed feelings with the game i took freeza race too going male saiyan first then android majin and demon god managed to pick up the last copy at my gamestop i felt so lucky to get it because the cashier told me that 4 people looked at it and didnt buy it they rly turned dragon ball into a turn based game smh duuuuude congrats on that double pull this game is wayyy better than i thought i wish we could use the cards i love your sound effects also the reason why the golden frieza fight is so hard is because on round 3 golden frieza transforms into golden frieza angered and also not playable yet and not only will he do a lot of damage he also always has his super ready im on chapter 4 and i think the story mode is pretty good im not sure about everyone elses opinions on it brroooo im so pissed i sold my switch about a month ago because i found that i just wasnt playing it much with my xbox being my main console and god knows if i knew this was coming out i would be playing it everyday guess ill have to buy another one just for this game this game looks really boring do a heroes summon video ill say this im done playing dokkan battle because at least with this game its all free base so anyone can become a whale and upload a lot of summoning videos on their channel like i am plus you can have any team you want without no cost i want to see more rhym so yes we want more can u plz do a summoning video on this it would be amazing i chose supreme kai and holy shit i love this game sooo much i actually have fun playing a dbz game last time i enjoyed a game thats dragon ball was raging blast 2 i was thinking about whether or not i should get this game but after the twitch stream and this vid i need this game in my life take my money started out the game with an android character but then switched to a berserker female saiyan i would donate my lr trunks and mai but thats my first summonable lr you right i got the launch edition of the eshop which includes the hero pack but i didnt even get the cards can anyone suggest a team for me ive never played the heroes series before or the actual card game and have now idea on building decks jesus they could made better animations that game looks fun omgthis video makes me happy to be a super sandwich someone give me an nintendo switch now i hope that we can get dlc of the other universe mission sets probably once the whole thing with cumber and hearts is done rhyme there is a ssj adult gohan berserker in sdh set 1 that lowers ci charge why is it only available till may in the eshop ima definitely gonna get this game on my birthday damn didnt even know that game had charater creations rhym i want ur opinion about the new db legends ban system i dont like preorder bonuses and any collectorsdeluxe edition only content i only buy games that have all of the content in the game that everyone can access all of the games content whatever you guys do do not wish for a class up you should wish for a class up after youve maxed out your characters level to maximize your characters stats anyone know the song name at 1135 i want the game and if i have it im going makai demon kai 256 that sounded very weird and funny note vb is top 3 where the mobile version at tho what about ui goku definitely getting a switch for this man arent rhymezas videos upload at the clutches times i have absolutely been loving this game so far wait can you buy this game like now getting this for my birthday and im choosing saiyan does it matter which male saiyan i pick we need them to update it with more cards and add gogeta blue amd broly i absolutely love an adore this game my favorite team so far to run is a menacing super saiyan 4 team i like how angry rhyme was against fused zamasu if you really want to capitalize on berserk gokus absurd damage while also mitigating his issue of constantly draining stamina id recommend pulling sp gine as a partner for him we are gathered here today to remember beeruss leg f did anyone else have to take a writing test today yo rhyme do you need wifi to play like to get characters like the berserker goku and etc i used my wish for a how to build a party guide getting beat hella bad on the harder difficulties this game is well ported for a arcade game on switch and pc its support smooth and controls just work without fail damn that last multi hot firee okay this game seems more worthwhile and worth the time than xenoverse or fighterz especially with custom missions we all know how well level creators do technically your supposed to max your char stats then upgrade but who tf cares this games awesome play however u want why the my leg in the intro not complaining its hilarious but why tho i originally thought id go with a regular ol earthling but when it turned out the closest they had was android i instead went with saiyan male for my avatar though i must admit the dark demon god was really tempting and ill probably go with that for the next one yo dino i just hit a stunned enemy with my mui goku for 99999 damage rhyme you want a really difficult mission do the last one of xeno bardock just give me this in xenoverse please weird question but what song is at 1125 i chose saiyan i already got him to ssjb hey rhyme are you gonna play online with fans because id really like to play with you what is your switch friend code i need this is on the ps4 cause i dont have a switch i picked namakian cause no one else would do summoning videos please wish i had a switch i picked the majin race only because of the berserk style since it is like kid buuone of my favorite villains in dbz because of just how insane he is i choose the demon god and got a destructive team already lol i cant believe people are shitting on this game we have been wanting this game to release on global for the longest and now it has just because its not another fighterz doesnt mean it isnt a good game definitely getting this with my next paycheck i chose female saiyan but used a wish to use a demon because thats all ive been pulling current team is deemon god demigra demon god shroom demon god buu xeno demon god dabura xeno demon god towa and ssj3 bardock xeno was on the fence about this game because it looked weird man it looks fun as shit actually seeing it being played now i really want it hehe of course i want to watch more of this 1141 so thats what that dragon sounds like i preordered the hero edition at my local gamestore but they game me the normal edition fun video would love more your eyes are still too far apart the story and such is what xeno 2 shouldve been instead of replaying dbzs again for the majority of the story or at least go to the original db sagas if youll put any base form gohan in your team gohan ssbe vegeta and mui goku have combo ult for 60k damage though you need 10 energy for it rhyme we need a new name for when golden freiza transforms would it be goldener freiza goldenest freiza this game is awesome we waited 11 years for them to release it to the west and boy were not disappointed i picked the supreme kai avatar i like it a lot keep uploading it plz i went with kai i pulled ssj4 gohan vegito and gogeta on my second multi berserker goku was in a third so im good with what i have ok this actually fun saiyan and i havent tried arcade but holy crap ot looks fun here comes a new hype summon series for your channel im exited for the next video is this yugioh sountrack i chose dark demon god and im loving this game right now been playing all weekend i am sayin and i am already ssj blue im getting the game in like a hour im hyped as hell in leaving a like cause i wanna see you play this game against nano and other dragon ball youtubers lol i love the cards you get when you preoder i feel like theyd do it with card sets and story in dlc i got the rage ssj goku and he is broken sucks this isnt on ps4 touch pad wouldve been perfect for this i hope next year i can get a nintendo switch so i can play this game rhymestyle your the best dragon ball youtuber ive been watching yu for 4 years now im looking forward to getting it thanks to you bro keep playing this damn game i love this gane so much its really fun how can i tell which card type beats what its that a jojos reference dimps did an amazing job with this game im loving the feedback the my leg though this game have dbs broly this game is extremely fun and is worth getting these dudes love card games way too much lmao just got payed totally grabbing this on my way home from work tonight i dont get how you play the game so i dont care anymore i wish they dropped it on consoles or at least phones i want a dbz game like this i love it but dont do a vid with nano that dude sucks just do summons with dfree or brad or damn man after watching that i need a part two this game looks so amazing rhyme chose android but switched to saiyan notification squad also rhyme ur bromance w seereax and his little music spongebob thing you guys did was utterly fantastic i want to get it so i can make custom cards why does this game look so shit in terms of graphic picked the majin race because i dont think anyone will ever pick it i chose the sayian race game is cool and i want you to keep playing it though the graphics are kind of bad so i dislike the game a little keep on going with good vids btw this game is available on steam for people who dont own a switch idk if cross play is a thing or not tho nah golden frieza was easy fused zamasu is difficult as hell is it ever coming to console hey rhyme if i get the game i want to fight you and ascend beyond super sandwich into a sandwich god i want the game but im not spending 60 for it so hope this game does good outside japan so we can get more hero games in the future i chose female saiyan cause iv always liked notes design show more gameplay i called it knew you would make this video soon your sound effects are getting better and better keep it up this man did everything right but put yeet instead of za warudo dude this game is so dope cant believe i have to wait till after my exams to play it imagine if they remade this game but with budikai 3 gameplay sooo about my leg also if people are wondering why isnt dbs broly or gogeta blue isnt in the game its because this game only has stuff from universe mission 1 and 2 and the broly gogeta and the other broly movie characters are in the other universe missions basically 57 so the only version of cumber that people can get is him in the straight jacket but you can still get fu and golden cooler as for the others well i think they might do either dlc or updates for the game man i wanna get this game so badly looks amazing i canr buy it right now so glad to see you playing it so fun lol now i really want it even more did you ever beat cumber has anyone seen the dlc leaksdatamines just curious p i went with saiyan and i just pulled um2 ui goku the one with vegeta d play more dragon ball heroes 816 i was gonna say you missed a opportunity to put a za warudo when gogeta stopped time but i guessed you are redeemed for putting in the ora ora oras 100th comment i bought it digitally and i never got the cards for pre order bonus does anyone know what to do i picked the supreme kai race to be different and this game is addicting plus some communities are showing their true colors so im not to keen on ningens right now xenoverse vs sdbh like for sdbh comment for x we all know this trick i would love to buy this game but i dont know if i would be good at this game but gotta try right even though i dont find an interest in this game because its extremely boring for me and yeah ive played it for myself i can see why people would call it a good game so the thing for me is why are people complaining that this game isnt worth 60 this is honestly worth 60 to people say its trash because of the graphics theyre wrong ssj3 gotenk straight up za warudo frieza so this game is basically that one mode in xenoverse 2 but a hell of a lot better so about not being shtupid finally that tie freeze was the perfect time to use za warudo 815 its that a mother fuciing jojos reference i went with saiyan i remember you raging last night with merged zamasu oof waiting for the summon videos dark demon god also can i say how insane this game is this is like 100 hour content i became super saiyan blue super god class lol i wouldnt mind seeing dimps use these character models to make the most ridiculous budokai game if only it was on more than the switch i already got to ssb love this game cant wait for more content from you hey rhyme i didnt get that goku but i got the other ui goku i chose saiyan as my avatar because im basic we need you to fight nano i legit love this game so much fun thanks for the new vid rhyme i need to upgrade my pc to play this game apparently i dont meet the minimum system requirements xx i think im just under this game looks amazing wheres my paycheck wen i need it also i hope this means for other games we can get things like this in other dragon ball games cause in terms of how you play i like xenoverse the best when it works so ifwhen xenoverse 3 comes out o hope they can use stuff from dragon ball heroes like golden cooler just imagine whats next just bought the game a couple of hours ago and ive had so much fun i have a team that when its round 2 nearly everyone on my team will use their ultimate ability like a dragon fist with future gohanks it is the best player anyone has the same problems with online going in sdbh any one here playd the 3ds version these are basically classics now im in love with this game i really hope this gets fantastic support so we get more i chose demon god pretty op in my opinion sdbh dual summons with truth nano andor dfree wen i chose saiyan form after hearing that my leg in the intro i had to instantly hit like not gonna lie this game is one of the funest dbz games i have ever played and it wayy more fun then the yugioh games so im gonna give it a 910 its a fun handheld dbz game and im happy that we finally got it worldwide i have a question is it worth buying a switch to play this game notification squad where you at 8 views 35 likes and 10 comments youtube everybody rhymes vids are always edit i cant wait for more db heroes content

ridiculous golden frieza arcade boss battle lmao thank you ichigo very helpful im a pleb on the game still lol ayeeeee i had to go last night on stream but im glad i was able to help e anche per telefono e su switch se credo bene meglio per switch o pc non ho la switch menomale che ci sei tu a potara fusion team vegito optional forms kefla fused zamasu i dont know some so just use their random forms try and do a goku family team just play hero colleseum i got 2 teen goku great apes in the same draw how did you get long hair on your cac for heroes i wish we could still have matches like this instead of every team ever being either ss4 xeno gogeta or berserk goku either you win instantly or you lose instantly ik am late but i have a team for pvp i win with this team all the time super sayian kaiokan vegito grand kai red four star ui goku the one with vegeta evil sayian ssjb vegito dark masked king and ssj3 vegito 428 krillin owned count 1 top team i want to see more of this im new to your chanel just subscribed and hit the like okay i just felt some amount of disrespect when goku said owari da there was just something about it did you know ultra instinct stands for leave a like do a fusion team mui ssbevl team you have a team of 6 ui gokus and your cac so you get to summon vegeta to blow himself up 6 times i made a custom angel frieza for the tournament of power team and gave it a double attack with shirtless goku for the final shot use a full gogeta team you should also include a goku and vegeta that can fuse hey burcol i was wondering which ui goku it was that was transforming to mui from the 11 minute mark it would be really helpful this is pretty much the hero colluseum god team burcol will never play dragon ball for kenect not really a theme team but just a really cancerous one ssj4 xeno gogeta suit frieza the idea is that you push up only gogeta up first turn and he gets 3 attacks because of his ability and suit frieza has a link which gives an ally a super attack once they attack even if they dont have enough energy please do full ssj4 team in super dragon ball heroes this video was full of that dank genki ah its mine 0 that team looks scary af goku gave them the jiren goku wants to be jiren so bad z fighters team i play xenonverse but always run into guys who are trying to hit on me while i beat them but this game looks soo cool so this is the power of ultra instinct im not sure if im going to get this game its a bit too expensive for what it is last ive checked anyways is it possible to battle you if i got xbox i think all the gods of destruction are in here and as such a full god of destruction team be cool iwan jerez mulemosco quitla arak champa beerus liqueur sidra rumush vermoud giin just pick 7 of them when you get them anyway how about a villian deck definitely not gonna pay that much money for a stand alone hero colosseum but i definitely dont mind watching it wait since when is there pvp that ending was just wow im amazed and scared of ui goku my favorite team to run so far is a ssj4 team with the ability menacing super saiyan 4 i suggest it how did you get your cacs hair pink and ssj3 looking 1211 holy shit what have you done i wish u can change how ur cac looks and we could make one cac man and cacurl whoa this cac looks different g force how to properly say it supa dorangon boru heroos this dmg 999 d this like battle colosium i like this game please make more vids and this guy picks ultra instinct goku i think the like button liked itself in a burcol voice those arent enough ultra instinct gokus you should do a full xeno team that owari da left jiren running for the hills breathes in bodiedah which gacha did you summon them on ive got 3 teams that you could do hopefully you actually see and use some of these 1 purefull blooded saiyans 2 godly might use only cards that are gods or god ki stuff like ssjg ssjb ultra instinct etc 3 time patrol use only cards that are part of the time patrol cards like xeno goku xeno vegeta xeno gohan etc definitely one of the harder games out there on switch up there with mega man 11 still very fun and addicting though im loving this game so far looking forward to more content on it and how about a full ssj4 team for a video this is basically the battle simulator in xenoverse 2 how do you change the music in game aye burcol use an android build in dbxv2 what about a full demon team fu salsa gravy any mira any towa putine dabura or demigra 922 was the best part dont me id love to see a team of as many different vegeta forms as possible so base ssj1 ssj2 ssj3 ssj4 ssgss and blue evolved if you have it from the preorder pack full child team in world missiom do a goku black team plz that mui goku thats said owari da was very noiicceeee jiren doesnt want to know your location do a full hercule team and he picks ultra instinct goku times 7 i kinda want to get the game but i dont want to have to pay 100 for it so im going to have to wait for when the stars aline for the extremely rare event off switch games going on sale am i the only one that doesnt see why people like this game its just like hero colosseum xv2 only difference is this is like you pay 60 for a gacha game i mean thats all i see just my opinion 7 trucker hat man robot thing team did u know g stands for leave a like phrase of the year fusion team goten kid trunks kid xeno goten xeno trunks gohanks xeno vegito ssj kaioken ss3 your choice xeno gogeta ssj ssj3 ss4 your choice and now he uses not 1 not 2 not 3 not 4 not 5 not 6 but 7 ui gokus now we need a demon clan team this game is so fucking good it looks so scuffed lol so this is what happened to all the ones he bodied is this game is console only if so is it free get this for me burcol what are you playing on and this is the journey of ulta instinct goku ssj4 team ssj4 goku ssj4 vegeta ssj4 gohan ssj4 bardock ssj4 gogeta ssj4 broly dark broly technically counts is this game worth it id like to see a full super dragon ball heroes team of zamasu zamasu black black ros merged zamasu and then a few more of them full fusion team characters that fuse together can count for me it was 7 mins ago i now he picks ultra instinct goku whole video ends intensity intesifies xd instinct instinctifies cacacacacacacac yo question is it worrh buying a switch for this game also u should do a team of all gokus different super sayian forms i wanna see that ssjg video i want this game eevery ccard iis rrandom l e a v e a l i k e how about the weakest team hey burcol love the videos keep up the good work were can i get this game hello to there burcol saammmaaa master of cac and thats enough of ultra instinct goku 11 likes 0 views 4 comments yeah ok youtube oh yea yea super dragon ball heroes and thats enough of ultra instinct your to op cac how can you beat him if you dont have these cards its looks like yugioh with trading card game this final boss fight is tough for all of the unnecessary reasons i had a tough time with some bosses like cellx and golden frieza tagteam goku black in which set can i get these cards im stuck chapter 5 sub chapter 3 once my team has to split up i beat a couple battles but wont let me go further says not all individual battles complete only thing i can see is it says i need to complete after frieza and cell to unlock the barrier but how do i do that and hit and goku black slo should still have his powers though 439 its sephiroth this game is a piece of shit dont waste your money the entire battle mechanic is based on pressing a button when the bar is full the only thing interesting is the story which you can get from watching youtube lol i used a custom deck and put energy siphon on 4 different characters when that wasnt enough i added in berserk goku w nerves of steel and grand priest for a round 2 overkill im on chapter 4 have you done the neko majin side story and the kuriza side story thanks for the massive spoiler in the thumbnail and fuck you as well great series ik never gonna happen but wish this came to ps in future or a new game so i dont have to spend more on buying switch and game 3 and a half hour stream into 49 minutes that must be hard to do man youre a legend that dab at the end had me dying congrats for beating the game love every minute of it ps i never know you were asian i thought you were from here well anyway have great day slo what if they added shallot into this like ssj3 shallot ssj4 shallot and ssjg or ssjb shallot i was thinking of a different ending where after all thats happened the scene goes back to the sdbh stage and beat goes against someone and as their about to fight beat looks at his goku card puts it on the field and as the avatars go in and before their about to fight his goku card avatar looks back at him with a smile and nods and so does beat that ssgss vegito 99999 damage is absolutely beautiful huula laala hu i dont know why commented like that dang i missed the streamnooooooo this one is gonna be hype 1023 hey theres my comment d i cant finish the last mission please teach me papi ok the story of this game is beyond baddid they just force another random person as part of gokus family tree wtfi know its non cannon but still how long would you say the average story mode run is for a person to beat onepunchfinalkamehameha sloarmy vegitossb

cards to collect and more content in general for free thanks dude that thumbnail was so budokai tenkaichi esk gogeta blue and god vegeta have the wrong supers 303 ultra instinct sign kid goku really cool to see this game getting a free update despite me not having it lol i cant wait to see broly in fighterz alongside gogeta weve got a wild one her i got all the new units was very easy can we get this broly and his attacks knowing goku hed probably be critically injured by those shots from cheelai and lemo here comes vic ready to fuck your shit up nobody gonna talk about kid goku going ultra instinct how to update the game on pc what set is broly in dub this game its so bad without it top how much of the story will the free demo have im happy theres a demo because ill probably wont have enough for the full version for a while no super sayian broly somehow the update doesnt let me play the game in spanish im here just to see budokai 3 new broly demo in a nutshell a a a a a a too much pointless talking after the last update the translation of super dragon ball super world mission to brazilian portuguese is not working on switch i liked liquiir that god of destruction threetailed fox i wanted to see him again in canonical anime or not without him dying im a fan of that character good job bandai and free thank you really great job its the update now out amazing work already cant wait to see where the game will be few months time oh oh first free updatewhich mean my favorite dragon ball heroes song is the 1st super dragon ball heroes song i have a question where is super saiyan ctype and btype full power broly from dragon ball super broly the movie and what if i dont like the songs ok now add super saiyan 4 to fighter z just got this 2 days ago i regret nothing so you think this broly can take on dark broly im actually kind of grateful the game didnt get an english dub you all know why yes finally i get to play as broly and the way he was beating up ssj god gogeta in his wrath state was priceless what about the ios that bgm customizer is the gold to me customize the music meoh god no omg very thx bandai this game is amazing d awesome and im glad this is free also does this mean the demo in english is free on the english eshop i need a switch and this game i really want to get this game bulma whit shotgun farmer whit shotgun honestly bulma scare even goku y vegeta how do you get the update wait a minute where is broly ssj and ssj full power where is soul punisherstar dust breaker tho sikk i better pull a broly soon guys where i can download update from i cant find it anywhere i am playing on pc is this a game with many paid dlcs where are the missions custom bgm awesome gine is so cute i cant find the demo on the website it just has standard and hero edition on the switch what an amazing update amazing bandai but please in future put the all universe mission expansions need omega shenron mecha zamas wait thats it just these cards from the movie neat update done but no new cards why does this shitty game have budokai 3 graphics like the new cards but im dissappointed with the music settings they went out of their way to implement new bgm for new missions but they only put db heroes theme songs in the settings its a shame you cant choose between all the different bgms from the actual game dude why is bulma in the fight im thankful an all but its looks like that broly unit cant transform if only they can put these characters in the actual fighting games please add the ability to tone down particle effects if only this game was available for ps4 xbox one and 3ds yes thats exactly what i wanted this really should just be a tenkaichi game youre the ducking best bandai thanks for this game sr not ur and this is just the first update i just wish they had english dubbed it so i could hear sean schemmel saying kamehameha wow a free update never seen that before and here i thought that youd had to pay to get updates for a game ty sarcasm because we all know that updates are always free and most dlc arent so why theyd put free update there doesnt maken sensebut hey ty for the extra cards game is nice this and mk11 is all i need well this sure came quick thanks bandai god i wish we had this for ps4 did i just see kid goku go ultra instinct sign at the end wow this is great free loads of new stuff free where i can find this on switch how do i get the update if i illegally downloaded the game yaaass i really cant understand the people who hates db heroes this looks sick ugh fine dont give us the 11 missing cards then finaly nappa with hair promoted better than fighterz haha ultra instinct toddler goku this is why this game is amazing so happy the demo is finally out this is the most addicting game ive played in a very long time and has basically any character ive always wanted to see in a dragon ball game as a 20 year db fan i absolutely love and adore this game this is the best game ever my first summon gave me chilie wow more cards and i was about to finish all camaraderie xd the game is trash do it broly free update game thank you love bandai damn thank you bandai namco tbh i like the graphics for the game it gives off an old rpg vibe like ff7 to bad many fans will miss put on this since they want every game to be fighterz this game added gine as a card before dokkan did and thats an accomplishment super warriors huh the legendary warrior of space cant believe im asking for this but add some dlc would love to have more arcade stages card sets and other items to play with wait was that ultra instinct broly at the end there the worst video game actually wont lie goku deserves to die like why would you train with the saiyan who can fight gods in his base form and had to get beat by a fusion i know goku is a nice person but boi a supreme dumb fix the auras on pc version cant wait for my hame to get done downloading this outstanding update yes finally pretty nice of them making this free for once wish theyve done this more for the other dragon ball games as well instead of having us pay for more content that or at least give us another method to do so there is a way to have all the songs in the game at random all dlc song packs and new db heroes themes all in random im a bit disappointed that broly dosnt go super saiyan tho i really hope they make budokai 4 with all these characters since they already have the models and this is coming from someone who has never played any of the budokai games but i keep hearing praise for them wheres tokyo ghoul re call to exist at all dragonball games should only be on nintendo and pc from now on i hope its a future plan i already have all the cards thats whats up bandai do stuff like this more often just out of the blue or should i say super saiyan blue not gonna lie i saw broly and i thought it was dragon ball fighters gameplay can my boi broly go super sayain rage wished they gave us ssj broly unless that one transforms into him i download the update but i cant select spanish in text options my language is spanishfix it pls why dont let me to put my game in spanish again this is an incredible and joyful trailer if you own the game of course however its not my case so this is an trailer that hurts me in different levels anyone know where to find the steam demo 3 words dragonball is amazing and now yall put out a demo im enjoying the game though yeah so where do i download the demo its not on steam and following their link doesnt tell me shit how to get the demo i keep trying to download the demo but it keeps saying an error occurred dope now its time for the bae cheelai to use atomic kamehameha oh thank god the updates are free god bless bamco man i wonder how would this have sounded in english finally i can change the music also new cards hell yes i am aroused xeno ssj4 gogeta is still the better card in terms of damage when used with the gine support wake me up when we get uvm 345678 prepared to be owned by broly not even full universal mission set 5 just 12 cards lol maybe its me but i enjoy the budokai type graphics reminds me of playing all the dragon ball games on ps2 teambroly what about legendary ssj broly or even just ssj broly are they holding those cards off until the next update please a dragon ball warriorz if only the graphics were like legends oh nice out now perfect you can see a huge jump in animation and model quality for these units compared to the ones already in the game if this game had better graphics this game would be amazing if only for mobile do anyone actually enjoy this yey edit frist i must buy it in steam for 199 z when you lost your switch with heroes and now you cant play it with the udpate which set is tarble in no he was stun any good teams for broly saga fibal stage i was wondering what banner did you get the tarble from that big green guy his name is bojack he got banned not u bruh i got ya on a match anytime if u want some fun decks to play make golden boy sp card build pls masked sagian vegeta vegito ssj3 turn 1 masked sayian and bardok then all the nuker r3 stam recover mudel hahaha ty for the shoutout catch me on twitch boys twitchtveternalfart stop cheating you have good 4 star cards why arent you using them when you got the banned messege eternalfart also got it at the same time soo its defenetly a bug btw how did you like playing against him p also we made him use ssj3 raditz back then iir it was against you its bojack the green guy with red hair than just stop cheating than u dont need to worry toget another 1day ban looks like at the end there u was facing the cpu hey man i just woke up to another awesome video havent played much of the game but i did do my 1st 10x summon got that ultra instinct goku the one that summons vegeta from subspace is he a decent unit apparently the supreme kai of times ability is to skip to the end of the battle video freezes muda muda muda video achieves perfect resolution ayayayayayayayayayaya video resets back to the beginning killa queens bites za dusto video pauses toki wo tomare za warudo video content gets skipped kekka dake da video speeds up kami no nanioite video has duplicated overlays and crashes justice dont piss off the god of love another childrens card game you guys are amazing because of you i recently started my own lets play series of this game 1814 well when you think about it this isnt all that far off i want to make a card of vegeta using ribrianns pretty canon if i canbest game low key i feel mad at my self that i noticed that wasnt gt goku but end of z goku at 555 kale and caulifla being buff is just silly temporal judgement looked so cool wow tfs denoted fire emblem why didnt this start at the beginning im super confused im making a meaningless comment just to boost the numbers for tfs how are they playing this bahahahahaha i love how they actually start watching the clip where dende says dont piss off the god of love aaaahahahahahaah lol yea good ol namek where balls are born yes you can choose a female saiyan and look exactly like note though if you level up enough note will change appearance and you can change your avatar attribute also changing your appearance that ultra instinct goku transforms oof i love that card we got king crimsond i can confirm that if you choose saiyan girl it will look like two notes what if they make dragon ball fusions 2 for the switch i might actually get a switch if they did that card design tutorial and the earlier tutorials were the kind of excessive handholding garbage the game world needs in quantities of exactly 0 they might be acceptable on an absolute basic level if and only if they were 100 voluntary you spent barely any time actually customizing the card you know just resizing and moving goku and the card effect and the whole process took over 7 minutes with some textdialogue seemingly breezed past kirin is making making a card game color me intrigued power field thats just starkillergalen mareks force repulse force power what if they made dragonball fusions 2 on the switch i know what id do and thats preorder that shit immediately that first game was significantly better than it had any right to be like holy shit it was amazing being a saibamen sithspawn if u had picked saiyan female yes there would be 2 hero female saiyan in the cut scenes with note until u either wish to change or unlock elite oh so thats how king crimson works by far the most retarded tutorial in a video game ever theres a difference between explaining complex systems and treating your players like an idiot in college when i saw that episode laughed my ass off so hard i fell out of my chair my buddy thought i was dying was the supreme kai of times special supposed to skip time or did i just get king crimsond why does no one ever use note i have no fucking idea how this game works but im enjoying the wacky fan service characters this is actually bugging me can anyone tell me if the ultimate win conditions and high score matter in arcade mode because some requirements for the things are just bullshit to deal with or is arcade more just there for score bragging and does not really matter caulifla is awsome i approve oh my god trunks shut up wait a second did they say ultra instinct sign was the worse version of ultra instinct xicor isnt that toyotaros oc from db af who was basically goku black before black i would absolutely love a fusions 2 supreme kai of crimson attack oh excellent they are making this a series thank you 3 this is awesome more please talking about pokmon did you guys ever play or heard about dragon ball z team training you should is a rom hack of pokmon firered and a good at that you should do a nuzlocke of that game i thought it would be fun that wasnt gt goku it was goku from the end of z in super saiyan which i find awesome cause i love the end of z dogi thats not gt goku thats the goku from the uub arc before gt basically 1 episode before beginning of gt 745 wait what was with that weird cut game the saiyan saga this is where it all started dragon ball am i a joke to you wait until you get the vegetaxeno ssj4 with the god meteor ability kaiser likes cauli hes my favorite now this is where it all started for goku and the gang uh what i thought this was dragon ball heroes not dragon ball z heroes a very distinct lack of introduction and or context for the opening discussion god of love or god above more heroes also if u wanna access the summons and deck building faster just use the pause menu instead of running i love this game and i love tfs finally starting to play it evolve is a curse word in the dragonball community when i saw caulifila in the thumbnail how do say it might sound crude but i got a boner the saiyan girl avatar is the exact same as note kaiser i know you dont like mastered ultra instinct but you at the least have to admit it brought some pretty badass moments for goku i want an infinite amount of these eps with you guys did chronoa just pull a king crimson i actually wanted to see that damn yes more of this i remember dont piss off the god of love every day i also remember jeice saying wanker which is a much bigger deal in the uk lmao yes yes this is going to be fun multiplied soooooooooo no one gonna point they have a card called eertuty when you power levels means nothing this is cool as hell morei need moremore the card looks like either a the wrong end of the kamehameha or b super saiyan navi i didnt preorder shit and i still got all those cards love the little detail of chronoa using her time power and it just cuts to the end of the fight thats a time travel joke right there make dont piss off the god of love your ringtone as if your digital versions of db heroes cards depend on it im sorry i think all the universe 6 saiyans have the ugliest designs ive ever seen dont piss off the god of love dende early funimation dub yes there would be 2 of the same saiyan girls but you can change your appearance with battle type wait its not dbcember yet 2019 best year i can hear tiny goku saying byeee son you guys can change to berserker or elite which changes your character model im so happy they are continuing this i sure do wish that there would be dlc down the line where there can be the dubbed actors voicing these characters cause then id actually play it be right back i have to look up that god of love thing was this a stream i feel like i watched this im a fucking child i laughed so hard a tiny goku xd so happy to see this is gonna be a longer lets play im loving seeing more of it if only because of how excited it makes kirran was that the enemys stand ability give the preorderers a bunch of powerful cards right off the bat im sure that wont tilt the power balance of this game so far away from new players that theyd be driven out of the multiplayer mode im sure this game has leaving only the few dedicated players who either started early or really want to beat the preorderers 725 power field is literally a less coollooking version of oren and kamin attacks berserker govas now thats something i didnt think ill see lol 331 i approve of raditz being in this set i hope there is a ssj nappa im so happy were getting a series for this kalifa is a mary sue character not a marial artist jus a thug character her getting super saiyan then skipping past grade 2 and 3 and going straight to grade 4 witch is mastered super saiyan you must achieve that in order to reach grade 5 aka ss2 mary sue confirmed and that proves it vegeta struggled to reach this an only got as far as he did by copying goku while she only saw it once an using a tingly feeling in her back really lol why do dragon ball super fadridder find her attractive she an anorexic bobblehead fan girl of goku the women in dbz are thick in all the right places and unlike super they have genitals just watch the original series and youll see no but for real tho fusions 2 damn some of these models might be from ps2 dragon ball games like budokai 2 i swear the blue gi goku looks identitical to goku in budokai 2 in that costume upload this just took you forever also did you edit out supreme kai of times sa purposely nuzlocke this what happened with temporal judgment it just skips oh my goodness i know you learn the game mostly by playing but there was a whole tutorial for checking cards and learning their abilities dont be salty just the way ui goku looks lets just call it super saiyan ultra instinct can we talk about how gohan says good ol namek where balls are born that supreme kai of time is actually really good in multiplayer because of her passive as far as im aware shes the best counter for berserk goku please do more of this this is amazing god watching this after being hours deep into the game myself is painful theyve got no team composition nor did they even look at their abilitiestfs why can you create more character cards like you did in the beginning id think it would be awesome if they made a deck filled with tfs members 743 this must be the work of king crimson is it worth 50 bucks though you already have the best card in the game evolved ssgss vegeta is op as hell that god of love denda said he sound like astro boy 745 is this the work of an enemy stand 1115 god i love humans when you guys do the sword and shield nuzlocke no matter what gender your character is can you please make them scottish please xicor guys i made a new card i call it gohans father random kid but i dont see goku or piccolo xicor exactly dbcember coming early this year hooray a full play through from a channel i know about also anyone else here use z decks i cant be the only one who likes that i liked temporal judgement that was a fun jape huh a game about a game lol why not ui goku is a great card and you guys should play arcade mode more than the story what did you guys name your ocs in the heroes i went myself with poche oh so now its part onewhich means there will be more really glad youre doing a series of this watching you guys nerd out in the previous video was genuinely heartwarming looking forward to the rest of the nerdery 3 part 1 the second part i miss when tfs gaming didnt cut so much out the commentary made things fun how can this be part 1 i clearly remember a part before this one wow supreme kai of time seems to be a little too overpowered i mean a time manipulation attack that brings you straight to the victory screen that is pretty broken caulifla is a great and fun character i know her improvement in power is not that well liked but as a character i think she is the perfect female saiyan and she is actually a lot of fun too did supreme kai of times temporal judgement disrupt time dbcember came early im so excited to see more look guys dont piss off the god of love yes this is the best thing to wake up to kirran 100 in and your the best please dont ever change 1 team fourstar member if you pick a sayian female its totally just two of note lol until you get the different unit types gowasuforsmash wanting to see more of thiskeep up the good work so many complained about the saiyan girls power but i was distracted by their sexy 040 yup which is why i swapped to elite as soon as i could lol also every race and type hero elite and berserker do have a canon name male saiyan hero is beat and female saiyan hero is note it looks like hit was in charge of editing its time to ddddduel oh wait wrong card game yes im so glad to see you continuing this into a series also yes if you pick the female saiyan its literally just the same two models its so weird and awkward for those early cutscenes i love this games weird janky bits tbh let the god of love take higher early im early imagine the z fighters just having a panic attack after seeing everyone in the world wearing clothes with the red ribbon logo yes if you pick the female saiyanyou get a mirror mirror style welp im early and happy yes a series more classic character lore to come 748 is this the work of king crimson 742 temporal judgement oh what the f skips attack lo ve the thumbnail caulifla is probobly my second favorite dragon ball character after vegeta immediately after they mentioned the god of love i stopped the video and searched it dont forget to link to the original video as this isnt really the first one supreme kai of time special was cut off guessing thats on purpose because youtube gets a notification i am the hype that cut from supreme kais attack to misson complete was really jarring can we get less of those did did they cut out temporal judgement i cant believe supreme kai of times special was able to remove time from the video supreme kai of time special ability king crimson we didnt get to see all of the supreme kai of times special attack thank youkaiswas begining to think you were useless thats end of z goku not gt goku fusions is so good never played any of the postgame content or dlc was was that cut on temporal judgement deliberate did i get king crimsoned yes yes y e s possible spoilers i really like the demon saga that they made for this game the demon gods dark shenron and towas new designs are great part 1 ty our green god on the lookout i was really hoping for you guys to do a series for this i hope this goes on for a while how does one man get this game i have absolutely no material for this comment so in other words glad to see more tfs plays as always part 1 now this does put a smile on my face damn those sure are some ugly ass looking cards right there im looking into buying this game for switch can anyone tell me if the arcade mode sagas have cutscenes or even story events that explain what is happening im so happy they keep adding up dates its my most played game on my swtich i do hope they add more to arcade mode since the arcade game may never leave japan giving us a chance to play it through this game i think would be the next best thing which i totally would be okay with as its better to be able to play it on a switch then never at all did they make a zeno card damn im quite disappointed this update is complete trash compared to the last one still no majin android 21 ssj broly ssj3 cumber ect you know the trailers make the game look fun but the timing its not that fun if it was a mobile game then its different what about god trunks the character models look absolutely terrible pause at 125 for an example if you do not believe me smash bros 3ds was better than smash bros wii u i want this on ps4 why hasnt bandai namco jp upload this on their account yoooo i cant wait slo i have a question have you ever played attack on titan 2 if you havent i suggest it its a fun game asking for more cards from shenron see i would go back to playing this game but i legit made a team that broke the game and i kinda took all the fun outi kinda ruined it for myself lol if only xenoverse had as many updates that this welp i wish i had the game and cards i forgot all about dis game ima play it when the update starts i first heard and seen of this update since i checked on the games website and i cannot wait to add in all those cards to my collection and yes i have all the cards unlocked including all the cards from the previous updates yooo vegitos art looks clean damn the quality is really just the same as it has always been 125 this man they need to add ssj cumber wtf only 5 cards why dont they just add all of them remember when we would only get 1minute cutscenes and everyone wanted dragon ball heroes global instead of just for japan and now that dbz kakarot will be out in 2 weeks no one talks about this game how time flies ok soo can we forget the cardsand maybe get the better models that is gonna be in being bang missionplease or both works killer queen used bites the dusto still no sign of hearts being added smh man i gotta start playing this game again are there actually any of the newer characters or are these all dbh cards doctors when did you start having alzheimers me i dont remember damn dude i still dont have all the cards from previous dlc glad its still getting love though 032 who farted lol what console is this for cant wait god damn it now i need to grind more gold tickets this so awesome what game is this in roblox kinda underwhelmed but its whatever game is already dead finally another update i havent played since the last one wish i knew what he was saying nice bro and cant wait good thing i got this game on christmas so this will be the first dlc i see when it comes out huh neat shenron the green noddle please translate the trailer aye bro love the content keep it how long till xenoverse 3 what r ur expectations for it slo will u ever do a giveaway or something like that not trying to be greedy is dragon ball big bang mission a new game or and update wow cant believe i saw ssj2 vegito shallot pls whats up yo slo i cant believe the same game models they used all the way in the budokai games are still being used to this degree can you also do for all ssj3 314 okay madara calm the hell down dragonball heroes is actually revive a ss4 popularity i would like to see more i dont care if this into supercanon or just xeno guys but at least give us proper 24 mins spinoff per eps not promote bullshit vegeta can summon a fucking meteor glad i refunded this game on steam lame asf lol funny how many people bash the god firm just because its a recolor but well at least it make sense unlike ssj4 ssb is basically a blue ssj1 yes but why would you want a change in it it is just ssj with god ki of course only the hair color will change for showing it but no one talk about the new clothes goku gt got by transforming and gogeta ssj4 nonsense color palette 116 thats the one gogeta blue used in the first trailer with him for dbh so its probably the attack that the upcoming gogeta blue from the free update will be using the ss4 goku 10 instant kamehameha is the coolest ss4 super attack in the game and i have it d wish it wasnt only on the switch what are you playing this on switch hey whare xeno vegitto ssj 4 man i really wish they designed ssj4 trunks what is that outro song 322 madara get the fuck out from dragon ball 310 vegeta has the rinnegan 148 broly is ulqurroira conformed is ssj4 vegito not in world mission where ssj4 vegito tho cool game just wished that trunks would shut up im hoping we maybe get to see ssj4 trunks or nappa can we get vegeta dropping meteors in the animemanga asking for a friend super saiyan 4 will always be one of my favorite forms of all the different dragon ball anime shows rebellion hammer atomic kamehameha and warp kamehameha x10 are so far the best ones ss4 units ssb units imo that ss4 dark broly green spear javelin oozed alpha male activity sadly no super saiyan 4 for trunks and goten ssj4 is already a shit show with how much it contradicts how transformations work and a whole bunch of other issues but the fact that this game has so many hypotheticals of them just makes it even more lame heroes doesnt know how to be creative with its forms so no ssj4 vegito in this game only gogeta ssj4 broly sounds like a disaster waiting to happen where is the special team up beam attack with ssj4 gohan ssj4 goku and ssj4 vegeta so gohan does shoryuken ssj 4 broly must be even more powerful and his corrputed mask version looks awesome where is the love for ssj4 mira 143 broly out here doing to a ki blast what he did to his dad have been searching that xeno vegeta that fuse everywherewhere the hell is he if only budokai music was in it ssj4 is the true saiyan form when you find out that you cant fuse goku and vegeta from gt into ssj4 gogeta but only the xeno versions this is a whole ss4 category for dokkan lmaoo wow at first this game was just meh for me but now im like daaayuuumm maybe this will break my dokkan addiction yeah right this is game is need come on ps4 all those epic movesand do less than 4000 xd super sayain 4 its still my most favorite these moves that theyre doing should literally break reality that xeno ssj4 goku times 10 warp kamehameha was sexy asf vegeta must be watching naruto since hes dropping meteors like madara 310 vegeta out here pulling a madarathis game looks lit though wish i had a switch game looks sick asf nice techniques wish i would see in the show like vegetas good meteor subscribe to the channel dragiome kaiido please like and share comment the video thanks to you super saiyan 4 is the ultimate and yet badass form of the saiyan race can you only play dragon ball heroes in japan i hope xenoverse 3 will be a good game how can i change the saiyaman 4 outfit for the cac in story mode its driving me crazy tbh atomic kame hello true rating of game pg original rating bandai namco when wiil be naruto storm 4 in the nintendo switch i would like have the

used gogeta i got him to 99999 37k is not a lot try 99k its actually kinda common does my boi slo live in houston yao ming used to be my boi before his injury behemoth cumber which vegito is that and vegito is best fusion sloplays whats the most worth it card to go for if ive just started is anyone else having trouble with dbxv2 were your game froze when you finish a conton city mentor quest and it just freezes and even if you close app and log back into dbxv2 and on that cac its remanes frozen on that part so yoh have to play on another caci need help is there and easier way to win ci battles and a quicker way to get gacha tickets that ssj4 gogeta youre using is broken he get a 4x power level multiplayer on round 3 any tips how to improve charge impact the ci increase in arcade when attacking the boss is screwing me over am a newcomer to this series was he calling cumber dark broly i managed to do 99999 max damage he is insanely good ends the battle in round 2 make a video of how to farm gacha cards could we use the custom decks with items attached on pvp i found out you cant fuse to gt gogeta ssj4 vegito xeno or super seventeen so weird this game nice vb team how did you come up with that team build kappa thats a lot of damage what hey you know who this is be cool about this game i can say with very cool on mobile devices like saying more game of dragon ball heroes thinking youre not thinking some kind of grouping you think about that a lot of players want this game to be a mobile device computers in switch nintendo consoles with this game would be lot of cruel to play mobile devices as a lot of players play on dragon ball legends greatest of this game decides to release a dragon ball heroes characters on dokkan battles thats very cruel you really sync battles game released dragon ball hero characters on dragon ball legends game what time you going to do that youre going to pronounce that i going to see you think im not going to do that youre going to do that what is aleutian fighting sound like this game has been released in the game being released in 2018 i thought about about dragon ball legends to be released in this game is having its time for this release date and time of one time of the year re how do you get some of those cards like cumber and gogeta are they purely from the gacha oof that game looks cooo look the 999 vegito blue is god of destruction poweranyways i love this game i appreciate your hard work bro the graphics in this game sucks take down all villains thats when great saiyaman number 4 appear aka slo as beat kick injustice butt and sent them to world justice oh look first time ever 99999 the op number of awesomeness 3005 slo witness murder by vegito rip buu quick question slo do you need to preorder to get the exclusive cards or just get the game early that is a cool team i have not seen yuma and spovige since buu sega i want this on ps4 do some team moves hey sloplays awesome video bro thanks for making my day better sup sloplay how did you get so many tickets and what mission did u grind in arcade mode to get that many tickets part 4 you are so good at the game and that is why final kamehameha is my favorite move in every game it appears in especially in dragon ball fusions so early the vids in 360p it hurts my eyes but ill watch it cause slo now that s a lot of damage finally he never did anythingoh you mean the damageim sorry i thought you were refering to his usefullnes onscreen jeez you gotta make a video on how max much damage you can do with your best team what banner is ssj4 gogeta on edit also marcarita 5 likes 3 comments no views youtube ia drunk again the gods are really cool i also have a team with helles iwen arack liquir geene beerus and belmod i really love them however theyre not as good of a team as one would suspect even with amazing items they dont even come close to other teams for example i have one team with the supreme kai of time ss4 xeno goku ss xeno goku gogeta ss xeno vegeta gogeta ss xeno gotenks ss3 xeno gogeta and another ss xeno gogeta and while i dont find this team nearly as cool as the god team and even though the cards individually have worse rating its a much more powerful team than the gods i got all the god of destructions too so good win are all the god of destructions op op on a team you are not giving enough time for ci do you need to buy cards at the gacha shop to get those gods super deagle is it just me or is it really easy for belmod to activate taas like god meteor mode and super star break mode in this video belmod uses super star break mode in round 2 and in your battle vs king geedorah he uses god meteor mode in round 1 u know u ca nget these guys in the beginning and another tip on arcade mode u get tickets liek crazy noob counter attack dont kill any player counter attack 1hp the games rng is so generous you usually pull the nutts off normal tickets so its very possible to do so in less than 24 hours if you farm hard arcade missions and just pull from that set you can play with steam players in the nintendo switch this guy has an annoying voice all the gods are in the same pack which means if you can easily spam it since you get tickets back on dupes if you didint know the counter rush cant kill the enemy even if you do 100000 dmg he still would have 1 hp you cant kill with vagetas counter nice comeback that was amazing i like your channel already i bought the game yesterday and have like half of the strongest cards im only missing grand priest like 56 hours of grind lmao i dont think its that hard to earn all the cards if you do 10x summon youre guaranteed at least one new 3 or higher from normal gacha and any new 4 unless you already own all of the ones from the box its not that hard to get cards its only been out since friday and i got over 700 cards without any cheats man if this game did not have pvp this game would be sooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid boring but since it has online it is veeeeerrryyyy entertaining i am loving this actually did not expect to enjoy this games pvp to watch in your final round it dosent matter if your character is in danger you can attack with your full power bro you need practice the energy gauge dont be afraid about cheaters as you can see on this video you can have how many cards you want but if you suck that doesnt matter great job how do you switch your characters on line battle more more moreeee please so my current deck is a grand priest r2 finish deck tbh if you get cell x and ssj4 gogeta then three game so much easier if you do use these cards then make sure you have card action damaging cards after you finish attack so you can finish the enemy off just in case you mess up your ci what i would definitely recommend is going to the japanese sdbh websiteand google translating it would list you out all the cards and the abilitys thats been out and potential dlc sets how do you change your cars is dragon ball heroes ur favorite game now theres a floating cheat going around the net that provides infinite normal and rare tickets for players to summon all the cards within an hour i have highlighted this issue to steam and even asked for a refund of the game as there wont be any legit fair plays in network battle anymore but sadly steam rejected my request its like ive wasted almost 70 on a game where most ppl cheat for the cards wow that was entertaining is this a good team great saiyman3yougokupiccolo merged with kamiandroid17kalecaulifla ps potarealso goku is the beginning of the game goku and you is ssgss lv20 how can i get the great priest card one more question how to unlock the tera accessories in the shop nig sparrow how did you get call for help when do you get the tera equipment need to do something specific for when to do it for free nig sparrow could you tell me what youve given each character for items that i wanted to build and try how it plays would be

who uses him unless i can first round them with evil saiyan but im also new so its only normal to lose every game to meta if really want people to turn subtitles you should probably put in your title because lets be honest litterally nobody reads the description do the change super attack items matter cause i dont have the ones like final hope slash how did you not notice that your voice was so quiet when editing how does that even happen wtf your team is so op it caused you to lose the ability to speak english turn the subtitles on you seem to be an expert on this what do you recomend for exp farming i use the jaco mission now but the highscore is 587k on this and i only czn get 389k i have around 468473 exp all the time how did you get almost all items i cant hear your voice cause of the background music ur mic is trash the daishinkan is super op wtf are you saying the music is too loud this is literally 90 of what you will run into in pvp its truly a shame yo you cant be heard

deck is so power full you may have a chance against mrpopo by chance i mean touching his skin before dying this confused game emmm god tame holy molly pvp is going to be a cancer theres a card like

necessity for every deck if u dont have it ur gonna get wrecked by someone who does same with perfect form cell who can block all attacks for a round so op what cards are you using you never posted it 954956 lol you did 2 matches in between this game is probably the most fun ive had playing a video game in a very long time you are mikkelpoolcool bc you good you is a progamer btw can you do mic up how do you get the gold sheron medal the first one that you fought was italian alright theres no way in hell that second guy got so many perfects and those close cut wins not gonna lie i know a ci this slow can help get perfect easier but it felt reaaaaaal sus that he was still getting over you by such small margins im just saying why is vegito so pink watching you lose every ci but still coming out on top makes me wonder if this game is even worth playing i feel your pain it took a while for me to get the br goku and vegeta cards too i was so happy when i was finally able to use ssb gogeta i want to send you my team so you can copy itits always a round 2 win my team is rush hero energy kuba boy on the others heroes why not change the deck to the other one that they have btw the gogeta blue is weaker than the vegito blue card but keep going for that goku dawg if you want it that bad still hey kauba you should definitely try utilising those xeno ssj4s that fuse into gogeta after they fuse they give 3 hero energy at the start of every turn why are some missions locked and unreachable need help grind those rare tickets kauba get about 20 better chance of getting goku that way trust me we are in the end game now your sitting in a room with ndukauba and a couple other people literally nobody somebody so ndukuaba indeed man beat must have tons of stamina and energy to stay in super saiyan blue for this long well hello supreme thickness lol can you make a card in the game ndukauba find the dragon balls and increase your modules slot what is with these fusions hey bro i think that when you promote your allies class you unlock a new deck for them you should give it a look sry if my english is bad i countdown thw hours till i get to see one of your vids my teamll still destroy you 1800 intend your puns coward take a shot every time he says ill take it gladly for the area that was blocked off by chase sealas 1 it would specify if you needed an ultra finish you didnt need to ultra finish this time nest music makes me think of naruto ninja storm supreme time of thickness that echo effect is cool ndukauba i would like a heart from you and ndukauba you are the best u know xeno ssj4 goku and vegeta can fuse into xeno ssj4 gogeta that has atomic kamehameha so yeah man my favorite character is gogeta and my favorite villain is broly what about u guys hi ndukauba plz shout me out in your next vid ive been an all time subscriber dude i think you are close to the end of the game to let you know im second one we dont care who is first im first that bringer of despair ability is slowly becoming the bane of my existence goku black is too hard i cant beat him i always like how you put the ps2 days of dragon ball games because you know this series uses that driver in the game once i get my copy of this game my avatar character will be female saiyan note you are a great motivator slo you have a alot of funny and crazy videos on this game also you make bowerfull teams my man super android 13 its been a long time change back your old skin a realy hard mission trry it out d bvhjy6n why you dont show your team i wish know the cards also can you actually pay attention to the story plz y the suit slo lol 1116 you should of had your final hakai vegito blue team wow none of you in the chat have no faith in project z and are way to judgmental with it we havent even seen gameplay yet all we got was a teaser trailer and you guys already act like the game is going to be ass rip slo plays dragon ball fusions videos na goku black is not invincible all you need is antman catching him off gaurd on the toilet and its all good just hit 99999 damage cap with ssj4 xeno gogeta vegito blue team please hey bro can u do a non cannon team thatll be dope who agrees really dope gameplaythis is getting better and better business squad tho lets see how to beat this ass hole keep up with the good work do a full non canon team like vegeta ssj3 and that kind of stuf 4th love your vids d dont say retarded so casually man hello bro cool video maybe team change tournament of power edit first its like the phone one but better lol i cant stop playing it two man how come you dont play heroes anymore this game made me stop playing dokkan and legends lol i just wish there were more pc players whats the t for this guys cringe my absolute favorite has to be ssj4 xeno gogeta hes a beast as well as just being great hello just stopped by to say that you have the most punchable thumbnails i cant stop watching this grinding for level 99 is boring but its nice with extra stats love uvm ultra instinct goku currently my favorite card is the secret ssgss vegito from set 1 recomendation going forward if youre gonna make a cringy joke dont apologize for it just stand by it if its what you decide to do apologizing just hurts it more i play this game everyday to its so super i give 1010 stars my favorite card has got to be dark broly from set 7 dude hits like a damn meteor would say truck but he hits much harder lol cant decide on favorite card i like ssbe vegeta with salza blade but i am also partial to my custom saiyaman with wolf fang fist not even 48 seconds ini did not realize you could check the cards you pull thanks you dude is this a good buy im so iffy on it i think it could have a huge price drop and not sure i want to drop 60 for it 40 i would in a heart beat why do sdbh streamers keep calling gacha summons summon is a card ability that allows your card to summon another character to the battle so i keep expecting these summon videos to be a compilation of summons in the game but its just the gacha shop i favorite card is like goku instead it summons arale by the way as a tip for anyone who hasnt already figured it out if youre playing on switch and you get those qtes that ask you to move a card side to side or up and down rotate your stick in a circle it doesnt matter which direction the card is moved as the game detects any kind of movement not a specific direction as such rotating the stick will register as more movement hard for me to decide i think if i had to choose it would be ssj4 gokuxeno or ssj4 gogetaxeno good stay off legends im a saiyan because i want to go to ssgss dragon fist i still want this game so what do duplicates give u and do u need to level up cards my favorite card is either the pre order evolved vegeta or the ssj4 xeno vegeta i use the hero type demon god cac my favorite card is the oceanus shenron princess form card i made i love oceanus shenron she bae 2 bad u dont got pc or id tell u some dank ass custom missions that utilize my oceanus god i wanted you get the other cell as a troll how do i get this game those sound affects why do the 3d models look so shtupid love bandy nancy for dropping this game in usa my favorite card is super saiyan 3 raditz my favorite card is xeno ss4 gogeta sorry but those dragonball card games are just boring in my opinion i hit set 2 once and said lemme get that cell shenon actually granted my wish do dark borly you should aim for getting gine she is a really good support unit yeah time skip is really strong thats my avatars super attack currently lmao at least i know that now ill have to reset my level by changing class try to use goten xeno he will do za warudo on enemy yo rhyme im playing a namekian as my avatar im learning a lot and id like to share with you for future videos hit me up fam eh i like legends better i dont like how i cant control the fight tbh rhyme ive been asking no one been responding whos the best unit in this game just like lr ss4 goku is in dokkan who is here is that scraper sky high yes one of my favorite themes from one of my favorite characters gotan is the best card in game who gonna hit 1 million first rhymestyle ssj9k more now give more heroes literally make your channel heroes only best game cabba pulls sparking cumber the whole stat thing with class up hasnt been confirmed it is speculation also rhymestyle how do you only have 18k hp i have 43k and that is with crappy units while i grind comradierie wow this game looks lame af the fart noise killed me i wasnt expecting thats get me a switch and this you and dfree should do a pvp video what is rhyme playing on makes me glad that i didnt spend any money on dokkan this game is much more fun to me i wish we got these cards physically too even just to collect i loved the cards from the broly movie me toothat game is amazing not sure if quests made by pc users show up but could you please try my custom mission destroy all mortals pt2 i would play it too if i had a gaming pc or switch broly super is coming in an update so be sure to save tickets andor prepare for if hes gonna be in an event if not a new pack excellent use of the jojo music rhyme since rhyme corrected himself with the avatar class up thing you only really need to level to 99 if you want to minmax but you should lv to 50 if you care about your avatars potential after level 50 the stat increases of your avatar are much lower than 1 50 imagine trying to stop a dragon fist crazyndukauba im still not seeing the appeal for this game if you like it then fine i hope you enjoy it hey when i was playing dokkan i got a fusion with goku and vegeta and you now its fusion super vegito but when i got that it was super saiyan blue vegito so dino now do u feel the power of f2p hahaha gonna unsubscribe this guy is not even touching dokkan anymore o man look at his eyes hes being possessed you cant stop playing it and i cant wait any longer whos with me super gogeta but i also like my elite demigra cuz he drains 1000 heath love the kakyoin theme in the background its hella addicted too fun game whats your friend code if you really want to experience hell try fighting the last stage of the fused zamasu arc indonesia anymore is this game in ios i was expecting the vs towa fight people are hating on these graphics but i honestly love being thrown back into the budokai engine and seeing all these new characters from super and heroes respectively in these graphics im definitely getting this for my birthday thank you for showing me this game i was hesitant at first but when i watched you play it and saw how much you enjoyed it i definitely want it now me2 because this game feel like watching the anime in a stragetic finalfantasy tactics style fun and addictive imo this game is so addictive and actually gives me the best luck out of dokkan and legends lol 4 star dark god shroom is an amazing card he gets a 10000 bonus in power and is a g meteor card i didnt know you liked undernight 657 rhyme she aint steely dan rhyme there is a select all button neither can i ssj3 gogeta xeno is my current favorite the hero energy charge is stoopid i just jumped into the game without watching vids or knowing which to go for so i just went for sdbh pack 1 so i gotta give my first favorite card has to be ssj3 raditz so far right now my favorite card is dark broly also thst team is trash looks like a bunch of non ultimate and legendary finishes tisk tisk if bardock yells everything wouldnt the mysterious masked saiyan who know one knows who he is yell nothing cant enjoy the game if you dont have it i think my favorite card is the cp dragon fist gogeta from um1 i cant play super dragon ball heroes does the pro controllers work with this game or do you have to use joy cons this man is playing kakyoins theme and i respect you for that because rip the milf hunter kakyoin what if rhyme hates all these bandai games and he lies just to pay his bills lmao rhyme is my brother you should do some custom missions or fan mission you can even do themed teams like a xeno team love dark broly every time with that 5000 increase each ci duel summons with nano you pulled the hero longhaired xeno trunks in this vid nice when im not using my demon god avatar i main him i will say one thing though if you ever go for a xeno gotenks fusion id recommend using that version of trunks with the elite xeno goten instead of the berserker xeno goten as the fusion character will take their card typing from the unit holding the fusion skill you dont want your opponent to stun your fusion before you get to use him fyi best support card ingame is hands down the elite demon goddess putine with the demon gods curse ability good god but that support ability keeps me alive when i need it you should pick her up rhyme so many jojo references oraoraora kakyoinz theme is rhyme a jojo fan i just got cell x and ssj rage trunks you ever just use secret rare vegito blue and grande priest to one shot almost everything why is your cac yellow nice jojos background music when i get the game i will choose the berserker frieza race dont have a favorite card yet havent played as much as id like life still using the preorder bonus cards rip super dragon ball heroes sucks the graphics are trash i dont like this game but im not one of those who will yell at others for playing it in fact id rather watch others play it than me spend my money and play it card games arent my thing unfortunately but everyone who plays it is loving it something i can never comprehend about card games but oh well that uniel ost though yo rhyme that krillin everyone starts out with has a skill called solid battle plan what the skill does is when krillin is a supporter he slows down the ci speed for your team the gameplay looks so stale and trash is it really worth it btw do only mutlis because u always get a card u dont have awww man all the time i spent getting the super dragon balls to upgrade my class to the max having to find out i can maximize my stats the feeling you get when you play a gacha game where you cant pay for tickets nice using kakyions theme hello ma boyz got a question is it normal that in pvp the games ia bit more laggy got the feeling that the game runs in pvp at 30 and not at 60fpsany one got the same experience this game is a cool i am legit so happy this game has curbed my dokkan and legends addiction im really loving all the sdbh content from everybody im hoping this last awhile dude yes im obsessed with the game too please keep making videos playing it man lets keep the hype going love his videos hey rhymstyle im special need im for real can please shout out my channel i will very thankful rhymstyle congratulations for 841k for my birthday im getting dark soul 3 for my ps4 and assassins creed odyssey for my xbox one i kinda love this game as well spending those hours dont stop these videos watching these makes me want to get a switch and play simultaneously with you same here and my play time is 2601 and man i didnt realize i played so much none stop also there is a good hurcle card that actually swaps power level but is is scary to because you dont know if your going to be higher or lower and if you do get higher then your power level is switch already so i say have it when your fighting bosses is this game fun i might get it if it is i literally play this on every of my work breaks first thing i noticed was hydes theme from unist xd how much they pay you for this i dont care what game it is your content is that of a god you should fight merged zamasu if you havent already when you dont want a swich so xeno 2 is your version of this lmaooo honestly who can i have nearly 500 cards 500 help me merged zamasu is op af although supreme kai of thickness can give you chances to miracle so that might be the key to winning against him can somebody remind me what the music is i know it i just cant remember where i heard it lol i literally have no idea whats going on but i love watching these vids can any1 help me whenever i go to my custom decks my game keeps crashing and i dont know what to do someone please help if u have a answer dude i saved up 55 my mom said she will give me the rest to get heroes world mission i cant wait almost pissed my pants imagine dbh game with dbl graphics me yay finally a f2p db game that everyone has to go through the same hardships as i do dlc announced also me they had us going in the first half not gonna lie my favorite so far is red 4 star jiren and last night i got red 4 start super saiyan gogeta from gt i would buy it if i could afford it but i cant shroom is my favorite character right now he just looks soo cool my favorite card so far is super saiyan 3 raditz i love his raditz awakened ability saw the twitch yesterday sad you kept loosing to towa ofc lvl 99 is optimal but at least lvl 50 for cac is around top tier as well rhyme do you know there gonna add more character s in the game i love this series man keep it up ive also read on steam that you dont actually keep some of your stats when you upgrade your class your stats are just higher cause your bondscameraderies increases your stats as you play so your lv1 stats are higher than last time cause of that i want to play online w you rhyme pc or switch i know what im buying tomorrow to say that 3 dont matter is a yikes since some of the 3 have pretty good ci skills i really want this game but itll just feel like im playing hero colesseum from dbxv2 smh vv itd be nice to have a guide for what kind of teams you need for the arcade bosses i chose saiyan male because i too wanted to become a super sandwich post more please and thank you do vs matches against nano online i just wish there were limits of certain raritie of cards in your party for online play most people just use the same god tier cards if there was a limit then we can see some variety and a more balanced online portion imo rhymestyle if you beat the entire tournament area then there should be a secret mission and everytime you beat that secret mission you get 3 rare gacha tickets and its really easy to grind ok its 2019 people can we please stop with the cooler jokes we get hes cool smh hi rhymestyle you arent kidding im really enjoying this game too few minutes later seereax these battles are not the same without you when youre playing with hannibal lecter the saiyan game looks cool as hell ive always wanted to play sdbh does anyone know if

like beerus could be good in a dragonball game new vid cant stop wont stop plz keep up the good work rhyme bower me to my brotha first cant stop never stop first cant stop wont stop im trying to get ssj2 but teach me an ability doesnt show up only the class up does this work for demon god race i got my super saiyan form but how do i change the ability everytime i do it always goes back to the team boost when does fusion and super 17s absorption ability come available in the shop i wanna teach my op team fusion what happens if you class up to god before getting super saiyan does wishing for ssg or ssb become an option i love the ultimate tenkaichi theme at the end how can i get this game i found a easy and fast way to get the 7 dragon balls do the jaco mission in custom missions youll get em in no time wait when youre in super god class and you still havent unlocked super saiyan will you still transform with the yellow hair or not do you still recommend getting it i wish there was a way to go down a level after unlocking the next one how do you pt your custom skill i got final explosion and idk how to put it on but how to get super saiyan god and ssb click bait where the super sayian god transform so if your frieza race and you do the dragonballs do you have the option to get golden form oh i chose rank up well time to gather it again what are the other races transformation any other way to get the transformation my hero is the highest class and i cant wish for a super abbility anymore i have a ssj1 for my female character but she still doesnt transform with 9 hero energy can someone expline why doesnt she transform so even if you class up you still dont get the transformation unless you wish for it just to note if your playing as the female saiyan i think you have to rank up to super class note has to rank up to go ssj is anyone having issues with super attack accessories can the berserker form go ssj once you go god u can no longer transform it is permanent what does the super class do also can you go to super saiyan god someone plz help i really wanna know hey how do you actually get to your hero data to change his or her moves wait wasnt that chac in ult tenchai should i level up before ranking or should i just rank up or beat jacos ass for the dragon balls how do you customize your characters clothing ive been dying to figure out if you can or cant an even better way is to go to the self made missions made by players and go the ranked section and pick 1 youll get a dragon ball battle mission every single time and can farm the super dragon balls there very easily hope this helps thats cool i didnt know that but then again i probably wont be using it since i dont really use the main character card i only use the original dragon ball characters guys do not waste your wishes on the super saiyan transformation because at one point when you have classed up enough you will be in super saiyan god permanently so its a waste of a wish if you choose the ssj transformation the other races get transformations right right can the berzerker and elite saiyans go ssj n ssb also how far can your hero go transformation wise what makes this game so special do you have to use shenron to get to super class its from the start of round 2 slo i have a question do you need to buy anything extra to play this game because i can see that you need to slide the card or something like that love being your 500th like keep up the great work its weird i just got the skill but it doesnt let me use it during battle anyone know the best way to get zennie lmao i found this out by myself yesterday you automatically become a ssjg if you lvl up to god class and if you go up to super god class thats when you turn ssjb so you dont have to wish for super saiyan just farm the dragon balls and lvl up your class and eventually you will become a ssjg then a ssjb please amke a tutoruial how you make this what char mut i have pease make a tutorial a superior method is going to custom missions in the creation mode menu then find an easy mission that has super dragon ball battlethen its completely guaranteed and not rng based android showcase 913 how do you get this character thanks i needed this lol i got it in frist day easy so idk whats up with mine but i just got it and i tried using it but it doesnt active so what do i do what do shenron medals grant how can you unlock ssjg im a god class but how do i have to wish for super saiyan in order to get it how you get this game hey um does it automatically go onto ur cac because i got ssj for the cac and it wont let me transform i actually managed to get like 3 or 4 super dragon balls in chapter one i guess i just got extremely lucky how do you the kamehameha super attack does every avatar race get a transformation im running a demon god avatar and would love to know if i get some transformation action the game is amazing full characters and fan services and the card game is so fun and challenging no wondering its super famous in japan is transformation just for sayians how about a video on the best ways to get summon tickets i got all my super dragon ball from custom mission i want the game the other races have transformations too or only the saiyans is there any benefit to getting to lvl 99 before going for a new super class i wonder if you can turn god or ss3 it kinda sucks you cant choose any of the race variations from the original peas carrots played for about 2 hours very fun game bummer i cant play for a week isnt there a customization item that can make people turn ssj ya know its kinda funny how dbh got the ssj hair spike up right but not xenoverse this would be great if i had this game but i dont imma get it later today can you choose any of the other race options like android freeza etc my fucking gamestop had a shipping error so i cant get it arcade mode is the best way to farm dragon ball im super god class its kool a db game added manga elementsvegeta used gamma burst flash im gonna be a bitch and get the cracked version of this game i dont find this game worth the 50 dollars i really want this game but i wanna see more gameplay to see if its 100 worth because it seems worth but idk i just got my second set of dragon balls and i cannot wish for super saiyan 3 or god which ever the game will give you next 001 still fast as fk boiii thanks for the info cant wait to play this i was gonna buy the game today but my brother took his switch on a trip the fact that i dont have the game yet will haunt for life or does anyone know what time it will be purchasable on the switch can you customize your character is anyone having trouble buying a digital version off the switch how do you actually slide cards for the switch version are u going to stream story mode on steam is it compatible with a ps4 controller or do you need ds4 windows or something i hope i get this game fod my birthday next month nice vid bro yesawaken the power why did i type that drinks a cokepop noisenoice you know how you got the glitch on legends it did the same for me what about the demon god race transformations for me frieza berserk done 1 ive always loved the frieza race and 2 it looks like my man cooler and then a berserk android race would be cool being able to literally play as cell is cool i wish xenoverse had android race and supreme kais also more transformations so im gonna turn from kind raditz to prince ssblue raditz i watched all dragon ball heroes opening to all games the whole video is over a hour but it are worth to look on its both game version and anime version in the clips i love them if u guys want write this all dragon ball heroes openings um plz help how do you change into the other sayian varations because i only see the 1st male sayain i think the color change in the cell looking android is supposed to be like super sayain god and blue through his sayain cells i really like the buus evolutions we got a king bui a pirate buu and a demon lord buu even though i know it would take to much time i kinda wish the different classes were theyre own character in the story shouldve watched this before i went with the demons i want to share a info if ppl didnt know if you decide to change race yea your lvl resets completly even you turn rank 1 but your camaraderie dosnt lower you still keep all your ranks camaraderie the only bad thing about the game is that if you change race you have to start from 0 again lvling wish they could give us a multiplier depending on what lvl you changed race thats the multiplier you get for exp demon gods have no transformations wish i knew demon has no transformations before hand lmao thats bad so no they nt add sdbh wm english site rip the buu evolution is like medieval times anyone gonna talk about how for some reason the second saiyans hair doesnt stand up for ssj blue sorry for the strange english anymore the heroes are customizable i did not understand is it an update that will do it the bezerker andrid class seems like the last 2 are super saiyan god and blue respectively when i first got this game i wasnt even going to get it at first and then i got it played loved it and then to find out that when they go super saiyan the hair actually changes im in love wish xenoverse could have did that but still a great game though is the classes thatcan be earn by level up or is it wish exclusive man i just wish we have a female majin avatar my only dislike is that the saiyan avatars hair doesnt go into super saiyan style for super saiyan blue like gokus does u need to gather all dragonball to advance to next ss transformation is it better to level some more before upgrading your avatar or is it ok to upgrade them right ahead i accidentally transformed my avatar at lv 15 or 16 not knowing what that wish does i should have informed myself ps its ss1 then ss2 3 god and blue is this stuff going to be in the north american version that comes out soon i really hope this game is not boring as fuck and i hope it will be worth the 80 nisshoku82 from rsuperdbheroes here or more commonly known as tharryn here on youtube glad to have helped out you out this is like a year old sorry about the multiple comments i sometimes comment as i watch the video if on the phone app ugh i wish xv would allow for custom transformations and give their races equal amount of exclusive forms hell i think xv should add much more from heroes mainly for customization wow i really like how the bio android type has transformations that mirrors ssg and ssb still working in january 2020 if they aint fixed it by now they aint gonna still 1 mission still works this method still works good thing that i found this video a great mission to farm stuff it stil works thanks man i cant get online how did i get in the mission screen i got the game last week and i love what im playing with the pc version i can confirm that you can use the cheat engine program to give your self max gacha tickets and max zeni well nto any reward just up to terra terra you need to kill super god difficulty but there are alot of these just cells and cells jr mission made each of 1 type and i can easely one shot it it is still 30k hp but not that hard so the weaker your deck the better the rewards still not patched d if u want garenteed zeni apparently u can get over 100k by doing the secret base mission in the tournaments area after beating all the tournaments your the best my dude this helped a bunch it works as of today testing it out now on switch version and it still gives a garunteed dragon ball and its random on drops as stated by you before i can confirm im currently playing sdbh wm its april saturday 27 2019 616 pm and its currently working with the nintendo membership is transformed android 21 in the game also what about fasha seripa thank you so much sloyour the best when youre like me and you dont have the online service wow just got the game this morning and now i can hopefully be op early in game that cool i am going get the game today 1 thank you 2 this is awesome 3 thanks again for the video doing it now omg gotta say thanks for telling us dude you know whats cool in round 2 jaco does god meteor you didnt mention it in the video but ik for majority of online switch games you need the membership so for this game do you need it or no still works i farm dragon balls from it get one everytime god boss custom missions give you better items here a good one mission code vsqzadh this method is amazing btw this mission has a highscore of 587k how to get that i only have 389k thanks for the awesome guide im doing this mission with 6 created elite cards with all of them max hp i can give them and like 100600 power 3 of them have better attacks other 3 a lower attack cause of card points they all have an ability to boost their power with 10k 1 hero energy for each of them so i have 10 hero energy from the begining every attack need 10 hero energy that i put on those cards for better damage 2 of my team even have a boost to health and stamina depends on power level all my cards are between 16k 19k points i use my avatar in elite class so this means 7 ultimate attacks even one with extra burst damage i end the match with 44k health and 31k damage gives me around 400 exp every time i have a module that give 66 exp and 1700 health in game so i end up with around 468473 exp every game but my question is are berserker or hero cards better at doing damage cause then i will do the same as now but only with another class replay a lot of story mode it gives you a lot gacha tickets sorry but how do you summonget cards in this game im bored with this defaultass team i got i didnt know this even existed until now xd yes this is the mission i was talking about this is a gold mine really fast zeni camaradies exp and dragon balls with no efforr hope they dont chance this because this is just amazing when i go to ranking it always says error of connexion have anyone a code for pc keep those tickets we are getting an update that has uvm 5 set weird thing i find is theres movie broly in the set but no gogeta hopefully they release uvm 34 along with the update aswell and maybe that will have a movie gogeta on top of how easy and useful this is you also get the fun of destroying jaco the tournament also gives loads of zeni if you beat all the ranks then spam the secret battle is there a fast and easy way offline as well i wanna know really wanted to buy this game today after testing it in mateymode but now that i see there are cheap tricks like that i wont everybody will have everything and before you know most matches will be mirrors with exception of one card if any best do this now just in case it gets patched how to acces to that menu on pc thx sooo much really appreciate you doing this hopefully they dont fix this awesome i wanted the card stickers but never get enough zeny thanks to this mission

stardust breaker wouldnt work on vegito but its just me cause im not sure catchy song too bad this only plays when you start the game the first time the girl clearly has a better taste in characters and on the game is some shitty graphics this opening cinematic looks really good though i feel some of the animation is a bit stiff in some places id say that ragong blast 2s opening is still better love the open intro is there a way to listen or replay this song for the nintendo switch why are you watermarking something that doesnt belong to you jiren this isnt even my final form his outro is called aint loyal oshi remix even this game has a better into than shitty xenoverse 2 note looks cool when walking into the stadium idk why but i think see vegito vs gogeta in a rly good animation is better than the fight of goku and jiren kinda cool looking but i dont like card games is this yugioh or dragon ball p the intro is a little disappointing cant find that awesome outro bro y is pan playing childrens card games get back to training man why does the animation look so clunky on the right we have the heroes ui goku gogeta ssj4 bardock trunks vegeta gohan and beerus on the left we have the most despicable villains in history jiren vegito frieza zamasu cell buu and champa why is vegito on the villains team finally after who knows how many years of wanting this in the west yugioh never looked better my bad wrong card game super cool intro what is the name of the song intro is awesome d i guess yamcha is too godlike to be put into the game dear developers make new fucking theme what song is this sounds good im confused who tf is that black dude with ssj ros yo the ai buu reject looks kinda like someone from kingdom hearts hmmmmmmmm what is this guys obsession with cell jrs simple ndu free child labor barely herd a click no clack i wish this is on ps4 i would totally buy it no need tail to be ssj4 trunks is hybrid saiyan how can he be any chance of them making amiibo of

in universe mission 8 and ndukauba please continue to make these great vids i wanna fight u bro my team is pretty op compared to urs edit id probably smoke u i mean god bosses are a joke to me couldnt here it my boy pls do online match videos after this you buy it in the shop use the dragon balls are mine ring it slows down ci and counter dimensional pressure the heck bruh sealas looking like a damn final fantasy character xd sorry if i am annoying i need help if my avatar is the demon god does my character still go super sayain in chapter 4 i havent made it there yet and if i change my race to sayain will i still keep my ultimate class he should put ultra instinct berserk goku back on their and his team will be way more overpowered if super saiyan berserk goku and mui berserk goku are matched together sephroph he does know that he can upgrade his cards right what is so special about being first doesnt beat have an ultimate attack with goku and teen gohan lmao man i still need to finish story mode and arcade mode dang at this rate this series will be finished before the end of this month get it beat him there if you think about it trunks cant turn super saiyan 4 cause he never

edit 858 ndukauba play the advent mechikabura saga to see the ending 2nd edit ndukauba im hoping that youll be trying to pull that heroclass ssj4 gogeta xeno card in the next video plz play with me i see all youre vids plz sir my friend code is vkwdsxfu we can hear you and the gc controller and you videos are so good can you get facecam on you dragon ball heroes world mission gameplay video pls that cool i suck in that game but its getting easier first i think first boi cool i got a dark broly card without pressing show list only for me goten from gt just looks weird can anyone give me the set for freiza in the tuxedo lmao this comment isnt about the video but is anyone else having issues with the super attack accessories in which one do you get kid goku with sayian armor we sure are missing a lot of characters from uvm 3 to 7 no garlic jr thanks slo but am confused how does one get all cards im a bit disapointed a lot of cards are missing from the game is dr wheelo playable in this game so wait all this and yet no golden cooler wtf isnt baby in the game or did i miss him what does cp mean there are more cards you cannot view that are secret rare if you are having trouble at following the video remember you can lower its speed so you can see all cards without missing any due to how fast it goes am i the only one annoyed by the gacha shops infinite loop of the same couple seconds of music edit i kinda miss some of the crazy character from ultimate mission x like super 18 but we still got cool and crazy characters i dont have a switch but i think thats not all of the characters because i dont gave seen hatchiyak or baby trunks they are missing lot of charswhere are garlic jr baby vegeta 2te and te freezer and so on i can make this by making a card why i can buy this in the gotcha shop no garlic jr i mut make this card thats kind of weird it stops at um2 the last game had over 3000 cards in it this one starts at the sdbh set instead the p promo cards can be used in fights to right i wish i could get the game i am getting this game tommrow so bardock crew are not in the game dragon ball heroes is the best dragon ball game until project z is released this game is so dopei might just get it so its dokkan battle on consoles how do i reinstall all my mods so i can fix the thing i just know mods are gonna come to this game how do you tell the rarity blink and youll miss it lol but slo thanks for taking the time to record this i just started downloading this game im so excited to finally be playing heroes i am downloading the game right now cause i saw it on your channel and i liked it nice video i like the japanese version better you ghod play the japanese verison bro could you imagine how well a mobile heroes game would do so i got this game on sale and im just now realizing that there arent any auras for my game but yours seem to show up just fine i like your videos helps alot but i dont really understand why you always mirror when theyre on super attack please remove it its annoying did i hear a jojo reference add that with grand priest 30k power boost if u have tera gear 3x power at 6 hero energy master rossi 2x super sky dmg team boost per power 5k 3050k damage why do you keep flipping the screen around if you see this could you go over xeno ssj kaioken vegito at some point id like to know how to utilize him better as a unit can youll go over the mask saiyan pbs45 card plz nice deck dude would be nice to see you take your decks into pvp aswell hey do you get a copyright strike for uploading this i will use same setup as yours to see if i like it or not but it looks dope me man the internet is really slacking on this putine i cant wait to open their eyes internet look at how amazing poutine is me yes thank you for bringing light to my girl putine i got her early in the game and havent stopped using her looks fun but i bet getting cards cost hella money worst clickbait ever goku looks like left for dead anyone know why on switch my stadium battles crash i cant even beat the first ones because i go to the finals and an error occurs making the game close and i have to start all over again something i dont see many people mentioning is that if this game sales well we might get a port of zenkai battle because the success of heroes could encourage bandai to port over more exclusive japanese games is this just me or is this just basically budokai with db super characters ive never been able to play a single ranked game in jump force on 2 different playstation even after reinstalling on both how can i fix this they should really make figure rise bulma as an adult and chi chi to as an adult just one thing name of the song please thanks 3 gogeta at the end was awesome the people complaining about this game and ignoring its success look like hot garbage they only care about dragon ball games if its a fighting game or a beatem up the folks who like card games especially dbscg will get into and love this game thanks bandai namco for finally releasing a sdbh game stateside after what 10 years bring more its so beautifullll super dragon ball heroes world mission will have for ps4 no one else notice this song sounding a lot like tenkaichi 1 op loving it so far its simple yet addictive spent 3 days just making different decks some decks i made a god of destruction xeno saiyan lost me at in this card strategy game will we be getting free dlc or will it all be paid come on bandai come up front with us bout it im just asking are we going to get a dub or is that not happening im okay if it doesnt happen but i would really like it if it did please update naruto ultimate ninja storm revolution ps3 amd pc another cashgrab from bandai this game is tight in this strategic card game so its one of those this should be a mobile game i bought it and it wont even load alright now that we have this i got one quick question where the hell is dragon ball project zits been 3 months im loosing my mind lmao my dream has come true ok were not talking about xenverse 2 but how come you cant stop the ai ultimate but they can stop yours thats bs why does every game that comes out is always in japan voices its getting really annoying tbh why dont they just keep it in japan isnt of making it worldwide because jump force was okish but it kinda sucks when there is no dubs in the game i kinda feel like that we have been betrayed by bandi namco because all they care about is japan voices only in there games its kinda racist tbh ive stopped playing jump force and dragon ball fusions because both they didnt have english voices and plus having japan voices is kinda off putting i hate card games dragon ball should really up their game come up with something new gotta appreciate the drum n bass in this lmao bandaiexcellent job thanks for bring in the game to south and north america also europe yall better not sleep on this game its legit fantastic game got it a day early and even though ive been busy ive already put almost 18 hours into it and im nowhere near finished hell ive barely even started fun gameplay great depth once you understand it and the customisation is really neat to play with its always fun to get a new game that just has an ocean of content to work through great to finally have one of these games in the west i hope you guys update it id gladly buy dlc for this title imagine if we get this game on xbox and ps4 but later on the year that would be crazy how is it possible that its 2019 and we still have the budokai graphics from 2002 oh its possible you know why cause its bandai i bought this game yesthurday and i cant stop playing so many cards and this budokai graphic is really just must for every dragon ball fun i dont know why people hate the budokai art style i dig it because nostalgia someone upload the damn ost dragon ball fans will defend this garbage will this game be out on mobile top xenoverse 2 amazing fighter z orgasmproject z seizures dbheroes garbage wait uhh who came up with this me sir what your name son weird guy says m my name is jeffof course it is great game but expensive in argentina a card game a fucking card game are you retarded im downloading it right now l my internet take ages to download so im checking videos while it does xd i hope this comes on ps4 reminds me of the budokai games so when can we expect the arcade game to come to america if they made a budokai 4 on the current gen with some of these characters good lord man that would be epic im absolutely loving the game people want this will this game support english dub honestly looks like garbage but thats just my opinion are they expecting people to pay money for this honestly this look so lame if they brought back budokai 3 or infinite world mechanics with this roster it would be the greatest dbz game ever why does it say may fifth for something in dragon ball heroes on my switch does something happen that day or is it the english version im ready to keep my hard earned money already got cracked lol my pc is not compatible not for 3ds i wanted to play with liquir but even in that they make it difficult mu favorite character in the game and i can not play with him anyone knows if you can get vegito ssj4ssjb gogeta broly super on this game i bought it but dont see them on the gachas view my channel as powerpuff girls get introduced

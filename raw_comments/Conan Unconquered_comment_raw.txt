attacked all the time is it me or can this game get quite boring after 2 or 3 efforts from aoc to conan exiles and now this its 21st but some developers are trying to make 20th game that a soldier bigger than castles that soldier can handle 120mm flying to his face so basicaly its like they are billion but with living enemy this looks very bad im sorry this looks dead in the water its so 2005 they are billions conan command conquer animations are 15 years old this game is like they are billions how is this a rts i like the lore and the whole conan world this game reminds me of 0ad too much what the hell is this shit aom multiplayer campaign all i ask simply take a look at the battle for middle earth games thats how an rts should look and feel like this looks like trash sorry i miss the old true rts games this one is okay but the wavesystem makes it too much arcade style its looks interesting kinda looks like an overhaul mod for they are billions which isnt a bad thing i dont like when theres a notification for constructing all the time i can see this getting really tiresome after a while because we will be spending a lot of time constructing there is no need really to notify the player because you can obviously see that youre constructing only when construction is completed that we need a notification i feel like all you really used were javelin throwers towers and your hero do other units feel really under powered or is there not a massive selection man after all this time you should find a way to mute the noises from your mouse and keyboard d been watching you on off for many years now time for you to face reality and come to terms that your fave game is dead you gotta renew your games and start to play gamea that other people play i aint saying this to be rude just thinking that you deserve more veiwers this game would have been good 10 years ago these are the same character voices in age of conan lol 3929 sound like my necro unholyhoe hope redo age of conan greastest open pvp game ever ill pass on the rts they are billions non zombie version i bought this game yesterday and its an amazing game i miss some good rts games since warcraft and starcraft nothing else is coming up this one though made a good job dont have the pvp aspect but its isnt supposed to have anyway im playing all the time getting the upgrades to beat harder scenarios also the coop works fine and its much more fun also for those who doesnt know with the game you won a comic book and you unlock chapters by playing the campaing the comic book comes only in english somebody needs to get on that mad max mod your video shows clearly how badly balanced this is graphics are not that interesting and dull compared to aoe meh ill skip this one this game is shit fam its a pure asset flip with upcoming microstransactions once enough people play it the only thing that bugs me so hard in this type and style of game is that the freaking humans are larger than the houses please do more of this x funcom is really disappointing me tbh they keep making horribly bug ridden conan games that show so much promise but are pushed out too early i hate the scifi sounding voice calling out everything thats going on does not fit this game at all mehthis isnt an rts its a tower defense game how do you check what your units stats are i know it comes up with a box on the right of the screen but when you go to mouse hover over an ability on the stats the box vanishes how to get more gold mid game this is what 1 apm looks like a vulgar and shameless copy of they are billions is there a camaign mode isnt this just age of empires they are billions called they want their idea back and they done it better your bought and paid for this looks shit tbh why not to buy 1day 1 dlc for a 30 euro game a hero wich costs 10 euro so you have to pay 40 euros for a game with only a 5 mission tutorial and then a few challenges 2 copy of they are billions 3 full game with a paywall character and about 10 hours content why to buy it 1 colorful rpg seting with good strategy very easy to learn 2 coop is fun 3 harder than tab because you are constantly under pressure and you need to do more stuff being attacked all the time omg this is they are billions rip off why is this game so slow loved this game but all those high pitched screaming would drove me fucking nuts jeeeezz what those warriors are trying to do annoy the fuck out of the enemy this is they are billions with a different skin am i the only one noticing the striking similarity maybe im nuts this is a less developed game than lotr battle for middle earth 2 which has the same style and was made in 2006 plus the graphics are about the same you must be able to do the most amazing jeff goldblum impression warcraft 3 singleplayer i just realized that the background music is actually the islamic sermon of call to prayer love u raptor from pakistan more of this please theres a repair all buildings button to the right of the mini map the robotic female voice sounds kinda futuristic for a barbarian game shouldnt that catapult burn from launching fireballs they sure are milking that conan brandno game was good after aoc wtf this looks so laggyslow feels like age of emipre 2 from 1999 runs better it looks nice but i like the little people you see moving in they are bilions it makes the world seem more alive you know read description love your vid from iraq the price is ridiculous no campaign just repeating slug fests nope read description isnt this game just like they are billions all your videos are videos i love to watch nice video btw click the like button read description aaahdont hit mei will workthis has a cc feel to it with a prince persia themeloving itthanks for the review mr raptor want to buy rts strategy is my jam but i dont support denuovo waiting for a gog release dno how i feel about a clean female voice as announcer doesnt fit the setting just for the record o always leave a like on raptors videos because i am a fan of his stuff doesnt matter if i like the game he is playing i show my support for his channel so show your support for the raptor end of rant execute sequence 0 15 raptorexerpk aka blitzcom activated hidehaxexe activated ready to execute on your order sir dope like the new vids man first in the other video when i was talking about the soldiers i said you build up towers you put archers in them you put spear chuckers in them now apparently the term spear chucker is racist which i had no idea about it was clear in my video i was talking about the troops in the game as they were on the screen chucking spears that is all they do the word chuck is a very common slang term for throw that i use all the time along with hoy i rarely use the word throw as its classed as posh talk around where i grew up i only use throw if am talking properly now i know 99 of you will think this is extreme to reedit the entire video and you may be correct but its 2019 and we all know that the powers listen to the 1 and not the 99 so i cant take any chances i had 255 comments on the last video and only 2 pointed out what i had said which in its self totally proves that either most of you were like me and had no idea what i said was bad or that you knew that i w thanks for taking the time out for the edit i have a couple spearchuckers in my family who may have been offended when viewing this video when i saw the trailer i thought a sequel to the survival game was comingnot this shit so what mac a word can have multiple meanings chink means dent it also is a racial slur the key is context dont give in to these pc babies gz bow to the pc overseers well done showing backbone 1 when they come for the christians because the words of jesus are offensive will we be able to count of you to go with the pc overseers to behead all the christians as well end days jesus is coming back soon but not before the pc have there pound of innocent flesh coming to a place near you soon kiss my sweaty rectum lmao this racist controversy really tells it all about who currently runs the west if you have to run and apologise for something so benign it tells the whole story the west has gone mad they are billions the co op editing the video was an obvious mistake for the sjwpc twats this is a clear sign of weakness now they know that youll just bend over and take it whenever one or two of them get triggered over nothing on the other hand in the eyes of the people who oppose this sjwpc idiocy you kinda lost respect for giving in the only group thats left is your hardcore fanboys who lets face it are a bad case of metrosexual millennial groupies hey worth idk if youd read this but there seems to be a lot thats changed since your review can you please do a new review with its new permanent price of 1999 usd great video great video mate the ones that whinge can go chuck themselves no surely not you dared to say spear chuckers and not nonracespecific bladed pole weapon users how dare you you made me cry spear chuckers political correctness will be the doom for society in the end we wont even be able to inform eachother that we are hungry and in need of food because children in africa are hungry racist good review anyway how many ringersbells do you own haha thanks for the honest review i was on the not to buy side already because its just a mobile games really hardly an rts to compare to any pc rts now i know its a s hit cash grab just like a mobile game game now days they release half a game and then dlc the rest to con people into playing there fav games fucking never had this shit on the sega this bouncing skull at the bottom right corner is really annoying the shit out of me these spear chuckers are 13 of the population but 50 of all violent crime i understand why you did this to protect yourself from the oversensitive morons but man the times that we live in is absolutely ridiculous love you that finish was remarkable its a huge missed opportunity that they havent made a campaign i find that the rts genre has been stagnating for a long time now as i cant really remember any big new exceptional rts games coming out in the last decade everything is just rehashing of the same old ideas over and over again with no evolution or any real innovation back in the day i was fine with the style of having these tiny buildings and larger units etc because the tech was limited back then and everything looked exciting but these days it is just pathetic to have these tiny buildings and walls and then you have these huge units that destroys buildings and walls by just hitting them with swords units fighting eachother is just them hacking at air until one die there is just no immersion at all in these kinds of games i wish i could get a big new massive rts with buildings and cities in more realistic scale large armies being sent to march across the land to lay siege to enemy cities sort of a blend between age of empires total war and cities skyline i at least brootel is macks favorite word of the day was the first broken mess worth a buy is the first game even out of early access yet why would you even make a video about this game man youre giving shit publishers free publicity ill be sure to carry the word spear chucker around how do you check what your units stats are i know it comes up with a box on the right of the screen but when you go to mouse hover over an ability on the stats the box vanishes 34 smelly ones what was the word now that was funny as hell to watch you have been subbed sir looks like a big old bunch of booolshziiit failcom is one of the worst developers in the industry dont expect this game to be fixed yeah might be a good game but its gonna be filled with dlc and milk it like every other game they make then after a few years it will be dead the only successful games they ever made were anarchy online and the secret world and they even eventually messed those up mr garrison is that you these people wish this game had spear chuckers in it what was the word thank you for being brutally honest day 1 dlc is unacceptable 100 of the time are we entirely sure this game wasnt a gift from a time traveller from 2005 10 more is too expensive wow people must not have jobs lmao a word had a duel meaning and you took down your whole fucking video wow thats weak kiss my sweaty rectum hahaha throw is posh mack u og shit i guess that means i cant talk about basketball players as that has a double meaning yeah that day 1 dlc costs them a sell with me you should definitely give legend of zelda breath of the wild a review im not a huge nintendo or zelda fan but its a brilliant game that i have played through multiple times great game in my opinion and would be a great review the original video was deleted because some retarded liberal shitstain hates the word spearchucker god help western society great video btw average price for 1 pint in london is 519 according to wikipedia so you can either drink 2 pints in one hour for 10 punds or 1 kickass class that you can play with forhours seriously well if it was only a couple complaints and nowt official i think you should add many more i mean many many more spear chuckers spear chuckers spear chuckers spear chuckers yes i could go ctrlv on spear chuckers but you get the point has it really come to this wtf im not that impressed with the game anyway ill avoid but i appreciate another great review btw 722 you said brown one stone him stone him yeah society is goin to shit with this pc bullshit freedom of speech has been hijacked and its such a shame cause i love a good stereotype use discount code conanexiles15 to get 15 off the game apparently its all over the splash screen during game loading in conan exiles they are billions will have a massive single player campaign soon context is everything my man fuck off mack you bend over again and im gone visually the game looks like it was made in 2005 but got a widescreen mod hahahahahahahahahahaha this have to be the best fucking review i have ever seeeeeeeee hahahahah you gut my sub you have to review void bastards at some point the game is an absolute blast wait an rts came out since when i thought the genre was dead can you review uboat seriously man the mentality of some people is just deplorable a brown one might edit that one too macksounds like a pooh o you know what im in the mood for some mother fuckin spear chuckin surprised you havent done a worth a buy for hell let loose vanguard normandy 1944 battalion 1944 yet thought they might be up your ally do a death stranding release date trailer impressions review tomorrow quit being a lazy hippy and do it i implore you you c this review was nuanced can you imagine the lifeless dipshits who complained about this god there are some fuckwits out there worth a buy said spear chucker why not to buy 1day 1 dlc for a 30 euro game a hero wich costs 10 euro so you have to pay 40 euros for a game with only a 5 mission tutorial and then a few challenges 2 copy of they are billions 3 full game with a paywall character and about 10 hours content why to buy it 1 colorful rpg seting with good strategy very easy to learn 2coop is fun 3 harder than tab because you are constantly under pressure and you need to do more stuff being attacked all the time worth a buy said spear chucker why not to buy 1day 1 dlc for a 30 euro game a hero wich costs 10 euro so you have to pay 40 euros for a game with only a 5 mission tutorial and then a few challenges 2 copy of they are billions 3 full game with a paywall character and about 10 hours content why to buy it 1 colorful rpg seting with good strategy very easy to learn 2coop is fun 3 harder than tab because you are constantly under pressure and you need to do more stuff being attacked all the time i think its absolutely valid to deduct the game for day one dlc that addresses a lack of characters and increases the price of the game by a 13 do addon characters by all means but not for 13 the price of the game and not if you only include 2 in the first place if they want to do that they should go free to play or super cheap 10 for started edition with 2 characters and make it obvious that the way to fund the game is to keep adding new characters with amazing abilities as you go and offer a lot of characters then offer them for 5 each or something i love spear chuckers my great great grandad used to keep some of these units on his farm any chance youd do a modern warfare trailer analysis i gave up hope on the series ages agoand i know you havebut i like where theyre going with this new one including the new engine and talks of naughty dog devs involved todays world is it worth a buy no i agree its overpriced even with coop may as well just install the ol stronghold again mack can you please give any info on what you plan to do with the mackscorner channel theres so many different lets plays i want to look at and some i want to rewatch thanks for the info ill wait for a huge drop in price if at all review outward its amazing brutally honest review again saves us from wasted you love this game because it has coop and yet you shit on red alert 3 despite that being probably the first ever rts to have offical coop and an true rts unlike this fucking wave defense doesnt even have versus no opponents with their own bases fucking pc gone mad mack you shouldnt have to do shit like this just be yourself thats why we all watch you can you redo the video please the supermarket coop offends me and i am the 1 that will be heard you should have changed it to spare truckers but that would have offended people who drive trucks but dont get much work lol 2 comments made you re edit a video sounds like some fake the cultural marxist feminist sjw are after me bullshit to whip up your rabid incel gamer fan base i like that mack googled it after someone mentioned it could be misunderstood then altered the video i think its more of an american thing but props never heard of the term but im gonna start using its just too funny its like when elders tell you not to say a bad word you say it because its just fun i cant believe you had to re upload an entire video just for one word im so angryi could chuck some spears chuck is just northern slang for throw or a greeting ffs lol there was a spearchucker jones in the movie mash thanks for saving me money mack yeah i heard it but i knew how you meant it and i could tell you didnt know the phrase you the best mack being publicly correct is it worth your time this has gotta be a joke lol in the mafia 3 review he said the n word like 30 times is it worth a sweaty rectum kiss lets readddddd lmaoalways cracks me up when u start tripping off in your vidsat the 7min mark i almost pissed myself that ui is awful i truly hope this game flops so hard that it becomes a financial deficit they need to lose money for this terrible game mack i didnt notice the word even i remember just gamplay and your very critical non corupt opinion what the hell is spear chucker supposed to be derogatory to is it in reference to people who fought with spears lmao people are retarded i swear itsnotpeopleanymore thanks again mack argh he said brown one spear chucker is a term used in the atlatl community as joke to describe the atlatl its basically a spear chucker dont apologise mack its how they get you sounds about right for a funcom game charge for all kinds of extra content that should be part of the game or offer more dlc skins then focus on getting the game to run properly cough conan exiles cough stone walls burning taking damage over time lmao not even if you throw oil on them that would actually make them burn theyd still take no damage because its stone and putting out fire that tedious no thanks developers these days very honest review wish the game had more spear chucking units cheers mac i was sitting on the fence with this game looks good but thought 25 was a bit much and then you dropped the bombshell another tenner for a dlc on day 1 that should be in the game anyway was too much im not buying it funcom is in huge financial troubles so much that norwegian government had to back them up so they wont go under they are doing all they can to milk customers with their conan license 2019 is gonna be tough cant wait to see 2020 game is way over priced im too niggardly to pay that i love they are billions i dont even like rts games much anymore but i play that game constantly i dont think co op alone would make me get into this game as a famous cockney actor once said dont you throw those bloody spears at me or was it chuck racist wow really people this has been the funniest comment section i have read in a while hope you dont have soup and crackers because i would be highly offended at the racist doublemeanings of that word great review mac always will be my favorite i have to agree day 1 dlc is scummy and the addition of coop isnt enough when the rest of the game is plain of belowaverage content graphics gameplaywise i guess better safe then sorry but it sucks all the same be careful with this because once you allow selfcensor the gates are open next you know ppl get offended because you talk with an english accent from god knows where im not british so i dunno i personally wouldnt have but then again i dont get thousands of comments and from those hundreds are people are making me out to be a shit person so i understand this from an effort to keep yourself sane its like trying to piss out a fire though wonder if wood chuck is racist i seen people playing this and it looked like a poor mobile phone game walking on eggshells here chuckin hell was the word bullwank why would you bow to people like that spear bunger could work the fact that people got upset with this is amazing to me the people that had the problem with this are not fans of your amazing content these people go out of there way to make other peoples lifes harder context matters enjoy your day off you deserve it how much spears could a spear chuck chuck if a spear chuck could chuck spears a sad day when you cant use random words because somebody somewhere somewhen was racist when they used that word interesting fact we all have ancestors from africa the english language was made for stupid humans sweaty rectum really disliked taking you off the watch list so they started to port mobile games to pcmasterrace conan is a loner but this is an army game ok then reupload witcher 3 i miss the rant it was so dam good excuse me the proper term is spear people all other terms are offensive p lol a brown one xd try age restricting yer content this will probably be buried in the comments but please do a worth a buy on pathologic 2 just ignore the snowflake race baiters our society is the way it is now because instead of telling them to shut the fuck up and go away we listen to them now i guess your bunny isnt going to get to show us the slides of his jungle adventure youre flying through the reviews mack always worthawatch what was the word asking for a research yeah the fire extinguish is very annoying and if more section of the wall is burning you simply cant be fast enough to prevent the other wall sections to catch on fire i hope it going to be fixed want to know the truth about a game this is the only channel to watch great review mac ty i watch your reviews most of the time but i gotta disagree with the thumbs down i realise the day one dlc adds more money but tbh you dont have to purchase it this game definitely deserves a thumbs up just my opinion im pretty sure a spear has been chucked by people of all colour and race since the dawn of man i miss proper rts games well this is fucking gay butisnt one who chucks spearssigh in what way is spear chucker racist im not familiar with the term o the spear chuckers are awesome i love all chuckers axe chuckers are especially cool a word had double meaning yet what you meant by using the word is irrelevant because someone else assume you mean something else what the fuck xd thats so ridiculous thanks mac your a proper geezer must of been nancy pelosi bitching about that word world is to pc do the commentary in rap format that way you can say what you want and nobody bats an eye what a pile of shit of a game it looks utterly terrible white people used to chuck spears too ffs blacks shouldnt get offended by it or more often guardian reading middleclass whites getting offended on their behalf being offended by it suggests they think chucking spears was exclusive to black people maybe every time someones called a tosser its racist against white scots as they toss the caber log thing ok this was a shit example despite being only 13 i know petroglyph are former cc guys and they will remind you about that nostalgia bonus as often as possible but every rts game ive played from them i found lacking in the gameplay department there is something generic about them now this one looks decent to good in terms of the artwork and graphics but the gameplay looks worse than they are billions 953 the reason you rarely get a press copy i fucking loved that comment red sonja or thulsa doom or any of the other colorful characters in the movies arent characters in the game come on its okay to be a spearchucker if a word bothers you and offends you you are weak and part of the problem its not worth a buy but is it worth a chuck good review but its not a game for me to play lol is it an american thing never heard it before mack how many hz is your monitor how obscure of a double meaning is that d why not leave it raging and sjw nonsense is just more extra views for your videos more views money lol im gonna chuck another like your way was gonna buy this i refuse to support greedy developers thanks again mack ill wait for a sale one word what a piece of shit youtube rewatching for you mack love the content what do you mean you people haha all kidding aside mac since i watched it last night im just gonna leave it playing in the background for algorith reasons enjoy your day off well jet fuel can bring down 2 110 storie and a 47 storie building made of steel and reinforced concrete so your little stone defences have no chance against normal fire political correctness causes your video to be taken down justice served day one dlc game still available to buy justice served is anyone else seeing the problem here d seriously what is the world coming to equilibrium is a brilliant film but i always thought it was just fiction who knew it was actually a premonition for the future only difference is we arent been given drugs to suppress our emotions oh no were expected to just dehumanize ourselves all on our lonesome ridiculous state of affairs in the world today people need to wake the fk up and stop pandering to what can only be described as madness what word was it what word what if i use it o freedom of speech be damned totaly unneccecery dlc right you are mack its kinda like pay to win because buying the dlc actualy makes the game easyer giving you an overpowered caracter lol i thought was an expansion for conan exiles d i am convinced that the people shouting racism had nothing to do with the offended ethnic group being offended gives you a moral high ground you are right feeling for some people you used the term slapping a brown one on it and thats really insensitive and i think you should rereedit this video its 2019 mac and using terms like that wont fly i mean try and be slightly progressive if a man has a scat fetish then thats not a negative thing ha you guys thought i was going to go somewhere else with that didnt ya you saucy buggers you thats a double like as far as i am concerned well done mack a fair review it gets macks thumb down over the lame day1 dlc i get that overall it seemed liked the gameplay though would i prefer the game just had 1 version of it for sale with all characters even if more expensive yeah at least then itd just be a pricer game but is at least straight forward with what its selling that being said rts nowadays is really pretty dead and this is where i think the genre is heading ive been waiting forever to play tab but i dont like early access at least this is a full release so ill be picking this up with all the characters overall i like what petroglyph does so im all in on this one no slave girls with customizable tits like the last conan pass i guess some people dont understand that context makes a word racist outside of a few particulars it would appear some people need to educate themselves great video mac keep rockin is it possible that you can queue up orders by shiftclicking like most strategy games so you can put out the fires easily with a couple of units this game have no campaign and its just a survival map with endless waves i really see no reason to buy this mobile game what the actual fuck england is a 1984 mess im so sorry to see what your country and my favoutire country is turning into i have no idea which word could have been sooo controversial to hell with the insane little snowflakes getting offended by words and bothering you with extra work pixels and wavs people grow up ffs social justice is fucking cancer this is funny and sad at the same time rip world you dont have the sword pass yeah we dont want to upset the poor dears do we can you do a retro review of shenmue selfcensorship is the price we pay for allowing our academic political and media institutions to be infested with cultural marxists the greedy bastards mack they will never learn 10 for one character is just a joke what was the word thx for the truth of arent u going to do a days gone review grease is the word best reviewer on youtube hands down by reuploading you give these mentally deranged people more power everything is racist today to all sjws your feelings are hurting my thoughts cona what was the word exactly those chuckers that made you upload this can go chuck themselves thanks for all you do mack love the vids things are getting a bit ridiculous can you imagine if those were the words of the developers in this ass backwards world of hysteria and emotional bullshit you are correct the media listens to the loud 1 people are presumed guilty right off the bat its a hideous world we live in and unfortunately you had to do this reedit based on necessity mack please do a wab on sekiro its not the same as dark souls so u might like it if u give it a chance spear chuckers racist gimme a break i guess every word is racist if a white person said it plus who decide which word is racist or not great video apologies in advance if the above comment is considered sexistracistageist or any other ist now i can enjoy what is left of my day off am heading out now enjoy the vid better safe than sorry too many people who are looking to be offended and ignore the context of the word looks like i have to rewatch the last 3 mins again absolute gold thanks for all your hardwork mack whats the word havent you heard the bird is the word conan unconquered is it worth a reupload lets watch i want a game of thrones mod for this im sure i watched this early this morning lol i didnt notice anything wrong with the first video neither uh what was the word and why was the dual meaning a problem bullshit that you had to change it arent they the ones that bang on about free speech so much aswell fucking stupid one word forced you to reupload ow boi a reupload gotta watch it again what word remind me of starcarft archon mode where is my cc generals 2 imagine the next call of duty game but instead of guns you have chicken and its not a shooter its an anime jrpg this is what this feels like lol for me awesome idea tab conan setting coop must have so majesty 3 conan edition will fail so hard just stop development this game looks soooooo bad and im not just talking about the graphics they are billions conan edition getting they are billion vibe just with coop d and that is certainly not a bad thing wow what a disappointment is this un conquered or unleashed wish wed got this instead of exiles for ps what paupery is this hey uhmwhen can we have another real conan game like the ps3xbox360 game they are billions i love how the title says conan unleashed and the game is called conan unconquered they should just show the actually gameplay of a game as the thumbnail not something misleading i got kush coming in heheh going to recycle age of conan music again so basically its tower defence without storyline you have to survive all waves and thats it if yes im very upset similar to stronghold when does this game come out not what i expect from a game with the name conan its really cool how they toned down the graphics so i can run it on my ps2 thanks guys title person messed up took me 2 seconds to scan through the video to figure out what the name was total wae conan lol nope not for me thanks so is it unleashed or unconquered tab coop petroglyph conan yes please so basicaly its they are billions but conan and not so billions looks cool cant be any worse than conan exiles lol thumbnail conan unconquered title conan unleashed is this what budget feels like this seems looking cool would you think it would have nudity content elements too since its a conan game pretty cool but i want more conan exiles content its there most popular game at the moment they should ride the wave wrong title garbage game with garbage graphics its 2019 why do game developers still make this type of gamesgraphic ppl really still play these type of games i use to play these type of games back when i was 8 its like warcraft 3 age of empires and conan got together and smashed it out getting some age of empires vibes i love it warcraft ill never understand these kind of games so basically its age of empires but conan cool what i would like to see is a strategy game like total war in the hyborian age would love to see you play more and do a break down of mechanics and strategy really enjoy your they are billions run and i love the conan universe this is a dope spin im down for more just letting you know i think you have amazing videos keep up the great work love it gimme moar yes a thousand times yes maybe a playthrough of the standard mode and not just a campaign one to show off the concept pretty sure they are billions fixed that target ai you are talking about it was a real problem with snipers originally also glad to see more games in this genre coming out i like them on the other hand so far at least this feel like a pretty lazy ripoff i want more this game looks really fun it quacks like an rtx i want a bike that can quack who else watched all the conan movies i got they are billions on sale this doesnt look as good imo why not to buy 1day 1 dlc for a 30 euro game a hero wich costs 10 euro so you have to pay 40 euros for a game with only a 5 mission tutorial and then a few challenges 2 copy of they are billions 3 full game with a paywall character and about 10 hours content why to buy it 1 colorful rpg seting with good strategy very easy to learn 2 coop is fun 3 harder than tab because you are constantly under pressure and you need to do more stuff being attacked all the time as an 80s baby i always find it strange whenever conan doesnt resemble arnold swarzenegger the food is purely to build hovels to allow for more units to be generated it does not mean that you need that much food for each unit already built if you have played they are billions you would probably know this it is a pretty close clone bring back power armor cat logo does this have the depth of they are billions splattercat cheers and keep up the good work is greater than so archers are greater than infantry while infantry are greater than cavalry and presumably the circle continues to be that cavalry are greater than archers it is perpetually disheartening how studios with rights to ips like conan or warhammer can so consistently churn out shit tier titles someone needs to make a game like this with killer bunnies well thats disheartening lol i get this is a lot like they are billions but they are billions needed inspiration too warcraft is the earliest game i can think of using this idea followed closely by civilization 2 and age of empires and command and conquer starcraft and there are billions others that did this same idea before they are billions lol sorry didnt want to be that guy but i am sure no one else would of said it lol love ya splatt talking about they are billions can you check back in on it its had a few updates you should try outer wilds i think you and your audience would enjoy it splat i am serious on this one make a lp i want to see you go through the game using your noggins deepest tactical level damn when i first saw some gameplay sneakpeaks i got soo hyped but then it turned out to be a tower defence could you just imagine if it was a full on rts with distinct factions like the stygians aquilonians and cimmerians and such gotta say it your my favorite youtuber keep up the great work another great video splatty throwback to red alert i miss that game is this a they are billions exspansion if not well you know what the biggest form of flattery is more conan i like the rts version myself i actually really liked this and wouldnt mind seeing more or even a stream of this great job splat well ill say it another game running conan from the mmo to the survival and now a cheap worse defense game ill pass but good job again splatter major they are billions vibes well i was interested in this game that is no longer the case this game is strictly worse than they are billions clearly since i currently have they are billions it is my opinion that you must be at least as tall or taller than they are billions to ride this ride last time i was this early i got my wife pregnant first nice looking game from this reminds me of aoe or stronghold hello you massive nob head how did you manage to get a copy you lucky bugger i really like the look of this age of empire v5213 age of empires conan edition pretty cool heck yeah man im super jacked to see you start this this was a free game on psn you really gotta work on using your minimap they didnt show you the full attack path of each wave but they did show you where the starting point would be playing too many series at the same time not a good idea sure glad you didnt pay for this you got to put archers in the towers it holds 4 phlinger this looks like a really good series also good vid good game for 1990 why are the waves so quick in this game barely anytime too build awesome guys i have the game too but playing it solo it sure is hard but fun thanks for the vlog shouldve been like age of empires where you need to build the infrastructure and work the economy with villagers this looks like a poor rts with many rts mechanics removed to maintain low budget aoe endless waves wouldve been awesome sorry what is that computergame i can see signs of add in the clicking behaviour p pretty nice but you should put coop in the title since many people dont know about it they are billions another one from those most anticipated games lists releases if youre planning on picking it up consider doing so here to support the channel as well as charity httpswwwhumblebundlecomstoreconanunconqueredpartnerpartyelite they are billions did this first and i personally prefer it lol that ui 300 unfortunately this is 90 of rtss out there thats why i think this genre of survival rts that focuses on single player experiences while ignoring mp is where more more indie rts developers games will go im ashamed but i bought it from humble and if that wasnt enough i even upgraded to deluxe edition for the king conan skin i am scum vermin i should be an example to avoid but im gonna have fun with it this weekend nonetheless also i am also enjoying the fuck out of three kingdoms even the battles i thought i was gonna hate it like the 3 previous historical titles but shit i genuinely like it enough to have finished the campaign with caocao and gonsun zan weird this looking like age of empire 3 lol hope this gets better in time everything about this game makes it look like a mobile port especially the main menu the day 1 dlc hero is also very powerful he has a ranged aoe attack and he can heal your units haha i dont think ive ever not heard you say as should become apparent as i go thorugh this review maybe one of these days youll review a game you love so much that people will accuse you of having your opinion purchased this game looks worse than rts games from 2005 nice pe thanx for this conan the barber cut your hair with one chop is it just me who see copy pasta of they are billions please tell me im wrong thanks for the review i was hesitating to take this one but i think ill pass its too similar to they are billions in my opinion and the game feel so slow whereas tab is quick nervous and well balanced thank you anyway cheers still better than game of thrones season 8 can someone tell me what is best in life this game looks a lot like there are billionshave you played there are billions and yes i am buying the game to support your channel big funcom fan with anarchy online still one of my favorite mmo ever the pvp was great i like conan universe but it looks like characters are running with their feets in the air like in tom and jerry maybe they could increase the running speed some so it doesnt look like they run in slow motion the coins which comes up from the buildings could look better is this a mobile or a pc game looks like a mobile game warcraft reforged and age of empires coming so hard pass i had high hopes for a new rts but this one just looks bad the buildings build all by themselves there are no active workers the units run in place before the attack the attack animations are slowcrappy especially for ranged the list goes on i was excited about the coop part until i saw the game this game looks like played in slow motion hope it will be good but i have not much hope for this this game should be free to play 510 bored game ever made w t f insert the infamous comment you guys have smart phones dont you one problem i have many times i see these types of games advertised is that when i see some actual gameplay it does not live up to the size and scope of the trailer its always hyped up to be some huge strategy game experience and it plays so small the idea is good and the graphics are as well but not the size or scope it ends up just being a new skin for an old game i personally want more looks alright id say even better than they are billions just the hero needs to attack sooner alot of walking on the spot animation before attack enemy ie why are you not building more layers of walls tested coop really enjoying this game 75 impressive i mostly try coop with a friend but we never passed 42 what do u think about heavy cavalry with the av they seem pretty decent is here a reason you let open space in your walls instead of building just gates do this improved walls for bonus fire dmg work with sorcerer or just archer sry for my bad english please like on steam ty httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1755370880 constructing you can tell its done but the command and conquer team i guess this is as close as we get to a new cc game haha so this is just they are billions with no zombies bit of a rip off the original unfortunately this game really sound like cc busy boy todaybut thats good for me thanks nooblets havent found a guide or build order if youre the first youll get tons of attention and subscribers hi are you planning to do any guide for new players by any chance hello master kensei is there something in this game that is not ripped off from they are billions i mean come on as of yet conan game for old ps3 is still the best hackslash action tried the mmo and exiles was not my cup of tea with all monster and lore of conan why not make a witcher like rpg or a dark hack and slash like dark souls but in conan universe funcom is pissing away the conan property just give us a single player rpg already no more of this survival crap this is the reason i cant get excited about them acquiring the rights to dune might as well just hand it off to ea it is freakin great to see petroglyph still making games norwegian bros make a conan rpg you have the entire world of hyboria to work with and youre wasting it on these genres that dont utilize that deep rich lore this is so sad fr helvete gubbar omg this look horrible well the gameplay looks like shit geez can we get a proper conan game already whats with all this strategy crap when i read the conan books and watch the films im not thinking these would make great strategy games i want action damnit i want a conan like gow whats the matter you guys done have phones interesting id rather conan exiles dlc or a new map los you mispronounce conquered it should be conkered not conkuered bro help subscribe me too thank you more like dota than a rts oops i think conan doesnt get his ultimate until he levels to veteranso um yeah well the idea is still houses and economy as fast as possible with him being the main defender i guess the purge actually works on this version of conan also send each unit out in a different direction to scoutyou will be pausing and running away as soon as they see an enemy and only build a gate when you want to get out in a direction as they are weaker than walls p ok looks like conan can use his special attack to hold off the 1st two waves singlehandedly maybe so you use all your resources at the start to build hovels which means hunter camps or farms to get the food to build them and lumber camps then start building new units and walls ultimate goal is 30 hovels say early game i grew up reading the paper back conan novels incredible pictures on the covers yes its pretty basic right now but that is the norm for all games circa 2019 they apparently have a lot of content they are planning to add so im very excited what is to come my only worry is that the publisher is an mmo publisher so i hope they dont head more that way i like my campaigns in strategy games reformist peh who needs tower 5 minutes later base swarmed by enemies reformist surprised pikachu face i like conan as a whole but this game looks a bit old in designs which is not good in the declining genre of rts they are billions vibes coming off of this game looks pretty cool would like to see how the co op is but will it have red sonja in it steam released the game today i love conan stories and this game looks cool but imagine a conan warband mod wow yeah you need to show us the sorcerers tower looks great would love to see more levels wait a minute this isnt knee bending simulator 2019 can you play fire pro wrestlinpromoter mode pls huh first that never happens how much did it cost amazing god i love conan and i love your channel as well so im really happy that title made me click so fast man i dont have a hints button and unto this conan destined to wear the jeweled crown of aquilonia upon a troubled brow it is i his chronicler who alone can tell thee of his saga let me tell you of the days of high adventure conan the barbarian used to watch this as a kid now theyre making game cant wait never played this game before looks interesting like and fw sorry was playing on lowest graphics for faster playthrough well i have a great gaming comp and brought a new gfx card and the game still slows the play at wave 20 and over omg that was awesome i brought the game right away and only got to level 4 but now im trying to do the 25 waves on hard as that is the mission you gave me some great tips and ive been doing it your way but im still dying about wave 20 lol thanks for the vlog it looks intresting but without any civilian population that wander between the buildings it dosent feel alive your economy and build order is sick mate ggwp didnt watch it all but definitely learned plenty from this and saying this having beaten 2525 a couple times now always watch you on twitch bro nice videos damn this guy lol yea i love these type of games too i seem to always see you when such a game releases sorry dude i tried but i really need that sweet sweet commentary i find it better if you were talking through out the game he is playing with ultralow graphics you should say that this looks terrible thank you for showing me that i will not like playing this conan game have fun the game looks like a mobile game sure graphics dont matter much but they couldve gone for an oldschool style like they are billions instead of something that looks like it came out in 2009 and doesnt hold up today also i know they made it deliberately that you cant drag queue buildings to build multiple at once but it just feels silly and a nuisance what are these graphics bro if they paying they should let you be on the screen i watch deadly the specs are a little bit low wheres jason mamoa after they did the remake which had no storyline i lost interest i was thinking it was going to be a new movie i really need to make a better movie of conan because its hard to remake a classic but at least try im with somebody as big as arnold was if you use that guy from that movie big the story of joe weider they kind of look like arnold he may be conanbut he aint the rock conan has black hair black as coal black as a ravens wing and blue eyes as blue as the highest cimmerian lake can ever hope to be i cant help but think that this guy reminds me of being king kull than conan bad game not worth playing just a waste of time now thats a man never liked cinematic advertising for a game it tells and shows you nothing about the game itself you should make the winterfell vs the knightking game too one more fantasy fake movie lol of hollywood is that liam o brian that guy really looks like he s been juiced for a long time is that talos somebody please make a video of this using trumps face instead of conans please conan exiles sucked ass makes me leery of buying another one steel isnt strong boy flesh ist stronger i originally thought this was an expansion to conan exiles that character dont look like conan shit its an rts in out i dont enjoy rts games so another movie series to be ruined by hollywood edit is this actually meant to for a video game spicey they should have gotten mamoa i played the crap out of conan exiles i cant wait for this one a vr game of conan original movie would be awesome conan looks like an all american pretty boy jock except with long hair scars and a perpetual scowl bullshit to that conan has primitive broader features a rude straight cut fringe and a busted nose conan sem swastnaguer there is only one conan arnold i read the comics and i am still waiting a movies at level of this barbarian this seems interesting at all wonder how much money fredrik malmberg gets for this like if you understand at all where the hell did all those arrows come from by the gods he hot this is a calling to all my aryan brothers this cinematic is better than all conan movies made we better not be able to be conan id be pissed like those of us who love the hyborian world are all fans of conan ive been a aquilonia for years just tolerate that mountainous savage just what we need another shitty conan game so conan worships other gods now wtf all hail krom it will be si shitty game like conan exiles the game devs shouldnt have him use magic that would be completely out of character he hates sorcery also he wasnt ever a slave so they shouldnt write into the story that he is a former slave this is bullshit anyone who knows anything about conan knows he hates magic so a golem fighting on his side would not happen fucking casuals this will be an down view rts as if anyone could think that they are making another 3rd person when exiles just come out doesnt conan believe in crom not mitra just once id like to play a conan game or see a conan movie that is actually based on an actual robert e howard conan story or at least produced by someone thats read one they frightened to show a glipmse of game play missed opportunity players conan exiles is it finished funcom not yet players why making new game funcom cuz conan players ok does it have multiplayer funcom of course coop players so no multiplayer funcom no it has twoplayer coop multiplayer players so no multiplayer funcom but its fun players yes for 12 hours funcom we guarantee theres at least hundred of hours of gameplay maps are never the same players thats it were walkingcya you missed an good opportunity its sad actual multiplayer pvpve or pvp would be much better then a old crappy coop a multiplayer with rankings so theres a point in actually getting good at the game and have a goal to work towards some prizes for seasons start of season mid season end season events free dlcs to show you appreciate people buying the game and their dedication to playing your gameunlike exiles where there are just a cosmetic ca that mitra statue looks stoned af its a rts if the dude standing on the wall is supposed to be conan whoever wrote this doesnt know anything about him soo literally the first game all over again nope that metal clasp around his bicepswhile cool looking will either snap or prevent proper use of the arm since it looks metal and will constrict biceps flexion this license needs to be taken away from funcom they have no clue who conan is and what he is about well damn no wonder ps4 gave us exiles for free this month oh boy an rts of conan im so excited said no one hmm this looks very good but i wonder if it will be as replayable as conan exiles because most strategy games that have had similar trailers are like i beat 30 online matches now what another conan game that isnt the adventure rpg everyones asking for great ill wait for this one to be free also yog is not pleased this looks like a conan exiles dlc what a joke lol is it going to be broken like exiles youve got to be shitting me looks neatwhat does it have to do with conan this is like the game conan exiles hope they will make it more interesting and bigger with more content so this is another coc copy wow thats really original crom man all those conan licenses wasted on mediocre games these days why not make something like adult fantasy rpg like witcher thats what i always wanted from reading the comics this looks promising defends a castle against innumerable oddsdecides to leave the safety of a castle to charge his smaller army headlong into one 3x its size with giant spiderswho ever designs this game should try and do maybe 1 small speck of research in ancient combat b4 designing a game if your not gonna use your castles defenses then why are you defending it lmfao makes 0 sense learn to design a game plz is this a new game or an add on for exiles skeptical about it need gp footage whoa funcom is gonna make another dogshit conan game no waaaaaay gtfoh with that gay ass conan i love conan so damn much he deserves such good games its too bad that they cant use arnolds face or voice in these games conan fighting alongside mitra wtf from the publisher who never polished age of conan the mmorpg and then left a bare bones team to keep it barely running from the publisher who left conan exiles half way through and with massive bugs that make it unplayable to finally leave a bare bones team running the thing i say no thank you your track record is pathetic and deserve no loyalty from a fan base betrayed two times by you ffs the fat spiders are back crom laughs at your four winds i want that game now they should focus on fixing exiles crashing bugs before releasing a new game so do we actully get to play as conan this time its been like 10 years so they summoned mitra from behind lol good strat i thought petroglyph was dead since the only other game i know them from is empire at war so we get a new conan before they finish exiles thats strange i was waiting all this time lol what bs sonia this a dlc or hither came conan the cimmerian blackhaired sulleneyed sword in hand a thief a reaver a slayer with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth to tread the jeweled thrones of the earth under his sandaled feet can there please be an xbox one single player conan game like dmc5 hellblade senuas sacrifice or the witcher 3 please this is even better than the movie the mummy dang conan looks like he could beat shaggy 45 seconds and its gone just make the game the way its suppose to be where you live love slay and be content ok so what conan is not one person but an amalgam of legends or is it a code name like james bond because this guy looks like kull and sounds like the maxx not the best strategy for a conan movie just sayin i hope they put in some toth amon and thusla doom too making conan fight against magic would be awesome its sad what funcom does with conan why not make an rpg in the with artstyle that reminds us of frazetta where we can explore the mysteries and myths of cimmeria with beautiful women great stories and such 3rd times a charm eh funcom what a fucking joke is this an rts or connan exiles 2 wait dont yall know that conan exiles is an rpgsurvival game must take place sometime after the oceans drank atlantis and the rise of the sons of arius lol i wonder if he is king of aquilonia in this game for ps4 would have preferred if they finished conan exiles before announcing a new game will arnold punch a camel on this good to see petroglyphs is back in the rts business i used to have conan the 2008 but the gameplay was ok i like the cute scenes i was up to the last boss fight and keep getting killed so i gave up though i already seen the ending and trade it in eb games for a moment i was totally out of the uncanny valley i want a conan rpg like the dragon age origins gg no more updates for conan exiles what an amazing cinematic funcom should do a conan movie oh a another conan exiles dlc and what rts game shut up and take my money well it better have black dragonscavalry and bossonian archers then im dandy interesting i think conan is more suited for open world a slay the treasure bed the dragon dig up the whoresehmm type adventure game but an rts not sure guess the hardon for the spartan look will never soften similar to games such as they are billions the enemy hordes will keep coming at you and how long you can resist the invasion depends entirely on your ability to build your stronghold and lead your army this is part of the description from the steam page on this gamesooo is it really a rts where its like age of empires or is it liturally just a game where its like tower defense where all you do is build a city and just defend against hordes of enemies as for multiplayer it said thisplay together online and build a shared stronghold while fending off the enemy hordes why is conan using mitra if hes a worshipper of crom imo the idea of playing as conan of cimeria assuming you do in a rts game rather than a hack slash openworld action rpg feels weird they spend time on a new trailer and a new game but they cant fix conan the barbarian be wearythey allways sell half assed games dont waste your money here i thought i was watching the opening to mortal kombat armageddon this looks good but why a conan game is a rts when conan is killing monsters boobs and gold like in the comics and books hope it delivers or crom with eat the developers hearts crom already better than conan exiles xd why cant we play as arnold they release another conan game to hype the fanbase yet they cant still fix their previous game funcom is a joke console users of conan exiles are still waiting the fixes in a broken hitty port how does conan summon the avatar of mitra wheres conans fringe o god the spiders again looks good now give me my solomon kane video game or so help me time to crush your enemies see them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of the women cinematic trailer vs real game this new game same conan exile made by command and conquer devs hyped its age of mytology with the cimerians cant wait for the first ever idle clicker moba battle royale and runner games set in the conan universe cinematic for an rts game im skeptic but im willing to check it out if there is an option for refund if you are reading this on the internet you are already too weak i assume it will be very close to bfme made by the original creatives of command conquer and delivering a kind of age of empires set in the conan universe this will be a great rts holy shit this looks lit is it really that hard to make a single player game where you actually play as conan himself know its war on conan good in other words peace has cost you your strength victory has defeated you kudos to the cinematic team for how they made conan look cause its absolutely how he should appear finally rts worth to buy its like 1000 300 bc soft beds dont sound right do not disappoint me please on 2018 with dow3 my heart is hurt and the other rts dont bad ancestor legacy warparty etc but dont have a excelent rts for play for mounts or years this generation need any rts the last good rts are company of heroes 2 and maybe starcraft but both are old today honestly its irritating to me that they did not have that huge statue guy go first i really hope funcom stopped stealing peoples money first they release age of conan game is complete trash full of hackers dead game then they release conan exiles with i still play and lov the game but its full of bugs and game breaking exploits could be great game if funcom actually cared about their games and to top it off they want to release a game similar to the broken games just difference it will be rts get out of here finish and fix your dam games first before releasing another funcom company is just shameless if i wasted 60 on conan i swear to fuck hail to the crom this game is going to scream conan exiles asset flip fuck funcom give other way better devs a shot at the conan ip why dont they just give him a game similar to gow goddamnit can we get an actual fucking conan game and not a bullshit mmo or strategy game how hard is it to make a decent adventure game about conan this trailer has some age of mythology vibe rts no thanks i hope the hoard doesnt have any fluffy wamblers funcom thank you for being awesome 2player coop rts conan as an old school gamer this excites me as long theres nudity its all i ask for v no seriously i just hope therell be more villages more interaction with npc and less buggy fights is this a dlc to conan exlies or stand alone rts is this for mobile i want harry potter mmo make rts great again what is best in life to crush your enemies see them driven before you and hear the lamentation of their women that game is garbage pc master race against mobiles sjw in games lootboxes and prealfa releases for 60 i want a conan rpg like the witcher 3 i would love it for be able to change server like ark cause it gets boring when you have to be leveling up everytime whenever you change server cool set will there be penis customization doh will it have actual great gameplay any news if this will get a ps4 release wouldve been cool if they focused more fixing their old games before making this waiting for aoe4 im not an rts fan at all good luck to them though if funcom already made a crappy game and unfinished u can be sure this will be another unpolished crappy game with no quality check too bad conan exiles doesnt get this much attention from their devs im not a fan of rts games but would like to see you play this its not based on conan exiles its based om conan the barbarian lmao conan exiles isnt the franchise this game does look fun to me i wont have time to get into it myself though but maybe my favourite gaming channel will supreme commander and empire earth one is the best the rts is of all time hell yes been wanted a good rts forfuckingever hopefully its decent i would buy this game if i had a decent pc i guess ill just have to wait for it to come out on ps4 unsubscribed from your shytt attitude asswipe so its command and conquer with a conan skin cool i loved command and conquer but sadly that game was taken over by ea instead of training one unit at a time wouldnt it be cooler if they did it total war or command and conquer tiberium wars style where units are trained in bunches i think it would be closer to the unit scale in the trailer and the battles would be more pleasing to look at that way i think theres so much potential for this game and i really hope that potential is realized in ways that are both satisfactory to the target audience and costeffective for the producers good news but i would like to prefer the xbox one or ps4 just keeping the update for the release if it comes to consoles i hope it comes with mouse and keyboard support out the box soooo its they are billions but like conan ok sure you bein a smart ass yea sure funcom make new game cuz u clearly finished with conan exiles bugged piece of shit i think if i ever played another rts game id constantly grizzle about all the ways its not age of empires 2 they are billions meets conan d i love this kind of games damn i was thinking it was a expansion for conan exiles i was so hyped but then it felt like a nut punch jade pg whats your favorite rts dang imagine a survival rts conan wow take all my money plz forget conan make a game of thrones rts thatll be dope i hope we get that cape outfit in conan exiles how did u just now find out about this thought u knew about it already this is definitly based off they are billions im not complaining in this day and age an entirely original video game is damn near impossible it looks good war party is a rts game on console its need more players what systems will this be featured on love your vids keep up the gr8 work great video thats nice but since you did this vid does that mean that theres no stream tonight typical crypticfox finds some cute animals baby animals eggs and his first inclination is to smashkill them honestly i shouldnt be surprised by now 8d seems like they are billions has had an influence on gaming also i expect petroglyph to focus on the cc remasters after this so we got that to look forward to as well if youd like to support the channel you can buy conan unconquered using this link httpswwwhumblebundlecomstoreconanunconqueredpartnergamerzakh back ground sing thumbs down the resources in this game are an unbalanced mess you need to build fifty hovels flags and hunter shacks before you can even think about building an army since they use up resources as well that is food and gold the two things youll never have enough of in this game thats if youre not running out of thralls or command points or wood or stone or animal hides or some other damn thing who the hell knows what because of the hunter shack spacing all this needs to be spread across a massive area thats far too big to defend from the randomnly spawning waves that never arrive from anywhere near where it says they are going to plus theres the random critters scattered everywhere this makes it almost impossible to build walls to put up a solid defence and even if you manage they just fly over go around or just flat out catapult curb stomp your walls to hell catapults will sit back way out of range of anything you have and destroy the walls then a huge wave of guys might be funny of me to mention as a viewer but one of those fonts reminds me of strife based on the like to dislike ratio i would really love to believe this is going to be an incredible rts that even the most hardcore conan fans can enjoy unfortunately based on what i have seen it looks like another cookie cutter rts made for mobile i know the chinese mobile app market is on fire right now but as a long time funcom and conan enthusiast i was hoping for more you can do better looks interesting and fresh enough petroglyph are a great team though the havent had great success since empire at war if you can get a hold of a legal copy even pirated copies are extremely rare on torrent trackers of their 2007 game universe at war earth assault and do a video on it it would be awesome grey goo was decent and had some interesting mechanics of the different factions but wasnt a standout game it lacked an involved story and charm i need to give this game a chance i used to love playing the stronghold series and this looks far better great quality with the video this looks 2d and ancient graphics it was enspired but they are billions but all i see is a weird reskin of age of mythology tab has way better atmosphere and osts say conan unconquered five times really fast 112 a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man this gonna be a series on your channel no for me i should dewl from steam looks like another rip off using badly the conan ip thanks funcon the game looks nice i loved the womans voice it reminded me to cc 3 o 715 nooo more arachnids bring out the party hats not sure about spending 30usd for this for 20 bucks i would have picked it up cause i like the conan setting but it looks like this game will be boring after one weekend just a straight rip of they are billions pretty lame really looks nice but thats it rest is just trash man i didnt expect this game to be this good keep it up when will a conan game come out where you actually play as conan and murder shit this has potential hopefully itll be like aom arguably one of the best strategy games oat wtf thumbnail makes it look like there is going to be gameplay ffs funcomso thisll be in beta for ages get a full release way before its ready be buggy as hell and theyll promisise to fix things but really just work on paid dlc thatll make the game even more buggy please like on steam ty httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1755244980 reminds me of the old stronghold i used to play before the turn of the millenium wow this game looks so boring its nothing new its all been done before game looks alright but my god the female voice whenever you buildfinish building something etc is fucking super obnoxious and the ui is so so fucking ugly the icons look like they havent been changed since early alpha and the font is disgusting as well 5249 u made it deliberately because u were reaching the end of the video and u have no interest of playing thus anymore than the 1 time i mean who makes all these building with no fighters lol looks interesting always liked conan games cheers nooblets for showing it that fog of war could use an overhaul but as an rts lover im picking this up thanks nooblets knew you would find me something to play what games is this nice game i got to the 13th wave and been massacred i posted it on my channel we should play coop sometime half the video was no phil how the hell did you get 200 max resources hi cryptic fox have you played they are billions game its a zombie version rts survival game in early access but on the 18th of june is getting a 60 plus hour campaign reminds me of age of empires 2 ooook thanks god we have they are billions maybe they should just do game trailers or bad moviesseries i think that this game should have been or really be an opens worlds wgames conan exiles the rts game not sure how i feel about this just yet i wish they would stop with the movies if games and not actual gameplay they spend more money on the trailer than they did on the game why not to buy 1day 1 dlc for a 30 euro game a hero wich costs 10 euro so you have to pay 40 euros for a game with only a 5 mission tutorial and then a few challenges 2 copy of they are billions 3 full game with a paywall character and about 10 hours content why to buy it 1 colorful rpg seting with good strategy very easy to learn 2coop is fun 3 harder than tab because you are constantly under pressure and you need to do more stuff being attacked all the time it looks like a facebook towerdefense game shit game every user rewiew thats good on steam is either prerelease or people that got the game for free wow this looks crap woooot gaming hd is on fire baby keep it up owning grey goo and all the 8 bit rts games i wanted to support this but i dont support denuvo shame really any chance of wars of succession interesting game reminds me of age of mithology gotta say the animations are kinda clanky and whats up with the assistant voice and its futuristic theme its conan not red alert buying the game support teh channel with this link httpsbuyconanunconqueredcomutmsourcet3vgrk5lutmcampaign5cee2cca5c0b2trackingidp8tnal4vioyrhb751xxqvbitvqtcjhsv is this just empire earth or they are billions cloned oh wow i didnt know they made this a thing love conan movies and the books i wonder if takes cues from the book of the same name play coop with fire spark jade you should play with farstatue on dayz again i think it would make a great series playing together also you inspired him to make a youtube channel tried this out yesterday only played one game pretty fun so far i need a gaming pc another conan game that i cant play as conan realy they really need to stop using god of war imitation with oversized creatures or avatar whatever its overated all they have to do is create a good storylines and plot and make it a 3rd person open world game i sometimes wonder if any of this developer even read the original conan comic books cause they keep creating shitty games wtf is this a game if you had a thing that big on your side why would all those men run out to die give the thing a lawnmower and its over was that giant a statue of krom come to life to finally help conan thor without makeup thats not conan thats a fkn underwear model you assholes have completely missed the mark is it just me or he sound like the voice actor for mokotomysterious guy enchanted arms cumore tales of vesperia war darksiders asura asuras wrath and gaara naruto what im sayin is he sound like liam obrien and liam always suits badass character i wish hed voice over guts of berserk netflix i thought we were going to get a new arnold film its a game i wish it was a hack and slash ahaha this isnt even a real rts its one of those base defense things like they are billions straight from the steam page similar to games such as they are billions the enemy hordes will keep coming at you and how long you can resist the invasion depends entirely on your ability to build your stronghold and lead your army gameplay is realtime but you can also pause at any time to issue commands and start construction of new buildings battles will be bloody and savage with players having to deal with anything from fires raging through their stronghold to piles of corpses spreading death and disease that guy dont look like conan at all so wait this isnt conan exiles looks just like it well hopefully the games much more better than the cinematic trailer what the thats no way to end a trailer this story is dead what is going on i didnt know abou tthis its by petroglyph but it has all the exact render models from conan exiles cinematics and the mitra colossus from the game looks awesome is it a video game or an anime movie conan the comedian would love this the original conan stories are badass this looks kind of whacky what is best in life ps4 multiplayer i chalenge this generation to create a respectable conam game fake trailer by funcom king conan finally gets some nonbookcomic representation nice wow your history told to you with eyes wide shut u think its a they should make this like the conan game of 2008 that was god of war like this is just conan exiles dlc or something please make it like prince of persia the best thing in my life is seeing my enemies running in fear and solving mystery conan the detective babarian now this bitches make another shit conan game loool wtf wrong with them where is arnold i like how conan looks like arnold schwarzenegger the original conan i just hope its not like conan exiles i am not fan of crafting resource management games i uninstalled the game to save hdd space holy cows i hope its open world conan exiles reskin sooo you want me to go out and fight that giant spider is there a good dental plan and 401k matching why couldnt the movie look this good crom onan the fapbarian if nobody notice this is the actor who did trevor on gta v isnt he liam obrien i got a pretty strong mobile vibe from this trailer for some reason whats conan going to do against giant spiders good answer so where is the strong female sidekickcharacter wheres the comedy relief 510 i cant decide without seeing some gameplay footage ronald the barbarian i think they should lead with the giant this is age of empire be liked guys not rpg crom and the riddle of steel new gow when will they make a conan game or movie true to the character where you just run around and kill people and steal shit and inadvertently kill demons as in he doesnt seek out demons or gods and only slayed them or anyone for that matter if they got in his way conan didnt make friends unless he had to he didnt join a cause unless it benefited him he took the crown of aquillonia but then afterwards he hated holding it thats some quality in the music hope that this game has a story campaign unlike conan exile hope it should also have nudity for rp because its conan christ when is the spartan influence ever gonna fade lol funny how kids are cluless here its by petroglyph an rts game if its like conan exiles then its a no buy for me the game was the worst shit ive ever bought looks more like thor than conan this guy looks nothing like arnold frank frazettas conan or the conan described by robert e howard he looks thoroughly aryanized sad oh great another conan exile game lol i hope it is not one of those from above camera strategic games let me guess its another survival game fuck this era for real im guessing its another openworld sandbox type game ill pass whats the point of having a video game called conan but your not playing conan exclusively we already have conan games few in a row that deals in an online fashion i just want that old school singleplayer gore fest set in the world of conan playing as conan you guys should just gave the rights to the folks that made the witcher video game first thing came to my mind on seeing the thumbnail is arnie this is sparta i am hoping this one goes hollywood single player game please we ve had enough with these bad survival games why would you sally out of the breach to face a numerically superior force conan you fool conan unconquered now we need conan unchained and conan unslaved and well get the zero punctuation award for best title is this movie or video game man i hope this is good i enjoyed the conan game that came out back in 2007 i hope this game atleast conquer someting crush your enemies see them driven before you and to hear the lamentation of their women its an rts coming out for pc a separate single player conan game is also in development soon as you see funcom you know its absolute shit is this an expansion for that conan game already out or a completely new thing aaa shit another crap like ark gamejust go to get fucked conan exiles was the greatest shit ever the biggest shit in the universe nice to see that the alliance has enlisted conan to be their champion finish unfinished conan game nah lets release a new one will this game come to ps4 lmao who thought it was right to get yasuo to voice conan this is horrible sooo conan controls a titan what a waste of moneycouldve fed a whole starving village instead we get this crapsame unoriginal buggy lifeless grinding with no love for content this game is going to suck when it comes out just like every other conan gamesomebody please step in and save this franchise perfect timing for this trailer ooooohhhh god another shity game stop ruiny the chance of conan have a decent game no mounts no visible holstered gear or arow quwivers still trash game is this another arc survive rip off i hope this game be like shadow of mordor or shadow of war i have a feeling this is going to be a slight disappointment to some ppl once it comes out if the game looks like this that would be tuff i need gameplay is it weird that i actually want this to be an rts this is conan is this one going to be better if the same shadows of mordor will be a success please dont be an rts hope it doesnt end up being some diablo clone cool this shouldve been in game awards this should have been in the game awardsstunning cgi if your not conan then i could care less conan should be like arnold best game boi its cgi meaning its shit we want arnold conan not another garbage movie what who else thought that this was related to detective conan first both are like the same they are billions is more slow pace where conan is more fast pace i dont understand why so many people hate conan lol people say the graphics are like 10 years past date on conan i mean they are billions graphics is like from like 2005 how i do in life in compared to my older sister nobody stupid peaple first they are billions conan version sounds fun what can go wrong xd hello i was watching a strain tactics video and i have a question how do you get more units and buy armor and guns in the game 25 waves should make for a pretty good challenge if you put the markets closer to your house they give you more gold per house should double your wall and a couple more towers per walls good review and gameplay like normal thinking this game isnt for me so glad you guys do these vids so a person doesnt go in blind and spend money on stuff they wont like thanks again well this is different from your past videos ive watched is this game like lotrbfme2 or more like command and conquer king spiders lol they been tamed as theyre attacking together with other enemies theres a new one 850 interesting visual glitch on the left hand side of the screen looks like one of your dog kill icons from battle brothers this is not robert e howards conan what is this that was arnies face for conan nice touch dont how much it cost them though hope it didnt affect the game budget funcom lets see some game footage why would they charge out of the walls i would just keep my troops behind that opening and choke the enemy forces why is a repair all button in an rts necessarily a good thing a iarge portion of rts gameplay is multitasking so they borrowed a ton from they are billions and threw on a conan tm skin they didnt actually improve on anything from they are billions its essentially a shitty lazy cashgrab just go play they are billions its a much better game age of barbarian this though dont be fooled dan liked one moba specifically heroes of the storm check the quick look conan the barbarian always had his name pronounced conan but then when conan obrien got popular it seemed everyone started calling him conin like the talk show host but yeah they are supposed to be pronounced differently conan has a really weird history his original creator robert howard only worked on him for like 5 years before he killed himself he made about 15 stories but then those faded into obscurity and went out of print for a long while and like 50 other books have been written since so conans really been around the block by different authors and comics movies games etc but from what i can tell i have not read a lot of them they all seem to kind of respect the source material i could be wrong interesting story the first movie was great and launched arnold schwarzeneggers career second movie destroyer was okay but i always wanted more conan as a kid and i had always thought red sonja was the third conan movie but they had lost t dan commandos where just following the hero unit craze be honest with yourself if yuri primes psychic mind control flying stuff didnt make it obvious yurikos anime powers sure as hell have better made you admit it the emotionless constructing voice certainly screams command and conquer or a scifi setting in general strange choice for a conan game thats already reusing appropriate assets wholesale take stuff like that and add it to ui like the tech tree and it ends up feeling like an asset flip or reskin which is unfortunate edit javelins blow people to giblets buildings instantly vanish when sold so many cheap animations cripes petroglyph arent what they used to be hey there are billions is a good game lets copy it basically 99 but just skin it differently worst part is so lazy they took most voice overs from conan exiles and the mmo of conan couldnt even record new voice work lazy ass super basic game no campaign just a few maps with a few heroes and u just do wave after wave hardly even a game in rts games i always liked to turtle up and build my base they are billions is basically turtling the game so it scratched the rts itch for me for quite a while this looks good too i may try it thanks gb its pronounced hawvel how has he never heard the world hovel this game reminds me of 8 bit hordes dammit its pronounced hovel not hovel the tooltips for the hovels say they can be upgraded on them theres gotta be a way edit oh okay a few minutes later im losing it at abby and dan talking about the best games of all time i recognize some of those models and animations from age of conan guess if youve got good assets why not use them some of the music too and while the composer for the movies was basil poledouris the composer for age of conan conan exiles and probably also this game happens to be knut avenstroup haugen this is very they are billions conan was conquered by jay leno the fog of war in this game is kind of hilarious looks like cappuccino foam do they even know thats not how running animations work still waiting for the dark soul like game set in hyboria or the witcher like rpg robert e howards lore is so vast imagine what could have been done yes i know of age of conan mmo but i want a more story driven rpg as of yet the hack and slash game is still the best if one dont count the 1991 pc version that still has a certain charm to it if this somehow has multiplayer i am buying it looks great for 2009 i have been playing this for the past 20 years its called age of empires wish they didnt try to copy age of empires formula because they arent doing a good job at it looks like a soulless mobile game give me a break dudeee im glad people are still making rtss but man the combat gameplay looks stiff and the graphics seem a bit outdated though rts in 2019 yeah please its an alright game is this a mobile game lame animation basicali no ideas veary bad looking game not worth more like 10 and nice video man d wowthis looks pretty bad all i can pay attention to is the constant hollow noise of his keyboard like his mic is on it im looking forward to more videos on this game 500 second impact they are billions feeling 2300 and yep total rip off of they are billions very sad i hope they payed you well quill to sponsor this kind of clone 243 initial impact thought age of empires seems a bit like stronghold sort of old school i know its sponsored and what not but cant you afford to refuse money when the games shit they are billions with stronghold crusader graph you build a wall and they go around it imagionot that gameplay looks interesting but the fps is abysmal are you getting 1015 fps nookrium also did a stream of this game and he was stuttering with around 10 fps for much of the stream it was so choppy is this just a youtube rendering thing or is the actual framerate really this bad so the thing is the game isnt actually running at that low of a framerate you can tell by the ui elements and how smoothly the view scrolls its running at least at 30 probably 60 fps its just that the character models are all animated at like 5 fps for some reason i feel like that might actually make it look worse than if the game was just poorly optimized this game is atleast 10 bucks to much is it just me or does naming the tech tree tech tree seem a bit redundant so basically they are billions but no zombies i think you expanded your base too much or at least your walls that meant more materials needed to build enough walls more towers needed to cover the walls and more time needed to run your troops around to cover each area if you had start with a smaller base it would have been cheaper and easier to defend then expand outward over time stand down bigot your desire to defend the sovereignty of your nations people is racist accept the waves of undocumented enemies and be silent how does anyone put up with 5 10 fps for an entire hour the madman no thanks it is not really conan at all just a rts build it as fast as you can game no imagination whatsoever conan title by funcom is just commandconquer tower defense with gore my who wouldve thunk 5 fps is more than enough for a rts so basically they are billions ripoff there wasnt loot at the second scorpion site you moved the party to another area so i dunno if there was or not would be important early on id think thrallsarepeople necromancers raise the dead conan raze the dead the fps seem very low defending from waves and waves of enemies sounds like getting attacked by zapp brannigan what happened to factorio what a horrible game so this is basically they are billions conan edition keel up the good work man oh heck quill stop playing games and making me want them ive got little enough time as it is d cryptic im begging you please play fortnite season 9 conan warlord what is best in life conan to crush your enemies to see them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of their women jay sherman conan how do you sleep at night rainier wolfcastle on top of a pile of money with many beautiful ladies ps also im so waiting for the age of empires iv release so its they are billions with a conan skin this game is a steaming pile maybe if someone hosed off the shite there might be a gem buried deep in there somewhere but i doubt it video quality sucks bro good game though wow the price forget it wow when people said lag i thought they meant like 20 fps or something this was like single digit bad lol so that fucking badass and epic anouncement trailer was for this kind of rts phone game with day one dlc neat this game more on macro or micro hope more on macro though due to majority rts today too saturated on microintense if you put a copy in front of me id probably play it but all in all ill probably go for they are billions only when that is done the thumbnail of valeria actually looks like sandahl bergman i think this looks nice theres one bit with the spiders that is choppy but the rest of the footage is smooth models and animations look detailed both units and buildings if im being picky maybe some building are too small compared to the units and it looks a bit weird but other than that i like what im seeing day one dlc eh fuck off it look like it was made in 2002 i think im gonna pass this the video is super choppy if the game is like that it looks unplayable is the video choppy or is the game lagging so much it looks nice but i do find the price a bit steep both of their views are here httpviewsyncnetwatchvjg6ltpnzy54t2vb2s2t8lkhxqt144 it always bugs me when rts games have their units be so dumb its like hey theres some guys over there smashing a house i should probably do something but theyre like 5 steps away from me i couldnt possibly move that far without orders that game looks so good please give us more of it isnt it strange how refreshingly wonderful it is with fog of war that is not black xd thats one strange thing i loved about civilization 5 too i dont know its much nicer with fog of war that reflects the environment youre in beige here as a sandstorm or white and cloudy in civ5 or map textured in anno and civ6 wow im so happy other games are gonna start using the they are billions engine now because it would be amazing to have more rts games capable of thousands of enemies on screen at once besides just the old cossacks and such not really a fan of their particular gameplay style very very naiiiice swimsuit borat voice i would love a warhammer 40k game using this engine wow just imagine half naked men count me in e at first i thought youd play a conan exiles dlc xd as iares mentioned this is a strategy game made from the same engine as they are billionsthere will be a sp campaign out soon for that game you may enjoy not sure if its coop what fun does the spider camp that you destroyed attack the incoming waves would it act as a passive defence they are billions with a different skin great play dude the repair button is your friend use it to the left of conans picture great job this is soo violent better give me an ak47 the sountrack reminds me of god of war dlc for conan this shouldve been in the game awards is this a age of empires 2 mod what the video restarted after turps said you gotta go back love lewis pornstar sunglasses crom cares little if men live or die so you wouldnt be calling him down but i wont hold your lack of conan lore knowledge against you turps are there conan games that arent clones of other games that ending i have a feeling that turps feels like its just there are billions reskinned sorry but it looks like a mobile shovelware the graphics look so dated the second conan fucking got me lewis i respect the sexy leather jacket again after that epic intro for the game so conan unconquered is they are billions with conan i miss having actual rts games with map editors can someone recommend a newer one the newest decent one that crosses my mond is grey goo love the double conan image what the hell this game is terribly difficult i appreciated your effort i like how you put out the wall fire from the middle and let it spread to the sides its better to start at a side i really enjoy the sessions with you and aven big fan whatever multiplayer games you play include aven your chemistry is so good yawn they are billions clone with heroes game looks good but graphic so ugly see both of them in action httpviewsyncnetwatchvffbvbgq8tit128vccgsrln1nhet143 man not my kind of game but it was fun watching you both interesting game aven1017 needs to be put on the wheel for mentioning red sonja in a conan game the movie he would have seen the wheel would have been in the original conan with arnold its where the children of conans village were taken by slavers after their village was destroyed it was used to toughen and strengthen them up to be sold 4810 but i like the festive fire i wont put it out unless im ordered to yeah i think like they are billions its really more an economic gameyou need to make a strong economy to make a strong defense to increase your economy to increase your defense i think you need to spread your towers out a bit more so they cover the whole length of the wall i know that its good to have them close so they can all reach the braziers but its leaving your soldiers idle in the tower while enemies attack the other parts of the wall doubling the walls is awesome can you double the gates up as well towers scattered inside the city area may be a good idea as well this game is awesome and i enjoyed watching you play it d more of this please motivational wheel also know as a breaking wheel or a katherine wheel pyanadon would be pleased command and conquer game engine again its all the same game with different graphics really liked this one and this is definitely another game for the if i ever have any damned money again list possibly the worst game ive seen you playreview dont bother wasting your time on any more recordings chalk it up to experience and move on im liking these one off specials great idea hello there lactating women wait what rewinds hello there land hating women did i really just hear rewinds hello there lamentating women oh right lamenting would be the proper declension but well give mr failure a pass especially after my ears dont quite seem like theyre getting english anyway conan unconquered is just like they are billions jk ive got maximum wood i have to say that in chat when screwing around in war of rights because that is the game that would do that for me with that historically accurate gameplay xd civil war line battles are so awesome in firstperson i dont like spiders or even worse buttons labelled train that dont mean what i hope they mean well at least conan wasnt exposed at the same time as the colonel had maximum wood this one is definitely different ill just sit back and wait for the next train my favorite bit is how the humor became bawdier as the attack waves got more intense that damn swordsman was a spy for khotan the whole time its the only reason we failed thanks for the invite colonel it was a blast pause the game and build an armored train well this was a nice change from trains thanks for the great work you put out there but dont let the trains ride out the platform with out you obligatory this game looks like a cousin of they are billions comment coop mode is an interesting addition but split resources and control kinda work against it the unconquered subtitle seems to be a bit of an exaggeration doesnt it trains wait what so you are telling me there are no trains i dont understannd why careful that no dutchmen are hiding among the nomads hehehe how new is this game is it alot like conon exile sorry i missed you stream jimbob i was getting roasted in hell for my sins and now i am a pot of boiling hot red irritated skin that was awesome game night bro we need to do more like this also thanx for helping me get some more subs scuffed they are billions is this out will you guys do more of this puh so happy didnt have to wait longer p what music are you using for your intro repug first view boy how do you check what your units stats are i know it comes up with a box on the right of the screen but when you go to mouse hover over an ability on the stats the box vanishes when your two favorite things fuck conan and rts games created my baby hop its fun im surprised at the price though starcraft 2 arcade spits games like this out pretty easy not in anyway near they are billions i mean this look boring no npc walking doing building etc and not exciting like tab that one zombie can end everything dlc on day one suck my peen honestly i had hoped the game would be like age of empires but not its a boring horde game man i want a proper fucking good rts wait so the standard version is missing one third of the game fuck that so its like the civilization games rts games dont or shouldnt have tutorials its putting you into the fire for you to learn looks awesom nope nope cracked version for me sorry funcock im not buy it 510 should be free to play trash if the concept of this game looks interesting id suggest checking out they are billions a very similar game but with a zombie theme and yes the title doesnt lie ive ended rounds with 200 000 kills in that game as an old school rts fan with countless hours of age of empires that was a game i enjoyed quite a bit this however looks a little slow paced and a bit simpler compared to they are billions but if it gets the same amount of updates and added content as that game got after its initial release i feel there is potential for this game no tutorial i hate it when i start a new game and have to search the internet for instructions to play no excuse not to have an ingame tutorial folks who dont need the extra hand holding can simply disable or bypass it how is it vaniverse lemme know too expensive for what you get its they are billons but with conan vr ready game looks like a snooze fest i was really excited for the first few seconds of the video great review though thanks no they had cheap servers on their conan mmo they realeased exiles a year too early two games that could have been great but ended up less bugcom must have crappy executives conan the barbariansim city cimmerian edition dude i want this game thanks for the video great stuff as always i see no penises or bewbs this is not conan great review i doubt ill buy this interesting to see the game played interesting but not my type of game just my thought i just want to say youre channel deserves waymore subscribers than you already have it really is fantastic will it come to ps4 seems kind of meh honestly hi dont forget the orbs video please its like a less smooth they are billions clones everywhere clones this guys 1st rts has he never played cc are you going to play monster hunter when iceborn is released i like these sorts of games from you hey sl1p check the artisan or craftsman hut there was something with wheat on it maybe thatll add some food productions or farming or something journey step completed watch sl1pg8r a we are billions reworked looks pretty cool but slip i must say youre not the best at micromanaging haha should have built more hunters shacks and more efficiently as well overall enjoyed this video pssss so funny story im really stoned and i found the videos thanks ps please play sub nautica again youre really good at swimming with the fishys and billing stuff and things i cant find your sub nautica subzero play throughs in the playlist i might be really stoned or really blind i dont now but i swear i couldnt find it and i know you played it please help i want to watch them again hey sl1p when you opened the research building or whatever its called i think i saw something to do with farming thought id comment cause you said you were having trouble with food but im not 100 sure it was farming it just looked like it hope this helps have a great day sl1p you are the aced it nailed it cant be stopped legend oh btw we need an ark extinction series thanks for the awesome vids all of these ark comments are sad that game is old news move on jesus christ its been too long since ive seen you they are billions rip off do one last episode on ark plz for a fan whose watched u from the beginning glorified tower defense game want a real and challenging rts play company of heroes you are kinda slow but love your vid take some range unit when attacking spider dont take unit out from tower leave at least 1 or 2 unit in emergency i really want to play it myself i wont tell how you should play but have fun man more of conan o brien send others with conan 2x speed is amazing i was excited to see a new dune game coming then realized that funcom was publishing it and got sad not a huge rts fan but this one is ok id rather see conan exiles though you can get elephants in that game now if your short on food and a building makes food id suggest making more of those buildings can you please play some more ark survival evolved i beg of you so its a conan themed they are billions do more videos on this game secure that southern border sl1p can we build it yes we can you must construct additional pylons so its like a conan we are billions looks like a crappy clone of age of empires you can upgrade your buildings slip ahh good classic arnold lines love it command and conquer conan saw evilzak playing this the other day wondered if it was like exiles or totally differentlove me a good rts though itd be big very disappointed it looks terrible looks boring tbh i adore rts games and conan this os going to be fantastic ive put so much time into conan exiles so i am stoked fuck ark is this game just fancy tower defense or are there any other type of missions any game with time presure no thank you the corpses are staying on the battlefield blood too huge plus in my book fucking good to see some devs that understand its nice to have a gory battlefield like good ol dow 1 tired of this fucking sink into the ground crap huge for this game who records gameplay like this these days also if i was understanding the promotional screen shots there where bigger units that players could build like elephants or rhinos is that still a thing pvp would be nice since it looks like mirrored factions is this not a mobile game okay im on board conan has a great setting for oppressive survival rts this is not on ps4 someone will die i dont know who it could be you person reading this comment but who knows it could be me for all i know wait does funcom not own the game right of this ip geralt of rivera aiaiai rune aiaiai p take on me what is your take on who i am party pper i know first the coop mode was really put as a major point for this game and its got a lot of good points to it makes me really want a coop mode in they are billions which i know is basically impossible for them so maybe thats why conan unconquered is pushing this mode so hard if youd like to support the channel you can buy conan unconquered using this link httpswwwhumblebundlecomstoreconanunconqueredpartnergamerzakh wow double resources shared research shit that is a major game changer for those of you saying this game looks like shit its very enjoyable but also very hard sad to see theres so much niche potential for sophisticated coop strategydefense games i am pretty sure theres no coop mode for they are billions in the pipeline according to the devs the engine is not built with mp experience in mind due to the excessive number of units present on the map trying to watch my they are billion twitch friends play this in coop is painful cuz it lags so bad this has amazing potential on paper but this looks incredibly bad the coop mode was more fun to play than the singleplayer campaign to be honest a thing i noticed while we played was that the game didnt really help us work together like when you put out markers i never noticed because i wasnt looking at the minimap at that moment and i didnt hear any sound alert from it same goes with when your buildings are being attacked i dont get notified so i assume that everything is alright until you tell me youre under attack p there also seem to be lack of sound when the waves start sometimes i completely missed that a wave had spawned until they were at our base in tab its really hard not to notice a wave has started because of the overwhelming epic music that drowns out everything else d god this game looks so dull another rushed game nice they are barbarians thats no pun they are barbillions what operating system are you using currently windows 7 or 10 which is better for oldschool games im just waiting for a torrent not gonna support this shit game game looks like shit honestly 2019 and they come up with this shame people would pay for such crap it has no compaign as a full product lol get out of here i have been waiting for this should make for a good campaign its reminiscent of empire earth 3 on tortage beach directly behind where you spawn is a chest in the water that usually has a constitution ring handy as jewellery is scarce in the starting zone really enjoyed your pom saga of zath streams last year yeah something about aoc that keeps me coming back despite no real new content the world just feels solid and real compared to other mmorpgs along with the more mature content and storylines this looks cool will you do more this looks like age of empireshalo wars game cant wait to get this on the sale awesome game play i want to see more please been interested in this game looks quite good with friends i love this game great gameplay my friend keep going nice gameplay this game had such potential pitty its just a glitchy and unpolished mess also pyro im pretty sure the gaurd towers also slightly increase attack range aswell as the hp of it being helpfull i like how expressive your voice is should make small walls and guard towers in a circle around the perimeter and fill with troops asap hey pyro been

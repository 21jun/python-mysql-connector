i really want a mana khemia like gameswhy atelier series so boring right now what have they done feels sad this game have sooooo many static dialogues and repetitive boring actions the price is also very crazy high maybe this was meant to be mobile games but since the size were too big and the quality was high they just go with console platform instead 12415 that moment when you decide fuck it just get everything lol you know this used to be my fav game one of them anyway on playstation 2 now ughh they need to put an optional male main char ye cant even run around in yer town this mobile game everything just auto wow this looks so boring even tho i like rpgs with city building minigames still im waiting a good atelier game like the atelier eris from ps2 or man khemia games but as allways a female mc everything is very cute ugh the walk is auto the gathering material is auto its like a atelier easy mode hehe i could give it a try just now wondering if it has that time thing like other atelier i didnt like since i love to take it slow and enjoy the game wtf is that name tho can you still get the dlc town building 5item set kinda funny that the game that is primarily for fans of the series has my interest the most since its primarily not a turn based rpg oh well looks cute and fun will check it out when it hits sale or gog was this game made by women because its aesthetics are really beautiful in an attentiontodetail way that i personally think women have a unique knack for certainly a title that is going to appeal first to existing fans of the franchise the game still retains enough core aspects of the series but streamlines everything to focus on the city building side of things rather than the crafting and exploring the story is also less involved than main series entries but instead focuses on lots of small character events though most of the other games arent going for grandiose story telling either im not sure if its a great place to get new fans interested in any particular main entry apart from simply being introduced to all the characters but it does well to setup the themes and hints of the various other stories im about half done the game and even if its in large part due to the fanservice i rank it near the top of the list for my favorite in the franchise that said im not sure id want it to become a regular entry but i wouldnt mind them doing a few more spinoff titles to explore the worlds in different ways it would be nice if they brought back the art style of atelier maries elie characters at least once i bought nelke thinking it was a mainline game lol i knew it had city builder elements but i thought it would play a bit more like previous titles though i havent put many hours into it im still glad i own it on the upside ryza looks good and its coming out in a week or so i hate my mind the only thing i could think of when she said city simulator with all the atelier characters in the game is to open a big tampon shop considering how japanese people use to pronounce l with the sound of r i think the western way to pronounce this games protagonist name is indeed neuke why she talks with so many pau ses what platform is this on im here to see why this game is over 100 bucks with all the dlc and season passthat ive never heard of before lol is this the sims for weebs xd well i guess ill watch and find outlol thanks to your excitement for this series i am slowly getting into it youre awesome an ateliers city builder game with all the previous characters as the cast heavy breathing seriously i have high hopes for this only to find out the battle game play looks so disgusting damn oh well when i was excited to buy this and use the old atelier mcs whats the intro tune good god that intro is majestic welpive been mispronouncing nelkes name this whole time figures p orz just a piece of advice i cringed when you were trying to pronounce nelke just figure out how to say it and stick with it and dont call attention to it it just wastes time and looks unprofessional its a bad habit ive noticed with american youtubers when trying to pronounce unfamiliar words but nonamericans are guilty of it too other than that nice review after looking at your videos to see if this is a series i should try and get into and seeing this review in particular makes me wish that there was an atelier game that played more like one of my favourite games of all time rune factory 4 the idea of a game about alchemy and going out to get materials for it and having an emphasis on characters over grand story on paper sounds like they would play like rune factory oh well when rf4 comes out on the switch i can hang out with my bff dragon and go hunting for the perfect materials for my alchemical and smithing needs while tending to my farm this is like the kingdom building in ni no kuni honestly compared to other atlier games it seems more like an app experiance omg vayne its been a while since i played his story in the psp mana khemia 00 since atelier has a habit of borrowing german words eg karotte village from atelier violet karotte meaning carrott and nelke is german for both clove the spice and carnation id assume its pronounced in the german way ie basically how you said it but pronounce the l like an l im so happy you play the atelier series thank you for the review and detailed look at actual gameplay you helped me make an informed purchase decision with no regrets nelke is a happy rare mix of many things that i enjoy 40 hours in and counting i really love all of your atelier videos i watch them over and over and it got me into the series im currently playing atelier sophie and i like it a lot id love for you to do an in depth video about each game although i know thats a lot to ask wow whose art is that at the end tho i havent played a ton of the games but i love the series nontheless i had be actually been following this game but ended up forgetting the release date lol ill certainly be picking it up when i get a chance just a fun fact the first one i had played was marie elie atelier pair for the wonderswan also how is the subscriber count not at like 500 thousand you certainly deserve it the cover artist is hidari right the shopkeepers are characters from the first games o even main characters of first games omg 210 it feels like one of those cheap auto playing mobile games im a huge atelier fan massive and i knew what to expect with this game and it is still the most disappointing piping hot garbage game i have played in many many years it should of been a free to play mobile game with micro transactions thats how bad it is dont buy it this reminds me of final fantasy crystal chronicles my life as a king now i gotta get it and somehow convince my partner im playing for the city building bits and not big ol anime tiddies cool thank you for this very clear review i personally have only played one atelier game but i really enjoyed it so when i saw this title in store i bought it on the spot despite not knowing it would be a city sim still i have been enjoying this game very much even though im unfamiliar with most of the older characters i never play a ateliers games but i am invest in this games and buy them in my ps vita the moment i saw vayne i liked the video this game has raze and vayne in it i had a bit of a fan moment myself when i saw vayne in your video i got into the series through cross edge which lead me to mk 2 and then to the ateliers series i honestly think i might have to buy this for the switch when i get it seems like a fun game to play on the road as a fan back when the atelier series started this game such a memory rush back when i first started playing the series definately a fan game that i personally couldnt recommend my friends if they never played an atelier game before i love that you pronounce atelier that way and not atleer not into the ateliers games at all here i bought this for my switch for the city simulator aspect im sure there are better options out there but im digging it so far im on my third assigment i think now nelke basically rule most powerful city in her world man im in cloud 9 now i love the atelier games and city sims now i can have my cake and eat it too this game sounds like the most technical game with how much is necessary to manage and balance out which kinda intimidates me yeah i will wait until it goes down to 30 dollars before buying it i am a huge fan of the series but i dont think this one is worth the 60 bucks i have no problem spending 60 bucks though once lulua comes out hmm i thoought the game was a mobile gacha game oo hi it reminds me of the kingdom builder in ni no kuni ii revenant kingdom i love the atelier series but this game is bored as hell i dont recomend it ive never played the atelier series before but i have already decided that misty is my new waifu 333 vayne is that my boy vayne yooooooo what is he doing here does alchemist of alrevis exist in the same world as this one i played all atelier series on ps2and atelier annie on ds then nelke is my comeback to series have you played annie always a joy to hear your voice also the game looks cute something to look forward to it seems atelier has been one of those series ive been wanting to check out but just never seem to know when to jump in its probably best to start with a mainline title but this does look like a cute game too wait what people do get new bands based on genre that comment just dont make sense honestly the game put me off real bad because the game just feel like a premium phone game ill stick with the traditional atelier games i dont even play the atelier series but i needed to hear your asmrish voice lmao still kept coming back to your nier vids love ya sis 1051 geoffinitely i want an ateliers game that is in the style of the iris 12 mana khemia would be okay but i have not really enjoyed any of them from ps3 and beyond i forgot this channel exists and now im binge watching last 6 months send help companies should focus on their main ip requirements not change their genre this will never get close to harvest moon level tropico etc yes seeing vayne and pamela is nice and all but where the hell is flay unless gasp he is hiding for a moment to attack i think your voice bit different since apex video or maybe i have hearing problem well i like your voice before it sound lovely in my ear thanks for the great review your voice is great for game reviews what is the intro song for the video something about the font really bothers me i dont know why so basically this is the sim citystory of seasons of atelier im sold ive been playing atelier sophie recently and its good wholesome fun still waiting for that mana khemia pc port though is there an option for english voice acting i had a hard time getting in to lydia suelle without an english option i especially miss sophies va so like meruru rorona with the time period jobs with a more extreme version of ni no kuni 2 with the work placement all the pirates are here before going back to fitgirl your voice is so good try valkyria chronicles series maybe u like it hey this was a really informative video thanks a tonne for making it looks like console gameplay was was removed for a focus on mobilephone style gameplay pass the struggle is so real ive been wondering though when do you actually get gust in the town when you have the 20th anniversary pack installed wow you sound so much like marceline from adventure time i really wanted escha and logi to come to switch no news yet never played an ateliet game before picked this up mostly because of the appeal of a city simulator with a great art style safe to say ill be picking up some other atelier titles in the future because of how much ive enjoyed playing this why does it look so much like a mobile game the story is similar to atelier annie develop a resort town within 3 years right ok so question what exactly is an atelier not the game but theshop is that it im still torn between almost the entire atelier cast being in this game triggering my inner fanboy and the fact that im not a fan and not good at simulators on the other hand synthesis especially in the unpolished rorona game holy bells is it terrible to go back after playing totori or meruru and figuring out you cant even carry your equipment into ng which is the only thing that would make your life easier is planningintensive too and requires some brainjuice ill probably wait for a sale and play the old games while waiting playing this for about 30 hours now game just froze on me there are other people running into the same problem on ps4 also im seeing problems with people game over ing and the stuff that should carry over to the next playthrough isnt this game has been out in japan for how long and it still has these issues its such a shame because im quite enjoying it hmmthough i usually avoid the time limit atelier games i might pick this up because i enjoy city simulators plus getting to see some of my favorite characters from across the franchise is a nice plus a question though it was mentioned that you can send a party off to gather at places you have already been would you be able to send them off and go do other tasks while their doing that or even send them off to gather at a previous location while your leading a second party to an unexplored locale i still have not started this series but i want to i kind of think think i should start with sophie ulreikaall of my hate boils over sorry not a fan of her storyline or et from that game either come to think of itmana khemia 2 the fall of alchemy that said this does sound interesting ive played most of the series modern incarnations from the iris to the dusk and the mysteriousi played arland but was not a fan of those for a lot of reasons all that said this kind of sounds like a beefed up version of the ds title atelier anna which i enjoyed two questions does this game have multiple endings asking because anna did and it made the game interesting as failing an objective meant you got an ending for your trouble does this game have new game another feature of anna and one i think the series as a whole could really benefit from as it would make the early game less tediouslooking at you sophie at least until i get my instakill item review man seeing that reminded me how much i missed klein lita and viese videos as comfy as the game itself city building i think this suits my taste better than normal atelier atelier series used to be good and fun till tecmo took over and turned it into weebo shit ive only ever played sophie so far but got put off by the others with the time limit and tough grindy trophies i wonder how the trophy list for this game will be if its reasonable i might give it a go esp since its an independent title hey sophie youve done a list of your favorite atelier games would you think a list of your favorite characters from the atelier series would be a good video also i think a better analogy would be going to see a band you know and love but theyre going to play a different genre of music ive only played the sophie games but this looks like a fun spinoff shame a lot of the cameos will be lost on me 1227 coincidentally thats the reason why my older brother is a bit interested in this game yesterday he ran out of games in his ps4 after less than hour of playing he deleted the game i finally get to play a game with marie and schia im so in oooh vayne and pamela from my favorite atelier game combat and exploration looks like darkest dungeons the way you say nelke is so cute speak more german please i personally got really hyped when they announced that nelke will have city building aspect to it even though i never play games like sim city or city skylines lately the mobage i play have city building valkyrie crusade or room designing imas cg princess connect etc and i always spend way more time fiddling around the cityroom than playing the actual game the town building is simple and easy to understand despite the lengthy tutorial give to us was sweating a little there lol but what sold me the most is the resource management and how it seems like were just the npc visiting the alchemists in their atelier once in a while to chat or give assignments back in the main games while they are still going around exploring by themselves when were not watching its a refreshing experience so i want to say my hype was paid in full and with some extra been loving this game im addicted and trapped in a just one more turn mentality im also odc about filling a district completely before moving on to the next also its the first atelier game ive picked up not a fan of the series but im in that niche group would would pick it up because its an atelier game now i wanna go back an play the other games d happy birthday sophie wish you all the best in your life keep up on creating fun yet absurd review that weirdly nice to watch hope your channel keep growing 1 million subscriber seem so far away but its getting closer day by day may year to come will be better than year to past congrats i am picky when it comes to simulation games like i loved the farming one called stardew valley but thats because it had more aspects besides farming although that was fun too now i have played mana khemia and loved it so when i first heard about this game and that vayne was going to be in it i was initially like when can i get this game but hearing it was a simulation did give me pause so i do have a question how does each day end like in mana khemia those days ended either by character interaction on free days doing a class or on event days when you completed an event i do think if i do decide to get this game though id rather play a few of the other alterier games first i just came from your recommended list so i have an idea which ones i should try that way ill enjoy the character interactions more here i heard the char name pamela youre talking about pamela from mana khemia right even though she wasnt my fav party character in th i stumbled on the video looking for reviews for ateliers of the new world and then i realized ive actually seen your lore summary of drakengard and nier so thanks for making this video and im looking forward to more not sure if this was asked before but are the intro and outro of your videos soundtracks or originals they are so beautiful the game have a history i always play atelier series but this one looks like mobile did worth a try play is this a gacha phone game cuz fucking hell does it look like every bottom tier gacha phone game i hope this spin of gets a good three part series i like your dedication to niche jrpgs here because of the epic indeimaus impression xd thanks for that worst game in series shame on atelier name a phone game for a premium price i picked up a copy today and played a couple of hours and in terms of first impressions im loving cant wait to meet up firis totori and cordelia as a side note ill be ecstatic if tess elise melvia and drossel all show up as a big fan of the atelier games im enjoying this and i dont really like city sims the fan service and the light nature of the game is perfect for a anniversary game thanks for the review mana khemia bois where we at theres at least one other out there yeah i find it very interesting how some of the gameplay loops are similar to darkest dungeon of all things ancient power seeker so its basically waifu vergil yo sophie this game sounds legit what kind of loving parents named their daughter flea atelier dark cloud yes please they actually gave you for review niiice i am so jealous of your voice its so cute fits so well with the game youre reviewing thank you for the detailed and informed review will you ever do videos on the legend of heroes series so i like city builders and anime but i have never play any of the other games not the biggest fan of turn based combat would you still recommend hey are you going to play final fantasy 14 so you can play the nier automata raids they will add to the game p thoughts on persona 5 omg ive missed this intro d a fanservice game isnt a bad think i love the atelier games but i dont like city simulator so probably i will skip it getting out of real work to do fake work sounds exciting if im new to the franchise but enjoy games like ffcc my life as a king do you think ill enjoy this game also congrats on the 150k subs ive always meant to get into one of these games i love the designs of them and this looks like a great love letter to fans please review the trails of cold steel decisive edition i like playing it on the switch but i cant imagine putting it on a big screen its got that i could put this down anytime but i just wanna doone moreturn appeal on handheld for sure gonna buy this at some point cant wait for atelier lulua is atelier lydie suelle any good id like to try it but i dunno to be honest them acknowledging mana khemia makes me want to buy this alone mana khemia 1 was the very first rpg i played to completion and its characters are ingrained in my heart for that reason oh god its like a review tutorial and ad at the same time holly nelke has some quite large assets i am a simple man i am interested mana khemia kind of look battle system i was waiting the little toy sound of the valkyrie ventures in the intro totally forget of the original intro saw a like 20 mim ad for this game befor the mha movie in cinmema might actually check out this game ive never played any of the atelier games but ive watched your atelier videos almost exclusively because of your love of them how much you enjoy them really comes across through your excitement and knowledge there are two things that may sway me into trying this one out 1 city building and 2 the plethora of cute girls xd am i the only one that thinks this concept would work better on a mobile game im really happy with this title mainly because i like city builder games is wilbell there shes one of my faves i gotta say waking up and hearing your voice really makes my day creepy i know but meh my wife loves city sims and weve both played at least 1 or 2 atelier games so im definitely gifting this to her ive wanted to get into this series for a while but i have absolutely no idea where to start would you have any recommendations knowing this is a koei tecmo game i cant help but think of this game as atelier empires since theyre the publishers of the warriors franchise ive had my eye on the atelier series for a while im fortunate to learn that youre a fan of the series which of the games do you consider an optimal entry point for someone interested in getting into the game series another game to add to my ever growing list of games to buy the change in gameplay just reminds me of recettears business management and its a nice change of pace still seems fun and oozes the atelier style so will probably get it eventually good review im looking forward to my limited edition to come in the mail i havent finished any of new atelier games last one in the series i finished was atelier annie or mana khemia i love this spinoff so much nostalgia of characters and city management which i love honestly this is a perfect atelier game for me sophie will you review crystar when it comes out it kinda seems like your style i get dark cloud 1 vibes from this game i love dark cloud on ps2 so much congratz on getting the game before release date that is super awesome i just recently picked up atelier sophie after enough thinking and with help from your vids i really liked the art style of the mysterious series so i wanted to start there im really loving it so far im addicted to mixing things i dont think this game in the video is quite for me yet i would like it to be because it looks like fun too but id want to play the games and know the characters more probably gonna go for the dusk series next definitely gonna give it a goit looks fun 3 u this actually sounds like so much fun o i was just looking for a good review of this game when this came up in subs 3 thank you also i am biased i really like sophie and wanted to see more of her thanks for the review i keep hoping to find an atelier game that will appeal to me because i like the aesthetic but i cant seem to get into it side note as an animator those 3d animations are pretty jarring in an otherwise goodlooking game matching the floor movement with the static walking animation is basics your videos about nierautomata made me so curious that finally i bought it and wow i love this game so much thank you really i mean its one of the best and emotional game i ever played wow more escha and logy content mi likey this is world of final fantasy for atelier i want to play this game if only for the outfit designs lol this all looks so pretty am i the only one that feels this game is a mobile game sold for full price what about someone whos never played but is intrested in the series i was scared to try the atelier series i thought they were too wholesome and tame for me then i tried atelier sophie spend 8h min maxing a single piece of armor went on to obliterate foes who gave me trouble before and got some serious fullmetal alchemist vibes all in all a great time if the city building aspects are as intricate as alchemy was this will be a blast oh my so great i cant wait to play this next one in the series wait a minutesince when alchemist cant synth if they dont get the materials delivered to them every game as alchemists we have to gather them lol okay okay i guess since this game d i will really love to have so many familiar faces together btw ill play anything that has firis or meruru in it lol city sim atelier take my damn money its real a t e l i e r hours who up i cant believe that it has been 2 years ago since i first saw your video on drakengard and nier the content has always been great sophie thank you so much 3 just with i could actually play it congrats on 150k sophie you earned it wonderful review however i always thought the r in atelier is supposed to be silent loved your cameo on indeimauss video reincarnated in a world with other cute anime girls and trying to run a city and find a fucking tree the game yo koei tecmo fuck my life up and give me a mobile version of nelke fam also congrats on 150000 valk atelier tycoon moon city of alchemy wow this is a better version of animal crossing 3 and they said the marvel cinematic universe was the most ambitious crossover ever anywho nice review looks like a game i might need to check out this looks like such a wholesome game shit i gotta get into ateiler i just havent gotten around to it neither has my money yay i enjoy these xd you really got me hooked on the atelier series im playing through totori right now and excited for lulua to come out thanks for introducing me to these games love your videos heya aurora im an avid jrpg fan been thinking about giving the atelier series a chance i got switch no ps4 do you think lydie suelle is a good way to get familiar with the series also nice reviews and i enjoy listening to your voice its really nice been waiting to see what you thought cute game when is the q a soon good review i may try it but since i havent played that kind of games before idk sounds like its trying to be nino kuni and now the day is better and brighter is this a full metal alchemist spin off lol a reminder for me to get back and finish atelier sophie the waifu 3 would you say this game gives a decent impression of the characters that show up like if i were to play it without having played the other games in the series would this give me a solid look into their personalities and who they are ive been interested in the series thanks to your videos and it being on the switch has made it fairly accessible to me so i was curious i really wish all the atelier games were in englishor i knew how to read japanese i want to play through all of them i really wish all the atelier games were in englishor i knew how to read japanese i want to play through all of them its been 34 months since i played my first atelier game and since then ive gotten through 4 of the games and counting im absolutely in love with the series and will consume more atelier in a heartbeat what i mean to say is thank you sophie for showing me the true way this actually looks fun that maid is very cute too sophie you are real fast with that review game got released just yesterday nice review thanks for giving the atelier series some spotlight man your opening is so peaceful whats that song called never played a atelier game before but might pick this up i have always been interested in the games so getting to meet characters from all the games feels like it could be a nice way to decide what games to start with thanks for the vid dad wheres my homie raze the 411 thatsretro congrats on 150k subscribers i got here on 100k and i can say that it is an honor being one of your subscribers wow they butchered totori and merurus model still im glad that we get to see almost all charactersnpcs in previous atelier games im a huge atelier fan and have played literally every version of atelier games since rorona original plus and deluxe and am looking forward to nelke despite knowing its deviation from ateliers standard synthesisexploration cycle but after watching your review i think ill wait for awhile before getting it because im not all into the city building aspect of the game at least from what ive seen plus my brain has been stuffed with too much atelier games lately having just finished rorona dx last december totori dx recently and maybe meruru dx somewhere next month i will still most likely get the game together with atelier lulua this coming may really looking forward to this one speaking of familiar tracks i hope they have north wind musette from ayeshas ost i always use that track for any atelier after that lol tr 330 can someone explain to me why vayne aurelius is in the game sure my man card is getting revoked for loving this series you got recognized by the publisher already nice great review i was one of the people curious about the switch up in gameplay theme but im still very intrigued in the game i just wish the steam version had steam cloud enabled 3 good reviewso this game had a rough transition to 3d huh where have i heard that before great video as always i love your channel the way you say nelke calms my mind somehow congrats on 150k subs btw ive only really played mana khemia so this one may not be for me but i enjoyed the review wow hey indeimaus back on the atelier souls games i see i dont care about this game but i liked the video to show support nelke carnation btw 1226 neu boden district new ground district thats just being lazy lolalso what is up with the ingredients randomly using the german name while others are in eng 634 zettelnote 420 eicheoak love your content but this game looks wack lol so this is sim city meets roller coaster tycoon the excitement is shown when you speak of atelier games and its so exciting to watch your content is exciting overall you rock kinda reminds me of kamidori alchemy meister i look forward to hearing all your reviews even when theyre often for titles like this where i never wouldve played on my own or even have heard of otherwise congrats on your 150k we need valkyrie ventures of this sophie is a weeeeeb shot great review i havent played atelier since escha and logy congrats on 150k i decided to give this series a try because of you and i love it thank you atelier hour is my favorite content and congrats to reach 150k sub sophie thanks on spending the time to focus on this modest series when everyone else is talking about sekiro and dmc 5 both good games love this

good d wish i could get into these games thanks again for your videos am i the only one who waits to hear the duck quack and gets disapointed when i dont real soapy hours ooh snap sofie has hit the big time now congrats with 150k subs you deserve it ive been living in my cubicle since last week so ive got some catching up to do thanks for the content do i need to play the other games in this series to know what is going on in the new game the dusk alchemists have arrived i think only atelier iris 3 and mana khemia 2 are the only main atelier series left the main character of atelier ayesha alchemist of dusk ayesha altugle is a kind naive herbalist running her familys secluded workshop after the death of her alchemist grandmother after her sister nios disappearance ayesha struggles to move on with her life during the third anniversary of nios disappearance a figure resembling nio appears at her grave not knowing what is going on a mysterious bypassing alchemist arrives and tells ayesha that nio is still alive and there is still hope to bring her back with this knowledge ayesha sets out on a quest with her pet cow pana to figure out a way to bring back her sister before it is too late the main characters of atelier ayesha alchemists of dusk sky are escha maller and logix logy fiscario escha and logy in japanese is escha to logy escha is a kind cheerful girl that comes from a fam there is another one of this game coming soon the environments look like an early ps2 game everything in this looks cheap and amateur and its supposed to be for the ps4 you can build a fascist state in this game just played it but its boring its simulator game and thats that you can build stores but that goes automaticly mostly and 1 week turn it will take then you can go to find materials which is also very very bad computer makes the walk for you from point a to z and in between you can find materials but also automaticly and maybe a monster or 2 enouncters no normal level up as previous titles no experience points gained from battles this game is like a book game telling it story and all you have to do is press button a on xbox controler to confirm and follow the story yep people they went easy road with this tile i do get it they wanted try something new but whats not broken dont fix it building a town is actually a good idea so you wont be able to get all upgrades that easily but you shouldve been able to have a free roaming in that village like aterlier firis just go forest and collect stuff and let hagel start building to attract people you know be world looks to meh and bland this game is 20 years late lul so how much contents were cut off by koeitecmo to sell them as a dlc iris and khemia characters im sold so let me get this straight gustkoei tecmo we are almost always facing a job crisis voice acting jobs are also very hard to come by so you feel that adding in dubbing even though its generally unused on youtube videos is a worthless expense then you jack up the price on dlc 300 to 600 percent hmm i feel that i shouldnt be paying full price for this game i will but im also only a person who helps pay your bills so i guess i have little value if escha and firis and shalie in there count me in i ask for one thing onlymake an english voice option i know its a jap download but does it gives english as an option at all when speaking i wish gust would return to their roots i loved the atelier iris and ar tonelico series they had depth not really interested in this fanservicey moe stuff it looks like a sailormoon game where are all the men protagonists let me strictly speak and fast for those not understand this is a spin off game for the 20th anniversary of gust for fans if you really want the really main games go search the new trilogy mysterious and the new sequel of arland atelier lulua seriously disappointed on this new series really lame looks terrible i cant justify spending full price on this ill have to pass why did they downgrade the specs i think this was supposed to be a mobile game man the text needs to centering work this looks phoned the fuck in gust needs to cool it with the annual releases and take more time with something that doesnt suck ass whoa whats up with the combat gameplay the animations look kinda stiff and awkward also got this mobile game vibe to it with all the 2dish interface and i cant say that i liked what i saw still thanks for footage though crescent prick what i dont understand is how an anime characters brain is structured inside their head with so such large eyes taking up most of the head what i dont understand is how an anime characters brain is structured inside their head with so such large eyes taking up most of the head looks kind of fun happy they still have a battle mechanic in it not sure about the world building but it might be fun is this a mobile game now im in cant wait for nelke lulua and arland dx boooooring if this is kingdom building i can do that in ni no kuni 2 peace wow i was kind of excited to get a new a atelier game with a town building mechanic like in meruru but this this isnt very interesting gosh that look so lame the texts font and how is it placed leaves a lot to be desired wccftech has enabled weebmode not that i mind holy shit this game is fking expensive o what do you think about the game does it play like a mobile game or is it still fun even if theres no exploration also is the town managementbuilding fun thanks let me know what you think about nelke the legendary alchemists ateliers of the new world im looking more forward to atelier lulua that game looks much better this game is for fans of the series in more ways than you think atelier games have a good dose of time management if you can go through the salburg games and gramnad games you can go through nelke how do you hate time limits but love the arland series as those are waaay more time heavy then say dusk i was extremely disapointed with this how can you make a game like this and mainly focus the building element im getting rid of this game and waiting for atelier lulua if you dont like mana khemia or turn based combat but love the mood and world of atelier games and love city management what would the review 10 be did anyone forget about atelier annie alchemist of sera island on ds i love the atelier games my favorite one is firis i loved the big open world but im going to skip this one i hate city building games nice video but ill have to skip this after hearing the combat was excited at first when i saw the combat cause it reminded me of mana khemia a bit have played dusk arland mysterious anytime you have gotten better with sound mixing in yoir videos i can hear your voice nice and loud thanks for this review i considered buying it but i find it too expensive for what you get and i like that youre saying theyre releasing too many games i feel the same way and i also feel like the quality isnt as good anymore id prefer it if they started truly working on a title with a good plot better graphics and whatnot and only release once every so many years instead of 1 or 2 a year that arent as good doesnt the atelier series have like 17 games out so far seems like their running out of ideas if this game is anything to go by good review as always red nelke the legendary alchemists ateliers of the new world is out on the 26th or 29th of march 2019 depending on your region get your copy here amazon httpsamznto2hzbrp8 aunz httpsbitly2wq1wne japanese audio in switch ver the jokes you put at the beginning of your videos are on always on point man would anyone suggest what platform to play this on i was thinking ps4 because all my other atelier games are on thaat but i think this game might be fun on the swtich wish it was online multiplayer i already know from the start that this is going to be spinoff atelier game and that it doesnt carry its traditional mechanic of synthesis and crafting but either way im a big fan of the series and im really interested to play nelkes simcity atelier game its nice to see one of my favorite characters from the dusk and arland series like totori and ayesha after hearing your review i cant wait to play this game once i get home thanks for the review looks like this was inspired by dark cloud thank goodness for this video i had no idea this was a spinoff thats mainly a town building game this atelier game looks like a mobile is worth to play this cant wait for this game u got my copy this morning and started playing took me a minute to really figure out the mechanics but once i did i really started enjoying it 12 hours in so far and im loving this game definitely a great new addition to my switch catalog thanks for the review jay i was on the fence with this one and i think ill pass and just hang out for atelier lulua its a well written review hope your channel grows gl does this game have a bad ending this doesnt seem like its worth 60 to me i think ill wait for a saletheres other stuff coming out that imo higher priority i have no intrest in this game im just here for support of this channel keep up the good work sounds interesting my fav part of atelier is the tone and i love city builders so civilization but atelier i am sold the game and some free dlc are out on the eshop finish main story research to clear maingame after which you get to play forever but remember to complete the main tasks when they appear i used to buy the atelier games but i fell off anyone here that can tell me how to get the complete series as of now like which games on which systems atelier has charm i thought it was an amalgamation of the lead writers and directors shoving their fists down their throats and throwing the crap that comes up into a computer seriously though this series is awful playing it was like constantly hearing grinding nails on a chalkboard mind you i have given multiple games in the series a chance my copy is in the mail i cant wait cheers for feeding my hype dood didnt expected so complex menagement even after trailers yet still they keep fighting element looks packed d thanks for the review i just got my copy in the mail but have yet to start it looks fun did this just hit the switch i did an atelier search couple weeks ago and and wasnt there i tried the gameit gets really boring further behind decoration items are so awkward to place battles are braindead even to turn 50 i barely do anything to win battles element shard are hard to get thru dispatch u kinda get alot i guess managing every single item u have to create to sell is kinda stupidof course players wanna get the most sales u kinda just pump the best item to sell request are so meaningless atelier should let u handle more alchemist so u dont have to switch to every single buidling everytime still have alot and alot of minor issue tat pile up tat make the game feels bad for me story are kinda worthless u cant check inside the buildings or anything so many stuff tat can be better the game doesnt worth rm 2xx for me really thy could actually add so much more haish kinda dissapointedi like this kinda of gamesso this really make me feel empty nelke and lotos reunion in jp version has dub while we dont have it in eng version am i the only one thinking that this atelier entry fits more in a mobile phone game weird this looks very mobile gacha esque kinda surprised they didnt go that route make it feel like this game suppose to be a mobile game but got something happen so it been cancel map running totally like mobile game and all character from the pastgacha system whos is that man because i love him with all my heart i dunno this seems better than the past several games looks kinda weird compared with the regular titles still will give it a chance battle gameplay need to reduce the ui size that shit is disgusting i really love atelier series 3 not sure about this sidescrolling mobile phone game gosh im really hyped for this one they should have left it the way it was in the previous atelier games this looks annoying but who knows how it would turn out definitely not worth the 60 price tag marie looks fantastic just look at her curves let me strictly speak and fast for those not understand this is a spin off game for the 20th anniversary of gust for fans if you really want the really main games go search the new trilogy mysterious and the new sequel of arland atelier lulua why its gotta be all women characters damn it i love women but not like this where are all the men protagonists ill pretend that this does not exist definitely a step back this battle system is ok but i still think mana khemia 2 had the best battle system in the series i like how everyones crying wuh weh it looks like a mobile game yes morons its designed for a portable console the nintendo switch oh limited move sets again hmm the alchemists act on their own looks like you cant direct their actions i like this combat system its faster than the traditional series the gameplay is nice fit for nintendo switch the arland trio is finally here i played the games in japanese so they all have the same japanese vas they didnt mention coming from another world so i wonder if they are from the same world i have noticed that the character models for the character resemble their models from the first game they were introduced instead of the character model they had in the latest game they showed up in it makes all the characters looks so young even though rorona should be in her twenties having a student who has a student herself you already know some of these characters but i am still going to introduce them for anyone else that may read these comments and maybe a refresher the main character of atelier rorona alchemsit of arland rorolina rorona frixell works for the alchemist astrid zexis to repay her for giving her parents medicine when they were sick business is slow astrid refuses to help the people of arls for personal reasons and she doesnt really teach rorona anyt im not surprised she used a sword nobles like fencing after all good one the blue slime is called blue puni which i think is the weakest monster in every atelier game surprising to see them with over 100hp so the hp numbers are probably going to be pretty large in this game marie is called a former dropout because she used to be the worst student in her class on the verge of expulsion her game is about producing results in five years and not failing marie probably sent out a message to someone else in her game who will probably arrive in your village later you look like an atelier character honestly miss lol i havent actually played any of the atelier games heard about them but im enjoying this one so far thanks for streaming this dragon star varnir trailer just drop today i think youll be interested the characters designs of the atelier series look so good they all have such lovely outfits and details put into them lol now i want game with valkyrie aurora dub d cullen what the fuck are you making me read i had to pause the video at 053 when i saw viese iris and lydie in one frame guess ill get nelke just for these 3 whatever lmao logy with the apose got me hahahahahahaha nice vid i think the charm of atelier games is just how casual they can feel they arent the best games around but always provide you with that comfy atelier admosphere we have all come to love all of this is elevated by a wonderous soundtrack which was the very reason im still playing these games and whimsical characters with lovely design and personalities good vid im looking for new jrpgs to play think ill pass on this one but the atelier series seems fun and interesting tfw you watch sophies video which persuades you to buy it while its on the steam summer sale then cullen puts out a video about it the stars are aligning so which atelier game would you recommend to start with i love the atelier series but nelke was the first one i couldnt finish i cant remember what task it was but the required amount of money was two high for me to obtain even after 2 playthroughs maybe im just not good at resource building games i did enjoy the character fanservice though but ill stick with the more traditional atelier titles so happy that we not only got lulua this year but we are also recieving atelier ryza in october holy fuck man theyre shitting those games faster than ubisoft and activision combined with their annual portion of dry out shitty franchises three games this year lulua nelke and ryza what was that at the end that was great i hope you review atelier thighs too once its out that logy apose got me swoonin i dont even know why raze is in this game in the beginning of his game mana khemia 2 he stated that he never had any interest in alchemy also he entered alrevis as student of combat department not alchemy one and then he comes to this game as legendary alchemist perhaps what he experienced in mana khemia 2 is inexplicable to say the least so that he must learned alchemy so hard to satisfy his necessity and then he becomes legendary alchemist ayesha worked as a pharmacist with her late grandfather in a secluded area she only started to properly learn alchemy to save her sister i wonder if her grandfather knew alchemy and only taught her how to make medicine judie is the one who accidentally travels through time apparently in the plus version of roronas game the postgame has totori and meruru time travel back then and rorona has to help get them back to their time from atelier sophie monika ellmenreich is sophies childhood friend she was born to wellrespected family good at studying and talented at fencing she also enjoys singing and is part of the church choir in the mana khemia games you do group synthesis where you partner with your teammates to help you they both have some interesting people in their team sometimes creating some chaos those flowers ayesha mentioned were related to how nio disappeared so you had to go find them all and figure out a way to use them to find nio i remember in manakhemia if vayne ended up with niki before the final boss fight shes like what do you not want to be my husband wellumm oh my god thats it ill drag you back to my village if i have to drag me but thatll hurt then are you going to come obediently and then they end up having like 8 kids how long is a playthrough of this game more long or short im still deciding to buy since its really expensive i want to know if i can invest a decent amount of time in it i love the pic with everyone 3 so please tell me t t how many character can use for battle did vayne can be use on battle i see your emergancy hunt cannot select him xx hey multi teach meh on how to be a popular youtuber like you youve mentioned atelier rorona sp a couple times have you done a play through of it by chance thanks for another video lotos is a tsundere i bet he disguised himself as sotol and acted nice to nelke so she thought sotol was a completely different person interesting a secret promise with pamela the research tree is pretty large leveling your relationship levels with alchemists and gathering the required materials seems like it will be a hassle later lilies mentor drnie dornier becomes headmaster and their apprentices ingrid and hermina rivals that are both child prodigies one of which you choose to mentor as lilie the other will be mentored by drnie become teachers of the academy ingrid teaches both marie and elie at separate times hermina was travelling during maries time at the academy but when she comes back she teaches elies rival eiser i dont think marie or elie ever become teachers no dub well no buy then haha seriously system and gameplay are good its a good game if you like that characters and relaxedsimple story hey unbox area 51 for the playstation 2 and the xbox i miss the times when these games were funnowdays kt releases one every year it looks like all the special buildings only give bonuses to your town sales productivity alchemy success rate etc from atelier sophie corneria is an alchemist with only the power to duplicate manmade objects she cant create things from scratch and her power comes at the cost of temporarily shortening her height she is kind and has a fondness for milk since her mother wont tell her anything about her father she plans on making her shop famous enough to reach her fathers ears she returns in atelier lydie suelle where she is the manager of the corneria company and she eventually finds her father fairies are a recurring race in the earlier atelier games they generally live in the fairy forest and in some games help out with alchemy seeing klein and lita sure brings back memories i loved atelier iris still have my copy of it i dont think there is a floating city in atelier escha logy but there are the floating ruins that they mentioned there is an area call the sand sea in atelier shallie so they use ships to travel on it the puppet girl in atelier rorona is lionela heinze there was different puppeteer fritz weissberg in atelier sophie then you meet his daughter drossel in atelier firis and lastly his wife grace in atelier lydie suelle they can all puppeteer another disaster hits the town ah well money fixes everything from atelier shallie rosemia is a calm mysterious woman who wanders the dusk sea as a collector she buries the dead collects their belongings and even takes anyone in need back to the city on her ship her personality makes it hard to tell what she is thinking it is later revealed that she is actually a longliving witch that gave up her magic operation lotos reinstatement has commenced this is on the switch too wowummhuh i was interested in the game and nowimnot this game is sucki dont know why thay are not make the game like 3 first game of this serie this looks like a dumbed down mobile game but its atelier and i get to see all my favs so im still getting it 3 koei tecmos pricing is going to be brutal though looking forward to all the chests what is this you know the term pissnelke research is a lot less bookish than i expected no joke i checked to see if this was a mobile game this is the worst trailer lmao from mana khemia isolde schelling is a graduate of alrevis academy alongside classmates zeppel kriever and theofratus aurelius vaynes father she is currently a teacher at alrevis academy she has a cold personality and gives out harder assignments than other teachers from atelier ayesha harry olson is a wealthy man who is the owner of the black cats path he has a great interesting in history and relics that he writes books and organizes the treasure trove hunt where contestants compete with bringing the rarest relic he later goes travelling for relics with leyfer luckberry isolde was in love with vaynes father but he never responded to her feelings and she ends up being pretty antagonistic of vayne when he enrolls at alrevisduring the game she ends up badly injuring vaynes love interest to force him to show her what he can really do her boss fight theme nefertiti is one of the best in the franchise remember when you played drowning i think you got the bad ending in which you die theres another ending where the voice says why didnt you do it so they went from the first five games which werent localized to the latest three the mysterious trilogy all at once the main character of atelier sophie the alchemist of the mysterious book sophie neuenmuller wants to become an alchemist that can be relied upon like her late grandmother after finally making a good batch of medicine she writes the recipe into one of her grandmothers reference books the book comes to life and introduces herself as plachta who has lost her memories sophie sets out to restore plachtas memories by writing more and more recipes into her the main character of atelier firis the alchemist of the mysterious journey firis mistlud initially work as a miner inside a mountain town and has an ability for finding ore she befriends the visiting sophie and plachta and learns alchemy her parents allow her to journey outside on the condition that she must pass the alchemy exam in reisenberg in one year or she has to return home the main charac like the thumb if you love ps4 nice one isnt it a bit late for april fools sony this game released on friday in europe its a bit late for a launch trailer plz tell me youre going to do a play through of dragon quest builders 2 seeing all the things that went on with vayne in this episode i feel almost bad that i havent played any of the atelier games past mana khemia 1 and 2 i have to imagine that the other characters are also treated really well if you know them from their source series since i wasnt imagining theyd have that subtle nod to vaynes whole struggle with his own humanity in that dialogue with pepperoni side note he makes a great teacher too all hail the beer kingdom youre not boring for not drinking much there are benefits my town almost met an early demise due to beer being our bestok fine our only commodity poor decisions left us poor the town building and management looks nice so far hopefully it doesnt get too complex when you have dozens of alchemists to control after looking elie up she is the protagonist of atelier elie alchemist of salburg 2 the second game which also was japan only she is saved by marie and then decides to follow in her footsteps and goes to the academy where marie graduated i guess this game takes place after elies game i wonder who will be next to show up according to the weekly report you already have 70 people a 10 increase from the previous week 100 shouldnt be a problem i wonder how large that number is going to get i didnt think i will see vayne again why this game like a mobile game system i love atelier series but this game for me really suck i think it sounds like ahteriye in the japanese romaji so i say it like that in my head in french its more like ahteyieh i think but i sometimes say ahteliyer which is how many english speakers understand it i like your pleasant vibe and narration style have subbed and look forward to your future playthroughs i just got this game today ok i finally got this game tuesday and blitzed through as much as i could looking at the titles of your episodes i think i can watch all of them and not worry about spoilers you want more of pamelas creepy teddy bear in the ps2 game mana khemia she was a party member and the bear attacked at her direction that was actually my favorite game in the series although i should amend my previous statement i was counting the previous games with western release only the first round of alchemists were from games not released outside of japan the group with twins is from the most recent trilogy though what is the anime that you mentioned you watch about a girl move and develop the town do you remember the title i would love to watch them nice miss this was the other brand new game huh i remember the atelier series is this a big rpg like dragon quest k and l wuuuut it feels like its got a very french feel to it ah the scenes like tales of vesperia i know youre a big fan of anime miss i always wondered do you know any japanese maybe some phrases this is very cute right up your alley miss interesting that that an atelier game has a nonalchemist as a main character cant wait to see what type of town you build hagel boldness and pamela ibis are recurring characters in the atelier series so they are probably not the same as the arland series versions hagel sounds like hage which means bald his last name boldness sounds like baldness my favorite pamela is from mana khemia where she is a playable character that attacks with her teddy bear i keep missing your streams xd nice one aaahhhhhhh omgilovethesegames just for playing this you get a like and i will be back to actually watch this after i get my hands on it i believe that there are 15 games before this with western releases and i have all of them i am soooooo looking forward to seeing old favorite characters in a new setting i like this game its interesting to watch you play it awe multi i was late to your stream and you ended so soon after i came to stream i love you multi i heard of this game just have not played any of this series yet would it be okay to ask for a video or videos showcasing the story of king ares welcome house noir yeux noire and surge concerto ciel nosurge dlc characters i cant find videos of them anywhere well i hate that they didnt give many voicing unto those conversation please tell me how to 9999 all element this will be a game bro this game they want make hardcore need to start all over again because of one quest this is so bad the buliding effect within town and means what whole sector or just the within the squard only if you fail a main task is not game over im at a task were it ask me to build large buildings but i dont have any or wich ones are large instead of experiencing through video first i should go to my mailbox to get the game lol its only the first hour and i gotta support a friend on youtube through watching the videos right hello multi i dare you to play subnautica if you can its a scary game and if you dont like deep sea creatures then ya done from atelier iris 2 azoth of destiny viese and felt blanchimont are two unrelated orphans raised as alchemistsintraining in eden the iris that viese mentioned is the titular character of atelier iris 1 and 2 but not 3 chosen by the azure azoth the legendary sword felt pulled it out left eden for belkhyde to destroy the crimson azoth felt has a strong sense of justice and recruits many to his cause viese stays behind in eden and synthesizes items for felt which can be given through the share rings which allow them to send things to each other during the game viese meets and becomes the guardian of a mysterious girl named iris roronas favorite snack is pies so i bet she will be the one to unlock a pie shop it is nice that they are mentioning that hagel and pamela are recurring characters throughout the atelier series i dont know what judie was trying to hide it looked like pamela was going to say all the different pamelas are actually the same pamela is this game fun oh hello im new to watching your videos i also know nothing of anime lol here is a video game series i recommend you imma explain a little about it hyperdimension neptunia is a roleplaying game produced by compile heart the series takes place in a world known as a gamindustri which parodies the reallife gaming industry the franchise follows characters that act as the representations of gaming consoles gaming companies and even games themselves the first installment of the hyperdimension neptunia franchise follows the story of neptune who has become an amnesiac after being defeated by the other console patron units cpus in a 3on1 match and being banished from celestia to the world below i love these types of rpgs thanks for all the awesome content my friend keep up the good work judith volltone is the main protagonist of atelier judie alchemist of gramnad the fourth atelier game so still in order a traveler requests judie to make a dragon hourglass in the atelier she inherited from her parents so many orphan alchemists but she makes a mistake and is taken 200 years into the future her game is about remaking the dragon hourglass to return home and repaying a loan she takes in the future so that she build a workshop bah didnt hear about this missed it shallotte wants to have a flying broom after seeing the witch wilbell fly on hers unable to use magic shallotte makes the flying board to fly instead explosions are pretty normal for alchemists in these games raze and ulrika have never gotten along from the very the moment they met totori the dragon slayer anyone else annoyed at the lack of viese during the scene where they show a lot of past characters ugh i hope it doesnt lag i hate games the drop below 30fps i already hate 30fps as it is so is this an actual rpg or city simulator that silky smooth animation for escha at 026 is this one the 2018 entry im allready seeing the dlc in this one what is this about exactly didnt the last atelier just came out not that long ago from atelier ayesha keithgriff hazeldine is a wandering alchemist that ayesha met and gave her a few hints on how to save her sister nio he is a class 1 wanted criminal because he destroyed all traces of alchemy where he lived because he felt the other alchemists werent willing to unravel alchemys true potential he loves reading and hates to be interrupted he is searching for a way to end the dusk and he generally doesnt do things that dont benefit him at the end of the true ending he becomes ayeshas master and travels with her and the automaton odelia although it is a similar shape and color to the pendant around her neck the green mana stone egg it is beside her left hip so not shown during this conversation is much bigger and ulrika uses it as her weapon it is kinda weird that it retains its shape even after uryu has already hatched from it imagined if that giant liquor barrel broke and all the alcohol flooded the town the crystal monument is cool i just listen to your intro and a laugh then i click away am i wierd this game is very rewarding and exciting for big fans of atelier as long as you know what you are getting into before playing i love the crossovers and dialogue between the different atelier characters its wholesome has all of the atelier charm and the town building itself is very fun to get into the combat and alchemy are put on the side this time which i think is fine enough it wasnt the focus this time its a simple town management simulator with all your favorite atelier girls and even guys i havent played this one so i didnt know what to expect butthis review really surprised me i knew you were a gamer who usually enjoyed the atelier titles so to see this was kind of a shock there were moments i could almost feel the disappointment it was so strong my jaw actually dropped when you gave it your score oo im sure youll have people who disagree with what you said much like with fallout 76 you kind of found yourself opposite the majority but you did an excellent job explaining why you didnt enjoy it and what the game did wrong i respect that youre willing to be completely honest in your videos it speaks volumes for you as a person and as a gamer very childish review tbh thanks for the warning i was thinking of buying this thanks for the heads up i know like phone game xdatleast have mana khemia and 2 than find out vayne is not playable t t saddddd thank you for this review i just got my switch lite on launch date and i love rpgs i was looking into all the atelier games and added this one to my wish list but i deleted it once i saw your review because i saw it is not my type of game lol im not into building games anywhoo thanks completely disagree while its drastically different from the other atelier games its definitely not a bad game ive been playing for about 8 hours and its super addictive for me was a breath of fresh air from the usual samey rpg i wonder if she has played a visual novelsim game soooo glad i watched this was literally choosing between this one another one lol thanks for saving me from blowing 60 ill w8 for the cool 3d one coming in 2020 i have to say this video is well made i dont plan to get this game but you get a like for the video itself and also for being brave enough to upload this video great review i jumped into this knowing nothing thinking this might be the og 20 anniversary or something 30 min in i noticed that im not controlling or moving my characters and then i knew this is a smurf village kinda game l liked the ps4 ones better i played this one too and it was really bad the others were really fun so i was surprised how awful this one was great reviews btw they did state up front that this was going to be a 20th anniversary city building spinoff i do agree this could have been better could have been more in depth better explorationcombat instead of whole walk in straight line with no input crap dialogues are nothing to write home about i would describe them as empty twaddle so far i found this game ok maybe i just enjoy these builders not the worst not the best just cram a bunch of past faces into one game type of game definitely should have been 2030 dollar title not full price though for anniversary i could maybe see why they hiked up the tag it definitely could fit well into the mobage market yeah looks like a free to play mobile game in this game you watch the characters walk and wa oh hey you can watch them run too this was a bit harsh but i didnt give a thumb down because you still like the other atelier games and you are an attractive woman definitely a spinoff for me and while not bad its not great either it definitely didnt deserve the 5999 price tag this game would have been better as mobile game because town building sim is not what atelier is about you saved my money congrats the worst atelier of game i have played and finished all atelier games from ps2 till ps4 and i am waiting for the new game atelier lulua yes i agree with you this is trash quiet sad i was somewhat excited about this game but when i saw the battle system and also the time limit for a simulation game hope they try to improve this and make it work it could really work i guess be kind of a unique game im willing to bet this is an over exaggeration damn fell for the clickbait sorry just didnt enjoy this review i appreciate that you showed how you really feel about the game but i truly doubt it is anywhere near the worst game on the switch lol i understand that the game didnt meet your expectations but to give it a 1 out of 10 is just being childish your review was too biased because of the fact that you feel like you got fooled based on your review alone i think a four or five is more appropriate based on what ive seen from others the game looks like a six or so depending on ones interests fans of the series might enjoy seeing their favorite characters converse with one another they might enjoy the new models for the older chatacters but ultimately this game is a spinoff thats more actual fanservice not the pervy kind than anything else thank you for voicing your uninformed opinion on this game i like to know which reviewers to blockfilter out and this makes it easy someone who doesnt do their homework opinion not needed because its a knee jerk reaction not an actual opinion this game is a big pass so we need to wait for altelier lulua i had never played an atelier game before this looked cool i hated it 60 usd i am so bummed that this sucked so bad going into this game actually knowing what to expect from this game i found it quite enjoyable poured 15 hours into it in the first couple days can you review legend of heroes cold steel its not that bad and worst is not the suitable title the game really isnt that bad its different for sure but it is a spinoff i agree that the price tag is way too high for what it is though the art is fantastic and its great seeing all the characters from the atelier games come together there is a little more to the story than described you forgot to mention that nelke is looking for powerful relics on the side too and i believe shes also looking for a way to send the characters from the other worlds back home shes also looking for her missing childhood friend sotol there are a few things going on here that you overlooked xd while it is primarily a menu game it can actually be addicting as you progress more recipes and things to build unlock and there are subquests and plenty of things to explore and do i personally think that this would be a great game to get when its on sale or the price drops a little i have been enjoying it so far d im sorry but clearly this games target market is not you as the anniversary spin off of the atelier series the target market are clearly the atelier fans that bought this game fully knowing what it was before dropping that price tag personally i really enjoyed the new things they are trying in this game and the great fan service with the returning alchemists i cant wait for the next atelier game in july did you ever watch a trailer seems like it is your own damn fault for having expectations this game would never meet besides it works best as a switch game in handheld mode girl you shouldnt review games im out of here this game does not come as a new atelier game because is not even called atelier nelke and they said countless of times this is a spin off so you cant review this game as an rpg atelier game i thought god of war is a puzzle game it is not therefore it is worst game ever i am a good reviewer i understand your sentiment but sometimes we need to toned down with some graphical gameplay and try to play with different perspective though well of course this is just a spinoff they wont bother to spend much effort to make a full scale version thank you i thought the same watching gameplays before buy it now watching your review i see i wasnt mistaken with my impression its a fucking bad sim city with atelier skin had to do some research on this one before i decided that it wasnt for me sounds lame to me thanks for saving me money i even watch apps and make sure that i can control my character wow they had the means to do such a huge game but this one is only a money grabber indeed disapointing nelke is the german name of the flower clove is that relevant in any way in the game great review by the way will avoid at all cost picked up for 30 on ebay after using a gift card i had i love building simulator games and games like civilization im looking forward to the upcoming reviews for atelier ive never played them so im curious to maybe check them out you burned this one well judging a game for what it was intended to be is not fair its not like they never let us know what it was like you had a different idea of the game but honestly thats your fault its a different style of game that does not make it bad however yes i do agree it is more a mobile game hey their ircha last time i asked you to review everybodys golf ps 4 you laughted no i m just a little disappointed that you choose to review this junk then what i asked i am saying with all the respect thanks ill stay away from it i have the ps3 collection still havent got around playing them i will eventually you didnt know what are you expecting they show many trailers and gameplay with the concept and mechanic its your fault expect wrong thinks dont worry about the defenders of atelier you have valid criticisms the atelier fanbase is among the worst well nis fans in general they will always defend their weeb games even though theyve been recycling the same thing since the start of the ps3 you shouldnt go into this game thinking its a main series one its a spin off its called a spinoff should also have known that though i mean if you know atelier games that much owo but i have to disagree the town building is kind of fun anyway the next atelier game goes back to the arland series where the main character is roronas daughter owo im a huge atelier fan and maybe its just because i didnt make the mistake of thinking it was main stream but im actually enjoying it as a side game its neat to see everyone again this however isint nearly as great as the main games but im super enjoying having a different game if you can even call it a game i do agree on how it should be a mobile game as its extremely menu heavy and investigations are automatic didnt like that a female thinks she knows what shes talking about lol i mean i feel like its kinda your fault for expecting something the game wasnt the title isnt atelier nelke the legendary alchemists its nelke the legendary alchemists ateliers of the new world the word atelier isnt given focus in the title because its a special anniversary spin off it goes without saying it will be disappointing if you go into it expecting a traditional atelier i remember why i purchase shining resonance refrain because i was listening star ocean remix theme and reading comment until someone mentioned tales ofstar ocean and shining resonance are in between similar rpg then i started to watch gameplays from that shining resonance refrain and i downloaded the demo version on my switch shortly after black friday from 2018 i got the ps4 version and a week later the switch version and i was wrong about shining resonance refrain from switch is a fully 100 physical game card so no worries xd thank you for covering this ircha while i dont agree with your criticisms and overall opinion of the game i appreciate the content and enjoyed listening to this review so you buy the game without seeing before hand that its more of a city building 20th anniversary special yet proceed to bash it and give it a pathetic score whos at fault here the uninformed or the game everyones entitled to an opinion not everyone will like it meruru had a similar reaction with people but talking down about the game and acting like the devs came round and shat on your cat is pretty poor if trying to deliver an unbiased or fair reviewopinion as i said it seems the majority of the negativity is due to you presuming the game was going to be something it isnt and then having a strop about it when it turns out to be different hopefully fans of the series dont see this review and get put off from trying it out because of your reaction to the game thats a shame lydie and suelle was really fun how is this a full priced game but this is not a main atelier game of course it wouls not be the same xd shit i was looking forward to this like you i would have been so disappointed thank you for the honest review i bought lydie suelle but i havent gone into it much only played for an hour and got distracted by something else i didnt enjoy the gameplay but i thought the characters were cute and i enjoyed their interaction with dummy daddy the world was pretty too im sure it gets better ill pick it up again in a couple of years when i finish playing the other 17976442 games in my backlog never seen you like this lol this game seem like shit i can taste your disappointment ive never looked at this series before probally wont bu anything 4 da switch till mario maker 2 i want to tourture my friends and love building levels you cant convince me this game wasnt halfassed great video have you played my time at portia i know right those games are retarded d haha but i seen you were streaming and you were looking like were pissed like you were going to shoot lasers from your eyeballs so its a another shitty iphone game on switch whomp whomp hey irene loved the video are you planning on playingreviewing octopath traveler at any point i think you would really enjoy it dont worry be happy good to have you back matey shame about the game looking forward to my timeat portia its a anniversary spinoff that is also the reason why the game title is not atelier nelke the legendary alchemists but nelke the legendary alchemists the real atelier come out in may atelier lulua boy this game looks so lifeless stalking walking people simulator would be a better title for this game xd you need yoshis crafted world ircha the atelier authority i bought fate extella link instead this game because i dont like this game style it looks like mobile game not an atelier game i like this game its a spin off fan service game the real next atelier game comes out in may i appreciate your honesty but i disagree im having fun with it as a long time fan its a fun relaxing game to me if it were not a spinoff title then i would be disappointed but i already knew all about the game when i preordered it anyway thanks for the review i still love your channel but i think this games fun im glad youre back totally agreed disgrace for atelier series oh no i was looking forward to playing this later todaybut now i dont think i will buy this game since its also quite high priced i thought there would be a real combat sytem like in lydie suelle and that you could walk around with the characters and the city building would be cool toovery disappointing might get one of the older atelier games instead since they only cost half anyway i am glad you are feeling better thank you for saving me money very truthful review just the way i like it huh thats disappointing this one looked interesting too trails of cold steel on ps4 tropico 6 on pc so who needs nelke anyway watched the vid fun as always aaaaand just bought lydie suelle lol d will be my first atelier game 35 is a great price for a physical copy i think hope ill enjoy it im pretty sure this game started off development as a mobile game looks like i wont bother buying this game ever a another huge disappointment in 2019 there are many worse games than this on the switch dont agree with you the game isnt really all that bad some parts maybe addicting especially if youre a diehard atelier fan but for 50 dollars youll better be off waiting for atelier lulua nelke should be something within the 20 dollar price tag because for 50 dollars it would have to be something above simcity and there should be more interaction involving the main character nelke if only atelier can come up with an idea thats pretty similar to animal crossing but with their own twist ill be letting nelke off the hook for now but if theyre making another spinoff game it should be worth the price tag a diehard atelier fancasual gamer is paying for why did they release this as physical and not the atelier collection i would spend money on those three games they released it physically in japan thank you ircha i was wondering if i should buy this game now i know better i dont have a switch maybe id get one if it had fair game prices remasters that are almost full game prices and nearly all the games seem to be a higher cost than their counterparts on ps4 and xbox one multiplats if this has changed please let me know so disappointed i usually love those games thank you for the heads up 000 now you know how i felt about kingdom hearts iii this might as well be a mobile game its so simular to them worst game ever bit harsh 1st yes woohoo did vayne can use us battle character there is a free nelke the alchemists theme right now on the playstation if you are interested its super cute d this is the voice for hagel i am familiar with all the way back i think there were even a few clips of his voice in atelier iris 1 on the ps2 the first western release i now want to go play it nice one maybe you should try using a xbox one controller if you using windows they are both made by microsoft and should be compatible httpssupportxboxcomenusxboxonwindowsaccessoriesconnectxboxonecontrollertopc i think hagel and pamelas japanese voice actors are the same as in the previous games eiche is german for oak the blonde girl is marie protagonist of atelier marie the first atelier game which was never localized hiw do you like this so far i was thinking about grabbing this iris and edge from the first atelier series in too wow love your videos im currently playing dragon quest builders and watching your play through with it i was wondering if youve ever heard of or played stardew valley its a pretty awesome game from mana khemia jessica philomele philomel hartung in japanese is vaynes classmate and first friend at alrevis academy when she was young she was afflicted with a deadly disease she was later cured by an alchemist who turned out to be legendary alchemist theofratus aurelius vaynes father but came at the cost of shortening her lifespan despite this she remains optimistic and desires to learn alchemy as a result she is proficient at making medicine and bombs uses a bag as a weapon and is partnered with a mana of wind she can turn enemies into snacks and her skill is onthespot synthesis almost everyone mistreats pepperoni in his game the mystery of pamela continues from atelier rorona sterkenburg sterk cranach was a loyal hardworking knight stationed in arland after arland became a rupublic and knighthood was abolished sterk became a powerful adventurer and a selfproclaimed knight he has great respect for the former king of arland ludwig giov there is 2 games i want badly to come to switch early rune factory 45 it makes for a pretty convoluted timeline when you think about the fact that viese is technically litas grandmother the blanchimont last name was past down to lita from viese and her husband felt also in the first atelier iris game pamela asks you to find her body and after you do theres a scene where delsus asks her if shes going to pass on and accept her death now and pamela tells him nah theres still way too many hot guys left in the world for me to see nelke is so cute the ending is sad nelke faded into obscurity never achieving anything noteworthy the question is do the alchemists make it home and what does lotos do from then on the desserts look delicious of course there are carrots in them viorate is talking about mivis pfalz a cheerful girl who owns a wine storehouse in fassbinder she is a heavy drinker that dreams of discovering a new alcohol so the ghosts were attacking because a stone monument was disturbed they couldnt have found that before having to make the morgen lamp the granzweit tree looks nice being able to control wind sounds like fun looks like your second playthrough is coming along nicely so far good one maybe judie was hiding the fact that she has messed up making the dragon hourglass before and was accidentally sent 200 years into the future to use items you need to use 2 drive points the green dots below the character portrait you gain 1 drive point per turn so you can never use items on a characters first turn schia donnerstages is marie childhood friend that comes from a wealthy family she can be the first party member for marie to recruit for no cost she was born with a weak body and marie has to create an elixir to heal her when schia falls deathly ill first again xd the x2 buff from new game plus it gives x2 of synthesis sales production dispatch it really breaks my heart seeing the beautiful 3d models in the background whenever they go to talk with 2d sprites 1919 intro dialog ends and actual gameplay begins 60 for a mobile game overall the story seems interesting because its an atelier game where the main character isnt an alchemist but the gameplay seems like a mobile game and not a game that should be on any console other then the switch but that is only because the switch can go mobile personally mobile like games arent my thing so i do not think i will be picking up this title i am more interested in the previous atelier games where you do the gathering and exploring yourself not just click a button and you watch them do it if anything i would have much more preferred they just made this into a mobile game because that is what this game feels like im not going to say this isnt an atelier game because it does look like one and the characters seem like they are indeed like what you would see in a atelier game in fact they are from previous atelier games however to me it doesnt seem like an atelier game that i want to play on my ps4 thank you for sharing im very much looking forward to this game town management ok for me but how will others see it 156 vio says ninjin wa seigi which means carrots are justice the star flowers would have to be extremely pretty if i were to think whoa awesome ayesha was the one that worked as a pharmacist and is good at making medicine even with issuing licenses people can still walk into areas they are not suppose to go to in mana khemia you also werent allowed in certain areas until you were a certain year in school it is nice that the campground was built in a more deserted area since it would look weird next to regular buildings do you have any tips or advice on passing task 3 cause i failed twice bro i was stuck into the main from get 1000 person to ure city always fail left 2 or 3 it dont have combat system like before is this an atelier game if so the battle system changed a lot lel the befriender of a book 1st comment can i have my cookie now you unlocked a new area because you reached the end of the previous area if you want to unlock more you may have to try running the annoying lotos has joined the party interesting that his name is sotol backwards it would be funny if he is actually the same person lilie is the main protagonist of atelier lilie alchemist of salburg 3 despite being 3 it is a prequel to the first two lilie creates the alchemist academy that marie and elie go to that is why she is marie and elies amazing forerunner so although she is from the same area she probably isnt from the same time period we seem to be going through the atelier games in order so far the games go not including side games atelier marie elie lilie judie viorate iris iris 2 iris 3 mana khemia mk2 rorona totori meruru ayesha escha logy shallie sophie firis and then lydie suelle lulua probably isnt included

as a guy who grew up in the era of ps2ps3 its very nice to see these old school nonmilitary shooters honestly i like this better than doom as great as doom is its just a maze game these levels look way more interestingly designed and aesthetically pleasing still this game had better atmosphere than all of the new superrealisticgraphics titles have hardcore game so what do you think now that nightdive has updated it several times since the release earlier this month does anyone else think that the well done difficulty in this version is more harder than bloodgdx i was able to beat that game in well done difficulty with ease but this version is just way too hard anybody interested with blood music covers httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4vq5zbuvbhclistpldax7ywj7wvhmselb1yfwdkdzinoa6g3n blood suer pack is still better about 5000 maps but stopped working p and one unit is cool between nblood and bloodgdx which one do you prefer what are the overall pros and cons of using one or the other save files dont work this is fucking trash they really need to remake this next i mean they did shadow warrior doom why not duke nukem and blood ive never played blood so whats all this talk about akward mouselook is it like how in the doom games when you look up and down the screen warped that doesnt really seem like a mouse issue so much as an issue with the games engine you know not being true 3d and all or is it an issue with the mouse input itself like how the mouse feels fucking awful in original quake 2 for example look at this httpswwwmoddbcommodsbloodthecursehunter well i guess theres no point buying it if you have a integrated gpu laptop someone asked in the steam forums for a fix for a texture glitch and they basically said tough luck its laughable that you need a gaming pc to run a dos game httpssteamcommunitycomapp1010750discussions01649918058737843575ctp2 207 pretty sure that sound was used in rise of the triad when you shoot the overpatrol enemies the officers that fire a net gun at you 207 ive heard that sound before you need to pitchfork some cultists could someone please point me in the right direction of nblood port please no cap in my ass god mode lara croft for infinite ammo edit several patches have been released as of now fixing loads of issues however theres still much left to fix specially regarding multiplayer and user made levels hi phone users heres and updated list keep in mind that the list could go on and on and on this port is a mess 0100 there is a lot of missing blood flying particles when i blow up the zombies this used to be satisfying 0100 wrong sprite for midair explosions 0105 whats with all the floating blood 0124 all the voxels are so horizontally stretched i almost cant reach the window with the pitchfork also whats with the wobbling of my char 0207 cultists never make that sound 0240 look at that auto aim sticking my flare into a rat that is impossible in vanilla blood 0326 showing wrong palette swap in the cultist gib animation thx doruk enemy ai doesnt behave propertly at many many levels and situtations its just plainly wrong caleb jumps more than intended caleb jum more things i noticed notice im not exactly complaining but it misses authenticity rats tend to stop while chasing you in og they stop when biting you here they act as if they did when not most enemies stick to a wall while chasing you and run in circles there cultists either take cover or run like madmen all around the place cultist can and sometimes just will chase you until hell freezes in the original they regularly hide somewhere if they cant find you after a while cultist accuracy is perfect and i mean they are flawless in the original shotgun cultist tend to miss if you strafe around and keep moving here they will most certainly gun you down crouching is too inefective to reduce chances of getting hit crouching cultists are still very hard to hit tho not impossible unless crouching too like in the og screen barely turns red when getting shot in the face its not like sometimes it doesnt turn red its been very downgrade to the point i cant recog pagb666 which is the best version do blood to play nblood or bloodgdx i would like to be it a play through on the best version im glad i got this port despite its issues mostly cuz of controller support looks like they still have a few bugs like floating blood but it looks great a lot of the issues are related to dx11 aside from a few issues i think its still a great experience for people many bugs no 4k textures for environment units and weapon it is no sense to make a remake of legendary game in 2019 without described things well good thing i actually skipped that shitty port i bought the game on steam today and there is a really serious problem with it no matter what i do the game crashes when i try to start a new game it plays the fmv intro cutscene fine but the game just crashes when it tries to load can someone please help has anyone else experienced this problem problems will most likely be fixed soon game has only been out for 1 day other than that it looks great i agree its not a good port too bad very disappointing what it looks like for me httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvocunnta3lg lol the music is louder than the sound effects curious as to what the modding community will do for this game good mouse control good to hear i dont know man i think i still prefer bgdx to this dont get me wrong its nice and all that blood got some recognition after all this time but its ugly that a lot of users will know about it with this debatable release its already been confirmed that tons of stuff is plain wrong with fresh supply way more than a youtube comment can summarize and im not only talking about nitpicky stuff but even ugly stuff like stolen voxels bugs bad gameplay accuracy and screwed up ai cultists move and surround you more and shoot less and theyre less spongy too at least the zombies have better path finding or so it seems at first glance sorry but this is a big no for me rolls eyes kinda little late since i pretty much beaten the game over a hundred times just to see how fast i can clear a level and collect secrets i know theres finally a remastered source port but gdx pretty much already fixed everything that the original blood couldnt fix still this pretty much feels like deja vu when you kill the enemies much more noticeable with the flare gun any gruntscream will definitely interrupt the previous sound in other words instead of lets say two audio clips that sound at the same time when someones on fire it burns it burns and the scream that represents their death aahhhh one will stop the other like any snes game this problem with floating blood i only noticed on first map all other maps were ok im on 4 epizode now could you upload what local splitscreen looks like and also if there is local cooperative splitscreen so theres still no way to make a perfect port why couldnt atari gives the source code already anyway ill still pay for this one even if i already own the original and pray theyll fix some of the stuff in it i notice these things and the lack of a groaning nnf noise when humping a wall i am sure these will all be addressed updated and fixed soon enough when the turok 2 remaster came out there were issues as well but they got those fixed i can imagine like usual on their end shit worked but weird bugs and issues and shit goes missing from time to time with releases i havent been truly disappointed by nightdive good stuff on catching all this i played first episode and only noticed a few things that seemed off that being said i feel like the ai of blood has always been off even in the original cultists run against walls with their back to you and zombies just walk off to god knows where unfortunately bloodgdx has performance issues for me so im going to have to stick to this for my blood needs and im not a fan of the renderer used in that i much prefer this look thats closer to the original either way i hope they fix this shit otherwise that is unfortunate i got a discount for having the original gameim gonna buy it having played new vegas for countless hours i can stand a few bugs count me in how you make your game look as clean as that even with most options on mine looks like its running on dos wow you are really fast dude xd for me all of visual bugs like floating blood pools were only in directx11 mode opengl however works perfectly so far blood fresh supply is worth getting for the improved mouselook alone bloodgdx while great for what it is always had really awkward mouselook that didnt feel right fresh supplys mouselook feels leagues better at least imo more i see this is embarrassing considering how much time and money inputted im sure the updates to it canwill be retrofitted to n or gdx nice job getting this transfusion out so quick i am completely and utterly unsurprised that an official rerelease is worse than ridiculously improbable sourceports like gdx and n oh man they forgot the duke nukem 3d style explosion with the dynamite blows up in the air glad to see a true blood fan that knows the game and giving feedback timestamps for mobile 100 missing blood 105 floating blood 124 voxels problem 207 cultist sound error 240 autoaim issue 326 pallete swap issue bloodgdx blood fresh supply well its still 10 hopefully they will fix problems 207 isnt the same sound they made at the beggining of train map so is worth it or would i be better off with nblood or gdx which is probably another topic all together of which is the best since this is literally day 1 im sure that a lot of these should be fixed soon hopefully this is severely disrespectful to blood we waited years for an official rerelease and this is it like the game blood there are a few improvements here and there but i dont think its a major problem as of yet oh my that was fast bloody fast and feels really nice to see the intro as well i do really hope some company or someone could make another blood game for a change such a shame i was looking forward to this port guess ill stick to bloodgdx does it come with coop on top of what you noticed the cultist sounds are off pitch the pitch they have currently is used by the fanatic not the yellow robed cultists they also display wrong colored frames while melting see 326 is this a joke this look s like shit what the hell two people can make their own near perfect ports by themselves referring to gdx and nblood but a whole gamecompany cant xd its nothing gamebreaking then hey guys you can buy the game here httpswwwgogcomgamebloodfreshsupply lol youre not a boomer if youre 30 fuckin sick wish id known about this game as a kid spent a lot of time on doom its neat with the made to order feature it reminds me of silent hill when nitro rad reviewed them and you case change either combat or puzzle difficulty separately like here do you want lots of enemies but the low challenge of lower mods for a fun time of blowing shit up without a care or do you want a special difficulty focused on surviving the enemies rather than mostly duck and cover shooting at cultists like a modern shooter with aim bot enemies im getting tired of these words like boomers and millenials were all fucking born in the second millenia or shortly thereafter you dont call people born in 1400 old schoolers or 100 bc post roman glory nuts what if everyone in the 70s was called a hippie and everyone in the 50s called a greaser and if boomers are the only schmucks that praise blood then who the fuck is the group praising mozart and shakespear ye post liberal neo millenials what generation is monkey island kings quest and day of the tentacle just cause something is superior to modern shit doesnt mean everyone praising it is categorized by some internet slang for old guys calling kids whippersnappers what do you call me then i like lezginka jujitsu uptown funk ievan polkka electro swing and a shit ton of stuff theres no category for it calling someone a specific generation because of their opinion on something from a certain time period is as stupid as brexit calling statistic facts fea i suck at old fps and i quickly gave up on blood the first time i tried it years ago but i decided to give this one a go yesterday and i am glad i did the first level is a pain since you only got a pitchfork a flare with few ammo and dynamite that can easily kill you as much as your enemies and this lackluster arsenal against a bunch of zombies that are not much of a threat but the psychos armed with shotguns and dynamite can kill you in seconds even in the easier difficulties i play it on lightly broiled so yeah the first level is pretty unforgiving but i sucked it up and progressed basically spamming f2 and the farther i got the more i enjoyed it right now i just finished episode 2 and i cant wait to go back home to play the next one there are some really qol changes in this version weapon swap with the mousewheel is pretty good the freemouse look is smooth and when i shoot at something below or above me bullets go where i point unlike before where the real impa the game doesnt show it having online coop in the steam store s i remember when i played blood for the firsttime nostalgia yeah but compared to bloodgdx wich you recommended with your source port video how accurate is it i just want to know if its worth a buy for me since i always appreciated that game and even a slight improvement is worth it to me given that of course i care only about single player and graphics improvements are entirely secondary to authenticity for me heres johnny new sub here have watched your videos forever dont know why i hadnt subd already haha great narration though the video post gmanlives blood may be old but it is still fun to this day i feel that steam and gog have total control of how and if you can play your game they both stopped supporting 1 and 2 of my games if this kex engine really does support linux and this particular game will i be able to play blood fresh supply alone on my linux desktop that all that im asking for nothing more than able to still play the game if i lose 3rd party external support hah i pay for this 10 but it not works via steam then i download nblood and works very well wait the main bad guy is called chernobog was this game made in eastern europe i loved playing blood lan deathmatch back in days and duke nudem 3d too why nobody actually talks about these im sure it is not as fun as it used to be as these were the days when people actually were baited by holodukes and some even played on keyboards but still why does the dbs looks like scouts scattergun blood is such a fucking gem im really curious how is this version of blood different from one unit whole blood childhood memories this was always ma favorite build engine fps and holy hell it still is d what is this 30 year old boomer talk a 30 year old is nothing close to a boomer thats a millennial ok i am 37 years old but in no god damn way am i a boomer i dont know exactly where the cutoff point is but i am nowhere near it i think the mini guys are a reference to army of darkness god i feel like a fuckin idioti passed the first chapter and thought i had beaten the entire game since the credits rolled upturns out it was just the first chapter lol hey gman love your videos and just bought the three build fps musketeers blood duke and shadow i notice you use freelook in blood but not shadow warrior do you use auto aim for them am wondering whats the best way to play cheers fucking loved this game i found out about it because of the bloom trailer it looks like a fun oldschool shooter heres a retrospective i created on blood httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvk6nicm7lbrmt1335s 10 is a great price for this masterpiece they secured the rights is this means we gone see blood 3 or some thing shameless plug for my blood extra crispy mod for bfs httpswwwmoddbcommodsbloodextracrispy incredible gamereview my only gripe is the story is weak i mean u play as a cult member also this never got a console port wat a shame i wish powerslave pc had the attention and recognition it deserves alongside dn3d blood and shadow warrior i know that the game came out with serious flaws such as its obsolete and bad controls even for your time also that it suffered from a low fps made it less attractive to the general public nor does it help the fact that the console versions were more polished and with more advanced mechanics and with a metroid prime map design all that ended up burying the pc version that runs on the build engine the console versions use another engine graphic luckily there is the dehacker patch that modernizes the controls and solves the failures of the strafing autorun toggleable mouse look and higher resolutions along with other failures of the game it is not perfect and does not solve the fps problem but at least it makes the game accessible to the general public until there is a sourcesport something very difficult since it seems that the source code of the game was lost dosbo i remember vhen my father plaied it and i vached it plai it and vhe i plaied it first i vas like vhat tha fucking fuck after all this time i can confirm remaster is still broken so this is an official remaster and it can run mods from the menu sign me up hi nice review i have problems with the graphics with direct 3d and open gl can i run this game with some source port i know some are gonna disagree but it would love to have the build engine games on switch mostly because im not a pc gamer this looks fun as fuck laugh reminds me of jack nicholson a buch of malakas hello greek friend i gave it the 9000th like d hey gman blood is currently being ported again to the doom engine but this time graphics and gameplay has been updated a little bit and it feels awesome its called reblood and you really should check it out httpsforumzdoomorgviewtopicphpf19t64783 put this shit on a physical disc i would definitely buy it i miss this game digital download sucks ass bloodfeaturing the widest train ever what is the name of the music that plays t 740 bunch of malakas i see what you did there download from steam and its good old memories the blood fresh supply runs on 64bit win10 i legitimately got a headache after playing with full 3d aim off ive never had that reaction to any game ever but the warping effect was really that bad game looks awesome any word on ps4 release did they change the way the stone gargoyles work in the original version they cant hit you 99 of the time if youre crouching all you need to do to defeat them when they show up later in the game as regular enemies is stay crouched keep moving around and use the voodoo doll on the one hand theyre quite hard to kill any other way but on the other hand doing it this way always felt cheap btw the life leech in turret mode is the most powerful weapon in the game as i recall it never runs out of ammo and it will eventually kill anything even bosses i think i dropped a couple in the pit with the two cereberus dogs and they easily took care of them i also dropped a couple in tchernobogs temple and lead him to them just for the hell of it i ran inside the room at 657 dropped the life leech and ran out again aaah eeegg aaah i just stood out the door listening while it cleared out the entire room on dos box not on fresh supply i cant get good frames like i put it to memsize 64 but cant get no lag thank you for this great honest professional review had not played this game since i played the shareware version keep up the good work as opposed to shadow warrior where two thirds of the games weapons can be found in the first level cant find this on steam did it ever come out blood is so awesome hd remaster with unreal 3 i have the old version and im glad to see a remaster i love this game in steam theres one unit whole blood and than theres this which do you guys want me to go for 742 is that the robot chicken end theme looks like someone directed their fanboys here the enthusiasm now im pumped to play blood now uhm actually cryptic passage is the 5th chapter and plasma paks post mortem is the 6th btw now july of 2019 fresh supply is kind of repaired not really buggy no freeze no crash no bugged enemies awsom game we need an epic reboot for this game too i didnt even know someone in 2019 will download about blood d all the best games were made 9398 its a fact i hate your accent thus send you to hell civvie11 fans are bottomsuckers from the 3 legendary games duke nukem 3d shadow warrior and blood i find blood the best one and u forget about amazing map editor for this game lern inglish this doom hexen duke nukem 3d and quake 2 are things i grew up with playing and loving every minute had i a pc today i would still be playing these games no blood gdx is really good fresh supply is stale and moldy edit why i catch spelling error now got it for little over 1 on steam sale looked so awesome from your review cant wait to try it out i hope its okay i just bought it because of this video theres even a tommy boy reference with jojo the idiot circus boy okay okay i will go buy it now geez i was sold 3 mins in description of the mission for a duke nukem modmap a life of illusion in versailles unknown russian suburbs the city is gray and miserable desperation is the daily bread for those citizens who are struggling to survive but there is something more sinister going on the recruiters men in suit roaming the streets convincing the young people to be part of the circuit of the versailles elite as they call themselves the recruiters are particularly nasty as they charm the youngster alluring to an incredible life the deal is simple 5 years of luxury life inside a fake versailles enjoying life to the extreme pleasures without working plenty of food and drinks living the life of the richest the fake versailles is composed by a few blocks outside gray and decadent buildings inside the elite has recreated the court of versailles at the time of marie antoniette with huge decorated saloons grand palaces luxury gardens and fountans where the blood was the coolest thats awsome now im waiting for a remaster of chasm the rift black screen every time i try to change any video settings only pc restart makes it go away refunded before even getting to gameplay did you just say 30 year old boomers wrong generationi think you mean gen x or gen y ive also heard people call 30 year olds millenials thats also wrong millenials were born after the year 2000 fucking duh if there was ever a game ive waited yrs for a console port did anybody else make really ducked up levels for blood back in the day 30 year old boomers wat i dont know why every one is saying the game is bad i played my bros original copy for his old pc and it works fine but that was 12 years ago and it was not a port so mabye im not looking at it right what did u even played the damm thing i think this is a review for blood no the port ive owned this game for a long time but ive hardly played it at all because i just couldnt get it working right for me this new version may be just what i need hopefully its a better remaster than shadow warrior classic redux ive still hardly played that game cuz the remaster is still awkward to play 30 year old boomers yeah no 026 malaka in greece means the guy who faps all the time its alright i guess but im looking more forward to some fanmade source ports to be completed like reblood the curse hunter or nblood on the eduke engine etc its still the same old thing and its not absolutely perfect eitherive probably just played way too much of the original i guesskinda meh 30 year old boomers lmfao seriously wow holy shit holy shit this has me so excited i played this against people 20 years ago in microplay in the deathmatch this was always my favorite there was duke nukem and shadow warrior and doom but this was always my fav game out of all of them i agree with people complaining about bugs i bought it and there was so manyy gameplay frustrations that werent in original that i stopped playing it and pretty much forgot about it maybe ill try it later so i have some hope of patched issues 30 year old boomers know what the best game of the time was i havent experienced a single bug in the entire campaign what the hell is everybody talking about is it just me been playing this the past couple of days plays a lot better then the original gog release randy pitchford is that you sooooooooo youre not going to talk about the glitches in the remaster cultists sometimes stop throwing dynamite on lightly broiled well done or extra crispy the disable run glitch option in the settings menu also stops cultists from throwing dynamite enemies that were once weak to fire attacks take longer to immolate fire attacks in general are fucked the game has a chance of crashing when changing render options yeah pretty obvious you reviewed the features and not the actual stability of the remaster granted its been patched since then and continues to be patched and fixed but still the day 1 patch was a buggy mess gmanhill ill be honest fresh supply seems to upgrade the gameplay compared to the horrible original one i only just caught this you mention the higher difficulties being unbalanced but thing is the readme to the original game said that those were made with cooperative play in mindthe developers outright said they shouldnt be played singleplayer on that note you kinda make it sound like coop is new to this remaster when the original game had it too not sure if you never knew that or if its just a bad choice of words but there ya go i totally need to try deathwish cryptic passage is the best you know i am not an extreme fan of blood just a person enjoyed bloodgdx i dont know details but after watching civvies video i think you need to make some explanation about this video about blood remaster i was about to buy blood remaster after seeing your video but decided not after civvies video hey didnt your name used to have more gs in it hm i have the feeling it should be added as a note that this looks more like paid endorsement because thats what this video feels like sonny jim ah yes i also came from civvie 11 who was calling you out on your bullshit dont forget to tell then you cant rekeyboard your controls mouse and keyboards not its a deal breaker i didnt know why u picking up on gman i playied the game since the day he rewied it and its pretty damn good and on well done ive got almost no bugs stop bitching pls and yeah i playied before the patch shillmanlives you know i havent encountered any real massive issues when im playing it im about halfway through the game and it works just fine i dont get it i like how detailed your reviews are getting even down to the coding and software of the game itself your videos are great and theyve jumped in production value over the years tenfold keep up the hard work and great content yo dumbasses in case your blind the footage in this review features the new custom voxels made to order and more so yeah this is the remaster it looks like hes playing the game and not going out of his way to trigger minor glitches so quit your bitching and go dig up early access steam games or just any bethesda title if you wanna see some broken shit can we get this for consoles like i have doom and doom 2 on my xbox am i the only one here played through the game with no big problems only issue i had was the music stopped playing if i diedand thats fixed a few days agoi bought it as soon as it released and played it on both my desktop and laptop for more then 10 hours without crashing or having game breaking bugsits not perfectbut the devs are fixing it and its far from broken for me this review was not accurate at all when it was released now i think it is ive been sucked into this game for 12 hours and i am loving every second of it ive only had a couple glitches and the save function tends to hitch up here and there but otherwise its fine has all the bugs been fixed i had no issues what so ever with this port thanks for the recommendation great killing porn simulator i laugh my ass off at some of the things that are possible in this gamei love it i really enjoyed rise of the triad as well as this i personally enjoyed cryptic passage i really want powerslave exhumed so badly gmanlives ive followed you for years and i think you are an exceptionally great reviewer however while it pains me to say it this video was almost as poorly thought out as your fistful of frags video considering it came out before the patch which fixed a lot of issues i know you hate that review now but this one is possibly even worse with the damage it could have caused its great that some other other well known reviewers took the time to really notice and talk about all the bad parts of the game which nightdive then took to fixing but imagine if you were the only one its likely people would have just taken your word for it and accepted this as an acceptable product which at the time of the review it hardly was im not trying to shit talk you and put you down but i do feel this video was a bit of a strong fuck up and a bit of a disservice to the legacy of blood for you to not even notice the numerous bugs and glitches and stuff to deny literally everyone e did i just get extremely lucky because i bought it day one and i had zero issues with it it ran beautiful and played way better than the old steam version i had played like a dream and i had a blast i honestly didnt have any of the issues mentioned at all people are acting like its the most broken thing ever and im trying to understand why i want blood to get a proper sequel or a remake in ue4 oh my god this is not gggmanlives this some impostor guy i wish they would release this on consoles for people who dont have gaming pcs you literally just reviewed blood whats actually good about the remaster gmanlives i used to be a blood 1 community level designer yesterday i sent an email to your business address hopefully it didnt get caught in a spam filter i bought it on release and didnt experience any glitches aside from floating blood splatters unlike many it seems i have not played the game hundreds of times to know if a zombie moves just a bit too fast or some guy takes one extra shot to kill i dont care about stuff like this the game is fun i didnt experience any issues playing it not sure whats everyones problem i cant speak for the game at launch as i didnt buy it until the patch came out i guess but blood fresh supply has so far worked just fine on my windows 8 laptop i ran into an issue where the exe wouldnt launch on my desktop which is win 7 because it was missing a file dunno if thats the games fault or not im guessing not i played the first 5 maps of episode 1 and the game works fine theres still the issues of difficulty balancing that i recall the gog version having but that was part of the original game for me i hope nightdive continues to support and tweak this because its a really underrated shooter probably my favorite of the build engine games forget the bugs this looks like shit im only here to read what the other civvie fans are saying im pretty surprised its all mostly pretty dang civil way to go internet better gameplay than rage 2 crap thaank you very much good thing the devs are absolute bros and released a huge ass patch with more to come unless you have a time machine and played a future version seemed like you missed quite a few bugs this looks like fortnite ripoff about bloody time finally a proper remaster of the original code blood is still one of my alltime favourite fps games right up there with doom and unreal tournament i love how the younger gamers keep complaining that its too hard yeah thats because its an oldschool 90s game when games were real games tough and demanding bloody brilliant bloody music covered httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4vq5zbuvbhclistpldax7ywj7wvhmselb1yfwdkdzinoa6g3n i really like your relationship with the studio and this obvious shilling great video hack go nightdive too many bugs gliches lazy programming even just some random changes were made compare to the mighty original why cmon man this is not a source port this port is done via nightdives inhouse engine so gdx is still the best way to revisit the original masterpiece i have not seen any bugs yet in my playthrough im not excusing them if they exist but maybe gman just genuinely didnt notice or get them like me saying he was paid by devs is laughable please put this on ps4 yo the game just got patched some issues have been fixed from what i can tell beat the game back in the days on windows 98 back then i could make the mouse work so used the keyboard alone love the new update it crashes the game i was hoping they fix the music cutting off after a re lode but i must be on crack i find it funny that not a single person left a comment about the bugs until civvie made his video its almost like people took a joke too seriously and have no critiques of their own another video where gggmanlives the greatest contrarian shill alive throws his credibility out the window again 3 ads in a 14 minute video is a little much and warrants a downvote nah gonna have to disagree with you man ive had a better time with blood gdx than this its loaded with bugs and crashes alot dont buy this yet its still pink on the inside i smell a paid review here this remaster is so plagued by bugs and glitches that there is no way you could not have noticed at least some of them and yet all you did was praise the game and did not mention a single bug or problem with the game as far as im concerned you have completely destroyed your own credibility with this review already have my copy i remember when the one unit whole blood was super hard to find and i was ecstatic when i finally got a copy now that im all digital im glad this is finally available people need to use occams razor and realize he may not have noticed most of the bugs do not buy this game gggman shills yet again it is bugged broken and absolutely inferior to bloodgdx and nblood which are also far more accurate to the original they really shit the bed with this release wait until its patched or even better use the aforementioned ports for free proof httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvekg29enea httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviarqk5thklu take a shot every time you see civvie mentioned here in comments there you died these guys actually make dark souls fans look nice and civilized blood 2 was my fav game hipefully they remaster that why didnt you point out important issues that needs to be addressed civvies review gives a detailed analysis of those issues unlike you not cool gmanlives good option if you dont have any blood version but if you bought blood on gog or steam years ago then better option is just download bloodgdx never heard of this game til today thanks anon will buy and play i loooooved this game except this one level with some sort of invisible ledge on it it took me forever to find out what to do there this was years before i got online so no search engines for me 30 year old boomers m8 people in their early to mid 30s are millennials despite the word mostly being used to mean kids i dont like dude not to sound like a dick but were you paid by the devs to not note any of the crashes or game breaking glitches in this initial release in your review only pc the game is broken and bloodgdx is better what the fuck are you talking about dude there are so many glitches crashes and bugs that its shameful it was released in this state dude you really just rush out the reviews anymore dont you unsubbed is this a review or an advertisement oh man another awesome night dive port thats great damn my boi civ straight called you out what if i were to take civvies review of blood fresh supply and disguise it as my own opinion like i actually played the remaster ho ho ho ho ho ho delightfully devilish fanboy ive been a fan of your channel since you had barely 1k subs and i really enjoy your content but the f76 review and now this i mean blood is an amazing game but this remaster is far from that right now this is remastered it looks like the same quality as the one i played when i had win95 duke nukem 3d was an okay game but suffered from the failing of most shareware releases of the day only the shareware content was amazing the rest was phoned in garbage shadow warrior and blood are just terrible uses of that same engine putting them on the same level as daikatana just polar opposites whereas daikatana was overly focused on narrative it couldnt deliver on shadow warrior and blood went full throttle on gameplay that they couldnt deliver on and both are steaming piles of inadequacy in a genre filled with countless other amazing titles but i love that you dont realize that makes the world go round and gives me something to laugh at while i eat my lunch d shillmanlives this port is completely fucked at the moment what with all kinds of balance problems bugs and crashes civvie11 got most of them but theres a huge long list of problems that are on the steam forums life leech not working as intended fucking christ i know they are working on updating it but damn i used to like your reviews but youve gone down the shitter here lately and you are acting like a shill you dont even mention a single issue that is so obvious if you actually knew what the fuck you are talking about or played dosblood more than a few minutes to see how fucked this port is the port may of things to fix but the mouse and control feels so good compared to gdx like i cant even play gdx anymore because of how awkward it feels to control compared to fresh supply what are you smoking civvie asked about it he wants to smoke it too guys i absolutely love civvie and yes in this case i value his opinion more than gmans because civvie is the biggest online authority when it comes to blood ports but it doesnt make gmans opinnions invalid i played the game and i did feel the damage was off but overall it is still a good game and the port at least makes it more accessible for the general masses i also trust that nightdive will do their best to iron out the flaws so chill out everyone not everyone can know all the ins and outs of every game hey souhwas the blunt ya smoked before makin this also provided by nightdive this video looks like it got rushed so hard the port itself needs more time im serious though this remaster needs work why did you ignore the obvious problems with the game those rendered cutscenes looks absolutely abysmal but everything else looks sweeet is really good except its fucking not you shill civvie won this one did they pay you for this review fucking shill its a bugridden mess look at this httpswwwmoddbcommodsbloodthecursehunter totally not the definitive version of the game until they fix all innacuracies do not lie in the meantime ill be playing bloodgdx but with default fov and no vertical mouselook since they are limitations of the port i knew i youre wrong in your hdoom review like this this remaster sucks money balls ah yes also gggmanlives hes a complete asskisser and a corporate tool he just writes fakes positive reviews to keep getting review keys and swag from the companies like a complete sellout and to keep his place on the mainstream think you rushed this review out way too early at this point the game is essentially broken warning this review is extremely inaccurate blood fresh supply has a lot of inconsistencies and technical problems at the time of writing with frequent crashing also reported by some ggmans blind praise of this whilst ignoring the issues it has that even things like bloodgdx a reverseengineered community port dont suffer from is extremely suspicious i recommend checking out the steam discussion forums or civ11s small video talking about this port if you dont believe that it suffers from technical problems we can only hope these issues are fixed soon what does he mean by 30 year old boomers the youngest baby boomers are 50 now or does it mean something else its awesome to see an official modern port blood gdx has been my goto for the last couple of years but its not the most stable thing out there looks like someone is getting paid for not talking about the bugs and issues of this port even bloodgdx is better than this remaster apparently a lot of visual and audio bugs and glitches sounds like bloodgdx is much better for now until its fixed civvi 11 called you out i remember playing demo of blood in 1997 wanted full game so badly shit port aussie man bad its broken as fuck the baby boom was 1948 to 1964 so the youngest a boomer can be is 55 that said bloods a bloody good game so us thirty somethings etc will let you off this once xd all i want to do is play blood literally every option has some form of compromise feels bad man watches gmans video seems more like a blood review then a review of the new remastering watches civvies video grabs popcorn and watches comment section hey dude did you even play this remaster civvie sure did prepare to get scheissed on for this review ya know when civvies videos went up i looked right away at gmans comments nothing wrong and no complaints civvie uploads a video and all of a sudden right after that video came out all these blood historians just showed up and decided to say how wrong gman was look the port has issues and to everyone who was here before the civvie review respect but its painfully obvious so many people didnt know anything until civvie droped that vid this port is fucking garbage sonny jim and you should be ashamed of yourself for shilling it go sleep in the road look man i like your content i really really really do but wasnt this just a tiny bit rushed the port is completely full of bugs and the crippling speed at which you released this video kind of proves that you wereworking very quickly to release this again i like your content a lot but the fact that there are so many bugs which are completely glossed over hereitsnot great the port needs more time in the oven and i think that your review needed some more time too at least you get the original dos version bundled in with fresh supply civvies right what the fuck were you smoking subscribed oh the drama gmanlives liked it but civvie said its broken and buggy and crashes sometimes gman must be unreliable quick bring some forks and torches blood is the best fps how does this port run death wish i love that addon its almost as if blood 2 never happened and monolith decided to make the sequel in build instead it reminds me that there is a minecraft version of this game httpswwwplanetminecraftcomprojectbloodepisode2 man you really rushed out this review huh can you atleast do a comment explaining that the game is quite broke and if it has any change on your initial review soon to be review by anita sarkeesian xd you didnt finish the port before making this video did ya its a buggy mess came here after watching civvie call you out cool shill bro i can see that there went a ton of work into the remaster but there are still too many bugs like calebs oneliners sometimes dont appear the tommygun gets too quiet the sound gets weird like a mush and it sounds like everything turned to mono coopplay is not passwordprotected so everyone can join and possibly ruin your game coopbuddies are not shown on the map the game crashes when you change some graphicsoptions well that one was mentioned in the video and firedamage has been obviously nerfed well at least i got it dirtcheap because i already owned blood on steam okay but uhm what about the bugs n glitches that hold the game back a bit bbut they fucked it up the cultist wont trow tnt anymore the fatties are what seems resistant to fire jumping mechanic is improved why u can jump higher now lol civvie fans are invading like a bunch of rabid cerberus ive played it for a while and the game works fine those bugs are really minor and bugs can be fixed how can you ignore all the bugs this remaster currently has well arent you a bullshitter the best thing about this remastered release not epic store exlusive this game is fucked gman its a mess and has balance breaking changes from the original and weird glitches also ive had crashing issues did you even play that much before you uploaded this i mean no offense theres definitely a strong attempt in this remaster but are you even playing the same game as most people the new run glitch removal option somehow causes brown cultists to entirely lose the ability to throw tnt vsync issues are absurd jumps are borked vulkan support is an actual joke crashes the game caleb is too soft fire is far too weak to the point that enemies weak to fire dont die like they should fanatics black cultists have a strange issue where they try to throw tnt but dont even though they never threw tnt this thing is a mess dude come on seriously blood and shadowarrior both feel more like what duke nukem forever could have been and should have been can i get this on steam too bad there are glitches up the ass and its night unplayable on intel graphics card for some reason the port was far from ready for release what about stuff like how fire damage is broken civvie asks what youre smoking wanna comment on that go watch civvies review what you smoking gman i like how this remaster actually supports using the vulkan api not enough games do that yet one of the best i ever played although fps was still crawling back in the day they managed to do something so different at that time with little technology nightdive rocks oh the time with no mouse on fps gamesthis game was amazing does anyone remember endless war 3 and its version of this review mercenaries playground of destruction or at least i want u to say its name in ur accent hm it seems that fresh supply has some minor problems quicksaveload takes too long for a buildgame these days and it has some weird sound and musicglitches on my pc der midisoundtrack doesnt play at all and the cdsoundtrack plays only on the very first level per episode please play boiling point road to hell and red faction guerilla 3 god i was in jr high when this first came out i was absolutely obsessed with it the game was so dark and creepy and even funny it was done just right you can tell the person who was playing the game was playing on a pretty low difficulty 30 year olds arent boomers i still prefer original unmodified blood version that i emulated through dosbox i downloaded it on emuparadise sorry but commercial rerelease this game was total failure it uses dosbox emulator which is freeware and it does not introduce anything new apart from two addons which are not great and change original weapons mechanics in case of shadow warrior at least you can get it for free on steam i mean original version not classic redux my point is that classic games should not be selled with freeware opensource emulators they should be reprogrammed that could be run natively on windows or linux with some tweaks such as mouse aiming another excelent video i love this channel now heres a game that could use the doom 4 treatment dont know what copy of the game you played mate but mine is bugged to hell it crashes and freezes all the time when it really shouldnt back when games had heart blood is the best fps ever doom wait thats illegal what about midi music bought the game after watching your review and i was wondering is there any reason why does the floor feel slippery when you run loved it blood 2 was great too days gone review plz you werent kidding about dying a lot oh god i need to play this again the game freeze when i try to save its crazy that modern games have gotten so bad due to greed we are looking back to these classics now is it worth getting even if you have the original on steam i bought my first copy of doom from a drug store and played blood multiplayer on a 336k dialup modem i dare ya i double dare ya call me boomer one more good damned time tchernobog disemboweled ps blood also introduced me to type o negative for some reason october rust was cross promoted with this game first port that works out on launch for me but still needs patches buying this bad boy it looks great for 5 bucks its more of an update than remaster crash was a remaster does it still have the 2 other dynamites the proximity dynamite and the remote detonation dynamite should i get this or stay with gdx 30 year old boomers maybe this is different in other countries but id assume boomers being like 50 and 60 somethings lol anyways sold on this game which slipped past me back when i was a kid and never did hear about it aside from an odd mention here and there was about to buy on steam then i noticed i had a voucher for it d insta buy i live again is it me or dose anyone else think his voice is calming idk gman i know just the one boomer this first release is so broken and buggy and innaccurate throw any usermap at it with a bit more advanced effects and it goes coocoo in deathwish for instance you cant get past the third level because of a gamebreaking bug this is not blood it needs serious fixing my go to at the moment is gdx or nblood my review of your review you spent too much time over 9 minutes rehashing information covered in previous videos basic info about the game its history etc you spent too little time discussing things like bugs mod compatibility features specific to this version and comparisons to other adaptations like nblood and bloodgdx overall not a very good review its 4 bucks on gog right now very good deal i think i died like 30 times or so on the first level bought serious as could be i want to buy this game for old times sake so this is not too different from blood gdx or im wrong i know something to complain about the fact that blood doesnt get a proper sequel with kickass graphics sort of like the treatment that doom got with its latest installation hey gman so you say in this video this is a proper licensed remaster of the game but ive read or been told that this is basically another fan port like all the other fan ports since the og blood 10 source code will never be released thanks to a couple cunts who have it and wont release it so i am confused if this truly is a real remaster of the og dosbox version of blood or its another fan type port tho done professionally like bloodgdx or something keep on truckin i just played the dos version last month good game though really difficult on harder difficulties still lots of fun dying a lot of times on extra crispy surprised to say i agree with you difficulty level its awesome they included the custom mode cause even on easier modes few cultists can get you down from full health and armor in 2 seconds from what ive read blood strife doom64 and power slave have all been placed onto nightdives kex engine does that mean modders can take assets from each of these games and place them in other ones or is the coding language for each game too different for them to work side by side steam gave me 50 off for some reason fools i was going to buy it regardless not to mention the fact that extra crispy is damn near impossible the texture work reminds me of half life and i absolutely love it garbage port the dos version is way better you forgot to mention the crow reference in e1m1 in the grave it is written draven which is the name of the protagonist of the story played by brandon lee that tragically died during the filming in 1993 hence the tombstone how did my channel die in a day tho i been asking alot of different comment sections lmao theres only one thing more satisfying than shooting a ball of napalm into a group of zombies and that is shooting a bundle of dynamite a cultist has just thrown out of the air having it explode and having it kill all of the surrounding cultists 1350 i like how gman head icon fits on caleb body like a poorly made photoshop nice touch good editing you are crazy this is far from a remaster and its full of glitches its so bad it crashes everytime you try to save there should be a word for that mix is ultra violence and self aware goofiness where is that halo 3 review never played this as sp game always did mp lan party with friends it was hell lot of fun doing it its time to play the sp part of it i guess i saw this review and instantly bought the game i just brought this game and im still seeing the 25d screen warping its not true 3d like in your video am i doing something wrong blood is still my favorite horror shooter of all time seriously 22 years after release no other game has so many and so good horror references and this deep atmosphere the sequel was bad but this original will forever be love blood was brutal before brutal doom became cool just opened steam and found a voucher for this game sitting in my inventoryill be playing this all afternoon cant wait just need a blood 2 remaster why blood didnt get the hd treatment at least officially all those years the answer is at 026 mostly because a bunch of malakes kept holding out over the licensing not many will catch that one but was funny i remember when i was 8 or 9 blood was the game played at internet cafes they were pretty big in postsocialist bulgaria as nobody could afford a pc or games i remember when i was 8 or 9 blood was the game played at internet cafes they were pretty big in postsocialist bulgaria as nobody could afford a pc or games i remember when i was 8 or 9 blood was the game played at internet cafes they were pretty big in postsocialist bulgaria as nobody could afford a pc or games i remember when i was 8 or 9 blood was the game played at internet cafes they were pretty big in postsocialist bulgaria as nobody could afford a pc or games i remember when i was 8 or 9 blood was the game played at internet cafes they were pretty big in postsocialist bulgaria as nobody could afford a pc or games 30 year old boomersdude no one whos 30 is a boomer thanks for the review few questions if you stick around is it stable is there notable changes about the game in this port how does coop work steamworks or on gog too is the experience good is it easy to invite friends play privately no disconnections or crashes thanks i waited for this remaster they really could have redone those cutscenes though theyre the ugliest ive seen in a commercial product and clash heavily with the fantastic ingame graphics when i quicksave it takes like 30 seconds to complete the quicksave why am i the only one having this problem i know you saw this and didnt reply so for the love of god help me because it took 30 seconds for a quicksave please actually using the insult malakes not greek my man my 90s nostalgia boner could shatter stone without a absolutely any hesitation getting this now notgonna lie that army of darkness mirror reference is simply awesome you are very misinformed here it does not use the original source code at all nightdive could not afford the asking price for it which atari wanted just like jace hall couldnt the game was being made with nightdives inhouse kex engine its essentially a remake with original resources nothing speciali cant wait for this mod httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzqk7ptldb8o i bought it and beat well done with ease its an amazing port with some bugs i lost my virginity to the blood cd after this review im ready to lose so much more all over again i bought this today and it is so fucking buggy its unplayable buildgdx and the og dos blood i bought earlier last year still works better this shit broke within minutes of buying greeaaaaat civvie has entered the chat why tf are there not more games being made to old school fps sensebilities and design i got to play this back on windows 98 httpsquasarulasbandcampcomtrackblood my own little tribute to the classic fps the best thing is its finally available in germany after so many years i am more than happy to play it right now i need a reboot for this series 30 year old gamers arent boomers obviously we are the greatest generation 130 centuries thought it was only a couple decades great memories play this play i used to make maps with build both with duke nukem 3d and shadow warrior build was nothing like modern day mapping software but if you had the patience you could make magic with it it also crashed a lot and could ruin maps which is why it always paid to have backups i just wish this game could get a doom 2016 treatment i hope shogo gets this treatment lets not forgot bloodcm i think that was a precursor to bloodgdx the first level of blood has a 2for1 reference at one grave headstones reads eric draven which is the character brandon lee played in the crow and caleb says nevermore when seeing it which references the raven by poe it was at that moment i knew i was really going to enjoy finding secrets in blood i can hear cv11 yelling yeeeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhh from here i never played this and i dont know why it looks fucking savage are you arnolds brother or also just from austria does it have free aim or is it that gay old school type of aiming blood was great the instant i saw this video i bought the game 2 videos over 3 days youve been a busy little sonny jim what is a 30 year old boomer if youre in your 30s you are a millennial arent you i really love blood this is a game from my childhood and my first firstperson shooter interesting monolith once decided on the development of blood 3 i really really really really hope they do a similar update for shadow warrior and duke 3d because its a pain trying to find the best source port or getting the games to run in dosbox but i suspect licensing issues will get in the way but hey with dusk amid evil and then on the horizon wrath were hardly short of true oldschool fps games i feel like were entering a bit of a renaissance in that regard like people finally remembered that old school fps games were about good level design not arena fights best build game thats for sure way to many inaccuracies in this version unfornantly hell there isnt even the proper gibs and blood when you blow up a group of zombies seriously look at all this shit httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviarqk5thklu surprised you praise this version so much gman tbh hey not a boomer here and i appreciate doom quake hexen halflife etc never played blood though now might just be the time this version does not use the original source code is there a next gen version of this still kicking pink on the inside short pause like your mum so it passes the gman test but will it pass the civvi test can you play local splitscreen coop with controllers what did he mean by 30 year old boomers what is that baby boomers are in their 60s now remaster where the fuck is 2019 graphics remaster my ass 30 year olds arent boomers wait there was an opening cutscene in blood its not a souceport floating blood wrong sprites and sounds not even running on build i want this game remastered with id tech 6 kaiser developer himself admits it uses disassembled executable and not an actual source httpstwittercomsvkaiserstatus1071146867650641920 source belongs to wb while atari owns distribution rights which is why the game was legally fucked for two decades nightdive got publishing rights for games name and assets from atari but did not get source from wb at least gdxnblood use stolen alpha source that nightdive cant use due to its dubious legal status cryptic passage has the better level design though nice coincidentally i just bought the old blood and i couldnt fix it i searched in all the forms so i refunded it and gonna get the remastered one bought after watching well this is best thing happening in this year so far classic shooters are so much more fun than the new ones released im able to put this game on a gpd win 2 and this remastered version finally support a controller making a perfect mobile version of blood coop blood yes plz 1119 thats going to be my new moto now we need heretic done with the same treatment steam automatically gave me a coupon for 50 off the game because i own the old version of blood already if you own blood already on steam its 50 off just tried it gdx has better hud options fuck its like these projects have zero work put in them shit if its going to be a remake even buggy at least give it something new lighting i dont know maybe the best remaster ive ever played if blood ever gets a reboot id better hear acdcs if you want blood in the trailer my name is caleb and im 15 with alot of interest in classic fps games so this game in particular suits me very well 044 is this an attack lol from my personal experienceblood is hands down the hardest build engine game nothing even comes close its brutal but its brutally fun d if you have the blood one whole unit on gog you get a 50 discount feels almost like stealing only having to pay 5 bucks for this new blood those greedy fucks over at gearbox could learn a thing or two about how to treat customers and loyal fans definitely need to try this without a person like you we were all doomed for a long time as much as i love the original graphics i hope someone does a neural network upscaled versionor even and hd texture pack anyways blood is back bitches honestly never thought id see the day since the source code was rumoured to be lost forever in hell why do you say like every other sentence are you a valley girl check that shite monolith are gods just played remaster and it feels and looks worse than bloodgdx of course remaster have some sweet thingies like ao and some ui additions but ill stick with gdx i want blood the chosen 2 remake just nabbed it last night considering getting it for my mate as well so we can play coop but if i may ask how do you set up a mp game when i clicked host session in game it just gave me nothing but my name on screen no other way to set anything up also idk if im missing anything but all the mp lobbies dont specify if its coop or dm or not which is a problem imo i love how this guy says fire foiyah so hows this differ from one unit whole brings back old memories was the death montage a homage to civvie 11 hey theres a mod for duke 3d called duke forces which is a huge star wars mod im really hoping for console ports now i would love to play this on switch ther you go i botit things to complain about theres no visual improvement in this remaster p higher video resolution doesnt count we dead to you how dare you say that about us and the remastered blood still managed to come out before sigil okay now add this game to xbox playstation and the switch and ill be satisfied should i really buy this game my friend also bought this game for coop the sad thing is i dont get any discount when buying it whatsoever and i dont even know its gonna fun to play or not blood 2 remaster when i had to refund this game because it turns out im fucking terrible at blood lol still if anyone wants to try this go for it the devs did a great job tbh i guess its nice that the game got more readily avaliable but sadly thats that id have been thrilled to see blood getting some more love than so guys some dudes finally got hold of the source code so you can play it on your modern computer nowi guess beyond the original creators work i dont see any game dev studio effort here other than ez it speaks for itself but this would all have been done and released for free by the community had the code been made public instead regardless while i fully agree with purists on various topics such as not adding details and clutter to the levels getting in the way of movement mainly unnecessary tweaks and changes yada yada its supposed to be a remaster where are the upgrades extra features wheres anything new at all im disappointed ex that the sprites and textures havent gotten a doubletheresolution upgrade at least as an option i mean even though its a new titl love to but no pc i knew youd hop on this great video only thing i find a little off putting is the narrated review voice it kinda goes up and down up and down like someone rapidly telling someone a story before slowing down towards the end p by the way owners of other versions of blood on steam get a coupon discount which turns the game from 10 to five which is an amazing value this morning i saw this video uploaded and immediately bought this game thanks for being the one to let me know it was out also is it just me or were the gibs messier back in dos kinda relieved to hear that you can play on the lower difficulties ive always felt guilty playing on lightly broiled or pink on the inside in blood cm and just thought i was complete garbage which i very well might be in my fav games ever being a big horror fan and all 430 pop culture references are literally the opposite of timeless awesome steam even gave me a 50 off coupon more reason to buy it what i dont like its not for linux and we had to wait to long i remember the old defunct magazine pc zone they interviewed monolith studio when making this game blood they mentioned the mimes and why they are there it basically an inside joke in the studio where they all hate mimes since seattle seems to have alot of mime artist so yeah dont play this game before you check out doom 2016 or you may not like the last reincarnation of doom ps blood on the hardest difficulty is just a very good survival horror not a pure blooded fps finally bought this game even before the vid finished i love blood finally we no longer have to deal with dosbox or bloodgdx no shwacked insert i feel betrayed but this doesnt use original source code and is pretty inaccurate overall god i love the visuals in old sprite based games that mom joke inhales madlad d loved the gonk dawn of the dead reference thank you now i can finally run blood awesome i remember when this first came out and we all played it to death especially after the shit with duke 3d and the australian censorship of it a must play and experience game bloods level design is absolutely unfettered really happy they brought this out again d id love to see an unreal gold remastered yo ggg pls dont show anything from the final level of games i have never heard so many screams in such a short amount of time if your using no vsync the max fps setting cooks your gpu use 240 or lower just a heads up hate to break this to you but most of us that watch you are 30 year old boomers how are you 30 and a boomer am i missing a joke here much memories plaeyd with cousins on modem in back in the 90 ties god if games like shadow warrior nd theas gott vibrant modding and leveling community with multiplayer iw woud be fucking hooked game needs a patch immediately cant even change video setting without black screen nice to see the remaster has finally released where is pro blood gmanlives how is this game not a thing looks way cooler then doom stares at watch still waiting on hblood did you say malakas its a greek word and i dont know if thats what you said or i just misheard being greek in sydney made that intro amazing shut the fuck up and take my money so funnyi bought the original via vpn on gog because it is on the index in germanythis remaster is available no problem then again extreme paintbrawl also used the build engine and more importantly this does support splitscreen 8player splitscreen in fact i wonder if civvie11 approves of this remake does this mean a future updated version in the pipeline good shit mate also could you tell me what microphone youre using you need to work on yout taggingkeywords game mate when i searched for blood fresh supply on youtube your video did not pop wasnt your name ggmanlives we liveagain it still holds up in 2019 uh well i guess but nowadays kids in my generation play stuff that has better graphics and other fancy schmancy nick nack and whatnot arent 30 year olds millennial now god i used to love kicking the heads around the graveyard did not know it got a remaster nice i wish theyd reboot this like they did with doom they did that with shadow warrior and doom so why not this i expected more from this remaster the weapons graphics are the same just like the monsters only the surroundings are different and textures well finally you can buy it in germany gosh nightdive is great however i really dont like bloods level design it made me bored pretty quick but the weapons are awesome i was honestly going to tell you to take a look at this but you beat me to a punch by 13 hours im glad to see blood back hopefully we can get night dive to remake 2 seeing as that had a bit of potential but fell face flat is it still banned in germany blood is the best build engine game dont me its as good as brutal doom the best part about a remake you get paid twice insta buy but is there a way to get rid of the texture warping when looking up and down edit found it it is under options gameplay full 3d aim on why does he keep saying 30 year old boomers 30 year olds are millennials he is like two generations off is the a joke i dont get epic can keep their explosives coz steam has blood two weeks ago i started blood nblood for the first time really enjoyed doom quake hexen duke nukem even though dn is the only game i ever played in 20 years that gave me motion sickness witch haven strife etc but man no game hit as hard as blood man fucking rats were the first to kill me not to mention the times i exploded myself 1010 guess i will get the remake since im not that far into the game not one of the bestthe best shooting game love this game childhood memories i never got why blood got so little love its level design is genius your character is a loveable bastard of an antihero the weaponry seems custombuilt to provide infinite quantities of catharsisits one of the best ever but until recently noone but the die hards gave a shit about it the mini calebs were preset in even in the vanilla game also hasnt been mentioned that the game ha split screen multiplayer ive been waiting this remaster for so long never played blood but played and finished blood 2 come out we wont hurt you you will die a slow slow death i wish it was remastered properly though they could still maintain a retro style but just scale up the resolution on the enemies and weapons and sure add more pixel gore as well so is boomer just a word for not young now looks like another game thats going to my wishlist i liveagain ah shit guess ill have to finish blood again if you type lara croft into the chat ingame you get all guns blood has one of the coolest set of weapons there wouldnt be an arsenal as varied until perfect dark its also the one 90s shooter where you can use the pistol throughout the whole game go and buy itbitch done and done i have been waiting for this for years its just a shame that i refuse to pay the microsoft tax just to be able to play it hopefully there will be a linux port at some point do we know if theres an xbox one release on the horizon they should give it a shadow warrior style reboot malakas you been playing assassin creed the real question is does the game have blood this owns cant wait for a good powerslave remaster i have been waiting for this usually im not that keen on straight fps games but youve sold me blood looks awesome actually reminds me a bit of bulletstorm especially the flare gun what happened to the other 2 gs you used to have in your name so a question does the 3d aiming allow for the normal wasd mouse controls or are we still bound to only the keyboard i have attempted to play the gog version of the old game but i never got the hang of the controls and so i havent really played this game that much now all that raytraced and i will be more them blasted away civvie11 wants to know your current location can someone explain what a 30 year old boomer is is that a running joke or something i was on the fence when i saw the remastered first but now that ive seen this i feel more confident in getting it when i can blood was for me one the games they are understand to use the build engine more effective than duke nukem 3d dont get me wrong the duke is of course very cool and i have so many nostalgic memories about this title but i have the same nostalgic memories about blood blood ii was not more the same than the first game and it disappointed me the first blood felt like a adventure like first person shooter the dead hand is annyoing in both bloodgames instabuy thanks for the vid sunny jim 50 says civvie11 screamed when this happened me and it is time for real pro blood with all expansion packs on extra crispy cv11 ah shit he we go again 027 i appreciate the reference to my country i hate those addams family thing enemies so many years i havent figured out for to get rid of them bring it to consoles saw email from gog this morning made immediate purchase i insta bought this game as soon as i saw this thank you gman this isnt based on the source code its on an entirely different engine bloodgdx and nblood are actually more accurate deathwish is broken in this btw edit ok so i just got this myself and heres how it looks like to me httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvocunnta3lg what even is going on just requested a refund on steam so i can finally get this bad boy nightdive is a god damn blessing cant wait for them to get more into the turok series i want my evolution remaster so like now all we need is a new kick ass shooter like a whole new ip thirty seconds in and youve already sworn in greek i knew i subbed to this channel for a reason as someone who just turned 30 play blood this game need a remake like doom fuck yeah i just opened steam and i have a 50 off coupon for this game for owning the original they also said it would be on console cant seem to find a release date though a bunch of malakas at 026 xd blood was my dads first fps game he played he showed me a floppy disk copy and he still has it to this day man i love my dad any mention about this coming to consoles this looks fun as hell but all these references just go over my head i hope the humor still stands without having to be a movie fan easily one of the most over rated 90s shooters thats awesome commercial version of blood gdx i already had the older version on gog so this one only cost me 5 euros good times and one of the if not the best build engine games never played this when i was younger time to fix it also pretty rare at least down in the southwest thanks for the info spooky and cool as hell doom wolfenstein duke nukem had nothing on this game im watching this and all i want to do is play this i never got to play blood back in the day i might pick this one up thanks for the review sorry to burst your bubble but if youre 30 years old youre a milenial if youre 40 youre a boomer great to see this reissued seemed like it never would be your editing is getting better and better finding relevant things to clip to mirror your scripts observations great work whats the name of song 744 lol its like christmas and my birthday at the same time over the lips and through the gums look out tummy here i come they should reboot this game the way they did doom 2016 holy shit yes always wanted to get it but all the versions confused me only problem is that i am dizzy af wait wut did he just say 30 year old boomers uh wasnt the boomer generation born in the 50s and 60s after ww2 is it on steam now we just need the brutal doom guys to make a similar mod for this can you review splatterhouse 3d next truly a wonderful time to be a fan of 90s fps fucking awesome civie11 also made it into geh achievemnts of the game i love this game i have a physical copy of it and i tried to get it to work about a month ago didnt like a modern pc so happy i can play this again and its on gog i dont think you know what a boomer is this dis the shit i have been waiting for gimie gimie gimie pro blood remaster when civvie the ai is ridiculously different the audio is muffled the midi used is the shittiest version available some voxels are stolen from fanports theres a lot of confirmed bugs overall the faithfulness and gameplay accuracy is pretty much nonexistent calebs movement isnt the same at all just like the oomph sensation regarding weapons the game doesnt sound look and feel like the original if compared to more convincing sourceports here this is a better review now go and buy the cheaper version one unit whole blood and either slap bloodgdx or nblood on that bad boy thank me later youve just got a way better experience with less bugs and approximatively 99 of the original gameplay accuracy let alone the fact that the customization you need is all there pretty much on par of the options that this bloodcm 2 gives you anyway now for the civvie review blood in a modern engine benis hardening im sure its just rigor mortis holy shit i forgot about this game for 20 years this is one of the first pc games i ever saw i want to make this clear nightdive did not use the original source code it was reverse engineered by eye in fact there are numerous inaccuracies that long term fans will notice however the new casual players will not its a decent remaster but the accuracy is maybe at 75 i still highly recommend this due to accessibility and modern netcode the ports nblood and bloodgdx are 100 accurate with enhancements i just want this to be clear before people go around praising this game its okay if you like it just know that its not accurate dont be ignorant to that fact thumbs up so people can see are they gonna release the source code runs to buy it on steam i grew up on doom quake and duke nukem but i never heard of blood until i started watching your channel now finally i have the chance to play this classic time to make a gog account good shit i was considering going to me senior prom lmao fuck that im just gonna stay home and play blood 025 most of it because a bunch of malakes kept holding out over the licensing are you also part greek apart from australian d cheers mate great video and released on time i consider buying this a stoned gargoyle i fuckin remember this game thanks for bringing it up dude really cool vid i can really hear your love for the game i bought this immediately was so much better than doom fun fact the kex engine that runs this game was programmed by the same guy who made doom 64 ex and is technically an offshoot of the engine that powers the latter game i did a video on this i dont know if this has been happening for a while since i havent really checked timestamps of corresponding videos but ive been noticing a lot more civvie 11 related comments ever since he did that little shout out although to be fair i cant say ive been reading the comments all that heavily in earlier gman videos not a bad thing but i do kind of concur to a small degree of some of the other comments ive seen they may want to try a collab although civvis going to have to get out of the facility first unless g man breaks him out always wanted to play blood but never knew what version to get figured i might as well wait when i heard nightdive was on it expected it to take much longer for them to deliver and im glad they did it well looking forward to finally playing it because i love the other build engine games ive played a lot you said it about damn time ill be getting me mitts on this at the soonest available opportunity the worst enemy in the game is those bloody severed hands i hate them so much not a big fan of the spiders either especially when they bite you and the screen goes nuts not the biggest fan of blood but those additions in the remaster seems very nice ill probably buy it since i have a coupon wooohooo edit damn this version is actually kind of broken been waiting to play this game for a long time not smart enough with computers to modernize this so this finally being released is so awesome just finished e1 and it was awesome but it was definitely harder than i thought pink on the inside like your mom either your mom virgin or you mom gay very operational review youre becoming my primary fpsoriented channel love you 30 year old boomer what is that a time traveler ive watched civvies blood review not long ago and wanted to try it and a few days later bam they release a remaster sacrificing that goat to the old god totally worked kind of a shame they didnt do another expansion like how quake got episode 5 from machine games wait i thought night dive studios wasnt allowed to remaster blood did something change or was i misinformed it really makes you feel like caleb they need this on xboxlive psn and the nintendo eshop cmon fuck yeah was waiting for a repackage of this game for ages can barely tolerate the dosbox version just so finicky to get running properly and for 7 bucks how could i say no i would be super excited if nblood hadnt been released some months ago because hd blood seemed like a pipe dream back then im still buying this though the quality of life improvements seem worth it what a coincidence i was trying to find out when this was gonna come out and now i know with a proper review too good shit dude now im hoping they remaster blood 2 just so i can finally fucking play it i swear ive tried running it on 5 separate pc builds over my entire life but no matter what i cant play it for more then 1 minute before it crashes no contest the build engine is better than the doom engine we need more new ips for suedo 3d sprite shooters id love to see a daggerfall remaster malakas youre either greek or you hear it a lot in melbourne wish they can make a sequel in the future as titled blood 3 then everyone will be jumping around with a monkey wrench and happy like fuck like your mom hey fuck you mate calebs laugh is pure win in this game i played this on lightly broiled as a kid now i always play it on well done made to order is such a big deal imo every game needs something like that aside from a few graphical issues that im having with this release i think its fantastic and well worth your money why is doom guys head on the hud why this game dosent had a remake youre my hero 703 fucking brilliant man i remember nearly pissing my pants playing this as a kid good times i dont think you know what boomer is im gonna paint the town red just bought it on steam immediately blood is my all time favorite 90s fps game next to doom hey us 30 year olds arent boomers but yeah so glad this came out and finally has controller support and even still has the original cheats how does this compare to bloodgdx i have been waiting for this remaster since i discover your channel in 2014 2019 has been a great year for nostalgia this is it chief i dont need iti dont need iti dont need it i neeeeeeeeeeed iiiiiiiitttt 30 year old boomers what boomers are in their 40s at this point i got a coupon for 50 off on steam because i owned the original hell fucking yeah happy friday when the fuck are gman and civvie gonna stop fucking around and drop a pro whatever together no thanks i am still fine with bloodgdx or nblood finally i can enjoy this game fuck dosbox dude the only box worth my time is the xbox where i can play fartnite i fucking love this channel it always reviews good old games that i never heard of or good goofy games that we should play far better than reviewing absolutely shitty triple a titles and none else i dont think ive seen you this happy in a review gman it scares the shit out of me games like this make me wish id drop the cash for a pc i will buy it soon ive been addicted to these types of games never played this back then i played doom duke nukem 3d quake 1 2 and more recently played dusk great game it nailed the 90s feel if this is on steam i will pick it up edit night dive studios are the same people that remade the turok game right this team is doing great work do you want to suck bloods dick any more seriously though blood is amazing and nightdive can do no wrong in my eyes at the moment theyve snatched up some amazing ips the most recent for me being the turok 2 remaster that was incredible looks fucking awesome 941 all new render voxels they look worse though been playing ac odyssey lately malakes is for plural hurray coop too bad none of my friends grew up playing this gotta get this what is a 30 year old boomer more blood for the blood god maybe ill finally play blood ehhh probably not stephan weyte caleb is one of the voice actors in my web series hes actually a really nice guy lives right down the street from me they did not have the original source code when they made this ive been wanting to play blood for several years now but i heard a lot of bad things about the version available on steam therefore i was thrilled to hear that nightdive was doing a remaster glad to see that they did it justice the draven tombstone is a reference to the crow isnt it they did a great job with strife remastered i was stoked when i found out about this custom difficulty is good maximum spawns normal behavior perfect i never liked it when behavior and count were tied together when it came to difficulty a few minor bugs aside i have to agree this is the definitive way to play blood today especially for those who havent played this gem before its never felt smoother 30yearold boomers ill be using that next time someone explains the merits of grunge music to me its crazy i just rewatched youre original blood review and was wondering when theyd make this finally it has arrived only i would die for a brutal blood mod sold the voodoo doll is a gimmick weapon in the clearest of cuts but i hear it really shines in bloodbath mode apparently where caleb stabs the doll affects the attack regular chest stabs are cheapest fastest and most common eye stabs take a bit more ammo but briefly black out the screen of the victim while a crotch stab does the most damage and causes the target to drop their weapon really just holster it never played bloodbath though id be down to try hatche d wha i have the age of a zoomer the taste in media of a boomer and the personality of a bloomer guess the meme cant really get everybody right finally proper mouse aiming in blood i thought sw was way harder than blood i wish they bothered to remaster the fucking awful 3d cinematics you know i just realized that i wasted my money for this game and im gonna take them back cause this piece of shit doesnt work a lots of dll errors and stuff and i dont know how to fix that shit and this is with the game that was released back when the cave man walked on earth you know fuck it this game can suck my fucking cock im done cause my last chance for playing original blood game is wasted in to fuck hole ps but im gonna like your video anyway because of your reviews that are amazing peace this needs to come out for the xbox one 30year old boomers meh they took way too long to get this out there and now there are better ways of playing blood like blood gdx i just instantly went to steam and bought it after 37 seconds you had me at nightdive studios does it come with the level editor what did you say about my mum man i thought i was clicking on a civvie video i know what im doing after work tonightfuriously masturbating also playing blood 30 year old boomers i dont think you know how generations work i absolutely love this game its one of the best old school shooters ever made and it brings me back a lot of memories from my childhood kudos fastest purchase of my life had the steam coupon in my inventory ill buy it again for the 3rd time tempt me with good games and i wont hesitate i own the orginal dos games nice got a 50 off coupon from steam for owning the originalso i know what i am doing tonight i live again can i still get the dos version ooooo sees true 3d aim that gives me an erection this is awesome now hopefully well see ports for handheld good thing theres no more messing around with dosbox and config files i got the rights to this just so i could watch a gggman review oh boy cant wait for the inevitable brutal mod the custom difficulty is a blessing from above im going to buy this on steam right now anyone want to play through coop with me third time buying this game worth it 703 shwack oh no civvie has nutted his pants i know im the ignored minority but i cant play fpss without full controller support so im left out your mom jokes are getting more and more hurtful i do believe she is starting to think you have something against her malakasassassins creed odyssey nightdive are some magic ass motherfuckers is this a mandela effect or your channels name was ggmanlives just picked this up is it just me or was blood the hardest of the build engine games having a much tougher time with this one than with shadow warrior or duke 3d maybe its just me though first my boy civvie and now my favorite aussie bastard gmanlives blood its in full force again ok i seriously was watching your previous blood reviews last night stop stalking me do i look like a kangaroo to you if you guys are wondering what type of ip hell blood is in its split between atari and warner brothers atari only owns the rights to the first two games since warner brothers owns monolith they own the ip accept the first two games so atari can only keep releasing the first two games its the shieeeeet its also 50 off atm on gog if you already have the whole unit i think one of the achievements on steam is a civvie11 reference so forgotten that theyre still full of cultists for finding forgotten catacombs doth my ears deceive me theres a fucking blood remaster finally i bought this game summer of 97 right before my sophomore year of high school id been saving every penny i got my hands on for a car but when this came out the car fund became my temporary game fund such is life what a hectic creative stonecold classic fuck yeah best fps ever i love this d blood 3 fuck yeah hope they remaster blood 2 as well someone made a mod for fallout new vegas called blood refilled that lets players play through 80 levels of blood through a sidequest you blood fans are fuckin wild now all we need is a shadow warrior reboot style rebootsequel i just thought what if we had an avengers style crossover with doomguy duke nukem lo wang and caleb does the remastered version use the midi soundtrack ive barely ever heard of this but man it looks great as much as i love horror movies ive got to check this out now dusk too because i havent checked it out yet either your mom is really good its a shame old 90s era games dont get more treatment like this its fun to replay old ps1 era games but trying silent hill 1 skullmonkeys and heart of darkness is almost impossible between the grease screen below 480p and the fact emulator sites are shutting down all over i just watch lets plays instead got myself a boomer boner 703 alright from now on whenever gman makes a mom joke in a vid im just gonna reply to most of peoples comments with a mom joke personally i was really hoping for updated textures and models for guns and enemies maybe fresh up on the ui to give it that remastered look ive been waiting for this for years i can finally play a proper remaster of blood and i am now incredibly happy i cant wait to hear what civvies thinks of the remaster god bless nightdive love them has anyone got any ideas if this will be ported to consoles instant buy cant wait nightdive are a treasure in this messed up gaming industry of today this game is still better than half the latest releases today one of my favorites now i just need a poweslave remaster and ill be happy looks awesome the full 3d look and made to order difficulty are big deals to me also if you own the original on steam you should have received a 50 off voucher im definitely getting it i hope it comes out to console later on i was hesitant to try the source ports hoping blood would get the same treatment as nukem shadow guess ive gotta finally add this to my collection and that user difficulty should be a standard i dont know if its a coincidence but the name tchernobog would mean the black god will this remastered game get a physical release for consoles blood is the best build engine game period yes its here now we just need a grezzo 2 remaster this is my first time ever playing this game and its good to hear that this game is a really hard game and its not because im just some fucking retard because holy shit the first two levels were a nightmare and i had it on lightly broiled you can tell he was excited while recording this i looked up boomer just to be sure and apparently you arent the first to label gen x gamers as boomers but this is super confusing to me because im used to boomer being short for baby boomer which refers to the parents of gen xers anyway ive had the originals on gog for years and am probably going to get this version now i didnt see this one coming you should do a projared review i have so many good memories related to blood awesome game when you changed your name to gmanlives all i can think about when watching your videos is gman from half life 2 bought it immediately after watching this now i just need quake 1 remastered with the soundtrack and ill be set wow i didnt even know this was a thing awesome to hear and great review as usual totally off topic but i cant believe you still havent made a video about operation flashpoint god bless nightdive and their kex engine 3 ads for a 13 m vid honestly a blood remaster was more good news to me than ooh we are making rage 2 or borderlands 3 honestly rage 2 just like a mess that dont know what it want to be a borderlands 3 is well honestly after i played bl 1 and 2 i did not feel the need to anymore games i was happy with does 2 they where good but not i want more games good honestly i would want a blood 3 that is in the same style as the first one bloody and fun and not fancy smanchy shit good challenging game however some of the later levels are straight up lazy garbage there is definitely some level design differences between the official expansion pack from monolith and the other whats happened to gggmanlives i got an email from gog containing the words blood and nightdive next thing i remember was receiving an email saying thanks for your order edit okay im lying i had to go to gog to see that nightdive were behind it i feel like im obligated to buy this best build engine game by a huge margin is this an impression or is the tnt doing less damage in this version lastly is there a level stats feature that shows how many kills and secrets there are in the levels welp guess im finally playing blood edit had to doubletake at pink on the inside like your mum lmao ffs i literally just bought ion maiden and dusk now i have to buy this too too many great games coming out lately imagine this game getting a full reboot like doom i wont celebrate this as much because i played bloodgdx a lot and this remaster should have been done ages ago but hey good for anyone new bring as many players to experience this classic the creme de la creme of 90s shooters feels nice now we just need blood 3blood remake ps its stephan weyte not steven sheit 027 did he say a bunch of malakas swearing in greek can you look at the first mortal kombat game also holy shit i cant believe they kept the customizable difficulty mechanic like bloodgdx had only this time theres even more customizability wow wheres the easier to use map editor and workshop that was promised thats not very maranax mallax dude i wish we could hang out when i win the lottery im gonna come visit australia and play some games with gman great video duder about time this game got a proper remaster i cant wait to play this youve been uploading so much lately youre back on meth arent you did they fix the difficulty bug can we get this on the consoles please shut up and kiss me id jizz over blood on the switch alright triple g i challenge you to a human beyblade battle so get ypur stongest helmate and spinniest office chair and lets battle does the kex engine allow you to avoid a lot of the hitscanners shots by crouching like you could in the original version and in fan ports pink on the inside like your mum well played is it lives as in he lives his best life or i only have 2 lives left gman was just waiting for this one boomerlife honestly this game is very overrated i got bored of all the hitscan enemies very fast only finished the first episode i prefer something like quake or duke nukem i have waited for this so long this is so fucking awesome insta buy stone gargoyles i am waiting for civvie to show up to give some awesome pro tips blood fantastic game really cool they made a remastered version i got the email from gog at work this morning on my phone and i screamed finally we got a remaster of this gem any ultrawide support something called the kex engine im a bit disappointed that someone who is so fond of old shooters isnt following that a little more closely it was made by samuel kaiser villarreal this guy was remaking a lot of forgotten and abandoned shooters doom 64 powerslave now hes working for nightdive and they are using his engine to make officially licensed remakes like this system shock and the turok games if you have any interest in an old game that doesnt play well on modern systems anymore this guy is the one to remake it pliz make a review of prey 2017 this is what i get for waiting so long to buy the originalthey release the remaster a couple of months later 705 you forgot the schwacked bought in and downloading as im watching this awesome review im 41 this is such a big part of my gaming life the carnival level soundscape brings back such awesome gaming memories ps4 port please physical release fantastic remaster that i immediately jumped on buying now i own the megaton edition that special edition of shadow warrior and this i have the holy trinity if they remaster blood 2a herculean effort on its own they should fix and complete that fucking game because its raw fresh supply is for sale on steam you also get 50 off if you own the original dos version on steam i think the best thing about blood to me anyways is that the environments are so damn realistic maybe not so interactive but you really feel youre in these places not many shooters can do that especially with this tech nightdive truly are the heroes we need but dont deserve i think i will buy this i own a physical copy of blood from back in the day and also a digital copy on steam i sure as hell dont mind paying for this remaster for a 3rd time either this game is one of my favorite fps ever made thanks for the review gman i wouldnt have known about this remaster otherwise now to go buy and play the shit out of it wait a fucking minute blood remaster is out holy shit im getting this right now please tell me this on consoles as well as pc been wanting to try blood for ages first i bought it on gog not knowing it would be released shortly after on steam then i bought it on steam not knowing i would get a loyalty coupon xp i may be a retard but i love blood d 925 bloodgdx is based on leaked blood alpha source code thats why its so faithful to originals physics and weapon handling when i saw the tweet from kroll earlier i thought we were going to get more info not a full release and couldnt be any damn happier watched trailer saw the price tag dropped cash on gog and off to paint the town red i went this is a perfect example of rereleasing a classic keep the core intact as much as feasibly possible add options while not subtracting from whats previously available and available at an affordable price ticks all the boxes and then some alter mal im ernst ich liebe deine videos die art wie sie geschnitten sindwie du sie sprichst ach das gesamte kontet finde ich groart bitte mach weiter mach weiter so 3 da mein englich nicht so gut ist bitte ich euch das mal zu bersetzten google shiiiit age seriously i love your videos the way they are cut how you speak them oh the whole kontet i think great please keep going like this 3 since my englich is not so good i ask you to translate that you deserve a spot in heaven or in hell im not sure at this point btw keep it up you make my youtube feed not boring af i was always indecisive when considering buying blood but this video convinced me by mentioning coop support then i look it up and discover it also supports splitscreen this is truly a rare breed i would like to know what night dive is doing with the licence in the future but whatever they do they need stephan m weyte to do calebs voice this remaster looks very good sips they dont make em like this used to anymore they should get the source code to blood 2 and give it the daikatana 13 treatment finally my favorite game of all time gets a proper remaster what a time to be alive thats all i can say review all marathon serious 0026 a bunch of what so you can just play this version nice and easy after downloading it been waiting what feels a lifetime for this to happen glad i didnt have to wait long for the review can we just remaster all the classics please im always down for that there are no 30 year old boomers now this is something id like to play console i do appreciate the power up timer when you used the death mask in the original game you where invulnerable but you never really knew when the power up would go away leaving you in the middle of a group of enemies ready to pummel you to death because you where no longer invincible a bunch of malakas kept holding out over the liscnencing malakas apparently one of my favourite youtubes is also greek nice shit man holy shit didnt expect this at all thanks for reviewing this all i had to do was see the is really good in the title and it was an instant purchase for me i could never complete blood and all its source ports due to the shoddy aiming new enemies mini calebs and working multiplayer am i dreaming ps got a 50 off coupon in my steam inventory which i presume is because i own the game on there cheers nightdive studios no one make fun of gg dying this is blood not hecking duke nukem its hard this is about to get bloody my problems with blood 1 i hate the dynamite 2 i hate the flare gun besides that i love it i think this was my first ebay purchase ever way back in the late 90s the blood pc game with the huge box that they used to be packaged in cost me 20 or 30 back then and this was the time when all transactions were done by mailing off a check or money order paypal wasnt a thing i playagain the blood remaster came out and got to hear gman say what a great day nice now i can actually play it one of the games that what boomers never shut up about dang didnt expect this to ever come out dewmgai has to rep and taer all the daemons i might get this for one reason and one reason alone custom difficulty to be able to play this enemy count on maximum enemy health lower than usual but with minimal tweaking to everything else sounds like a ridiculously fun time as i have a tendency to like guns to feel really deadly but have enemy counts and damage output keep me on my toes havent played blood before but ive been keeping an eye on it just in case edit fuck it bought it anyway ten bucks so why not i remember reading many times that the blood source code was lost and gone so they actually had it still oh i got it they put everything 5ogether last summer i did all of that manually you sound really happy i bet getting this was like a wet dream come true this just proves how good monolith used to be blood no one lives forever fear and condemned some of the best fps games ever middle earth was good too not as good as those wish those days would come back i hope soon somebody will finally get full license of nolf and we will get sequel in a future split screen man you missed the elephant they added split screen for up to 4 players the thing we could only dream of as a kids back in the day god u loved this game as a kid do the old cheat codes still work man i remember kicking the head of a zombie around thx for analyzing the difficulty levels a bunch of malakes dynamic lighting would be a nice feature but im glad its finally back on track are they going to remaster blood 2 the chosen hey gman i just discovered this mod that is basically a brutal doom for blood i think you should check it out httpsforumzdoomorgviewtopicphpf19t61162 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzqk7ptldb8o thanks for video about this remaster i cant wait to scoop this up i guess im too young never heard of this now i need it

remaster releases gmanlives yes i can review this game once more thank you very much man blood is my favorite fps ever i need this on my xbox finished 5wo chapters last summer this summer the other two is on the list you shell need a widescreen patch i saw that this got released earlier thought i would wait for the gmanlives review to see how it is bought the game half way through the video playing now didnt realize this was out already good deal can you play in coop in this version i loved playing the original in coop via lan if you got the gog version of blood before then you will get a 50 discount on the remaster known as fresh supply why dont they make new games like this i cant think of one it needs an option for sprite billboarding i prefer sprites in 3d games to always face the player instead of having that cardboard cutout effect when you look up and down at them please blood 2 the choosen remastered night dive thanks for bringing back my favorites 90s fps turok system shock and blood the shotgun from blood is what made me go out and get a double barrel sawed off shotgun i dont regret getting it for a minute i am disappointed dont get me wrong i love blood i played it when it was released its one of the few games i finished more than once but i expected so much more hint doom remake 4 not to mention this one httpswwwmoddbcomgamesbloodfanremake oh well ah finally somebody who mentions the phantasm reference in e1m1 the morningside funeral house youre a man of culture i see in the last 15 years i only purchased 2 games this is one of them ive been waiting 20 years for this remaster civvie is nursing a semi and i bought it immediately upon seeing this didnt even wait to finish the video because chances are itll be gone from the german storefront again soon next do a conflict denied ops review its like 2 bucks on humble bundle how accurate is it since it isnt using build anymore blood is definitely my favorite build engine game i love the gothic 1920s setting and all the pop culture and horror references and that double barrel shotgun the best in the biz oh hi cheap version of civvie came back home from work checked my facebook and found out this news instabuy but now i am happy gman is talking good about itthis is awesome ok broski ive a gripe with ya i agree 100000000 that calebs sawed off is by far one of the greatest guns in fps history however in your best fps shotgun videotwasnt even a mention correct me if im wrong oh and you forgot to drop a schwacked after that yo momma joke silly bastard you really need to stop calling yourself a boomer dude pretty sure 30 year olds are millennials if not theyre gen x boomers were born in the decades following wwii so the 50s and 60s imo the best sawed off shotgun in all fps games pink in the inside like your mom i love this channel i was wondering was this remaster of blood released on next gen consoles i ask cause im a console gamer but i always wanted to play blood but cant afford a gaming pc i think that sadly 30 year olds are still millenials ohhhhh civvie is gona be happy review broforce blood was the game i missed out on so i was most happy to see this on steam now i got out the unlikely hope that monoliths avp2 will see the light of day duke caribbean is the expansion pack i dont think anything can top it now we need a brutal blood mod screams in civvie this is great i love blood the guns akimbo cheat is burned into my brain hopefully they make a console port did you just said a bunch of malakes or is my greek ear is hearing things wrong oh my fucking god thank you g i will buy this shit and play finally so glad theres another person out there who understands the true genius of blood i love duke and all but blood is the build engine game for me for years i felt like nobody even knew this game existed now if nightdive can just get the rights to clive barkers undying wellthere goes 10i just bought the normal gog version within the last couple years too civvie will be jumping for joy nightdive studios back at it again with the remasters nightdive studios appears to be the goto team for remastering old games that rare moment where g hasnt got a single thing he didnt like about a game that shows how good blood is and how well nightdive did with the remaster i wished the cutscenes where remade i always thought doom would be more fun if he would grunt or yell you know mestill waiting on blood 3 just got a 50 discount coupon for it today no fucking idea why but im pretty fuckin excited sonny jim customizable difficulty is sick as fuck play the game civvie this game makes my asshole wet a remaster of blood made by nightdive i mean i already am grateful about their take on the system shock series and nowblood there is a god after all and its name

the world youre my favorite reviewer so far uagn sonny jim in baris dialect i have never rebought a game this fast people are arguing about things that arent the same like blood vanilla but even with that there is still room for fixing and this is a great release thanks for the review finally no more messing around with dosbox or config files was getting ready to ask blood fresh supply review when pro blood remaster when wait wrong channel nobody know this game for no reason like painkiller are good games but the players well they are missing does is it better than gdx blood 30 year old boomers people born from 19802000 are confusingly called millennials boomers are their parents id love to see a new blood game in the same fashion as the new shadow warrior game first bloodgdx then nblood and now this finally blood is getting the attention it deserves i fakken will mate i do remember buying blood a couple of years ago and i had to remove it bit now i will buy it and play it freely out of all the game review channels ive seen you are my favourite i might have a slight bias towards your channel because im an aussie but who gives a shit when theres nothing but quality content keep it up mate cheers does he still accidentally stab his own thumb sometimes with the voodoo doll hey sorry to self promote but if youre interested in blood im trying to grow a community on the rbloodfps subreddit check it out if youre interested could you please review titan quest anniversary edition definitely a classic albeit not as popular as its main competitor diablo 2 if i never followed your channel i would never had guessed this remaster came out as i gave up hope im so fucking happy also youre not a boomer youre a millennium as am i at 29 this port does not appear to be using the source code at all there are many things that arent right here like hitboxobject radius for some stuff slightly muffledinterpolated sound dwt suffered from that as well some of the physics enemy ai acts differently and less aggressive at times also tries and fails to execute some maneuvres and so on sure those can be fixed in time but without the source that will be an approximation and not the faithful port to end all other ports everyone was looking for saw it on gog even better they give you 5 off if you own the original version my wallet is ready so you remastered your own blood review and reviewed the remaster itself this was a good vid sonny jim 1107 maybe you should do another vid on deathwish for old timesake ive always loved this game more than doom how did you not mention all the lovecraft references from the miskatonic station to ep 2 literally being called even death may die the voice acting in this game triggers asmr god bless you nightdive no weird warping take my money now sorry man but no its not a proper remaster its flawed from the core the enemy ai doesnt behave propertly go and buy it bitch thats all i needed to hear buying it asap anybody else remember the first time you realized you could kick severed heads around like a soccer ball i bought it as soon i saw it on gog half off because i already own the original count me in keepem coming night dive studios you should love grezzo 2 if you love this grezzo uses a lot of the stuff from this game like areas enemies weapons and even the mimes i really like this game but was never able to run properly in any modern system either the game was too slow or maybe too fast or perhaps the mouse was very clunky to use quite happy with this remaster this game certainly deserves it im gonna paint the townreeeed caleb a true boomer would have spotted that the colours are different still a great port tho remaster with expansion packs take a note gearbox dn3d and ubisoft homm3 i need money to buy the game bish i love the blood soundtrack my favorit httpsyoutubeqfajc2gtde starts at 045 made me sad and happy at the same time i just finished writing an little essay on my thoughts on three games but i thought shadow warrior was harder than blood btw i have an idea for a little mini series you can do where you talk about the first levels of shooters and how it teaches you skills to help you play like how in blood you only have a flare gun tnt and you pitchfork to get by so you have to learn to use them dude this is a missed opportunity for a civvie11 collaboration you guys are my favs death wish is a masterpiece why are people this happy it is great that we finally have a offical remaster blood but what was wrong with bloodgdx at point blank is pretty damn lethallike it should be i never found out how caleb was able to come back to life or unlife was it through pure badassery or was there something else involved personally i prefer plasma pack over cryptic passage huh cryptic passage has legendary levels plasma pack levels are trash like they were made by modders only because plasma pack was developed by monolith while cryptic passage yes this is why they levels are as bad as blood 2 or fear which is nothing more than offices and sewers blood was not made by monolith it was made by 3d realms monolith got the rights and they released it just like gearbox did with duke nukem forever wait didnt even know it was released sorry but without even watching your video i go buy and play it myself holy hell my pants wouldve exploded if i was wearing any i remember trying to buy the expansion packs but couldnt since monolith had stopped selling them and then almost immediatelly pulled out last seen on planetblood blod 2 wa just trash and then some of them made fear and isnt bioshock made by the team also first level also has a reference to macbeth out out damned spot the custom difficulty is what had me sold maxing spawns to be precise great review but this game has fov slider blood lives again made to order is an awesome feature that i wish more games had to bad its not standard like other basic options in games i really wasnt having fun with the dos port but it seems like i might have to give this a try dude i was wondering if you were gonna o this when i bought it mere moments earlier with discount for owning blood already take a shot each time you hear a cultist screaming in the video lmao i bought it the second i saw it was for sale and have been playing for a few hours to see how it compared im a big build engine fan too and blood is one of my childhood favourites but somehow i completely missed the full 3d view option so thanks for bringing that up its so much nicer when are they going to remaster turok 3 so is it much different from bloodgdx i knew this would come out and im glad i waited this long tried the various fan builds but every time i had issues so im glad ill finally be able to play this like a modern game cv11 has joined the chat a simultaneous celebration and parody of horror movies and tropes the first game from one of the finest fps developers ever and one that truly deserved to liveagain well civvie 11 will be happy with this release 0026 did you jjst say malakes i fucking love this channel i love how to cultists scream and talk haha is it possible to be a boomer even though youre only 20 ive always liked half life but your channel made me want to try pretty much every old school fps game there is i think im addicted to them now they did it the absolute madmen did it also yes ive already bought it definitely going to get this one i didnt want to buy it at d1 but fuck it i bought it at d1 i gotta put this game on my steam wish list but dont remind me because i can definitely do that by myself for myself funny how you upload this im playing blood gdx at the moment the way you say shit is the reason i subscribed to you i live again bought it thanks ha jokes on you i bought it before this video was up and i even got it 50 off for owning the original bitch and now i gotta shove over 100 hours into this remaster would be nice to see power slave be brought back from the grave like blood not gonna liebut with this remaster i expected to see a bit more slightly updated graphics and textures in hud and gameplay like what devolver digital did with shadow warrior classic redux and duke nukem 3d megaton editionbut with all the content this content being added in i cant actually complainnow hopefully theyll remaster blood 2 aswell and possibly continue the blood franchise in the futurewhat are your thoughts sonny jim guess i know what im gonna buy and play tonight i didnt find this to be harder than shadow warrior i couldnt make it past the first few levels of shadow warrior because of how hard it was ive been playing blood for years now found it as abandonware probably back in 2010 or so and ive yet to be able to beat it on anything higher than lightly broiled lol this game is so crazy hard and it still pains me every time i think of blood 2 because of it just the satisfying sound of the thompsons brass hitting the ground while shooting brings me back again in fact ill probably go buy and play through again d locked caleb pro blood when civvie wait i told my friends i have a date with an attractive girl they told me she was imaginary jokes on them because they are too caleb is so fucking cool 90s games had so much charm and personality wish they had jazzed up the lighting like in duke nukem anniversary edition my only gripe with the game difficulty is how bullshit the hit scanners are other than that its golden game great review have you taken a look at the current state of ion maiden i was thinking about getting it and i think its pretty good but idk night dive studios is also trying to get the rights for no one lives forever so that the series can get the remaster treatment fuck yeah blood is the best hard you say oh its fine ill just buydoes air quotes time savers wait what no microtransactions this is blasphemy how am i gonna beat this gamethats todays generation in a nutshell wish my pc didnt break so i could play the remaster used to play it all the time easily one if the best fps games ever if this got a ps4 version which is extremely unlikely i would be the happiest man on the planet hope they release modding tools id love to see some kickass things done with this new version of blood today is a good goddamn day now all my friends can play a game that i never shut the fuck up about when we talk about shooters and see its majesticness for themselves about damn time this game got a remaster bring to console now i wish i hadnt played the gog version months before i really hope blood 3 comes out in the future i mean system shock 3s gonna come out so why not for blood just hoping it wont be another 2 the chosen the first game i ever played online was blood im pretty sure it was the friday the 13th level because one of my best buddies back then had some weird fascination with jason not sure if it actually supported coop though or if we just messed around in some kinda two person death match yes oh god yes no more unofficial source ports praise the tchernobog awesome and split screen eight freakin players split screen they added also quite a lot voxel stuff simply great awesome but pretty sure shadow warrior is the hardest build engine game monolith must merge with with the creators of alien isolation to make a new alien vs predator game because so far monolith made the best avp game from the early 2000s and there other games were also pretty damn good that was fast back in the day all my friends played quake while me and my brother played shadow warrior and blood we made up challenges like who can survive longer on the hardest difficulty with 1 health ah the good old times like ya mom no schwacked edit just got the game you are fucking blind my man wait nightdive was able to get their hands on the sourcecode big fan of this game awesome that someone gave this game some modern love how dare you say a positive opinion damn you made this video faster than i could finish the new ghost recon trailer good job may actually have to get this remaster i hope theres no issues went to go buy this just to get a 50 off coupon for being the owner of the original thanks nightdive 3 blood remastered cool stephen weyte hope i spelt it right is a fucking badass he voiced the final boss in episode 3 of dusk we need him to voice more badass protagonists and villains weve got civvie to thank for this one its out already did you just say bunch of malakas in the intro did you say malakas at the beginning of the video at 026 to be precise aaah yes the good old cult classic blood finally getting a proper remaster this game has some of the most terrifying sounds ever ohmygodwhat its out already holy shit i brain explodes in a bloody mess bought the game today played it for the first time and love it imagine a brutal mod for this damn that enhancements list is huge vulkan 4k unlocked framerates modding support coop etc etc review spec ops the line wait its out already its good but there are bugs that need to get patched but either than that its just the tits and if youre reading this shut up and play blood how did you physically make a video this quickly ive never caught a vid this early clicked on this video faster than the dropping of projareds sub count whats up gman the second i saw this on steam i knew this would come out today woah didnt know this was a thing ah noice lol im really early finaly alright youve convinced me im playing blood today the golden age of ego shooter damn im old harry potter and the smoking barrels do the priests with guns actually speak latin if so they seem to say malak a lot and we all know malaka from ac odyssey which is greek for asshole and knowing that latin culture is pretty much just greek culture malak if latin would also mean asshole so basically theyre calling you an asshole what even is the story of this game my grandmother used to fall down the stairs and die a lot but then she tried lifeseed with lifeseed every time my grandmother falls down the stairs she comes back to life in the form of a tiny demonbaby my life is so much better now thank you lifeseed they based this game off of the fallout mod oh man this is the first mod i ever watched you play its so funny seeing you actually play the game lol i kinda hope you do a full play through even though i doubt you will yall think al going to play outer worlds the screams gosh its like a flashback to high school one of the good parts thanks for the memories al have a good one so this is where the blood refilled mod from new vegas comes from d i adore blood but its crazy hard i cant play on anything higher than medium difficulty what about 7 days to die al chooses well done start praying for al love you al ive been a viewer since

seeing al not know how to play blood is hilarious i wonder how long itll take to realize that fire button can be held to toss tnt further or that flareguns deal damage over time or that zombies need 2 shots to kill from the shotgun or that he can turn on true 3d and tweak his fov in the settings anyone remember blood refilled seeing al play this game is actually pretty weird as its ridiculously difficult on most settings and thats from someone who beat it on well done id love to see more though als almost at the carnival level holy crap this games brings back memories flashback to bloodrefilled watch as al dives into what is arguably one of the most difficult classic shooters id love to see you master this this does make me wonder if dan castenella did voice work for this game

third first i dont know why but i just putt this shit on in the background when im working duke nukem 3d was my jam as a kid for a long time the sounds of the source engine the splats and the monster screams it makes me happy i may be a psychopath i cant believe this game is now on steam o i notice nothing different hi man thank you to make videos with this wonderful game i have one question to you i have on my steams library blood fresh and supply in your video texture seemed less squared then minehow could it possible how i have to set video settings to have textures more smmothedthanks a lot and good video why do you waste so much flare gun ammo one shot is enough to set them in fire nch i used to play this game so much back in the 90s loved blood playing it on my old mouse i had then respect to u for playing this and doing a playthrough u have really cool gaming channel i have a gaming channel of my own and would really appreciate if we could support each other and spread that community love 3 subbed ya with notes on hoping we can stay connected and support each other much love 3 back in my day where destroying wall revealing a secret this is a mod they stole gzdooms mod and resell it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvximfu5oty8 poor game like the old ones actually i live again is from army of darkness the 3rd evil dead movie its used in blood as an homage to the movie crouching matters so much in blood compared any other build engine game it throws off hitscan enemys aim and you can use it to cheese most enemies except one specific asshole you encounter later theres specific sound cue for killing zombies the regular moan means theyll get back up but the louder one means theyre dead pitchfork stabs and burning kill them instantly alt fire on the shotgun might instakill based on difficulty level and a well aimed dynamite will do the job too get accustomed to your alt fire options on weapons you can drop dynamite or toss it around corners on a timer shotguns fire both barrels at once tommygun fires a sweeping pattern that kind of sucks the flare gun fires a diamond pattern and the napalm better yet dont use the napalm alt fire in the first episode it takes too much ammo and normal shots more than get the job done i dont even think episode one has enough ammo for an alt fire anyway hmm you missed a cool secret map youll find secret level exit in blood carnival map if my memory serves me correctly its in that map how have i never seen this its like just like doom cringe i really want this game to come to consoles with trophy achievement support love this game i want more blood this game is quite fun to watch nice game to watch cant wait for chapters 2 3 4 next they still need to fix the voices brown cultist voice is not the same of the black cultist and they speak like the black cultists didnt expect to see this here looks like we have another contender for the pro blood series his scream when he is burning sounds like clancy from re7 favourite game 3 played this growing up lol best game ever thatit burns sounds exactly the same as the fire hyena boss from megaman x8 it 7 i cant remember but hes one of the most obnoxious boss of all megaman x greetings from argentina i remember i played this game when i was 10 it the the very definition of the word bizarre never heard of this game looks great only played duke nukem and doom while growing up and found out about this a couple years back loved it despite the difficulty you should give dusk a run next if you havent yet episodes 2 and 3 have some of the bestdesigned maps ive played in a loooong time and its much more accessible than blood imo im so happy to play this game again its doom w a pitchfork ever played the second one what a memory i played thay game when i was 10 the game is good but the price in the steam its much expensive for me your rich shit americans anyone know why when i look up or down in fresh supply it distorts everything cool thanks pc gaming master race ftw dude i remember playing this waaay back in the day save files dont work dont buy this trash jeff i think the cultists are in league with the zombies chris exasperated yes i know its painted with nostalgia but this is one of my fav games would murder a man for switch port lol this is cringe and a half maybe shoot him in the head i was just looking at this game on steam wasnt sure about it glad you doing a lets play i know this game has been patched multiple times but would someone mind telling me how many of these problems have been fixed and how close it is to the original now that there have been multiple patches not everyone experienced all these bugs the bugs were patched very quickly shame it appears theyve just given up on it they fixed a lot but fire damage is weak and some ai stuff is still in the virgin aussie vs the chad prisoner you are not the only one complainingthere are some major glitches that were caused by the remaster where you will have trouble with secrets and progressing through the game i bought the one whole of unit of blood when it was out on steam i think it is now replaced by fresh supply i am sticking with one whole unit lol looking back on it remember when everyone tried to shit on gman because of that one sentece from civvie that was dumb fresh supply isnt perfect now but i love it gmanlives cant help it he comes from the land down under and all that fair dinkum things seem to be better now i havent run into any crashes fire seems somewhat better cultists throw the correct tier of dynamite based on difficulty also damage seems to be fixed i cant waltz into the train station on extra crispy and kill them all with a shotgun blast to the face without dying immediately anymore 0248 im dissappointed with you here set them on fire stop fire and let them burn watch what happens jesus i think its just crazy that these games are making a comeback good times to be had for those that came later i woke up this morning and i was grumpy and i thought to my self today is going to be a great day until i saw this really appreciate the brutal honesty my guy youre an amazing content creator well well loos like mr shillman is pretty cheap to hire fanatic indeed doesnt throw dynamite now it throws bullets 203 ah doctor who mode civvie you have to check the gzdoom remake of blood if you havent already its pretty awesome did they fix it is it still fucked looking forward to play it again but i want the best experience possible a remaster for blood should just be 3d still civvie civvie on the inside lightly civvie well civvie extra civvie dear god this is this is just finally what i waited for honestly this is why you just play dos bloodi just use a ps4 controller and xpadder and it works fine the game is so forgiving with auto aim i never had a problem just wondering if it is worth getting this time when i first saw the review made by gman i just thought man this is too good to be true after all were talking about an old fps with basically no supportnew ports and that has been reeverseengineered so many times with varying degrees of success shameless plug for my blood extra crispy mod for bfs t can somebody tell me how good it is today never played the original but i want to play the best version possible are you okay civvie i mean no gordan ramsay clips thats pretty bad well its called blood fresh supply so of course it was gonna be fuckin raw gman talks a lot of shit i spoke to him when he was fairly new and he called me a fucking idiot when i said alien3 on the mega drive is pretty good nds did a pitiful work game is still flawed in many ways and patch support took a dead end now no more money to nightdive studios in the future from me nblood is much better and accurate piss upon this remaster i suggest to all of you to donate some bucks for nblood dev httpsnukeyktretrohostnet proproject warlock when civvie well he is honestso that is a thing oh he roasted gman xd fucking raw he throw tnt lmao this guy is sad yahtzee just covered this on zero punctuation i suppose that explains the extra traffic outro music httpsmyoutubecomwatchvlofj7vgf67e hey man ggmanlives tries his best i bought fresh supply hours after it was released on steam and i never had any of these glitches happen trump 2020 maga you faggot bow to emperor t muller btfo demtards btfo stay mad and cuck i just bought it every thing is messed upthe pixels are just black and whiteidk wtf to doim actually pissed i wasted money edithttpsyoutubep6qeyzhwwss thats what im experiencing what the hell is with that weird shadow thing that takes over the top half of the screen are they trying to emulate shitty software rendering please get rid of that nightdive 170 fov is a necessary addition for todays nearsighted myopic generation get with the times dude gman shill confirmed whats the name of the song in the end sound like some air song did they fix it i bought it recently and had a blast i like gman but some of his opinions are nuts like thinking quake 4 was one of the best in the series its not and hating sigil 204 its full of scars 311 i love these vocals and sfx lol whats the song you played at the end civvie whats that outro music i hate to be that guy but i would really love to know what song this 543 is i am playing this right now 4 weeks from video and i just wanted to say that now spiders have the right animation when killed with flames and bloated butchers are again weak to fire like in the original also i never experienced fanatics trying to throw tnt like cultists seems that many of the bugs shown here are resolved wouldnt know about things like missing parts of the game like switches and stuff dont remember the original hey civvie wanna play a random custom map i made back in the 2000 its ridicilous i was 12 but anyway had a good start and none of the early problems since the last update it crashes everytime i want to start it piece of shit dont buy i still cant buy it in australia i guess im lucky cuz i have yet to see these crashes lets be honest the enemy damage was always way too highespecially in the fan remakes gman has always been a shit channel they made it hd and fucked up the basic mechanics bravo what a surprise gman putting on 10 pairs of rosetinted glasses to look at anything from the dos era lol and i thought the port of blood that was just a mod of duke 3d was the worst port of blood pro kens labyrinth when i was gonna buy it later today you can also walk up crates like stairs wherein the original game you jump blood 2021 like doom 2016 u feel me thats what we need man cmon thumb it baby o and a spider pops like a tick in fire not in game but reality just saying its like they based this off the terrible doom zblood tc so many similarities did none of them play actual blood can someone remind me what happend with the rights to this game with atari and all that even broken its one of the best game releases this year i had no issues like this until they patched it i couldnt even load my games xd i was expecting so much more from this remaster some updated textures maybe models something fresh to really give it that 2019 spark but i guess im just better off still playing bloodgdx what is the credits song what patch came out like yesterday that fixed most of those bugs including the jumping out of water bug spiders not being damaged by fire etc the dynamite bug and disable run glitch was fixed too thank you for keeping oldschool shooters alive you are a fucking saint sir i really miss the blood filled screen when you get killed too late i already bought it and have had no issuesso far lets hope it stays that way hey civv love your videos but im missing an outlaws 1997 video and a powerslave1995 video as well as willrock video not sure what year this is would love to see your opinions on those 3 games regards its good a version but maybe wait a bit it wouldnt even launch on my desktop at first you noticed all of those flaws and you still missed the most obvious one the location of the crosshair when youre playing with the minimal hud in fresh supply it is located below the center of the screen in the original it was located a bit higher than that over the center of the screen loved that gmanlives jab is the patch on gog that feeling when you realize the remaking devs of your childhood favorite game is a fan of your videos the game is fixed now httpssteamcommunitycomgames1010750announcementsdetail1620645290559247391 patch out is it fixed should have seen your review before buying i watched gman 1st blame on me i even uninstalled bloodgdx reinstalled again playing post mortem fuck the acueducts thanks to that fuck gggman i bought the game wish youd come out with this video a few hours earlier hope they fix it also civvie kiss psycho circus we need it rage 2 civvie rage 2 love ya from korea patch released make it works they just did a huge patch for the game two days after review they fixed the bugs mentioned in this video last night however it still needs some tweaks my save files no longer work and had to start over post mortem which is fine as i was only 3 levels in anyway also yes the saves work still saves from the last version will not work you dingle berries the game is good now dad there was an update btw is this version the only way to play splitscreen multiplayer thats the only reason i wanted to buy it fuck civvie is a good port thanks gmanlives you made lose 1 usd i played the remaster or remake or whateverand i found it good the multiplayer is complete dog shit though a patch has been released 188 httpssteamcommunitycomgames1010750announcementsdetail1620645290559247391fbclidiwar0fk4bvn32yjjkp1xnnomvcivq8rjjvgyso06q9hcivnjuvs9vmokbx0 at 139 that shadow efffect ive made a lot of blood mods in the past but i could never figure out how the map designers made that wall shade i guess the nightdive guys also didnt btw the first time ive played this remake i loved how i could now use modern key configurations easily but then i notice that the brown cultists gets blue when gibedburned that burned and gibbed enemies will explode and disappear i got used to bloods higher difficult levels just to avoid burned and gibbed and burned enemies to disappear that the animated textures are way faster then the original and and that my beloved near 10 years old blood mods do not play right in it some of them even crashes the game bur worked fine in dos blood d damn i love my mods d i still love nightdive studios work tough i just was expecting more from blood fresh supply i guess does blood gdx come with the game or is it just a source port i play doom through gzdoom and love it i bought the wads officially off of steam and now after watching your videos i want to play blood i was able to beat bloodgdx on well done difficulty but fresh supplys well done feels a bit more harder does anyone else feel the same way goddamned save files dont work dont buy this fucking trash hey guys does anyone know the name of the song for the in credits is that part of bloods ost please and thank you great video civvie hows your opinion with this new blood update 188 from the patch notes removing the run glitch feature this has to be the most impressive youtube video of 2019 so far i gasped at diggory doo thanks for being you civvie first you have my curiosity now you have my respect does anyone know the name of the outro song as someone who codes i see a lot of these issues as really easy to fix i wonder why they did such a rushjob project warlock when civvie i couldnt tell what what was supposed to be wrong in that lifeleech comparison well i tried it out before watching this video i noticed the blood splatter effect floats in the air and the zombie heads disappear whereas in the real versions they stay unless you kick them so much they disintegrate also zombie statue glitches but i had no idea about all of the others glad i got it refunded also if you have gdx or nblood its pointless dos blood has always been my favorite way to play the game he has to fix his pc i have been playing it and it is fine dude please give the devs feedback i doubt many knows the game as well as you do can you review amc tc we were all thinking it you were the only one who was honest now thats a fov slider thank god for people like you calling out this bs for what it is while idiots like ggmanlives spew out incoherent babble bloodgdx was the return of blood which i needed its more more accurate to the original game than fresh supply is because it relied on reverse engineering and some leaked code unlike fresh supply which uses a completely new engine without any of the original source code also jace hall who was a leader of the original developers who made blood was trying to bring blood back since he had the full source code but atari was asking for too much for the rights to using it same with night dive but they instead got the rights to remaking the game with the original resources but without the original source code denneys spec to be honest i do not think itt is that bad of a remake no it is not perfect but with duke nukem 20th anniversary edition in mind wich was the shittiest rerelease of a classic game ever i think this one even in its current state it is fully worth the price in contrast with the duke game wich was 3 times the price of this one so dont ba a little cry baby and just buy it in the first level its way mor difficult to get the the doublegun item because you cant walk over the fence like in the old version it sucks i just played blood for the first time ever and i immidiately got crushed by closing doors and died my first death in this game was from a door what even well now i know saw gman do a review was hyped went to buy my favourite game andit didnt even work it wouldnt start now i fell stupid for being blind and i should know better from past experiences what a shame well at least it was cheap i even got a 50 coupon for it it only cost me 4 civvie makin moves out here with that achievement were proud of you dog keep it up lets get this man to 100k can anybody tell me how can i run death wish cutscenes on blood fresh supply just finished the first episode and everything was fine no bugs at all just the music stop playing sometimes this review is too harsh in my opinion gmanlives is a tool the music at the end is so good anyone knows the title you let them off easy civvie not ready for prime time you say fresh supply is a 4 month old fetus night dive games has yanked out mother doss fertile womb and then charged us all an admission fee to see the under developed freakshow while gman collects cheques for singing happy birthday with a straight face as an australian i want this gman deported to a leper colony and not one of the nice ones on an island played the multiplayer for 10 hours saturday night heres a small list of complaintsbugs jump boots did not negate fall damage doors that do not require keys refuse to open or only open once often leaving you stuck in a room unable to continue interface does not tell you what episode is being played or even whether its a deathmatch or not controls are smoother but way overdone to the point of being slippery nothing feels right and then theres the disconnections played through episode1 maps 17 half a dozen times before the connection dropped often only i still dont get how to open boold gdx nice music in the end i might just buy it cuz i have a coupon for it for 50 off on steam you know you can really hear how he doesnt want to say that the game is bad but he still does it because he is being honest big balls ramsay would be proud carmageddon max pack please we need to get this game remastered really sorry to hear about this itd be nice if they fixed it butthey wont damn shame blood was a classic no doubt the dedicated fandom deserves a decent port so they can continue mistaking nostalgia for quality real depression hours atleast theyre trying to fix it i guess goddamn even breaking out the virgin suicides ost c you cant use lara croft cheat before using spork resurrect or you have weapons after spork cheat you cant pick anything neither health its just too fuckin raw pro catfight when bless my eyes fresh supplies also wondering if you might be covering doom 64 maybe psx doom watching other reviews of it i thought it was a great remaster i was about to click buy thank you civvie for saving me from this for the moment i got it works fine i got it on release that sad tune at the end of the video really reflects the view of the remaster big time will you make a video when its all fixed up this review is dumb and malicious unsub when civvie said there was no gordon clips i thought he was joking i thought there was going to be a its fahken roaw right at the end of the video there wasnt thats pretty serious well i guess its a good thing i picked up blood one unit whole blood over this civvie so tru i play in that and itsraw d that friggin gmanlives callout tho holy crap nice well it is the backwards land down under funny enough i noticed something might be wrong once i used dynamite if the zombies are barely behind the ones in the group that got hit there is a chance it might not hit them the sound is better on dos imo i agree totally i got bought this and have an irreconcilable graphical error on everything and most options crash the game as you have showed however the user reviews seems like people are just reviewing blood itself and not this port gog actually refunded my purchase after their support couldnt fix this after 3 days i also cant see much that this does that gdx already does and not to mention now gdx is a hub for all build engine games that installs easily man i was this close to buying this thing but thought i should probably wait for some reviews just to be safe i saw gmans review and thought hey it looks pretty damn good but like you said some things seemed a little off from just watching well here im now and i cant even begin to say how much of shame it is they pushed this out of the door so soon i genuinelly hope they care enough to fix it because if there is a game that deserves a good remaster it is most definitely blood fuck i think i hastily purchased this remaster a bit too early got too excited after gmans review dont forget that this port is incapable of running properly on integrated graphics yet bloodgdx runs fine in fresh supply the screen is littered with white pixels some guy asked the devs if there was a fix but they told him his hardware isnt supported httpssteamcommunitycomapp1010750discussions01649918058737843575ctp2 i bought this game and i was having fun with it being the first exposure to the game am i a bad guy how old is civvie anyways you certainly the best thing that happened to youtube please be you and never sell out its true there is a lot of bugs at current state but it still has blood feeling and all those minor bugs dont ruin it i love it im playing all the way through again this time with friends online geez this is tough to see i wanted to get this but if its as broken as you say then i can happily wait whats that credits music i wanted to play this game because of your videos then i learned fresh supply just came out guess ill wait to buy until they fix it i really want to play this game you know what isnt pink on the inside castle miner z civvie you deserve way more love from us everyone subscribe to him til he reaches to 100k then hell play duke nukem forever this is my favourite channel will you make a followup for whenif they patch it fucking raw i was looking forward to this game but seeing this is just unbelievable first system shock rewhatever now this nightdive dropped the ball yet again as much as i love gman he fucked up big time as i can see here too much didgeridoobies that day you think he can share thatll help i bought it the other day and have played it a little bit i actually like the movement speed the other issues like enemy damage output are likely to get patched soon i still had a better experience with it than bloodgdx i love the understated yet honestsounding disappointment in this video no grand theatric meltdown no condemnation pure tone of goddamnit guys why in this video is very impactful so i should just build the latest commit of nblood and play it again with that well i was going to do that anyway but i was hoping this would be better im glad i watched this i was fixing to buy it but ill wait awhile till they get everything fixed thanks for the video civvie i was actually interested in playing blood for a while and couldnt make up my mind between picking remastered edition or bloodgdxnblood it costs 3 bucks to me so i dont give a fuck about its bugs and glitches thanks for the upload civvie ur the boss not to mention that saving takes way too long and true 3d is off by default black cultist hands in the air pardner shoots finger guns caleb dies i have old mad hd 7570m and vulkan work goodif u have nvidea maybe not work idk thank you for posting this thanks for nice insight finished blood gdx in december last year on well done bought this version for half of a price no regrets but it would be nice if they fix it this video must reach to the nightdive studios eyes and ears this is honestly a very well done review you were honest and too the point and hopefully they fix the game enough i think they soft launched and it might take a few more weeks to fix it hopefully either way it looks like a good port that is in too early of a state to be released still bought it still having one heck of a good time are here crazy vision effect when spider bite you when you die with lit dynamite in your hand the dynamite disappears instead of eventually detonating in your dead hand like its supposed to also no autosaving after completing a level that absolutely threw me off after i got used to it in bloodgdx but it wasnt in the original so its whatever yo big up on this video ive never played blood and after watching gman i was finna buy it i think ill wait before i do so its so raw the fucking beast is still alive gmans a shill word on the street and nightdives discord is theyre patching their butts off hopefully this means we get two civvie 11 videos for one game but yeah its pretty pink right now needs some more time on the bbq whats the music playing during the credits also im kinda sad at the state of this remaster and the fact that gmanlives ignored many pressing issues regarding this one i will buy it after they iron out many of the bugs present i literally had this in the cart to buy thank you for saving me the cost and disappointment right now thanks for this honest review civ i love the gman and almost fell for his bullshit review this saved me time money and from being disappointed until itpatched right so gman is a dishonest snake like me gmanlives probably hasnt played a ton of blood so these differences probably wouldnt have been noticed either that or he is more forgiving i noticed he was quite forgiving of project warlock very very forgiving at that but with blood fresh supply despite its issues it still can be fun for people who like build engine games but havent played blood civvie it hurts me that we got to this place to the folks shitting on gmanlives did it ever occur to you that maybe just maybe he didnt encounter every bug that civvie 11 and others did theyre called bugs for a reason hell other than some floating blood textures and misplaced sound effects and dx11 not displaying sky boxes my copy runs and performs like a charm is there room for improvement absolutely but lets show the world that gamers can act like mature adults and report the bugs without resorting to childish namecalling i was really surprised to see it was already out so soon after it had been announced i knew it was too quick and something wasnt going to be right like all software today release it quickly and patch it later was the mentality i have not had any of these issues did not toy around with the settings much though and only finished the first episode so far hopefully theyll be quick to patch this version up to be exactly what blood fans desire it to be i know what that gman dude smokes its called money huehuehue thanks for the warning ill be livestreaming the gdx version tonight then i like the outro song wheres it from hey civvie 11 can you do pro doom 3 anytime soon please im actually fairly new to build engine games im a doom guy through and through played a bit of duke as a kid but thats it i own one unit whole on gog and was playing it since the start of the year and ive not noticed much of a difference between the games its interesting to see how jarring it must be to a seasoned player im enjoying it though not sure which version ill play more but im definitely having fun i remember kaiser bragging back in december about how he dissassembled the game for years and how he knows how the game works well judging by what ive played in the end i came to understand that kaiser was full of shit well hopefully hell get some coffee with those 5 to wake the fuck up and fix this inaccurate mess of a port from a good ports like doom64ex and turok to this i guess the time shows no mercy to everyone gonna stick to the gdx and nblood for now i honestly feel tempted to buy it just to give nightdive more incentive to iron it out i want this to be a success goddamnit sad to hear but nightdive are good folks sure theyll fix it i didnt notice these issues when i played it but thats likely because i only completed the first episode and majority of the stuff mentioned seems to involve things much later in the game before someone revokes my blood fanboy club card i got distracted as the postman delivered rage 2 early first for local post office so caleb had to make room for the good ol id in my calendar gggman gets paid by companies to make good reviews its sad really he used to be good thank you cv11 you are not cheap bastard like gmanlives who just totally sell his ass out for who knows maybe for nothing which is even worse im gonna say the nblood even i noticed something was really off with the dynamite handling and i dont play blood a huge amount the odd sound effects handling the crashing when attempting to change vsync on to off the improper cd audio handling its way too fucking loud not to mention the inclusion of quake door sounds that arent supposed to be there the bugs and crashes are inexcusable they should have already had a handle on this as this is the same engine as used in the forsaken remaster and doom64ex hold on tight the ride might get a little fucking raaaaaaaawwwwwwwwww damn the bloated butchers now take forever to be killed by fire edit can someone please name the song playing at the end of the video so all the other originals are actually patch 10something where as fresh supply is patch 184 surely that makes a big difference now im not saying they didnt get some things wrong but its a much more balanced and newer version of the game that they remastered so obviously theres gonna be some differences no i still have a lot of fun playing it you shouldve mentioned how gog and steam players cant play together in mp thank you so much for your honest review i bought it anyway just to support the devs itll get better with patches broken i mean for fuck sake man stop yeah its buggy and has a bunch of shit going on but i wouldnt say its broken nothings stopping you from playing to the end theyve acknowledged this and opened a report thread on the steam forums for people to report the inconsistencies and bugs theyll patch things still tho i wouldve been happy waiting a little longer for them to iron it out before release but its fine im playing and having fun why does it even need a remaster i think theyll appreciate your honesty and critique 200 now were fookin master fov yeve got eyes on the back of yer fookin ead i bought it day one release after watching gggmanlives review lol havent had a chance to play it yet fuckin raw fuck off i love you but ive been playing this for three days straight but havent witnessed any kind of glaring bug or had any kind of crash you are right about fire attacks tho i knew i was right to wait for you and how the fuck did gman miss all of that i noticed that when i used the spray can it started firing at the ceiling even though i was aiming straight ahead also the voodoo doll wasnt hitting enemies i was clearly aiming at i experienced only one issue when changing the resolution the first time i had a stubborn black screen for those who bought the game put it in windowed mode and compatible with windows 8 it works fine now the only thing i dont like is the sliding when you jump on things this is weird even though it is not a big deal other than that it runs on direct x11 3840x2160 with ambient occlusion and all fov setting is nice i feel like you can go up to 95 without feeling too much distortion but it is a personal preference here i think it is a really good game especially if you havent played nblood or bloodgdx like me and dont want to get into tweaking anything while waiting for ion maiden prodeus and wrath eaon of ruin i was hoping he was gonna do cryptic passage i think it has some of the coolest levels in the game i like the honesty and lack of bashing you make a lot of good informed points good and honest video i respect you despite your disgustingly miserable castlevania playing skills 204 civvie achieved singularity the didgeridoobies line made me crack up even when youre doing a solemn takedown like this its still gold love ya cv11 played on well done and the only thing i noticed is calebs voice is too low and the fire seems too weak after that i never found any faults or anything i can complain about and also dynamite feels kinda wrongdifferent ill stick with gdx enemy alert sounds dont play sometimes 101 calebs voice lines volume too low 109 tesla shoots 4 projectiles instead of 5 120 textureflat tiling bug 126 ctd when changing from dx11 to vulkan environmental shadows missing 137 e3m1 i think less damage from enemies on same difficulty as dosbox notably fanatics 145 fov slider goes up to 180 spiders show burning to death animation when killed by spraycan 215 jumping physics odd 219 jumping out of water allows you to reach higher ledges than vanill 223 bloated butchers dont take appropriate damage from spraycan they take much more damage to kill 241 life leech less effective does less damage aoe 310 fanatics dont throw dynamite but still play the throwing animation 355 run glitch variable stops cultists from throwing dynamite 430 will this come out on xbox one as i cant find anything about the other releases are you considering making a video on project brutality mod what im getting from this and the other typically positive reviews ive seen is that your enjoyment of this will depend to an extent on your familiarity with the original game im digging the fuck out of it and havent noticed any bugs just yet but if youve been playing this for years and have an intimate feel for how the thing works then it may come across as unpleasantly jarring and unfaithful to its source thanks civvie im no blood expert like at all only started playing it properly on nblood but when i watched the release trailer for this remaster something seemed off i couldnt recall the floor explosion animation happening in the air so i purposely held off buying this to wait for your seal of approval so glad i did i hope you can find the time to do another video post patch freecivvie i love blood its a secret brother of duke3d bloodgdx sounds interesting civvie seeing as this needs to be fixed whats the best way to play blood right now what are the ports like how about a video for someone like me who is completely fucking clueless about this shit recently found your channel and fuck youtube for not recommending it sooner cancer mouse i fucking love cancer mouse edit just got to your pro blood videos gdx it is i just got word from the support team that my intel gpu isnt supported by the engine because it is legacy nblood and bloodgdx work just fine with it so does gzdoom and eduke32 so i wont be able to play fresh supply for a while im just going to refund it sad you know this actually makes me want to research into other kex engine rereleases doom 64 ex powerslave ex turok turok 2 system shock etc this is so sad alexa play dispacitto gmanlives smokes crack kaiser had to reverse engineer it since no one would give or even know where it is bloods source code to nightdive if you get it on steam theres already a beta branch to try out and yes steam has the same discount basically bought it twice ill wait a bit for some fixing but looking at their turok and turok 2 support this will get better enemies dont bleed and gib as in the original game vodoo dolls hit detection seems broken pedestrians dont make sounds when running away explosions in midair use the wrong sprite living gargoyle statues dont bleed and cant be pushed blood pools tend to fly above ground fresh supply gets less fun the longer i play so many glitches so its like uncooked blood pudding civvie11 i hope you stay true like you always do no matter the backlash the world chico and everything in it thanks for the straight talk look at this httpswwwmoddbcommodsbloodthecursehunter gg possibly got paid but more likely just shilled to a game he really likes im so surprised gmanlives didnt say anything about these changes in his video theres no private co op and that makes me sad i came here before i was gonna buy it thanks for the heads up will wait for the patch will you do a follow up after bugfixes well thats sad but im not surprised about gmanlives tho i once got into an argument with him by saying that isle of the dead was unplayable and he didnt like that he was and is convinced that its playable and i have to give credit where its due isle of the dead isnt that buggy and it doesnt crash but those arent the only requirements for a game to be playable edit not to mention that gmanlives talked an insultingly short 45 seconds about how good the port is while he spent the rest of the time going on about how great the original game was in the comments i asked him if it had any of those wonky issues like the mouse acceleration in shadow warrior redux and he claimed no i knew something was up with the game and that it wasnt as perfect as he portrayed it i fuckin knew it editedit my comment about isle of the dead being unplayable is gone and i didnt remove it im not accusing him of doing it buuuuut its gone its really weird to see one youtuber praise the blood remaster than immediately seeing another call it a glitchy mess why did gmanlives never mention anything about these glitches i doubt he never noticed them considering he plays blood as well damn calling out gggman i watched his review a couple days ago when it dropped and he genuinely said he couldnt find anything wrong with this remaster glad we got civvie to keep it real still love gggman but when it comes to blood civvie is my go to i was hyped to see this finally out i enjoyed it a lot i am definitely going to enjoy it more when they patch it the coop and multiplayer crashes a bit more than just solo as well as the other issues you pointed out good video hopefully the patch will fix these issues i am sad to see that so many people have jumped on the gman hate bandwagon dont get me wrong his review is objectively flawed and he isnt a particularly indepth reviewer to start with but but but but but people have different values for what they look for in games as well as blind spots shit lgr actually likes duke nukem forever yes he is a duke nukem fanboy but he is also a sims fanboy and still ripped into that for months on end despite getting free dlc from ea my point is dont call someone a shill unless you have damn good evidence to back yourself up dont attribute to malice what could just as easily be ignorance or stupidity i waited for civvies review because i figured it would have more indepth thoughts considering the amount of love he has for the game you can tell just from the footage that gman never played the game to that degree and from his reviews on old ps2 games that he likes different elements in fps in general and that is okay it is par wait a year and then make pro blood fresh supply video 1 year specifically because everything should be fixed then this shows that you really are a pro blood player its the little details that will make or break this revamp in this video youve given the devs a lot to think about you have tegrity if you think this is glitchy try playing cryptic passage thanks dude this is why i was waiting to see what you thought before going near it i wanted at least one rew at the end gmanshills stale supply whats the song at the end though they should talk to you to fix all these problems you seem like a pool of knowledge for these things great work as always keep it up thanks for your honest review civvie agree with the gmanlives comment after he recommended duke nukem forever i bought it and i have wished eternal damnation upon him ever since methinks he sniffeth too much lynx ill wait for a patch the lack of enemy warning sounds is a huge loss for me not only does it seriously harm gameplay on the harder difficulties but it hinders the scary atmosphere too how amazing is this game when a modern remaster cant accomplish the same quality was gonna buy this if they ever ported it to console to play with my cousin but after this im reconsidering even the pc version fresh supply 4k maybe some new mods in the future i wasnt huge into blood when i was a kid but it was one of the first shooters i played i was going to buy this after watching gmans review but now ill hold off for a bit thanks a commercial remake that fares worse than free ones by fans now where have i seen that before pretty much everywhere ah yes also gggmanlives hes a complete asskisser and a corporate tool he just writes fakes positive reviews to keep getting review keys and swag from the companies like a complete sellout and to keep his place on the mainstream do you guys still watch gmanlives videos looks like this guy started playing video games yesterday so much that he needed to play prey 2017 twice for not having understood the game in the first time and i do not even need to talk about the fallout 76 review he proclaims itself a boomer i still dont know what the fuck this means maybe is some new term that kids are using nowadays and all but its just a casual and a fucking child who keep talk shit about the mothers of the people in the comments of his videos hes nothing but a muggle for me the cultist are the most accurate theyve ever been their damage seems stronger than ever and they whip dynamite like crazy i think lots of different glitches are poppin up for different systems and oss for me the aiming has never felt better compared to my experience with dos and both nblood and gdx just like turok 2 nd will get these issues fixed soon enough gggman is a total shill now its sad a real shame the remaster isnt quite up to snuff to give us the authentic blood experience we were hoping for unfortunately i bought it the day gman released his video on it on the bright side i played through the first episode and had no issues mind you this is my first time actually playing it despite growing up with 90s fps games myself so i wouldnt have noticed certain intricacies like you did civ i dont know the first thing about getting the other unofficial releases of blood to run on my computer so i was really invested in getting this remaster and i hope the dev team work out the kinks you addressed in the video gman has paid reviews however im pretty sure they will fix these in a month i wouldnt give up on this this easily gggmanlives is a goof gmanlives something that i complaing isnothing cv11 make this video what side i gonna pick now civvies endless love for blood was tested by the rushed and bugged state of this remaster this is why i watch civvie you aint afraid to tell it like it is even if it hurts ive seen you tear into a few things that i was blissfully ignoring in the past and while it hurt to hear the truth you just keep doing whats best for us all continue its so raw theres still blood coming out cool aww c at the very least they are aware and are working on patching the game i mean it still sucks that this happened but at the very least it could end up being the remaster port this game deserves thank you for being so honest about this civvie many critics reviewers just people in general could learn a lot from you regarding that gggman praised the broken remaster i mean what else would you expect from the guy who defended randy bitchford i cant even try it it stops working while loading a level i know all this isnt your fault but im still gonna blame it on you the dev team spent all their time looking for an obscure reference so they could shoehorn in your steam achievement and look what happens its a goddamn catastrophe bummer i wanted to buy it but as long as the dev team compromises to fix it i will keep an eye on it i wanted a remake of this heretic hexen 12 and bungies marathon games well this is kinda disheartening holy shit congrats on the achievement shout out and yeah bought this immediately the floating blood bugged the shit outta me but damn didnt play long enough to notice most of those other issues hopefully patches will happen but i definitely dont get why they put this out in this state i do like the custom difficulty option if they can fix all these issues this could be the best way to play it but they got some work to do remastered more like picked up dusted off had animate dead cast on it and had a brandnew price tag slapped on it this remaster is disgrace and desecration of a heros resting place my point is that even if the bugs were fixed there is still no reason for a remaster that improves nothing holy crap like everyone else here i was stoked after watching gmans review i almost bought the damn thing i really really appreciate your review guess i am sticking with nblood too raw and too close to home to gordon ramsey meme 0 look im gonna level with you dynamite is expensive shit and we couldnt afford to supply all our lowlevel goons with it so we just gave it to a few then trained them to pretend like theyre throwing it once they run out sometimes you just have to make do with what you got in these bizarro deathcults you know whats with the made to order difficulty setting well guess ill have to postpone the purchase i really wonder what gman was actually smoking when he said that fresh supply was built from original source code i do appreciate the brutal honesty civvie looking forward to the fixed version also btw im also a huge fan of gman i think he was just a little blinded by having a new version of blood i know i was this is why i support you on patreon youre the real deal noticing all this stuff and holding developers accountable probably this video will be used as a checklist of things to fix by the dev 204 my god its full of stars ahhh fuck thats real disappointing to hear civvie glad you called out gman i was like wtf about how different your take is great job too many glitches so bad it crashes everytime you try to save only problem i had was with multiplayer didnt pick up on half the problems you did dont bother with this get bloodgdx its also free my main issue is the sound the weapons are way too quiet sometimes and caleb is either really loud or really quiet which is obnoxious you gotta be down if you dont pull out the fooking raw to be honest i think ive been fortunate enough to not experience as many bugs as everyone else so ive had a pretty flawless experience with it so far but ive felt like physics and movement was a bit off since i started the first map at least my suspicions werent completely wrong like maybe someone else can voice their opinion but i swear it feels like you move faster but jump slightly lower giving you less air control im completely missing a few jumps that id normally make on the original at times and it feels so unnatural due to muscle memory damn he roasted gggman well done has civvie played wolfenstein tno 205 im just runnin through the 90s so bloodgdx is still the best ive been waiting for years for blood to finally get some decent attention and when the remake was announced i thought that this was a good sign if this goes well maybe there will be a decent sequel but then i played it on launch and it was underwhelming and the multiplayer was crap i dont understand why no one else is mentioning thisunless they didnt grow up with this game so thanks for being honest and saying what i was thinking friendly reminder that civvie is creating comedy videos and reviews patreon httpswwwpatreoncomcivvie11 well i guess i will continue playing gdx for a while then will we get an update when its in a better state civvie well if they named an achievement after one of your videos then that means theyre definitely gonna see this video you know as much about the subtle nuance and details about this game as i do in classic sonic games and the original doom trust me thats a lot so id trust your judgement and so should they maybe they can even get with you personally to help iron out the wrinkles in this one idunno im just a commenter on youtube i havent had any issues but to be fair i never played blood before this i played duke nukem 3d shadow warrior and ion maiden now being that i havent played before and hearing these complaints i can totally see some of them but for someone who has no experience in the game i havent had any problems i also havent crashed yet but i have only played half the game still i dont think its a bad remaster but from what you are saying it definitely needs some updates grats on getting an achievement named after something you said thats fucking awesome could there possibly be a follow up video i am know i am echoing this but i really respect you being honest about this man this is good shit what better feedback for the dev than the guy who lives and breathes blood remake all it is is textures at best modern gaming industry everyone i noticed that when i try to use quick save i still end up spawning at the beginning of the stage im not sure if its just a normal bug or if its cause i mapped quick save off of the f keys when i saw ggmans review i couldnt wait to see your reaction sucks that it actually is pretty bad but could we get that blood 2 remaster though real shame i bought it a couple days ago and im still having a blast so heres hoping for some hotfixes the bloated butchers still go down with 2 shots from the flare gun so i think the issue might be the spray can itself it doesnt do as much direct damage but it still sets enemies on fire and maybe thats what actually does the damage weird bug that sucks thanks for doing the hard thing and telling it like it is hopefully they fix this yeah i fired it up friday night and i noticed by the end of level 1 that jumping seemed a little clunkier i wasnt able to make that bunny hop to the secret napalm launcher within ten tries could be my fault but it wasnt an issue two weeks ago when i replayed bloodgdx to prep for the rerelease didnt play long enough to catch the other stuff though hope it gets resolved before i give the game a full run through edit the first glitch i encountered was the floating blood though literally my second kill into the game glad i put it away for the night before getting my heart broken i prefer to have my bad news broken to me by cancermouse and co i have faith in them patching it hell if ea ubisoft and activision can put out broken games without even a thought then i have no right to be impatient with someone actually putting in the workhours also no happy mothers day to you cv16 he has a loving family already those kids arent yours focus on removing those black frames great video c11 but hey whats the song at the credits hold on tight the ride might get a little buggy and here i was getting through chapter 3 im glad im not a veteran of blood or its multiple incarnations id be pissed too im still having fun spending 3 flares on the fat zombies and watching them run on fire not like i need that much ammo in lightly broiled i could try dusk while they fix this one these old fpss are such a hoot okay lets be honest here ggmanlives is synonymous with shill i bought fresh supply a few days ago and i have not played the original so i dont have much to add in this being a remaster but i do enjoy the time so far even though it does have its hiccups and odd bugs here and there i hope they patch it close to its original as possible yeah jumping physix was broken i noticed at e1m1 blood gdx is more enjoyable how this is official the gman or should i say shillman has been a little liar for a while now fallout 76 rage 2 preview anthem preview project warlock preview etc have shown exceptionally bad support on his part for games that are either really buggy on release or in the case of anthem or fallout 76 you can tell its a dogshit game but hes intentionally being overly positive for potential future benefits i know you havent seen your family in awhile cv11 but i want you to know that we on the security team intercepted a letter from your aunt to you and your uncle that we destroyed for having positive reinforfement razor blades and the details of your mothers disappearance in it happy fucking mothers day youre doing gods work civvie somebody has to protect the sacred trilogy of build does fresh supply add more mouse options ive been playing bloodgdx and i cant get the mouse to feel right for the life of me i mean my dosbox works just fine so why do i want this theyll have to cook it again because this remaster is still pink on the inside aw man i was hoping to do another run through soon i have faith they will fix it good of you hit the nail on the head though as it is terribly broken i do so hope though they stick to it pink on the inside like your momma fish eye extreme g mode i dont regret buying it as a first time player id still say this remaster is is better than gdx because of the control and mouse movement it just feels smoother and better to play blood fresh supply pro grezzo due when damn and i bought this out of pure hype and the hopes of rebooting the bloodbath scene to any extent oh well i had the coupon at least still glad to give this game financial support but i hope they patch it quick you callin out gman fuck you you piece of shit theres only one opiion that maters die lol jk xd aw man now theyre gonna fix the levitating pools of blood thats the best bit about this release all the blood splatters at eye level heh theyll disable the run glitch fix thing entirely next patch or now if you get the beta httpssteamcommunitycomapp1010750discussions01649918058737843575ctp2 if they are fans of your work youd think they really would want to avoid releasing something so raw gggmanlives blown the fck out i see a lot of they will fix it comments for this video it really saddens me that they released a broken mess an old simple game from a longago era ends up being as buggy as the rest of the modern gaming goodness this is just depressing great to have two opinions great video whats that outro song goddamm nigthdive you had one job one fucking job but i guess is common nowadays to release a half ass baked game eh its fucken raw gggmanlives was put under a spell by the cultists thats why his review was crap twitch this is like when an episode ends with dead silence in the credits well i am holding my breath i sure hope they can fix these issues enjoying it so far but im not nearly as familiar with blood as you and didnt notice anything other than jumping being a little different i wont be refunding the custom difficulty makes it worth it for me personally omg he called out gman call the police lol a tear travels down my cheek didgeridoobies god i love you civvie not just because ive had my misgivings about gmanatwork in the past oh wow i was excited to play this new remaster and im glad i watched your review before i dove in to the game head first the virgin remaster vs the chad java source port quicksaving is also horrifically busted good to know i was thinking about picking it up are you going to take a look at ion maiden or have i missed it im pretty new to your channel keep up the good work gmans video is more a blood review while civvies video is a review of blood fresh supplymaybe gmans brain is off one of of those walkabouts oof this was painfully honest its a bittersweet thing really leaving your mark on a beloved game only to see it flying off a cliff while on fire that sadish music at the end really sells it great to see constructive criticism not harassment or arse kissing thanks civvie still waiting for pro turok wellat least i got it for half off seems that some of these things have already been fixed according to the steam forums which is good the remaster is honestly my first time playing blood i bought it after seeing gmanlives review of it thinking that he hadnt set me wrong yet its not bad but yeah i can definitely see a lot of glitches still better than a lot of aaa releases meh its 10 dollars ill buy it and just wait for patch to play be a larger deal if it was 40 to 60 well i suppose i oughta switch to blood gdx while they fix the issues also ggmanlives or whatever his name is now is super annoying every five minutes he feels the need to throw in a lol being pc is lame amirite guize i feel like this was a perfect video to bring ramsey back at least once i miss him having read up on how atari has deliberately neglected mistreated blood ever since they got the rights to iti suspect someone at the top has a dislike of the game im surprised this came out at all but it looks like a barely better release than what the fans have made and i would wager theyll do 1 or 2 minor patches to fix a few things then call it quits atari may not even care if things are broken and will probably give the dev team only so much money and time before moving them to another project which is a shame this should have been better i can understand a few minor issues as they do not have the original source codeeven nblood feels off to me i have to be closer to switches doors to use them i have compared this to my dosbox setup nor can i compare to bloodgdx as it would never runboot despite redneckgdx working fine but it seems there are too many bugs popping up that other ports havent dealt with and a port thats trying too many new fancy things welp i guess ill wait keep is updates ciivie i bought it and am now a bit doubtfulwondering if i should return it things just generally felt off about this version i know throwing tnt and its explosion radius felt off as well what digeridoobies gman is smoking my fucking sides mate nice one cunt i told you it wouldnt touch gdx bloodgdx is near perfect and the closest to the original feel gameplaywise just gonna slide that fov into 999 and slip on into the matrix civvie any chance of a video on the painkiller games son of a bitch must pay dam i was really looking forward to this guess i have to wait a bit stephan weyte caleb is one of the voices in my miniseries antihero watch it for free on my channel im working with him on other projects too my game never had these issues though finished the whole thing without a crash too your problem is that you arent australian whats ur outro song also huge fan of the pro blood series but you should continue the duke nukem one i tried the coop sometimes its impossible to pick up items or open doors and if you die you can heal yourself with the doctors bag and walk around but only on your end why is literally nobody else mentioning all these issues purchased the game based off all these reviews expecting a flawless blood experience and what do i get fucking black screensystem lock up when changing video settings and pressing the auto save button what a joke nice to see that blood gets so much love on this channel despite some boring and annoying enemies like spiders and stone gargoyles i love the game 205 pyrocynical mode activated ggmanlives is on acid playing fresh supply its completely broken but i found a fix for this put blood gdx on the fresh supply or nblood and you can play the game fine now nevertheless if youve never played blood before dont wait im having the time of my life playing this thing for the first time coming from a guy who couldnt get into build engine games for ages no way am i saying these criticisms arent justified im just saying dont bother waiting because while there are obvious problems you wont notice them as a new player and more importantly they wont break the experience damn your right glad you covered this one did they fix the run glitch glitch by completely removing the option was wondering why fire didnt seem useful to me against the butchers after your video said it was yeah thought gman was high honestly i completely agree with almost all of the complaintsbut at the same time its still fuckin blood so its still worth the purchase to me at least kaiser and the rest of nds are smart peeps and i expect them to be on top of it in no time but even then honestly fuck it i still like it warts n all mad props civvie youre a man of the people pro blood when civvie honestly i think ive watched it all around 10 times in the last 6 months started 11 last night good thing i have the dosbox version raw i think blood fresh supply is still kicking sometimes i think gman gets paid to say its good hey civvie if they fix it id really love to hear from you if they do since you actually care about it improving not kissing its ass not trashing it just to trash it if you say its good ill get it then i was so waiting for this video finally the opinion of a professional thank you civvie 11 well thats unfortunate to hear especially after i already dropped the moolah for this version still for me nightdives folks have had a great track record before this doom 64 ex turok forsaken and i wanna believe theyll patch this up to par and give us a damn fine remaster you know we really could have used this info earlier before buying it and the forums are full of apologists for a broken game that never should have been released in this state also screw ggman the shill who never fails to randomly release completely unrealistic reviews damn i bought this game because i watched that other freaks video first fuck i just bought this off gog on account of wanting to try the series oh well easier is probably best for someone like me whos far from pro why do the cultists say hero shit playing build engine games on windows 98 mouse input is instant with vsync off ofc how its supposed to feel the ports ive played of the build engine feels interpolated and emulated or something its just not the same mouse feel not even eduke32 and its such a shame because doom ports for example are ultra crispy at locked 35fpscn prboom zdoom on win7 10 is whole next level screwup again fuck it just not build engine the duke3d and sw remasters are especially bad dukesterx on winxp with an old eduke32 maybe 10y ago felt okay not super crispy as win98 dos blood you could get to run on winxp with vdm sound driver or something and worked really well actually theres some directwritedrawinput thats getting ported weirdly for sure in all these ports and its such a shame we really need some help from those 60y old guys today who originally worked on the games to help port what tricks they used to get the same feel with new systems the dynamite also felt kinda off tbh when i first used it in e1m1 it killed one of the first two zombies but did 0 damage to the guy standing next to him had to pitchfork his boney ass 7 times who knows what sticky gggman was smoking but maybe now he can afford more tough love is real love civvie why the fuck did nightdive and atari just release this with as far as i know no announcement ahead of time dont they know that doing that is awful for business was this not the original release date did atari force nightdive to release the game before it was ready subs to gman i think nobody else gave it a good review because they all wanted to get a video out before you did lol glad you take time to put the extra details in while i do like gmanlives he does mess up in his reviews stalker is definitely the biggest one for me but i actually hadnt played it and the review made me want to play it more i honestly think he just didnt have that much experience with og blood and thought everything that was in this was normal theres also the possibility he didnt encounter a bug or glitch because he was lucky i guess overall while i wouldnt suggest him for a final review maybe a first but just know he isnt as great as a reviewer as he can be youre doing the world a favor putting out an honest psa a lesser person would have let the shout out go to their head but im glad to see that not how you roll youre the reason i bought blood i hope they appreciate your work not gonna lie when i heard this remaster was coming out i went and bought it immediately because of watching you play through and talk about it i had no idea it was broken tho thanks for the heads up i personally get a graphical glitch that renders everything in the wrong colors so it looks like im playing blood with a fucking cga color palette this only happens on directx 11 when i change it to vulkan or opengl the game straight up wont boot i dont know how nightdive fucked this up so bad system shock and strife remasters were awesome so first i want to make it clear that i am extremely new to these oldschool fps games i guess they are called and the blood remastered is the first one ive played besides dusk dont know where to classify it i cant speak for ai or shading and stuff compared to gdx or nblood but ive never experienced the crashes and stuff i hear about all the time maybe ive misunderstood but it seems like everyone has issues with it crashing but me literally has never crashed once i wish atari would have just released the source code i was debating on buying this all weekendvery glad i watched this video before making any purchases i think ill wait a few months and check to see if most of the glitches are gone until then i always have one unit whole and nblood thx for great vid glad you said those things i love blood im playing on gdx all the time was excited for the new release but it just gave me a headache so many things broken cant save properly with the label on it there is no option for secretkill counter even my chosen options with fov and other stuff cant seem to be saved when i reset the game they are again on the deafault ill just wait a bit just like you ill wait for them to clear up this mess pro blood part 6 soon every version of this game i own is broken how the fuck am i supposed to play this game you jerk off about constantly guess ill stick to the dos version like i did with duke 3d thats a shame i played it a bit felt like activating some secrets was a bit iffy and sometimes i thought i was misremembering where they were but i wasnt great vid man really helped me make the decision to hold off until things are fixed gaygaygaymanlives exposed as fraud on the plus side if you buy the remaster you also get the original blood from there you can get the files you need to play nblood the biggest flaw in this remaster is that enemies cant see you through those room over room portals and that gib sprites dont appear hopefully they can fix a lot of this stuff ill be honest im having 0 problems with the game so far no crashes the sound is fine voices are coming nice and clear no graphic glitches at all and enemies are behaving as they should dude its a shame you are having these problems but i can only speculate that it is related to your pc or something like that hope they fix it soon so it can work properly for everyone they probably just gave gman some money that seems to make him like things more thank you for actually digging into this port and finding the inaccuracies its a shame that night dive couldnt get this one right since from what i recall the turok and system shock ports were great got to admit it takes some stomach to call out something like this especially when theres an achievement added just as a reference to you andits a sign of damn fine integrity civvie its also pretty eyeopening since gmans review came outblisteringly quickly and this explains it all too well he just skipped over it went yep that looks vaguely like blood damn shame butit is what it is why is it that not even remasters of old games can be released without myriads of bugs these days this just sucks they broke blood this does have some problems but i have to give nightdive credit for adding as many features as they have it just needs a little more time to fix some bugs and rebalance it the fact that it has 8 player split screen just blows my mind though im really curious to try this out on my 60 4k tv thank you for speaking the truth even if it hurts all of you who are saying its raw its not raw its just pink on the inside they took it out of the oven too early just give it a few more months its all be okay well thats a shame i had heard the remaster had some bugs but i didnt think it could be crippling like the fire damage descaling im lucky enough to have had very few glitches happen yet and this games extra crispy is a lot easier than gdx so far flare gun damage and sound distance seem off but nothing else im having fun with the game and i hope the glitches get patched but its understandable that you might wait to buy your mileage will very you just fed gggmanlives in the ass i dunno what didgerydoobies gman is smokingshots fired given the current state of the industry and the much better quality of their other remasters up to now i wouldnt be surprised if it wasnt entirely nightdives fault i suspect there was some sort of executive meddling from warner brothers or atari possibly in the form of some dipshit exec demanding that the they release the game prematurely in the hopes of getting some extra seasonal profits or some stupid crap like that i wont refund it anyways at least nms watches this so that means they could take notes hope they do yeah of course gggman gave it a positive review hes a paid shill who loves defending broken buggy games i noticed after the f76 video and when he started to get invited to those preview events with other games journalists dude is a confirmed sellout hey i have found out you can respawn if you die if you have doctors bag you can still use it while dead and live again tho you wont have any weapons 205 oh shit weve entered the caleb zone i think its fantastic overall and im equally nitpicky about blood but yeah it needs about three more coats of polish before its the definitive version i just hope they fix the multiplayer crashes fast because the multiplayer is going to have a short life as it is and id like to enjoy it while it lasts so i guess the game is shit if civvie get to 100k subs that other guy wont have to remind us about the dnf video anymore somehow i knew it also civvie ill continue to say youre the best youtuber out there right now your honesty heres 1 reason why i played through the whole port each episode with all secret level and had crashed 6 fucking time in 5 hour play through the cultists are making pain sounds they never made zomies are just hitting walls even though there is nothing there half time i hear zombies head get stuck in the wall and quick saving can take up to 15 seconds depends on the map size and sometimes when i would just i would go so high i would actually take damage i dont know what makes it happens i just happens out of no where thank you civve for being honest and may a fucking hard drive with all different old of duke nukem forever with bag of money that will last you for rest of your life ps i could hear him talk but not the music as a pc novice i am at least thankful i can easily play this with a pad or at least have my bindings actually save unlike the other steam version i have had a number of instances of frame skipping lag the screen will freeze a second or two but the games still going this is on my basic laptop but it should be able to handle this game shadow warrior doesnt have that problem for me 819 i like it a lot because there is no other legit way to get it in germany legaly product shouldnt have even been made i did notice the glitches after playing a while things are a bit off i will say that i have faith in nightdive studios to fix this they have done amazing work in the past and im sure that they will listen to criticism i wish they would experiment with the voxels for enemies it seems that the best bet of ever getting good looking sprites in 3d will be to use voxels i mean voxels look good for everything else so far i really hope they fix this i want to love this remaster so much now i dont know if its just me but does anyone else get really really weird fov warping when looking up and down this is so similar to grezzo2 its okay civvie you can blame atari for this i know you want to gah damn dude been lookin forward to this glad i didnt buy it yet ill wait till they fix it atleast im not the only one who was disapointed for a moment after seeing all those other youtubers saying how good it is i thought i just expected much more but i guess it really was just bad also it would be much better if blood got a total rework like give it a storyline rebuild the levels with modern graphics make it a bit more gory its worth it i dont know what they are waiting for it pains me that both duke nukem and shadow warrior both had such a cool remake but not blood civvie 11 doesnt spend half of his review time complaining about sjws or any current bullshit altlite cause celebr honestly critiques things he loves instead of shilling and doesnt talk like a fuckin moron has anyone noticed how gimped the jumping in fresh supply feels like just try to get the duel wielding power up in e1m1 without going through the window and youll see what i mean honestly thats my one and only complaint damn shame guess ill wait then thanks civvie hopefully theyll take this in stride and fix the glitches so what version should i get to play blood for the first time this doesnt exactly bode well for the system shock remake nightdive should get their shit together i hope the devs understand you only do this out of love are the controls for this version of blood keyboard or can i use my game controller didnt have a single technical issue on vulkan in one and a half episodes i went through and fanatics dont try to throw dynamite either bloated butchers are resistant to fire though had a fun on all the cheap bitches in comments acting all fussy and blabbing about refunds they will never request so what youre saying is its fuckin raw yeah i felt some stuff felt super off but since i havent played blood in a while i thought i might just be remembering stuff wrong but i guess i was right there was one time i killed a cultist mid air and his life essence got floating in the air besides the crashes which i solved changing the api and the soundtrack muting after loading a save i didnt had more problems its playable but need some tweaks and fixes shit the run glitch option was stopping the dynamite i shouldve known something was up when i was zooming through well done and my ass wasnt getting fucked each second well lets hope they take notice and fix all this stuff soon in the meanwhile ill stick to nblood not being able to boot death wish without it crashing yeah not ideal civvie have you ever considered covering the system shock series pls respond its one of my faves and i think ur style could add something amazing to it oh so the fire damage is broken just bought and played it for the first time today i dont think its as good as shadow warrior or duke nukem the tnt throwing being broken seems like a good thing as all the cultists did in mine was spam it i got to the carnival level and am done for the day i was pretty excited for this as i didnt hear about this game until a year or so ago jumping so bad in fresh supply you have to like actually try now to get the guns akimbo from jumping on to the tomb stone in the first level now as someone who loves the blood games since 1997 im having a blast with fresh supply its not perfect but its a step in the right direction also dont forget that releases like this are used to gauge interest for the series future i just hope nightdive studios remasters blood 2 and maybe fix its shortcomings to a degree this is probably the best review of blood fresh supply thats what a review is suppose to do tell people whats wrong with the fcking product and this product is fcking broken and fck this shady gmanlies dude he completely turned to sht a while ago now he also does those fully retarded yourmama dick jokes all the time like some 12 year old methhead he cannot be trusted any longer night dive studios you fcked it up hard and my respect for your company tanked big time i think ill wait a bit before buying x3 its not raw its i m e n s i l y r a w i got it for half price on steam and yeah gmanlives is a dick the game has issues but im more the confident night dive will fix all the issues that outro song though gman put on blast oof 200 totalbiscuit intensifies glad i waited for your review civvie youre the only trusted source for blood related media they will no doubt fix these problems in the future but for now i will wait and see how things go btw what was the song at the end it reminded me of the music that plays when you drink a cup of tea or coffee in earthbound and the scrolling text is on screen thanks for you due diligence none of those comments will sour my enjoyment you are the hero we need but dont deserve well civvie 11 isnt happy with this release erf that sucks to hear i dont know what your rig is on but im running everything fine everything is working as it should maybe its just you huh that was a bit unexpected out of curiosity have you played any of nightdives other remasters first i learn about dusk thanks to you now i was just about to purchase the fresh supply when i watched this video boy am i glad i subscribed to your channel civvie dude try coop and start with e3m1 amount of bugs there was immense i loved the blown up vip hole which let me server host both ways but other players could only get inside the building also fookin keys only working for the player who picked one up so you feel like a doorsman to everyone or you have to ask to be let in if you have any connection to the host because ingame chat doesnt work 1010 the game experience may change during an online play i was considering picking this up after someone had recommended your video series about the original im glad i waited until you had posted your thoughts on it i hope youre able to follow up later after they maybe fix the bugs bought it day one zero crashes about the bugs i have no experience with dos versions of blood so iw ouldnt even know whats a bug or not i like ggmans channel but you are the blood master its one of my favorite fps yet i dont know a lot of these little details the difference of ggmans review and i would have reacted the same i would say it looks faithful to the original is like when some people are still playing doom in the community and remember how doom is while others have nostalgic glasses and are like what isnt doom 2016 like classic doom rip and tear heavy metal and so on man i also know idkfa iddqd doom rules men but they have forgotten the little details because they have played it only back in 1993 it could be the same you breath blood you know every detail cool its called blood but all i see are tears didgeridoobies gman lmao i knew there was something off but now i have clarification gg is a pleb and for the love of god dont waste your time on roguelites well shit i guess no blood for me then ive said it before but i dont think you can buy games any more buy them day one or preorder you get a glitchy unplayable mess that doesnt even run wait till their patched and its an epic store exclusive or its been pulled because it was so shit no one wanted it any more i didnt notice any of the glitches except for the one time a bloated butcher was clipped halfway into the ground but thats it it didnt crash once and i dont know what the run glitch is im currently on episode 3 and only saw one glaring bug who even watches gman anymore hes boring as fuck the only times he can get a click from me if he reviews something really bizarre and im bored out of my mind and have nothing else to watchdo hot balls its another blood video oof this is rough they fucked up the dynamite explosions too it displays the exploded on the ground sprite instead of the exploded midair sprite that youre supposed to get when you hit somebody directly with it sure hope they dont cd nblood i will agree wiht everything you said here civvie i wasstill am super excited about this release that i without hesidation went ahead and bought it on gog but i can say its buggy ai is a bit off the rendered crashesgraphical glitches when switching between say vulkan and dx11 etc i need to install nblood or bloodgdx again and play it in softwaremost accurate visually in this rendererbest way to play blood right now still postrelease of fresh supply civvie who hurt you got blood fresh supply as a gift from a friend on steam i like it but it could be better i felt that bloodgdx and nblood are a better representation i have faith things will get better though when updatespatches are released overtime one of the more egregious errors ive encountered is the fact that jump boots dont negate fall damage meaning you can easily cause yourself damage just by jumping with them on i was very sad when i tested the remaster for the first time when quicksaving took 5 fucking seconds i knew i was in for a rough ride to many bugs and oddities to be honest i wasnt expecting to much from this turok 2 remaster was also a mess on release but at least they patch it out and now is a very enjoyable experience i hope night dive do the same with fresh supply glad to see someone is telling the truth i get its hard for you to say it you always always talk about how much you love blood can you still buy the original version from gog or just the remake i played blood as a kid but never finished it glad they did a remaster with keyboard and mouse controls i didnt want to buy old version and mod it now im playing it and i like it only bug i encountered is music sometimes just goes silent and i have to restart game or finish level to get it back hopefully this doesnt start a beef between you and ggmanlives is anyone else finding it impossible to jump on the grave stones on e1m1 to get the guns akimbo i put all the high quality voxel settings on which replaces some of the 2d sprite models with 3d ones instead but its like they now have no mass like they are just hollow holograms and its impossible to stand on them i bought this as soon as it was available because i love blood and want it to get official support and interest but yeah this has a few problems which i really hope they fix gmanlives doesnt point at a single flaw in the remaster alright ill give him the benefit of the doubt and say he was lucky not to encounter any gamebreaking stuff civvie points a laundry list of flaws unsub gmanlives subscribe civvie11 the really weird thing is that i havent been having most of the bugs people talk about i mean there are issues but for the most part it just runs really well for me and even the multi is really stable ive only had it crash once and that was with 5 people in an elevator have had no issues saving and enemies seem to throw dynamite as usual there are issues and it does need work but for me at least it runs pretty well you deserve twice the amount of ggman subscribers im glad you are realizing gman blows smoke out his ass now and then i trust your reviews civvie thanks bro blood one unit whole blood was removed from gog but is available if you bought before now you should buy fresh supply to get one unit whole blood this is shit not surprised that gggmanlives shilled for this his reviews are barebones paid for and often wrong also he samefags and screenshots his own posts on v for twitter i bought it and i can still enjoy it but i definitely noticed that something about it was off i started playing bloodgdx alongside your videos so i would watch your video then play through the episode you just did helps me as someone who doesnt now all of the secrets yet but want to experience it and man i got my ass kicked on well done i persevered and beat it all the way through but now ive been playing through fresh supply and the damage output some of the sound even some of the weapons were just off ive only causually played through blood except recently and even i noticed it its something i can handle but it can still get really annoying because the spray can feels close to useless also menu crashes when turning on anti aliasing how does that slip through the cracks thats such a shame that mp doesnt work as that was gonna be my deciding factor cause a buddy of mine wanted to rip through it in coop i have faith that nightdive will make it right but man thats a sordid dump on my weekend it would be nice if you could just type a value into the fov instead of making it a slider gosh darn at least you are sincere keep up the good work civvie you are one of the greatest youtubers i follow at least you got the game to run steam wont even run the game for me since apparently the exe has missing dll files which i cant seem to fix oh well heres hoping civvie rises to fame soon like sseth did what even is the run glitch first ive heard of it sees video in sub feed oh boy i cant wait to hear civvie tell us how awesome this new port is and finally bring upon the blood renaissance weve all been waiting fo watches video oh oh thats a shame we really cant have good things gman is a corporate shill pure and simple you should see how much he shit on people for complaining about fallout 76 that dude aint trustworthy the run glitch is actually cultist behavior they were both supposed to throw dynamite grey if you werent running and orange if you did but it was broken granted i only know this because i happen to be in a discord channel with one of the devs whats that music over the patreons gives me a vtmb vibe dos blood will work just fine until they finish this shit 033 why would it put any reverseengineered port to shame if fresh blood is also reverseengineered itself except not by russian wizards thanks for the warning man even though it would only cost me 5 bucks they need to fix this shit to get it is it possible that atari may have forced nightdive to release it way earlier than it was supposed to they do have a recent history of rushing all their games they are that incompetent theres a chance when buying this you wont even be distributed the entirety of the game files today is a sad one bois it seems like there is less well blood in the game i know this isnt a callout post for gman but goddamn if this debacle isnt revealing especially with his other questionable reviews as of late keep fighting the good fight civvie civvie calling out gman for his review is not what i expected two of my favorite youtubers now crossed over reverse engineered my ass kaiser literally just tried to copy the whole game by looking at it gr8 puts hand on my shoulder whats wrong civvies 11 sniffles itits fuckin raw its damn time for us to push for a full remaster in the new doom engine in all its glory thats some autism level nitpicking i bought it because i had a 50 coupon for it i really enjoyed it but this is my first time playing blood so i dont have a reference point i really hope that theyll fix the bugs and bring this remaster to a state it deserves i encountered a bug which freezes the menu when i change the graphics settings so i have to open up the task manager right after i change graphics settings to get it back to a working state i hope nightdive fixes the issues thanks for making this video civvie blood fresh supply exists civvie look to how they massacred my boy i will buy this when they fix these glitches this game is so raw that gordon ramsey isnt even necessary to say how raw it is oh no i wanted this to be good i really did ive still got the gdx for it and thus havent gotten around to this release i trust your judgement civvie thanks for the honesty im still going to play it and experience it for myself but under 2 hours is easy to do when you die every 2 min i died quickload guess what music cuts off fucking roar hold on a minute so when i heard about blood getting a remaster some time ago and got all excited for itthis is it ive seen mods for other build engine games that did more for visuals and gameplay and they are free not to mention looking at the list of supposedly implemented features most of those seem to be missing either that or civvie turned them off stuff like aaao etc but i am pressing x to doubt on that one disappointed damn i saw gggmans review and i do not remember once he showed any or all these issues he just summed it as a good game which is but yeah these technical issues do show another light nice job on sharing these there is a few more you can clip into voxel gravestones and use medikit to resurrect yourself after you die who beta tested this junk theres also the problem with the flare gun secondary fire not spreading out soon enough too i feel dumb i bought blood not long ago and had no idea it was getting a remaster till recentlywelp guess i gotta buy this now xd i agree i played it and the cd music doesnt work 521 why would anyone listen to gmanlives after he gave a glowing review to fallout 76 congrats on getting a achievement quoted after you hopefully this remaster will get the patches love it needs it doesnt sound too bad its good that youre honest civvie shame the remaster ended up busted he has his own achievement civvie is too cool for us hes going to leave us uncool people thx for this bought blood fresh supply with the coupon i was given bloods very new to me but after seeing this maybe i should take the advice and wait before properly playing it only tested the water so far ive got one unit whole from ages ago but thats not the ideal version either i hear still an achievement shout is a nice thing thinking gman wasnt gonna say some stupid bullshit you played yourself yep they dont throw dynamite here too there also should be a horizontal mouselook lock yeah started playing it today and it just feels off i thought i was misremembering it and sadly i was not thank you for being honest was gonna wait for payday guess ill just wait for we fixed it day oh well back to gdx for the time being but its painful to see a reverse engineered attempt be a more accurate experience to the original some more from me in blood and bloodgdx falling from high enough to cause you damage or kill you can be nullified by activating jump boots before you hit the ground you still take damage andor die in fresh supply in blood and bloodgdx weapon switching is handled faster where if you shoot a single barrel from the sawed off and want to reload back to both barrels without firing the remaining shot you can do it by quickly tapping 1 followed by 3 do it fast enough and what happens is the sawed off is lowered and immediately brought back up without the pitchfork ever being raised in fresh supply pressing 1 followed by 3 forces the pitchfork to be raised no matter how fast you hit 3 in blood and bloodgdx sticking a single flare in a shotgun cultist isnt enough to light them on fire while playing on extra crispy in fresh supply a single flare is enough to light them on fire swinging doors no longer crush you or monsters cmon man i lived my young adult life terrifi no matter what at least this wont be silent hill hd should have brought you on as a consultant in the first place tbh i was waiting for this gggman has been way to forgiving in recent months its been making me suspicious history repeating itself blood 2 was broken on release and now fresh supply the outro music is endless love suzukis theme thanks for the honest review finally someone who is not afraid to speak the truth even if it hurts gggmanlives was praising this remaster so hard but the reality is that its not even a remaster its just another port another engine using the exact same resources same maps same textures same enemy sprites they didnt even bother to offer the option to filter textures thats plain stupid i know that some people like the old huge pixels its fine but some of us like the filtered version thats why we bought voodoo cards back in the days so yes another poor attempt to revive blood guys if you want to see how its done check doom remake 4 check quake 15 thats a proper remakeremaster shame blood was one of my favorite game give this game a break its still in early access are we playing the same game ive had zero issues the game is working as intended no dynamite glitch no weapon problems sound errors nothing i expect these issues will be ironed out after a few months no idea why they rushed it out the door but this is clearly a little undercooked from what i can gather this version was made in a similar fashion to bloodcm where the game was essentially reverse engineered under a different engine considering this game engine the kex engine has powered a wide variety of classic fps remakes its clear that the inaccuracies are not necessarily caused by any sort of engine limitations frankly the most inexcusable issue for me is that when you reload a level say after dying the music just stops forever until you finish the level blood is a really complex and intricate game i think they bit off more than they can chew lets hope that peoples first exposure with blood via fresh supply will get some kind of enjoyment out of it at least and hope that they do manage to fix all of these tangled vines i dont see it being an easy job im glad i actually didnt buy this before watching reviews never played it and dont want a shitty port to ruin the experience ive gotten to the third level and as far as i can tell there havent been any issues maybe the some peoples copies are just not as broken as others that would explain why gmanlives didnt complain about any glitches 459 nice rhyming there glad i didnt buy it i bought blood on steam and they gave me a 50 off remastered coupon so i can buy the same game again to the comments saying no one properly criticized the remaster properly until civvie you gotta realize it takes full mastery of this game to see all the subtle and not so subtle problems this has from the butcher not being properly weak to spray can to fanatics throwing dynamites you have to have played this game a lot to see all these problems i completely was shocked when i saw gggmanlives review and its quite strange he gave a fully positive review of it too i had seen pagbs bug showcase and i was just in shock how could it be released like this does nobody test this really strange i personally hope this gets fixed asap i picked it up because i never played it before and i had seen civvie play the original theyll probably patch it quickly and youll be able to do an update video with ode to joy in the background if they just fixed the fire attacks id be much happier i knew i shouldve waited for civvie but everyone said this was good now it turns out nightdive didnt even have the source code fuck this had i known that id have just stayed with the dos emulated version at least the gog version includes the original dos version of blood when you buy fresh supply so theres that best video to watch while you have a goth girl ride your beak in a yellow thong caw caw alright so i bought this game on the release day the moment i realized it was out and have played it for roughly 9h already so i thought id throw my experiences in here as well in case one of the developers reads this keep in mind i have never played the original blood so i have no reference and also im playing it on linux via steamplayproton so some issues might have come from that so firstly the mouse is pretty fucked for me after every start of the game when i enter an episode or load a save the game just stops as long as the mouse is moving this is happening for a solid half minute of mouse wiggling but then it works fine furthermore the mouse is fixed in the middle of the screen in the pause menu until i switch the window in i3 basically alt tabbing but when i go back to the game and start selecting options the real fun begins the mouse ingame just goes crazy when i move it to the right it moves incontrollably fast to the left and up when i move it to the left im a complete newcomer to blood and even i noticed glaring discrepancies between fresh supply and bloodgdx as i played it before im hoping the remaster gets patched soon nightdive did good things with turok 2 but this fresh supply right now isnt all the way up to snuff finally someone tell true about this piece of shit hell yeah i was disappointed by the lack of hud customization and some better lighting the rest is fine also for some reason save game screenies dont work i do appreciate the 3d models for some stuff hope they fix it it doesnt work well for all computers i really wanted to like this remaster but its just inaccurate in its current state the physics feels off enemyweapon behavior is slightly different and it has new bugs too i hope theyll listen to the feedback and fix these issues in future updates worked fine for me its a shame the game comes with so many bugs i hope they fix the coop soon since you cant set it to private also the game crashes when i change the graphics and calebs oneliners are missing sometimes and the sound is sometimes broken like its all mono and i hope youll be able to see your coopbuddy on the map look at this fucking hockey puck these scallops are rubber rubber fucking yankee dankee doodle shite are you gonna do an update if things get patched i bought it because i want to support the initiative but for the moment its back to gdx 204 i can see infinity thanks for the warning man its great that you didnt fall for flattery i brought it before i watched this video but im still glad i did i feel like if the devs will listen to anyone its civvie so i think theyll fix it fingers crossed i would love to know what you think about project warlock the only issue ive had thus far that you pointed out is the cultists no longer throwing dynamite even with its warts its still better than the sourceports thanks for a genuine freaking review i heard nothing but praise from other channels im still buying it but im glad to know what im getting myself into i still picked it up pretty much the moment i was made aware of its existence by gman primarily because the original was banned here few years ago they pulled the game from steam and gog because thanks to greenlight or some shit it slipped by unnoticed same with a few other games such as postal 1 2 and horse manure and checking the ratings boards website reveals it wasnt even submitted so i didnt want to take a chance and find that it was gone by the time i got round to it bright side the gog version very thankfully also includes the dosbox version so now i have both and a type o negative music video the relevance escapes me tough luck dude tough luck 1 megaprops for calling out ggmans video as the shillsucking it was what an honest review even after they pandered to you with the achievement youve got a lot of credibility with me now disapointing hopefully its fixed i hope they can fix it beta on steam is making a start damn that end credits music mans really does feel bad eivvic nehw 3 mood orp btw tnt barrels explode much quicker when on fire from flare gun as someone who hasnt played the original more than a few times i am fine with the port i have a lot of fun with it if youre being quoted its more than likely some one on at monolith or nightdive is watching your videos hopefully they see this one and work on fixing the stuff you pointed out hopefully they can iron out the kinks i think a remaster would be great and nds seems pretty dedicated props to them for including a civvie quote too lol thanks for the very honest and thorough review i was hoping fresh supply would be accurate but thats not the case i should have waited but bought it anyway ah well at least i got it for five bucks and have the original from steam with gdx installed also got the pure dos version from gog still on the fence about nblood damn appreciate the candid take all the same heres hoping this can get unfucked into the remaster i waited for i was very much looking forward to this remaster of blood bought it got thoroughly disappointed went back to playing bloodgdx i hope they fix it soon this is too good to pass up so the shillmanlives did it again ramsay civvie come over civvie not now ramsay im about to see if this food is raw civvie 204 im gonna play the nblood as far as i can tell everything is included to run bloodgdx it worked when i tested not sure about nblood but itd likely be the same so i guess right now its a great way to get a legal copy of the game to use with either of those ports ive been playing duke3d and blood on buildgdx lately and for some reason theyve felt the closest to original out of any ports ive ever tried but it took some mouse setting adjustment first and i still cant fix the goddamn mouse acceleration on bloodgdx it is bug filled and i to thought well done felt way easier i do think everyone should wait till it is patched i still bought it and have been enjoying it but as far as everything and everyone else who wants to buy it i say wait but once it is working and all that shit coop and deathmatch should be a lot of fun i havent deathmatched in blood in years fresh supply has so many issues it makes me sad because this was our chance to get the best version of blood some of the issues that tick me off the most are the controls you just feel slower and more floaty i also hate that the game freezes every time you save your game which with blood is pretty often really breaks the flow of the game so uhhh civvie i doubt you read all the comments but yesterday i decided to be a man and actually finish postal 2 after watching your pro postal videos and i had a lot of fun specially in apocalypse weekend with the double barreled shotgun thanks civvie for just making me stop being a lazy fuck and get to finish my games im really liking this channel it got me into playing postal 2 freecivvie hah i knew this was coming the moment gmanlives uploaded a video on this game i dont know what gmanlives is smoking implying its the first time ggman did questionable things regarding game reviews good to know where the grass isnt green looks like they need testers like you for these details i play blood but i really dont know it as well as you do 342 the smaller things dont bother me but that is a big oversight basic game property from the original game i didnt think it would be so highly requested but the song at the end is called suzukis theme by endless love and it is a royalty free track from youtubes audio library httpswwwyoutubecomaudiolibrarydownloadvid860dc2f99f87c20d man your spoiling us this weekend civ so basically a public flight of a version of blood that may eventually be the best version of blood it takes integrity to be critical of something you want to succeed so thank you for being honest and having the integrity to tell us whats wrong with this release and recommending potential buyers wait for patches whats the name of end credits song civvie my boyfriend got this for both me and himself i think without any previous reference to the og blood he didnt get my major complaints this vdeo is sad to watch so much potential but need more time when a game port is so bad that cv11 refuses to put gordon ramsay clips in to prove his point if its not worthy of a fucking raw its not worthy period you are spoiling us cv11 i couldnt start any episode of the game the game would just not load fix turning on some cd audio in the sound menu or something similar ok good start 205 2001 a space odyssey ending it really seems that gggmanlives turned into a shill sad can someone tell me what the songs name is at the ending maybe just maybe gmanlives is not speaking the truth i didnt even get the fucking remaster to start dunno why i try to start it but the comp just loads a little bit and then nothing gonna wait and see if therell be any patches or fixes for this problem someone did a massive oopse cause civvie is telling me to not get it until the patch for me personally the medic bag pickup icon would just not dissapear until i used it up a crying shame they seemingly rushed it out like this my fresh supply came and it is fucking raw yikes thanks for being gentle was anyone else expecting a sudden fuckin raw at the end of the credits ive never had any of these issues so far am i alone on this i havent played the original but im having a lot of fun with this one but thanks for the report im sure you will make it even better the small businessman always always always gets it in the ass 205 blood 3 the fourth dimention youre a true blood fan mate i knew youd see this for what it is ya know i was just patiently waiting for you to review this civvi and was wondering how youd react the fact that youre this sad doesnt surprise me but it makes me feel for ya man i hope its fixed soon and you get to enjoy blood like you deserve youre doing a great service by posting your content on here godspeed civvi this raises some questions 1 what the fuck are they doing and 2 what is gman doing i doubt that civvie patched the bugs in the game to talk shit about nightdive so gmans credibility has gone down a lot another shitty cash grab remake there is no excuse for a company to release a broken game especially blood youre better of buying blood from gog or steam and using the bloodgdx port also kex engine fov sliders use the vertical value so use 8358 if you want 100fov at 169 cant buy anything on release anymore when i first heard of the remaster i thought it was going to smooth the animations and fix glitches but i guess not civvie 11 you have just become the best game reviewer on all of youtube for this video most other youtubers would get down on their knees for the developers if they referenced them in a game yet here you are giving your true honest opinions on this objectivelyflawed remaster and giving good constructive criticism without sounding like a ranting avgn clone hack gmanlives has been hitting the digeridoobies hard since fallout 76 it seems sad to know this version is a little under cooked hope theyre able to make it satisfactory friendly reminder that some guy is going to give us all a friendly reminder about duke nukum forever at 100k subs a problem i had with fresh supply is that when you turn cd music on you have to load your save to fully enable it which is not the issue for me the issue is that after you load the save again the music stops playing does anyone know where we can report these issues is that outro song some weird ass rendition of tony montanas theme from scarface im playing this right now as my first blood playthrough so i dont notice the differences nad issues that someone who played this game for years notices i myself am having tons of fun with this game i actually kinda hope they keep the fov slider uncapped its hilarious and ultimately harmless since anyone willingly setting it that high will know exactly what theyre doing i feel like the only person fresh supply edit ok now i see what hes talkin about i didnt have any problems at first but now my game is fucking up like in post mortem zombies butchers and hellhounds keep coming back and most of the time when ever i shoot an enemy with the shotgun they set on fire like i used the launcher or flair gun i think ill wait a bit until they iron it out a bit more i played through this as well and noticed that there was still a lot of work to be done has anyone else noticed that the cultists also seem to have 100 accuracy and instant reaction time it makes the first episode even more difficult than it already was for some people game doesnt even start just black screen after the firts fmv or infinite loading if you choose different chapter matt mcmuscles gushed over it too cocaines a hell of a drug he does wanna be your buddy for some multiplayer though edit forgot to mention he said he never really played blood previously and only had the shareware back in the day we gotta give him some slack for not knowing thanks for helping me save money thanks i will not buy it now great review calling it like it is called out gggmanlives too lol btw whats that song that plays over the end and where can i find it finally about time someone doesnt absolutely deepthroat and circlejerk about it like that strayan shill having finished every episode on blood fresh supply now i feel lucky for not running into any crashes or game breaking glitches i had no idea it was this bad i had to stop listening to ggman because hes a muppet but the question is is big mike back lets just press f to pay respects for this just finished dusk and just finished beneath dusk 3 so glad you got recommend you have this specialty to your voice and line delivery you would be the endboss of all boomers but we know you aint a boomber you are john civvie space marine yeah i was wondering why the game felt a bit off glad it wasnt just me ah well ill just wait for the patches fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck yeah this is awesome pro blood fresh supply whenever its been purified of bugs also whats the ending song oh the bitter sweet pain of this video on the up side i look forward to the video where everything is patched and thanks for the heads up and warning gmans just in it for the paycheck i dont trust any of his videos anymore yeah ggman isnt very good with reviews not to mention his humor revolves around the call people you dont like soyboys or whatever style that would make cancer mouse blush multiplayer is fun when it works im australian so the moment an american joins it ruins the game and causes game breaking lag and theres no option to lock people out or put a password on still tho for the 5bucks i got this for its worth it but ill wait till they fix it and stick with gdx with death wish which is broken on fresh supply what music at the end now thats my kind of fov slider it is sad to think that they are probably not gonna fix any of these bugs because this game is so old gmanlives just doesnt play a lot of the games he says he is a huge fan of shame on that aussie queer cuck gmanlives for not noticing all these bugs in his review watching civvie disappointed makes me really sad for some reason huh ill be honest as someone who can barely handle blood beyond well done a lot of these just dont make a huge difference in the midst of things not that nds shouldnt endeavor to fix things but unless players are truly as diehard a purist as this guy youll probably be fine i havent had any crashes or game breaking bugs myself gman doesnt know shit about fps games wow thats news to me when i quick save it takes nearly a minute to load afterwards completely defeating the purpose not playing until its fixed so far im dissapointed with this remaster especially since its from nightdive ill stick with gdx for now but i hope they will update it soon smh i cannot believe they killed blood again rip in peace blood bloodman 1997 20019 welp its good to get this boomers opinion n shit so some unpaid enthusiasts did a better job at reviving a retro shooter than a proper team of industry professionals what a surprise i like how upfront you are they name an achievement after a quote from you and youre still as honest and open as ever now thats integrity a lot of the issues seem engine related probably because its not actually on the build engine but has been reversed engineered to be on the kex engine which is a custom engine by kaiser to remaster games like doom64 and powerslaveexhumed i shouldnt be surprised that this happened i am surprised but i shouldnt be especially blood as much as i love it had the rockiest build engine foundation of the holy trinity tough love the developers did answer really fast to my bug report so they are at work fixing stuff yeeeesss rr is coming finally is this the steam version or the gog version you got im not that far into it yet but i havent seen these issues so far and im using the gog version i havent played enough blood before this remaster to judge some of the finer points and only played about an hour or so to this point but i never had a crash nds are good folks though so i expect this to be fixed pretty quickly if people are crashing a lot they gotta fix that asap i was wainting for your video when i saw it came out thank yya 3 i knew it was good to keep my skepticism close for this one the boat load of new features added are nice but whats the point if the original game is broken civvie posts something blood related me quick footsteps from the distance a honest review as a person who has been playing blood since the shareware version came out a big thank you its medium raw wow i im sorry civvie this is why i waited for you to tell me if its good i was going to buy it and sadly now i wont i myself bought the remaster and immediately refunded it on account of very severe graphical glitches from having a very old low end intel card its a shame night dive seems to have rushed this and it ended up being quite raw but atleast 2 good source ports now exists so one can get fairly good experience with old digital version i watched gmanlives review and immediately went onto gog to buy it shouldve waited for civvie lets be real gggman is 100 shill by now fucking raw sadly ah snap civvie you nailed it but shit man i already bought it oh good so im not the only one who found the movement and jumping wonky as hell and what about tnt glitch that will explode on contact with wall and nerf on explosion radius i tried to play it but it kept crashing on me so i just refunded it while blood gdx just works im ok with waiting i can trust this review a russian dude with a crappy pc did reverse engineering and made an awesome port including multi and coop i donate some money to him to finish multiplayer and he did i think bloodgdx is more faithful than fresh blood but i dont mind this trend to make ports from older games anyone know any hioctane port i loved that game meow 3 sad to see you that depressed cuz of that another condescending jerk off nitpicking a game oh youtube how you bring out the best in people glad to know im not the only one who has noticed some weirdness in the remaster to be fair gmanlives doesnt have blood as his autobiography i kinda feel like you are the only one who has any authority to judge any blood port damn i bought this in hopes to like blood again which i pirated and loved in the late 90s guess ill wait i cant wait till they patch it so i can go grab it but for now ill sit and wait i was honestly having a lot of fun up until episode 2 thats when a lot of cracks started to show for me cultists stopped throwing dynamite enemies would randomly infight for no reason or just completely wander off into another part of the map i tried coop with a friend and its a half baked mess no way to save game but you can load your quick save slot from a singleplayer run wtf and when you die you lose all your weapons with no setting to let players keep them i hope they patch this up fast it has the potential to be awesome but its just kinda squandered right now gggmanlives is a hack fraud thats why was the music stopping once you died or reloaded a save file in the original blood because that shit happened to me i stopped looking to gmanlives for legit gaming critiques especially skill based endeavors a long time ago i hope this wont erupt any drama between you and gman wow raw is blood remastered not even having an achievement in his honor was enough for civvie to sugar coat his review that my friends is called integrity i love how the mouselook is smoother than bloodgdx though but the varying voice pitches between the fanatics and cultists also bugs me also holy shit didgeridoobies is my new favorite thing youve ever said lol lets not forget that the dynamite doesnt explode on your corpse anymore nor the burning hands sprite is shown whenever you hold onto a lit stick without tossing it been waiting for this upload i came here for the truth civvie always supplies the truth they are working on itgood but we pay for it it should be working already no level stats feature sad me oh man i had the remake in my cart when this popped up gonna wait until they patch it to get the proper blood experience thanks civvie i have never laughed as hard as i did at i dunno what didgeridoobies gman is smoking now i dont want to act like i know this for sure but at the moment it seems like a workable hypothesis that gmanlives isnt quite as much of an aficionado or current player of oldskool fps games as it appears can we all be honest and just blame atari for this i bought it but i cant play it because im on intel hd graphics and it fucks all the textures in the game im not going to shit on nightdive just yet but im a bit sad well hey theres one good thing about this being 2019 they can patch it or maybe they wont i dunno i know you talk a lot about the ports bloodgdx and nblood but have you tried zbloody for doom i play it in vr httpsyoutubevsnfpzh3ceo i knew one unit whole was the better deal ill just wait until gdx gets an fov slider and smoothens out mouselook i never thought that ggman was not a reliable source and now i know she has a built in ability do do dodoooh shes diggin for things you seeee do do do dooh and now it seems im falli i need to stop ooh project warlcok is next great choice gman lives often doesnt even play the games he reviews and ppl including me have called him out on his bs plenty of times even in his review of blood fs i called him out on his bs when is a video about the first quake coming out the main reason for this i think is that kaiser couldnt use any of the stolen alpha source code nblood and gdx use for the fear of legal reprecussions from wb those guys didnt care about atari owns the publishing rights which they sold to nightdive wb owns the source which they dont want to sell to anyone long story short wait for bugfixes play original while waiting gman is a shill thats trash at fps games thank god i unsubbed when i could i still cant believe people watch his shit after shitting on prey and saying fallout 76 was good yo boyz what is the outro song i am ignorant i know no i do not want to listen darure thx oh maaaann i was waiting for your review to buy this i was already with the game in cart and didnt read a single review i see the video and expect praise and to go buy the damn thing nope its not good not blood good fuck me sideways i dint notice any of this till you pointed it out thank you cv11 i was blinded by the blood imagine playing on less than 170 fov lul bought it noticed something was wrong in the menu already tried to map keys didnt work uninstalled and refunded 3 minutes after im sticking with blood gdx thanks for your take sif and thankfully nightdive is working on it yup civvie sure has more complains about this remaster than gmanlives does its fucking raw you wont say it so i will its facking raaaw1 i crashed the game by quick loading when i didint have a save also unrelated but i think the game doesnt save after finishing a level thanks for the honest talk on it civvie ill give it a bit of a wait for fixes to come before i get to trying it props man probably no one said anything about those bugs because they played blood very little or just not played at all to notice still thanks man i was waiting for your opinion before buying keep those awesome videos coming out 200 my god its full of stars hey at least dynamite doesnt fly right through enemies like it does in nblood what he was smoking who knows what they put on the ea parties must be something good enough to praise f76 and antherm yeah i agree with alot of what you said but i think i got an updated version of the game that fixed some of the issues calebs voice tommy gun cultists not throwing dynamite or trying to etc tbh though i liked this alot better than gdx i felt like the controls and lighting were very well done and ya i agree that the eneimies are lacking i beat the game on well done with a controller a controller i bought it because of gmanlives ok to be fair the game never crashed on me only the quicksaves take fucking forever it got so bad that when i got to the overlooked hotel i had to do it in 1 try it took 30 seconds for the game to complete a quicksave seems only in the secret levels is this cut down to 3 which is still a lot if anyone knows how to fix this please let me know the game still plays nice and no crashes only a bug where the voodoo doll would still hit me even if im in the enemys face or it would hit the person behind the enemy sorry for writting this fucking bible passage but please just tell me how to fix the quicksaves because gman told me to fuck off its broken in places but id say give it a few months and it should be more or less fixed so in your opinion whats the best version of blood to play right now i really want to play this great game again i was about to buy this ill wait im really sorry nightdive but i trust ol civvie theyll fix itor ill just kill myself no big deal 200 how quake pros play blood thank you for taking your time on this and actually reviewing the port gmans video was so weirdly positive and spent more time gushing about how awesome blood is than saying anything useful about fresh supply other than buy it because blood felt more like an ad which just reminds me of the anthem debacle oh no this little thing is not how it was back when i was still a level 1 neckbeard burn the thing try blood on gzdoom engine hm ive been playing blood fresh supply for most of the week and i havent noticed any of the bugs youve mentioned the blackrobed cultists dont do the little dynamite toss animation i havent really noticed any lighting problems but i wont deny that the release has bugs because ive got two of my own the save function seems to take about 10 seconds to work and freezes the game while it does it not a deal breaker but kind of annoying and have you played cryptic passage or as its called in fresh supply for some reason custom maps all the cryptic passage maps are in there and theyre just missing textures some have been swapped for existing ones of monsters and look just terrible i couldnt get through the first map without all kinds of screen tear and weirdness that made it hard to look at let alone play now im not hugely upset about this because blood is hard to remaster isnt it i heard something about them not having the original source cod well shit time to reinstall blood gdx i guess if its still not fixed when i go to play post morturm in the future i only played for 5ish minuites so i didnt get time to see this stuff also nice aerosmith in the creditrs another civvie video good shit i bought it just because i hadnt had a proper version of blood actually bought a person who is not that familiar with blood will not get any discrepancies its meh not to bad of a release for a game that wasnt properly rereleased since year 1997 is that end credits music some sort of a reinterpretation of in the court of the crimson king and starless have noticed a fair few bugs myself some of the areas in episode 2 i found fucked with sprites and made enemies completely invisible but id be getting the bug were they dont make noise so id have tnt being thrown at me from what appeared to be nothing closed out of pornhub faster than dd killing off the nk on game of thrones totally worth it roblox oof release a video when the bugs are patched please civvie my zoomer ass is too lazy to check for itself i have one unit whole blood on my wishlist and thats as far as ill go for now until i can buy it oh and i recommend you talk about how bad the shadow warrior remake is monotonous unfunny 98 of the time but some good looking parts like wangs armory cave i got it for free at the same time i first heard it existed lucky me its about time i see a video about this remaster that is honest thanks civvie glad you released this sadly i bought it before hand but lucky enough i had that 50 coupon i just have to play that waiting game now ive been playing this for 6 hours and never noticed any of these things most likely since its my first time and the game is kickass love your videos btw edit some of the comments on gmans video has gotten pretty sour now i mean cmon its a working game and some of the bugs mentioned here are pretty minor and can be fixed well that was unexpected pink on the inside you could perhaps say its a bit raw the kex engine more like the kek engine played blood because civvie loved it had lots of fun got a 50 off coupon on fresh supply because of having the original and grabbed it quick played it for just a little bit and realized that something felt off also quicksaving freezes the game for a bit god i hope they fix it edit fuck it refunding needs more time in the oven edit now with it being much more polished its a much better purchase personally ive rebought it gg is nothing more than a shill now he is trying to get good boy points after shitting his pants with his f76 and anthem advertising me before the release of the vid oooh this is going to be gordon ramsey extravaganza me after watching the vid that was one helluva handbrake turn to the crestfallen avenue and i wasnt wearing my seat belt but do they remove that stone gargoyle cheese this is legitimately sad its so raw gordon died of salmonella poisoning i dont know it works fine by me and im glad having blood on my steam account the glitch where fanatics try to throw dynamite is also in dosblood though i think it happens more often in fresh supply than it did in dos im glad someone noticed that bloated butchers take way too much aerosol fuel to cook up also the crushers in e3m5 spare parts are very wonky like they dont crush you when then go down but rather they kill you when theyre at a certain height when going up but overall i agree they should have spent more time on this to polish out the issues aww man lets hope they can fix it bro also love your channel that fucking fov is broken xd is it on steam oh thats a shame im really glad you made this before i bought it civvie genuinely appreciate that you had the nads to come out and criticise it gdx is still in game you didnr mention how mouselook not being shit is the only redeemable thing this remaster has going on it feels fucking raw without any ramsay clips once again one of your videos has made me glad to no longer watch ggmanlives a new civvie video what a nice present im really glad you made this i know nds are a fan of your work so hopefully theyll take notice of this also lol fov slider ooohhhhhh shiiiitttttt new civvie the floating blood gave me chuckles its still full of bugs i really want this to get fixed 205 hes gone into plaid rocky start is very fitting considering i tried changing my video mode and suddenly everything went black i got a free copy from my m8 from texas fun but pink on the inside damn man thanks for this vid after gmans vid i was hyped and gushing about this game but i trust you going over blood stuff more than basically anyone at this point ill wait until they iron out the bugs and stuff sad they released it in this state but its still awesome were getting an official release like this i hope this doesnt negatively affect anyone else getting official releases of games that were in ip limbo for a long time i think you get that achievement for subbing to civvie after all he will play dnf 204 wow i didnt know fresh supply had a star trek reference i knew something was off when i first played this i refunded it and just played the original instead nblood bloodgdx blood fresh supply also thank you for saying its broken that is one critical thing that no one has said reviewing this remaster mfw i found the achievement and rushed over to twitter to let my favorite boomertuber know you going places dude they did an amazing job on this port most fun i had in years but the few problems do hold it back good overall didnt even know there was a remaster some say the lighter is still going till this day ive clicked the notification so fast that civvie is still in sewer count 0 thank you civvie astolfo is hot ophelia 224 when youre high

never heard of this game before great video though awesome review bill this is one of my all time favorite dos games from back in the day oh man soooooo good absolutely brilliant blood is an awesome and often overlooked shooter with some wonderfully unique weapons having the actual voice of caleb was such a great touch lol that delay at the beginning waiting for the game to start hit me right in the memories i remember this game along with other early fps spinoffs that came out at the time like hexen and heretic forgot how much time i spent on these games thanks for another great lnr amazing as always d another brilliant video very well done the dog is scared of gt and for good reason that was bloody brilliant lad thank you for honoring this timeless classic bill what a cracking video mate and with the actual voice of the main character himself that really adds to it d such a score getting him to do this production values are definitely going up man you deserve the views and subs to go with them by now that was bloody awesome d ha yes first to say it well done bill done justice to one of my top 5 games cracking job mate nice who voiced caleb i still have a visual glitch after all that time yeah great thanks atari god and i wanted to play blood that badly fuck and the music playing in this video is brian tyler all is well httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvotr3sqtmore what about on gog version now i want to rewatch bubba ho tep whats the song just asking just wanted to mention i met bubba ho teps director at a phantasm screening and he was supremely nice to everyone ive heard the same about angus scrimm oh snap someone else likes a really obscure bruce campbell movie that i enjoy yay make a patch that lets you fight more than 4 enemies the whole game this is why people who say dont like it dont buy it in response to criticism should be crucified but what do i care i got a growth on my pecker this is all great but do respawning spiders still crash the game like the original its still broken as fuck try bloodbath 5 months later what do you think of the port civvie i wish it was more of a megaton editionified release anyone else get all emotional and shit over this video please tell me that is stephan weyte in the thumbnail lol still a shit port just use nblood or gdx random curiosity question civvie but whats the name of the music you used in this video did the daniel have auto aim on enemies or not because the flare gun does when you just want to blow the barrels but instead hit the enemyenemies hope blood fresh supply and turok gets updates in the future so is fresh supply worth picking up now civvie been wanting to try blood since i found your channel after watching this and the pro blood videos i took the dive and bought it on friday 1213 hours of gameplay later im glad i did super underrated classic i remember playing this with my crazy uncle when i was a wee lad and im glad i found your channel and rediscovered this worth the 10 pro blood 179 degree fov when civvie you might want to make another update because the updates for fresh supply have officially stopped httpsimgurcomeexiyzi was the difficulty bug fixed hey civvie i was full of hope too until i read the latest patch notes and read this for future issues we will have to recommend contacting atari about them what are your thoughts on this this was one of the most beautiful gaming vids ever someone must tell me what the music is here thanks so much fart never knew a stick of dynamite can make a man this happy wonders how manny people recognized the buba ho tep bruce cambell and elvis so why do people like cv exactly i bought it off atari website i sent them a msg awhile ago its one u it of blood notfresh supply my recite says its fresh supply and their site advertised that it was idk they havnt got back to me i sent a them an emaili dont want a refund cause im having fun but i dont know of they kmow theyre selling one unit and not fresh supply when the game is installed it says one unit and is dos so dont ask if im wrong cultists have their dynamite alls right with the world lol great movie released games shouldnt have changelogs of bugfixes that long the game industry is broken near the end i was thinking how dramatically poignant it was then you literally took the air out of it you get all the brownie points for referencing bubba hotep as many bugs as there were when this was released maybe early for financial reasons who knows its so amazingly great to see how fast the devs are working on fixing all the issues and just how many issues and feature requests are getting fixed and addressed i dont think there will be a greater example of a game the relesead to early for reasons that 1 month later had near half of its major issues fixed and 2 months later had like 80 of its issues fixed even if the original the original data with a sourceport is still the more accurate way to play right now i dont believe that this release wont soon be better and the same with thier future ports even better they acknowledging your viewpoints as a valid representation from a fan so the cynical excuse is they want you to be happy to help thier game sell by the positive advertising but that doesnt mean they wont make the best version of blood yet does anyone know if the gog version has been patched as well why this song gotta go back in my brain civvie make me feel like the angels are comin for me sure hope they patch the bugged graphics when using intel graphics id really like to be able to enjoy this version this video is why i bought the game good that the devs were a fan of you through and through also whats the song and the movie clip i want the name of that background music now i want to buy blood should i go for the bloodgdx or fresh supply civvie i consider myself a huge movie buff but for some reason bubba hotep has avoided my radar the entire 26 years ive been alive i have you to thank for introducing me to it im glad this got patched ive never had the privilege of playing blood with all the bad press about this release of blood it turned me off from the idea of buying it but now ill definitely buy it thanks for keeping us updated civvie correction blood fresh supply gets a transfusion i bought it today after the patch was announced its actually pretty good but still it shouldnt be broken from the start and i hope the future of fresh supply will be good review rebel moon rising please any interest in doing a video on rage civvie i knew i was right to find your channel way back hey where pro cryptic passage man also wanton destruction thank you i couldnt place the music until i saw bruce campbell as the best elvis anyone has ever done at the end at least i know im not the only one not involved in its production to know this movie exists we needed a clip or something like nicely seasoned quite tasty and perfect for a winters day gordon ramsay i swear i saw a new civvie video a few minutes ago but now it seems to be gone looked like he was playing an older game pro half life when civvie i found your channel like 2 months ago from your postal 3 video and im loving your videos so far congrats 6k subs gainned in less then 4 days the road to million is just a step now well played i really hope they an make it run for windows 10 prodoom 64 when civvie meant to ask this yesterday but nows good too whats wrong with your face anyone else think the jumping still just feels off it feels like caleb still tries to do the higher jump but hits a ceiling and instead just hangs in the air weirdly was this in dosthe other ports checkout hedon plz very old school shooter its fucking cooked doom duke shadow or blood which one you think is over all most fun to play please do a video on system shock 1 can we just be honest with ourselves here for a minute blood was not a good game it was the poster child for doom clone great song fucking love bubba hotep new profile picture nice hey man love your videos of blood r u planning to do the cryptic passage levels i love this fucking movie so much the torrent version doesnt work win 81 is the steam version safe ive got a growth on my pecker pro rise of the triad when it will come still needs a gordon ramsey joke but bubba hotep was a nice touch hey civvie pro radix beyond the void when this video was nothing more and nothing less than it needed to be praise civvie pro adventures of square when civvie but for real love youre videos found some voxel objects clipping through the floor exactly like in shadow warrior classic redux and quicksaving still takes ages its too early to celebrate i thought kaiser and nightdive were better than whoever the fuck did that port but apparently i was wrong so when you get silent that is when you are in your happy place d civvie is growing fast and thats good he deserves it also who else is hyped for the 100k special this is game development in a nut shell nowadays release it in a half assed state and then patch it later would you ever do a pro painkiller okay but that thumbnail is such a blessed and cursed imagery you made a video about a patch emotional kudos this is one of the best videos ive seen in a long time top i would like to see you play clive barkers undying and jericho grest channel btw i enjoyed your pro doom and pro blood series where is gordon saying finally some good fucking food love the new profile image civ proquake when this is an update for the steam version but what about the gog one why the dicks was this disliked i seem to be the only one who hasnt had any issues oh my fucking god that tldr of a goddamn bugfix list i knew from the heart that nightdive were hard at work on fixing this they gave us an awesome strife and damn good turok and turok 2 remasters it may not be 100 yet but were still on track hey civvie whens pro chex quest youre making an impact where it counts civvie keep on truckin my friend i expected gordon ramsey droping the f bom with raw in it at the very end of the vid with like unfixed bug fresh supply was worthy you know and he accomplished so much but then update 1 came along update 1 who was stronger update 1 who was faster update 1 i likebetter ahh civvie i fucking love you dude pro quake champions when civii oof new profile picture tfw we never got bubba hotep 2 civvie when will there be pro duke nukem 3d 2 the patch broke my save ffs i bet the makerd of blood fresh supply knows that civvie11 knows the shit from blood and when civvie says something wrong they watch the video and fix it and they in fact believe to civvie like some fucking dynamite cultist so much that if he would say theres suppose to be fucking candy unicorn flying in some secret level breathing fire like dragon they would go and fucking do it edit never fucking mind the updated version also crashes back to gdx i had no idea there was someone as passionate about the bubbahotep soundtrack as i am watched video to comment on new civvie avatar look at the chin lol so youre some kind of a diehard blood fan or whative seen people talking about you on almost all blood related videosif thats true then tell mewhat would you do for blood iii wait why is everyone praising this when normally everyone blasts companies for day one patches its so erotical that they did that i like the music in the beginning so good im crying its so beautiful wait blood fresh supply had issues im almost done with the game and i havent noticed anything wrong with it its a lot better than the first port we got for steam do we get a second review when its all patched xd totally not trying to find a way to watch you play more blood where can i get blood the game whats bubba ho tep got to with it free civvie and pass the blood civ your two cents on projects warlock civvie can fuck my tiddies i have a lot of faith that night dive will make the game right theyve done great work in the past ill wait for this to be fully fixed and then buy it on sale happy to see the devs are actually trying unlike many others nice use of the music from bubba hotep i liveagain pro quake 1 when civvie oh hey new profile pic ill miss the old one but change happens and the new one is just as funny as the old one oddly enough one of the earliest and most distracting bugs is still there though hovering blood splatters on level 1 are you kidding me i just watched bubba hotep last night too much of a coincidence wow subscribed i just wrote your name on my sandwich so what was that song 20 seconds into the vid and judging by the presentation civvie does makes me think that civvie is actually happy almost with a small tear in the eye now the most broken thing about this situation is i want to rewatch bubba hotep but i lost my dvd years ago was having a bad day and that thumbnail alone sent me into a laughing fit civvie you are a treasure cleopatra does the nasty sure enough here it is any civvie content is good content happy for yall well done on agitating for changes you want w minimal frothing kinda ironic considering that blood didnt need a patch to be played properly when it first came out says a lot about the developers nowadays blood lives again long live blood loving the pfp civvie thanks dude purchasing it now civvie i didnt know how much i needed a government prisonertest subject reviewing 90s videogames before you straightjacketed along now im a patreon keep it up so when are you going to review the bubba hotep game that no one knows actually exists aside from you you know just like with from dusk till dawn that fart noise at the end classy bubba hotep approves lmao i swear your take on things are so hilarious is the thumbnail literally stephen weyte pulling a low budget caleb cosplay it feels good dont it civvie a dev who actually listens and cares a rare feeling in these days yeah calebs voice is still fucked and now you cant break glass with conventional means great job this is legitimately joyful its beatiful ill definitely keep an eye on this game on my wishlist im starting to think is all a marketing campaign by nightdive studios and civvie you know what it is mean cv11 blood on extra crispy oh shit here we go again way to spoil bubbahotep ya dick what a way to end a video glad i watched bubba hotep because what the fuck civvie love bubba hotep what did you think of john dies at the end this remaster is still kicking i wanted to make a joke about your last video being the unofficial patch notes but they took it seriously hey civvie the game is still broken you cant shoot out glass windows among numerous other bugs dont redemption arc this product until it actually is fixed because it makes you look like youre selling out i get that a lot of the older bugs were fixed but this latest patch just introduced a bunch of completely new ones and its still nowhere near an acceptable state it does seem like you addressed this somewhat but it feels like the video is all about dismissing these bugs because the developer is working on it this is the same problem with games like anthem and we shouldnt be accepting broken games that are being worked on unreal quake doom starcraft halflife diablo etc all received patches but at the same time those games were in a playable state on release releasing completely broken games is unacceptable even if they are getting patches wipes tear from eye play the game civvie play the game im probably gonna buy this now when i saw the other video i decided to hold off on buying the game when i saw this one i bought it immediately civvie which new game you like to play this why you are the premier boomer youtuber you give a shit and that damn well worth subscribing to one beef two wellington one risotto i knew nightdive guys wont let us down welcome to modern day game development civvie where the motto is launch now patch later now only if this can get ported onto consoles bruce campbell is the fucking best i want him to voice act for a game like blood they stole half the oneliners from evil dead anyway hopefully they fix the wierd ass issues with audio in multiplayer one player can often hear the other players enemy voices or vise versa or not hear the other or music doesnt play for one player and often the nonhost doesnt get voice clips at all ruining a big part of what makes blood so fun the hilarious voice clips for now bloodgdx is super servicable in mp nowadays will switch back when it gets further patched damn thats gotta be one of the most comprehensive first patches ive ever seen for a game also nice bubba ho tep soundtrack is this why i cant load my save file spoilers for bubba hotep i had no idea anyone else even watched that movie how do people even find out about bubba hotep its easily one of the strangest movies ive ever watched but i cant recall where i first watched it all i know is that i own it on dvd and that civvie is cool so what youre saying is buy it now its good to go were calling these mivvies mini civvies i claim it man okay your videos are great and refer to everything i love and the bubba hotep reference fucking hit home civvie how could you spoil bubba hotep its only like what 14 years old lmao id recommend it for anyone who hasnt seen it though if they like cheesy movies andor bruce campbell i knew theyd fix it like i said on the last video on fresh supply nds is dedicated and works pretty hard its a shame it seems to have been pushed out a little early but im sure theyll perfect it one of few game devs i have faith in meanwhile in fallout 76 and anthem ok so they listened to you even the jump without raising the water level thing congrats dude well done it is good to know people are playing blood and enjoying it thank you devs and thank you civvie i still dont like how they removed the stone gargoyle animation removing the gargoyle morph animation was not a good thing though can we get a little bit of context do a pro doom 64 ex its some of kaisers previous work before nightdive studios great port patch notes added rest of the game was so happy that they patched it thanks for this vid and thank you nightdive d nightdive studios really does good work i remember when forsaken remastered had a bunch of issues at launch and they patched those out so fucking fast this video gave me many positive vibes and i dont even played the game respect for staying on the ball for this that actually hit me hard in the feels did they reach out to you to beg you to make a video about how they are still working on it due to the spergs who massively overreacted and misunderstood the tone of your original video btw i dont know why but you remind me of max damage from carmageddon now i have to get this i already own the other but i want this one dumb i love it they patched the game when they were criticized you updated your review nearly immediately the creative integrity on display from all of you is fucking glowing this video reminds me that i really need to rewatch bubba hotep hope what with owning the rights to blood now they eventually make a new blood game thats actually good maybe make it like a greasier doom you should waited the game is worse now after patch glad to see them fixing it so fast night dive have really done well even if this remaster had issues they really do care about their games and you definitely helped get thing rolling civvie reminder that civvie will record pro catfight when he reaches 100 million subscribers civvie is such a good guy hey when is pro half life coming out i wish theyd update blood 2 on the steam release i cant get off the face leech things and i literally fall through the map at certain points i genuinely enjoy that game i know its annoying but shitty games can be so great hail to the king baby civvie tcb baby taking care of business review bobba ho tep now you boomer elvis didnt die he helped make blood fresh supply you have no idea how much it pleases my cold dead heart that my all time favorite shooter is finally getting the attention it deserves praise you civvie im not a fever blood fan but i really liked the remaster in its initial form even with the crashes now it become unmissable well this is what happends when you stand out for what you love and say the things that people are afraid to say you get positive changes changes for the better i will still hold upuntil they fixed other bugs and issues the game still has until diving again into the deepest catacombs of blood once more well i still play the original but its the least i can do with a new port of blood now if we could have a better version of blood 2 that could be really swell man hell tess bubba hotep did you just spoiled me bubba hotep shit it was in my watching list after this huge laundry list of fixes i gotta say blood fresh supply is in good hands buy it up everyone still needs fixing but nice other youtubers when a game gets patched ignores positive changes doubles down on complaints incites anger amongst easilymanipulated fanbase of morons towards developers for seemingly no reason civvie 11 makes touching tribute to bubba hotep and the developers for their hard work while still admitting its not 100 fixed in a constructive way this is why he needs more subscribers and exposure people the chad retro reviewer or the virgin aussie shillmaster nice to see there putting effort into it nightdive of late seem to be doing decent thumbs up for bubba hotep projared cheated on his wife what still needs to be fixed any other major bugs still present im waiting until this is the perfect way to play blood to buy it i really want to get it but ill wait until this gem is perfected that song is perfection update was so hard it broke all the saves bruce campbell can do no wrong you know they were listening to you already when you talked about the achievement but they really wanted to make sure a lot of those issues got addressed quick looking forward to giving this a go i bought this just after it got patched and im fuckin loving it finally get to play this brilliant game civvie gets one hour knocked off his sentance for this although he is still going to be down in the dungeon till the end of time so sad is that bubba hotep will you marry me civvie 11 i really wanna see bubba hotep now and woo i love that score games a price of shit ass kicking bullshit game that we all know and love so should we get it now with the 50 off to be fair the initial 188 patch fucked up a lot of peoples games bugs with the logo cutscene preventing people from running the game in the first place rendering and texture issues making the shit look like an atari 2600 game issues with loading saves from the main menu not working at all nds was quick in releasing subsequent updates that actually fixed everything so i guess they just screwed up when sending the initial patch down the pike i do think everyone got up in arms for no good reason though has nightdive earned a rep for shoddy releases in the past instead of waiting and seeing how things would play out blood diehards opted to raise the pitchforks instead no one had the patience to sit back and see what would happen i subbed to this channel a few days ago and its the best decision i have made since being on youtube your content is honest and well made and youre opinion is reliable and not skewed by monetary incentives i can respect that i have held off on this remaster based on your reviews so far so i am looking forward to a future update where hopefully most of these problems are ironed out for now i will be sticking with the og version of the game i was expecting some sort of nah it still sucks but no i was pleasantly surprised seems like night dive are dedicated to try and keep the supply as fresh as their title i guess you can say we got a fresh supply of updates ill walk myself out now god even hearing the music to bubba hoteps ending makes me all teary eyed is flame guy still a thing httpsbloodwikiorgindexphpflameguy if no one has seen bubba hotep stop reading this comment and go and watch it you were part of this good work sir definitely my favorite reviewer and one of my favorite games as a programmer seeing that many fixes in such a short time makes me want to work for this company elvis has left the building thank you for being honest civvie more youtube reviewers need to do that more this is the best reminder that i need to rewatch bubba hotep that ive ever had usually its just any mention of jfk in anything breaking news pro blood player mad developers listen this why we keep you in the dungeon against your will civvie this is why we keep you in the dungeon against your will i had to make a salute to this i knew those nightdive gents could be trusted to listen and fix ah yes more bruce campbell sweet should i get the steam or gog version steam gave me a coupon for this they really want people who picked up the original to buy fresh supply i still dont know if i should use it and i dont think i will either oh thats very nice i already bought it and this update made me real happy very nice can someone tell me the name of the song its not in the description to be honest i was actually starting to tear up until the fart sound see this this is the kind of power you wield apparently you can no longer break glass with many of your weapons ugh thank you civvie may your torturous sentence in the dungeon be slightly less painful not only are you a fan of 19201940 golden age movies but also bubba hotep even more respect now i really look forward to the devs watching this to those who cant load savegames after patch went live open console type developer 1 and try again game will pop warning you have incorrect version but should load save anyway after that make new save and disable developer mode yeah i bought it and couldnt get through first level i remember blood being hard but not that hard i just wish gearbox would be like this for duke nukem 3d 20th anniversary world tour the weapon selection for mousewheel is shiiieett geaaarboooxxxx well atleast i can still play blood in an enjoyable manner i wonder why did civvie never play exhumed powersalve or at least talk about it also the discussions for the game on steam have went to normal not an update but the whole civvie fans are sheep vs gman fans are shills shit got old quick god bless you civvie god bless you 045 if you ever wanted to get emotional by looking at a wall with a shadow on it this is the time still waiting for a new proper sequel for this game cultist chuck a lit stick of dynamite at me made me cry 032 private lobbies fuckin yesssssssssssss and all was well touching there is some kind of gods and civvie im happy so much got patched and i cant thank nightdive enough for actually listening to people but good luck breaking a window now good fucking luck you lit a napalmfueled fire under their ass use this power of yours responsibly they did more with 1 patch than most dev studios do in a year godspeed nightdive they did this for you civvie ayeeehaw now theres no need to call someone a loser for wanting to buy their partner a port of a good game yahoooo mama mia i remember trying to play bloodone whole unit and it sucked im glad this came along waiting for poweslave ex bloodfresh supply is something we needed so is it good enough to buy now that was beautiful guys dont worry nightdive releases about a zillion patches for every game yurok and system shock are still getting little patches to perfect the game reminds me of beamdog with balders gate remasters edit yurok stays as it is perfect forever damn i thought i was the only person who knew about bubba ho tepp i knew i became a fan of yours for a damn good reason yeah bubba hotep is great now if only you could convince randy pitchford to put duke megaton back on steam then the holy trinity will be complete in all its glory preferably by

unlike that cocksucker gman ill buy it when its extra crispy thank you all for coming ill be here next week that bubba hotep scene reminds me when spoony used it sigh better times back then you did

love that movie but now i cant destroy windows without wasting precious explosives ammo d good reviewers merely put a number on a game and put it in the shelf the best reviewers make videos to point out how shit some stuff are and get love from the devs to fix that shit guess where civvies at in the ranking i have a question why theres still no quake or pro quake movie on this channel hey civvie 11 can you do pro doom 3 anytime soon please all is good once again ok epic win for the use of bubba hotept goddamn that was well done until the end pitchfork is broken lmao blood fresh supply releases bugs all over civvie rants bugs fixed give this man a medal my wallet says no but everything else says to buy and play it for the next 10 hrs thats great news maybe one day in the coming months it will complete its journey from raw to extra crispy they got on that pretty fast considering that they name an achievement after a quote from one of your videos im sure seeing your its broken review gave them a ohh shit moment good on them for listening bubba hotep was awesome thank u man i know it is stupid but will u do a next pro blood remaked or a live stream with archive to yt i would love to watch this good cuz rage 2 still wont launch for me what was with the fart at the end d somehow the bubba hotep music and imagery is super fitting for this video i wouldnt have it any other way still no mouse y look i dont want to have vertical look the feels when i hear this music oh hell yeah bubba hotep was an incredible movie is this it civvie is it now cooked just right all hail civvie singlehandedly saving fresh supply gman lives is already bitching about some of the changes making the game too hard and just deleted those posts as usual when ppl overwhelmingly call his bs out xd i mean it was their job to fix their own mess but i have to admit i havent expected them to do it so fast now at last blood is finally once again open for business vincent we happy oh so thats why all my save files got corrupted hud is still ugly are we starting to cook with gas im impressed how fast this fix was now they got my money and i get 50 off from owning bouwb brings a tear to ones eye when is pro duke nukem forever civvie hay civvie are we ever going to get a painkiller review look civvie i know lunar apocalypse sucks but youve got to give us pro nukem 3d part 2 at some point i just on break and i only miss earth changing update this by an hour nice bubba hotep is a good choice bought at full price even having 50 off yea money will be well spent if it make devs want to rework blood 2 so sir are you saying you recomend to buy on steam or hold dinaro in wallet still smoking a didgeradoo on gs video buahahaha cant wait for pro fresh supply patched version idk why i was expecting the game to not get any patches is there a linux version coming soon nightdives other games have linux versions so i was expecting a version of blood on linux damn you love to see it thats a huge patch gone on the lads glad someone else appreciates bubba hotep i knew that music was familiar but i couldnt place it pro turok when civvie you bastard hitting me with all the bubba hotep feels at the end damn it almost feels like they used you to identify all the bugs so is it worth playing yet or should i still wait you didnt buy on gog shame on you civvie props to you for updating as soon as it was patched civvie11 you are the hero we need but not the one we deserveyour passion for this game has also made me love bloodand iam a more doomduke guy for your brutal honestyblood now lives again manly tear has been shed also will you look at no one lives forever games nolf12 are one of my favourites and it was developed by monolith too too bad some idiot cant find where are the rights to it we cant even get a remaster civ your style of humor and love of 90s games is pretty spot on with my own ive got a nostalgia trip for you do you remember coconut monkey from the pc gamer demo cds bruce fucking campbell so you are saying that we may have a chance at a faithful recreation of blood without need to use dosbox thats cool pro barbies horse adventure when civvie well i was just thinking about this earlier today and told myself that ill get it if it gets patched this video made me want to buy it now top 10 anime redemption arcs real talk though im happy to see that nightdive is actually giving a shit about this blood is a game that deserves to be played by many and its good to see that its being done justice it still sucks that not everything is fixed but hey gotta fight one evil at a time when i saw the update yesterday i knew it was thanks to you d keep up the good work civvie sniff its so beautiful is it worth getting now didnt buy it yet im quite surprised how fast they managed to fix so many issues hey civvie i dont know you i stumbled across your channel when the algorithm suggested the hunt down the freeman video i rarely sub to the channels i watch but when i do i make sure to tap the bell and so i did so today i had this horrible horrible day i lost the train to work ive been reading ugly news all day long the people i talked to today insulted me or felt entitled to violently pick on me because i do a job thats considered subpar uninteresting and a fraud im not a fraud i do surveys and quality checks for a living there have been times when i was utterly assaulted first verbally then physically just for posing a question you know the postal dude right the mission you hated the most in postal 2 the petitions thats right only its a tad more investigative but thats the tip of the iceberg furthermore i live alone in a house of my own but no friends in town and none from my past i moved in my home town three years ago after almos i enjoy the bubba hotep reference lol your a good friend we wouldnt have this if everyone was as conformist as some people criticising people who criticise obvious flaws when do you take a break civvie and some awesome buba ho tepperyi love that film and soundtrack thumbs up just for bubba hotep alone so is it worth a buy now time to redo the review thanks gggman for the solid criticism kaiser fresh supply has bugs what kind of bugs civvie look man do i look like an eciologist to you some big damn bugs size of my fist size of a peanut butter and banana sandwich man o boi now the game is worth its asking price which is 500 can because i have the coupon wow im a cheapskape okay here we go time to play thank u civvie dont stop making video please best channel on youtube who is for the new review when the blood remaster will become well done i dont fucking care that you reviewed this game already twice i just want more blood and your civvie how the fuck are your update videos better than peoples normal videos see this is why i didnt refunded the game i hope it doesnt end up like shadow warrior redux with that fuckjn aiming acceleration glitch and the weapons shooting left of the crosshair those two bugs should have been fixed its not cool that the redux looks washed out while the original is vibrant but thats excusable the two bugs i mentioned before are not nice i literally just checked gog for a patch this morning found none figured it would take another week or two glad i was wrong with civvie till death its awesome when the devs actually pay attention and fix the stuff that gets critiqued bubba hotep now its more like medium rare when its raw but you send it back to the cook and they fix it i love this song great choice bubba hotep is a amazing movie with a godlike soundtrack more people should know it and blood is a godlike game with a amazing soundtrack hm civvie is a man of taste still pretty skeptical well now ill buy it thanks for you cv11 for make they care about their costumers and make their product much better i was wondering why the music was so familiar then i read the description nice one very promising ill grab the update from gog to see how it fares bubba hotep is as beautiful as evil dead time to rewatch bubba hotep a single tear falls from civvies eye god is real this is one character redemption arc if ive ever seen one good then way to ruin the moment smh cv i knew my bois at nightdive would fix everything up loved their work on turok and a few other games thankfully they have kept my trust was that a bubba hotep reference about to head to work when i saw you post it glad they took your advice as constructive criticism may pick the game up now on steam soon im sure many others will as well with a development like this still yet another broken game on release patching it is great but if it doesnt work on day one it shouldnt be for sale for that bubba hotep reference you get a like my nigga civvie whipped the devs into shape so is it safe to play fresh supply now and have a good experience or should i still stick with bloodgdx until later patches im still running through my first time with episodes 3 onwards so i dont want a tainted first experience this this is why i subbed to you civvie hey civvie wheres pro opposing force we need a nice gearbox video to honor the news that randy likes to slap around people up who inadvertently get in the way of him doing shady deals and pocketing millions of dollars in bonuses the fart at the end civvieis this a eddie murphy joke i was going to be really pissed if you didnt show the all is well when i heard that song fucken thing still gives me goosebumps proof nightdive studios watches civvies vids review bubba hotep we need more eyes on it and my coworkers think i made up the buttmummy wow im not the only one who remembers bubbahotep damn right also a on using bubba hotep cant wait for nightdive to release powerslave too ive been waiting for this its time to properly murder things time to go buy it hell yeah civvie is a pure child this game this game is live again interpolation is working now because nblood now is a way better well this is a win win a patch goes in effect really quickly and civvie lets the world know i wish this remastered was coming coming to xbox one bubba hotep is a great movie fuck bubba hotep is such a good but underrated fucking movie surprisingly touching for a cheesy bmonster flick even my mom who usually hates those kinda movies fell in love with it highly recommended thats cool when devs are very rapid and to the point in their response a golden star and a smiley sticker for nightdive studios did it become perfect can i finally die in peace i never thought bubba hotep would be so emotional that thumbnail is a piece of art its as if someone at night dive watched reviews and read criticisms and acted to make their game better than it was before take note aaa studios you know i wonder what mods you could make for blood i mean doom has a fuckton of mods from map packs to minor asthetics to complete overhauls wow thx civvie pretty sure they see your video awesome juste awesome heartwarming my blood runs hot with joy finally ill be able to hear the god damn music fuckin cooked i cried and now they will spill more blood was that gordon ramsey at the end that bubba hotep move was unexpected and im not crying i swear civvie you are my fresh supply just bought it on gogfor less than half the price of a lge double quarter pounder meal canned soup tonight boomer dad looks out for his sons and nephews respect also bubba hotep is good movie still pink on the inside but its getting closer to being well done after the patch is it safe to say we will get the extra crispy version eventually i knew theyd patch it they obviously watch your channel civvie keep up the good work everyone lol the new patch literally breaks the game you cant finish e5m5 without using no clip now windows no longer break when you shoot them either did anyone else lol at the dynamite freeze frame 1 for bubba hotep after seeing your review of blood fresh supply i refunded it and got my 10 bucks back but after watching this and seeing it get patched yesterday i bought it again good thing i did refund it let it get patched and buy it again second time i bought it i got it 50 off for owning og blood also did anyone else notice how the new patch also has the atari animation at the start when it originally didnt how pissed was atari when they saw that there was no credit to them in the startup initially the speed of the fixes is as puzzling as the nature of most of the bugs its like they released the wrong build friendly reminder that bubba ho tep is a fucking amazing movie not impressed yet i would never expect a blood remaster to fit the hole release it now patch it later mentality civvie you should play doom 64 bubba hotep you beautiful boomer i like you even more now saves seem to take even longer to work now i dunno if thats just me before civvie i only knew about duke3d quake and doom didnt like sw for the character i thought these were the top of 90s fps now i know better blood is so much better so good so wonderful ive never been so happy to have a cultist chuck a lit stick of dynamite at me cv11 2019 paraphrased time to use that coupon then so have they acknowledged every single issue you brought up it would worry me if they were intentionally holding off on fixing certain issues might get it now thanks civvie you da man awesome nice one civvie if your videos help to get games patched well and quickly i can see there being a lot of demand for videos about bethesda games good on night dive studios for listening to the fans and major thanks to civvie 11 for bringing awareness to these issues not a stretch to say he helped get the ball running i am really glad to see how fast and hard they are working on this even if my game crashed after a few quick loads on the new version with some stuttering i just really hope it becomes one of the best alternatives if not the best to play blood edit okay i just hope they dont work too fast that it brings up new bugs civvie likes bubba hotep he truly is a man of good taste looks like they still havent fixed the key rebinding but its good that theyre working on it i refunded my copy im still gonna stick with bloodgdx might check nblood out if that gets praise somewhere its fucking medium rare bubba hotep now that was a movie oh and the game got patched thats cool i guess sooooo blood 2 remastered anyone you know a proper fixed game 113th well i guess its time to buy it wow they are to be trusted then well now i have a good reason to buy it nice i incinerated a cultist from afar with that extra flare i saved from the butcher worth it maaaaaan you had to post this with the ending of bubba hotep thanks for making me happy while getting me in the feels now return the hydrogen bomb theres something about these type of game developers they know how to accept criticism and right their wrong take rws for example postal 3 was bad and they took it like a champ and release newbetter dlc im not crying youre crying holy jesus that was fast stupid fast one of the most under rated movies out there ive tested and now death wish runs fine in fresh supply consider me a happy man now civvie i love you and the content that you make bubba hotep imagery and music this is why i love you civvie whats the name of the soundtrack this is why i pay you passion over content keep doing you where is the guy in preview is from also fuck yeah blood never i have seen such beautiful patch notes pro kiss psycho circus when civvie awesome must be a good feeling seeing your constructive criticism being taken seriously and not being dismissed as a personal attack as a lot of indie devs would i mean i dont even blame devs going that route since you pour so much work and effort into a project as a single person that it gets hard to confuse the two i think the delivery of your initial video also helped a lot civvie great job damn kaiser wasnt lying when he said hes gonna look into all critical points that was beautiful thank goodness ive never been so upset immediately after purchasing a game im still mad at gggman though where is that movie scene from at the end also what is the song that is playing at the end thank god this wasnt like hdtf im happy why play blood fresh supply when you can just play blood reborn babyyyy civvie becoming too powerfull to contain now he can change reality we need to find a way to weaken him or eliminate if possible wow that was fast the lingering closeup on the thrown dynamite is just perfect eventually civvie 11 will be happy with this release ive just changed my mind its great still have a bug window panes not braking for some reason only tnt the movie scene is from the bubba ho tep if anyones wondering at this hour redemption arc release a buggy build to fuck over pirates patch the game shortly after release profit its its beautiful i knew i recognized that theme sebastian haff saves the day told you it wasnt raw it was just pink on the inside okay guys put it back on the grill for a bit i like my oldschool fps games as i like my steak extra crispy lansdale is the fucking best doing gods work civvie you roasting in the video got them fixing it it was like they diddnt even test it the news with civvie 11 at 11 hes bringing the breaking stories which matter to you things like these make me respect nightdive studios but if it wasnt for people like civvie11 this update probably wouldve taken longer that said let the proper blood modding begin this was profound good on you to make a speedy follow up on the issues from the previous vid see you in the grave blood so we lived on to explode more corpses wheres the music from its awesome wow that was fast civvies review is a better analysis then shillmanlivess analysis fight me and admire the boomer they listened to you civvie they felt your pain at it being raw and they fixed it that video thumbnail is choice do a rereview of the game i guess its now lightly broiled ayyy good on em they must watch your vids this is good to hear im going to gog to buy it now yay like i said nightdive are good folks with a holy mission to save divine relics of the past and it seems theyre darn fast in their patching too bubba ho tep was an awesome movie shit that was fast hell yeah that was indeed fast and now i am starting to really wanting to buy blood fresh supply off of steam lost all my save files thanks to this patch but it was worth it all is well and here i was hoping for asmr civvie reading the patch notes dang thanks civvie for critiquing the remaster so we can play it more like its supposed to be played can you turn off the glowing blue eyes on the gargoyle that no other version had just like i suspected my save game file got destroyed by incompatibility with the new game version and lit dynamite still doesnt explode in my dead hand patch so good it corrupted all my saves it seems that nightdive gives a fuck about the work perhaps ive misjudged ooh im early woop woop this is love big fan boi wow he immediately updates good on you other reviewers will just leave the review and never go back say the n word in the next video is too eager to wait for end of video to comment did they add a level stats feature either way praise be to nightdive studios they have listened to our favorite dungeon gamer hope they also fixed the long as fuck quick save times notification squad roll out civvie back with another banger oh god that thumbnail first comment fuck you can you alter the keypad to personalize game play if so how u didnt even turn on the 3d aiming in other words the real 3d lmao i noticed the explosion sprites are cut when over the sky in gdx still i dont know what is best i had problems with fresh meat map04 in fresh supply some bugs in room over room areas i prefer bloodgdx since theyve been improving and fixing so much game in every nook and cranny im less worried about minor color differences and more about not being able to play since game crashes or just bugs quite frequently to the point that i have to fuk around in the config manually when game wont start on a given renderer since i cant go into options to change it hoping for a patch somehow gdx isnt smooth for me and the skybox isidk i feel sick when i look that is it me or did gdx change the intro tomb rooms floor brown the muddy floor has a pink hue to it in the original game and palette pathetic charging 5 for a source port when there already exists a free source port that looks better ridiculous money grab at the moment i prefer the fresh supply version because it has excellent vsync while im having problems with camera movement in the bloodgdx v0798 version because i think its incompatible with the gpu gigabyte 1050 ti or 4gb cpu intel core i3 8100 i have that image refresh problem in bloodgdx v0798 at the moment the gog fresh supply version is better i hope that bloodgdx repairs that error soon in some new version or update fresh supply is shit my game dont start the issues ive noticed in fresh supply are easily fixed and i have no doubt will be addressed and improved even turok 2 remaster had some issues with graphics sounds and textures but they were all addressed to me everything is nearly perfect but needs fine tuning gdx is way more accurate to the original sounds and ai are off in the new port funny thing is fresh supply is supposed to be easier but i cant get used to how different it behaves so i capt dying so much i started save scummingxd then i tried bloodgdx for the first time to see the differences and beet the first episode no problem best shotgun dmc 3 shotgun or super shotgon you jump that a lot for what reason theres no strafe jumping in blood is there i would trash you noobs oh nice you recorded our game play were we tested the maps so cool they should have added cultist skin alt use to play blood coop and bloodbaths all the time in the 90s and later on metldownyang and i remember friendly fire couldnt be turned off glad to see it being worked out now so it turns out that blood is a very very good game and i feel like an idiot for not playing it sooner i hope you like the video my twitter httpsgooglcfy1co instagram httpsgooglyynzud facebook httpsgooglg68z5f much love x i have seen phantasm the tall man in the mocie phantasm scared the living hell out of me not to mention his flying chrome balls of death such an iconic horror movie i would recommend new players to turn weapon wheel off and to turn the hud to minimal less clutter and a way more modern feeling experience wish this was on xbox ill have to get this when i get a good pc iconic machete not knife my dad got me hooked on phantasm and it is one of my favorite movie series ever somewhere over the rainbow is from iz represent hawaii jeez in episode 1 mission 1 as soon as you get out of the crypt and try to open the grass hedge background you will find eric draven grave from the movie and comic the crow also at the end of episode 1 when caleb shout show yourself show yourself is a reference to the movie warlock didnt know about the bill and ted one what is jojo a reference to you missed quite a few like the the crow reference eric dravens grave in e1m1 if you stab dukes body with a melee weapon he says oh shake it babie 347 he says it louder in the dos version blood fresh supply had sound issues among other things upon launch it has since been patched once or twice remasters jump is awkward cool and scary game jason has a knife mm okay i didnt even knew that blood existed quite interesting game ophelia is also calebs lover but who watches those ugly cinematics 033 pause and see the zombie or human dead is from hl2 they predict half life 2 ophelia is his lovernot just a dead body first level in the inbalming room out out damndest spot first level s soon as you leave the crypt the bushes to the right never more there are alot more do better holy crap are you playing keyboard only how did you survive missed the tomb raider one ophelia is also kalebs girlfriend so basically literally every easter eggs secrets and references that were in the original game and the gzblood and nblood ports also get your facts right this isnt a remake it is a remaster aw man you forgot the reference to civvies channel one of the secret areas is called the forgotten tomb alter if you go in youll get an achievement that says so forgotten it still has cultists in it which is a reference to the youtube channel cv11 he reviews games like blood and hexen witch on there are alot of the phatasme movies still the dual shotgun on is the best phantasm heard of it srry if i misspelled it the voice actor stephan weyte voice actor for caleb in blood is a friend of mine he told me he came up with a lot of the songs in the recording booth just to mix things up if you want to see his recent stuff hes an actor in my miniseries antihero you forgot to shake dukes body you forgot how the choking hands will shout ill swallow your soul thats a reference to the evil dead movies turn on full 3d aim ive watched the first three movie of phantoms could get around the fourth instalment 916 that made me laugh harder than it should have theres a reference to stephen king at the end of episode 3 when you begin the boss level against cerebus the two headed dog as you enter its den a loud howl can be heard before you actually confront the monster caleb says cujo really enjoyed these even though i dont remember this game hope to see more of these retro easter eggs in e1m1 there is a secret with the tomb that says draven in which it reference the crow and caleb says a line from the poem crow the only reason ive heard of phantasm was because of how bad it was you missed the edger allen poes the raven referencesecret its the the cery third one found right near the start of the game behind a hedge wall just after you exit the crypt ophelia is also the love interest in caleb i get it everyone youve heard of phantasm but havent seen it p love the movie phantasm the calenders with the sexy lady you see around the game are a references to elvira mistress of the dark i believe the severed head on the table next to the jason mask is also meant to be a reference to the severed head of jasons mother yo why dint you mention the shrine at jasons partits a reference to the shrine dedicated to his mother hey broawesome video as alwaysi hv one req can u make an easter eggssecrets video on alien isolationthnx dont remember much about phantasm but do remember having nightmares about it when i was younger very first level exit the tomb right right open and youll find eric dravens grave or was it left s anyway its in the first area 547 ive seen it in the theatre hey can you make a video about games who added easter eggs about players who have died 811 damn shame you didnt press the use key hed say shake it baby spencer charnas of ice nine kills would play the fuck out of this game ive heard of phantasm but i havent seen it ive heard of phantasm but never seen it rip angus scrimm you were the tallest of men phatasam was a weird movie we know what he said he just said you treat the audience like they are retarded just to get to 10mins good to see you back to easter eggs sad to see you are repeating stuff to get to 10mins 10 respect ophelia is a character you see in the intro video she is calebs girlfriend she was captured and then killed by the stone gargoyle cheogh bgm has doom 2016 soundtrack i love it one the first map of the game where you wake up right outside the krypt is a hedge you can click on it and it opens there you can find empty crave of draven and clicking on it makes caleb say nevermore i hear all these people bitching about the smallest bugs and glitches am i really the only one that cares that the save files dont work what the fuck there are at least two references to the film dead calm on e2l1 the game is full of so many great references and one liners the corpse barrels on stage 1 and 2 are a reference to return of the living dead well phantasm introduced me to the quadbarrelled shotgun atleast thats one thing i remembered from the movie i havent seen phantasm but i do know of the film and most of the plot you say ch ch ch ha ha ha but its ki ki ki ma ma ma if you press use on dukes corpse caleb will say ooh shake it baby as the corpse twitches also on the shining level it actually is called the overlooked hotel which is a reference to the overlook and in the freddy level it is a boiler room and when you walk on the high up platform you hear a voice say 12 freddys coming for you i remember posting about the friday the 13th level on a friday the 13th forum back in 2008 and they were not impressed they couldnt get over the fact the graphics were so outdated and started bitching and they live in a world of dlcs where you can get movie references in every cod downloadable mod what they were missing is it was a legit friday the 13th level based in the actual camp not a secret level not a dlc not fan made and actually canonical to the game itself in a game that can be purchased on the shelf in a store the protagonist sounds like gman they should have stephan weyte rerecord his old lines in high quality d something tells me we still aint gonna get the source code man there is plenty of good games for you for easter eggs hunting this one is not my cup of tea for sure herd of it but never seen it its so forgotten its still full of fucking cultists might want to put an epilepsy warning on the duke nukem easter egg those projector flashes are a little bright and fast ive never heard of phantasm i really enjoyed your video however it truly saddens me that you couldnt play it with a mouse and keyboard in my version of blood old one the mask of jason says with an echo kill have you watched civvie 11 yet was thinking about picking this game up the audio isnt working edit works nowsorry for disturbing if you poke duke nukems corpse he also says shake itbaby if you play with the body of duke nukem caleb say shake it baby and in the first level in the game if you go right after leaving the crypt you can touch the bush then a secret area is open and you can see the tomb of the raven of edgar allan poe nevermore 602 dont think thats a hamlet reference calebs girlfriend just happens to be named ophelia you can find a hamlet reference in the first level where if you interact with the sink caleb will say out out damned spot one of the maps in the second episode is named overlook hotel like the hotel in shining and the friday the 13th sound says kill kill kill kill kill ma ma ma ma ma if you interact with duke kaleb will say shake it baby wich is also a voiceline of duke for when he interacts with strippers i really enjoy your content keep that awsome shit up d in the duke nukem easter egg what version are you playing of duke i like to know it please good video ironically in duke nukem you can also find the hanging body of doom guy to answer your question i have heard of phantasm but never actually seen it ironically i know of the film due to a old gaming magazine called tips and tricks where i guess there was supposed to be a reference to it in one of the old tony hawk games but it ended being taken out for some reason love these videos man keep up the great work is it possible to have cryptic passage in the standad episode selection menu as in whole unit great review i subscribed people say this game is a cult classic and i tend to agree with them its just awesome your review gave some perspective of some of the negatives in which youre mostly right i played the original as a kid and certain things like being able to get crushed by a door were still in the game which made it quite a bit harder especially the platforming parts thank you for allowing me to play this game vicariously since i wont be playing it myself great review love it the only issue is really just that the enemy variety seems so lackluster in an otherwise fun game dang in the original there was a very annoying bug which makes closing doors crash you to death i guess thats why the

remaster next step is chasm the rift oh hell yeah im getting this one whooohooo i wanna real blood 2 on build engine just thank you have my money everyone forget about system shock wtf are you doing nightdive save files dont work dont buy this trash need support mac os x if it game is cool this game doesnt work because my pc is 32 bit i really hope you guys hammer out all the bugs because this would be my personal goty this game has always been fantastic love the new additions that nightdive brought to the table a big thumbsup as nightdive are the saviors of keeping retro videogame gems alive and kicking a big thanks an while the game blood may have some ironingout finetuning to go on inhouse hopefully within upcoming updates there could be an option to disable vertical looking mouse gamepad eg shadow warrior this is simply a purest option request as playing these games back in the good ol days of dos looking up and down wasnt necessary and at points seems to break immersion an while modern fps gamers cant resist not having complete mouse joystick looking control these days really feel that games based on the early doom build engines look feel and play better while played with no vertical looking as the 2d sprite animated enemies objects when looked down upon are seen as paper cutouts to be distracting and damage the experience as it was never mea so uh it runs smoother but enemies arent working the way theyre supposed to on certain difficulties and a lot of other bugs that shouldnt happen sounds like dos emulators are unfortunately still the way to go until this gets fixed thanks for the insight civvie gratz for your rushed launch the game is filled with glitches and game break bugs nice job we are players not alphabeta testers please fix it so why does this thing exist exactly if i knew no better i would assume this is footage from the blood gdx port which will you know run the original game just fine at no extra cost please fix the bugs do not buy this game it is bugged broken and absolutely inferior to bloodgdx and nblood which are also far more accurate to the original they really shit the bed with this release wait until its patched or even better use the aforementioned ports for free proof httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvekg29enea httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviarqk5thklu im loving this game but unless im missing something there is no way to password or kick people from my server been trying to do coop but with in a minute the trolls join any news or info on passwording or kicking options ps4 and im in now its about time for a shogo remaster

clearly a lot of time and effort put into it really loving the remaster well done nds already bought it nightdive i love you so much for this thank you okay for 5 its not bad just to support it but at the same timeblood gdx has more options and fewer glitchesits going to take a bit more effort to make it not a bugy beta game released to consumers so they can do all the bug test work once again nightdive doing gods work thank you one of my favorite studios for sure whats new bloodgdx the same thing and its free i love this remasterbut the music in the trailer is a bit out of placewas

companies like nightdive and gog which are more than willing to make money off retro games by working with retro gamers and not against them like nintendo it gives me hope for the future a ps4 release would be really nice a ps4 release would be really nice oh man thank you so much for this is there a list of games you plan to save from obscurity somewhere any chance of combining steam and gogs online servers in the future ill be honest i hoped for updated graphics but ill take it got a 50 off coupon this morning instabought thank you nightdive this trailer needed more death via misthrowing

how turok 2s remaster release had some issues with the game but besides some graphics wrong sounds and textures and missing stuff blood fresh supply plays and controls amazing and i am glad you

remasterremake of blood 2 that fixes all the issues the original had holy crap this takes me back good show guys he livesagain this looks bloody good nice playthrough good stuff dude and i guess with the zombies yelling brains and the canisters with the zombies in them its a reference to return of the living dead if someone doesnt know great movie worth a watchstay away from 45 they are like blood iigarbage can you make all references in voicelines underrated horror fps you forgot two references in phantom 666 the name of stage and a quote get of my train this quote becomes from film ghost the head in the jason room may be a reference to pamela voorhees amazing job youve done there were a lot of references i hadnt noticed theres one you missed in e2m2 after jumping down the latrine moon key door caleb says something like what a wonderful smell ive discovered thats a quote from star wars a new hope when han solo and the rest fall down into the trash compactor i cant believe you didnt add the fresh victim for the overgrowing army of the dead line to the easter eggs also you dont need tnt to blow up to the super secret on the first level too i sincerely hope they make a remake of this game maybe like doom ep2 m1 shipwrecked where caleb encounters the jaw fish he quotes were gonna need a bigger boat which is a quote from the movie jaws only missed jaws movie esene miskatonic station in e1 from hp lovecraft books in the jason easter egg its also thought the head on the table is a reference to his mother who in later films is shown to be kept as a mummified head 017 or to league of legends can some 1 explain to me the speedrun achivement in this game what will it give you this game has in my eyes the best easter eggs also love this game is this coming to consoles why skelleton appears at the left 631 no one will make game like this againsimply best of the best uh theres already an all easter egg vid years ago on youtube but thanks for making it more relevant wtf was with that random skeleton xd 1248 hey its elvira shitty video you missed easter eggs that head on the table is jasons mother so is the voice saying kill ive been playing this for 20 years and i still dont know half this shit alright ive played blood for years and ill admit i never knew about some of these if you want to hear the voice actor stephan weyte he and i worked together on the miniseries antihero you can see on my other account i hope this game and dusk get released on console one day lol you could easily just jump on zombies head in e1m1s super secret you and captain egglance are the best easter egg founders i remember when i interacted with the sink with the sign instead of out out damn spot caleb would say i like my hands bloody edit just got word caleb actually says the line in wrong side of the tracks episode 1 level 2 not cradle to grave episode 1 level 1 thanks wow i didnt even know of some of these ive been looking at blood easter egg videos for years and played the game numerous times but didnt know a few of these played it the first time about a year ago or something amazing game the atmosphere the references the variety the main hero the humor its just good ok lets be real here games made before 2000s are some of the best games ever made trumping games to date they came out as full games were worked hard on for the experience not just the money looking at you ea and were genuinely inviting and creative even if it was horror too bad im born in 2001 this secrets are available on original blood or one unit whole blood jojo everywhere the player saying jojo jotaro kujo from jojos bizzare adventures stardust crusader suddenly appeared i saw a spooky boy at 630 am i seeing things i want to die please wanna help me or not a im death poor dog why did they put that right when you start on the first level he says i live again thats a reference to army of darkness and the nightmare on elm street baby movie the carriage one these secrets and movie references are so well done some of my favourite movies man i remember playing this game when i was 8 years old it made me shit my pants a few times specially with the hand jumping out of nowhere to choke caleb or the ghosts screaming while flying towards the player great vid man came in expecting shit video got highquality video with referential clips and all dude what spec you got this is

thought it is reference jojos bizzare adventurexd are you not terrified at this easter eggs you know its bad if duke is dead and hanging from a ceiling a great underrated horror fps game that better than most of todays games was this supposed to be a game that competed with doom at 210 when he jumps the ledge does it not look like a letter where a secret message would be written on the wall 630 there is a skeleton on the side early af where my civvie fans at know it all easter egg master yep you definitely are a veteran at blood those cultists hitscan have psychic perceptions and lightspeed windups i theorized playing this on extra crispy involved playing with the ambushes memorized and planning accordingly seems that is the case i didnt know you could do that window shortcut at the start cool i love how interactive build engine games were and how varied the level design was modern fpss need to take more cues from it any chance you will tackle the hexen games in the future great video what a fast releaseproduction o and gameplay extra chrispy is fing insane congratulations i was in search of a video like this to learn some gameplay tips may i ask which settings you used especially regarding the autoaim always run and crouch toggle blood is the fps that teaches you dont need fancy weapons to get the job done as long as you have the right mindset and skill i have never played blood so now is a good time to jump in looks great i tried to record myself playing this and the audio was really low what software did you use how does this compare to nblood or bloodgdx no unholy voice music in the beginning of level i live again lol what fresh hell is this what the hell is going on xd nani what is this oo hey look a video with no views to shake off those hand enemy motherfuckers press use or e repeatedly damnit corwin watch the shining its a masterpiece heres a piece of trivia the shining along with john carpenters the thing are screened every year for those spending the antarctic winter at the amundsenscott base nothing like a bit of paranoia fuel to begin a 6month period of isolation and darkness edit the tomes are there to unlock the exit to the secret level of the episode with phantasms the ghouls theyre invulnerable unless solid blood flesh supply is where caleb goes to san francisco to hit up the gay bath houses 150 his head went into the stratosphere woohoo this is the you lady you met at walmart do they connect wirelessly or with a ethernet cable thanks bro i played a lan yesterday using your fix it works smooth as butter how to change nickname your so bad at th egame omg 2650 well actually it may be a jojos bizarre adventures reference because caleb says four times jojo and in 1997 four series of jojos came out and ended i

i would recommend turning the hud to minimalistic makes it look a bit more modern top of your screen is also getting cut off a little bit blood for the blood god get off my train jojo was cheat code thats make you to play like under lsd or some sort of narcotics played this game about 17 years ago and still remember that lol but cant remeber where is my bloody car keys damn hell yeah blood never gets bored good times played a lot back in the day and im still play i also still have the original cdrom from the nonsteam version the msdos version along with the magazine its such a master piece for me blood will never die wrong side of the tracks was one of the maps released in the blood demo it is part of the era blood 1 multiplayer hell yeah i need to play this so basically multiplayer is what happens when the mini calebs are life sized and given full weapon access how do you set up a game i have no idea how and when i click host session in the menu all it gives me is my steam name in a box and no other options to click on i got blood fresh supply myself was it a good idea i dont care much about the innacuracies nostalgia its so good to watch such gameplay nowadays thx for uploading it so this port is a total wreck how amazing can you please share about the details of how did you make this work because they seemed to have canceled the linux port of the game or at least are not working on the game anymore but might do something official with atari i need to know i bought the game thinking they will make a linux port but now that they have cancelled i cant play this game i tired to run in steam proton but i cant get the game to work right i would deeply appreciate a tutorial as to how you got this to work right this is native game not dosbox man the final boss doesnt seem to have much health i bought this game cuz of your videos its very fun well observed on the dark cloak cultists aka fanatics they slide out of corners and surprise you and they do hide behind others because their code makes them stop firing when a fellow cultist is in their path so when the other cultist is in front they stop firing and walk behind them which makes them look like they think they are too superior to the other cultist and need a human shield to stay alive and the other cult member isnt worth y i love the blood games there should be a blood based level for hotdogs horseshoes and hand grenades are you guys ever gonna continue amid evil the full games been out fer a bit yeeeees dam straight far to long dammit as for the voodoo doll it does damage to enemies in your field of view but if you do it with something blocking you or if there are no enemies to damage you hurt yourself instead and as for the thicc zombies theyre pretty tanky but also weak to fire so flare gun is the way to go and you can crouch under their barf projectiles thats a bitchfork been waiting for this uko i dont think there are voodoo dolls in hot dogs horseshoes and hand grenades are there plus you guys havent come across all the weapons yet there should be a mod fo the game that makes the butchers ass cheecks clap first for the blood festival kills self by throwing dynamite at wall i guess they have some kind of rocket launcher how come the comments section says theres one comment but theres no comments is someone shadowbanned i am so nabbing this shit as soon as i have the money episode 1 mission 1 cradle to grave 000 level starts secrets 110 113 120 156 jump over the first row of chairs 207 press use on the organ 215 226 246 300 309 323 328 super secret it is behind a wall that isnt solid episode 1 mission 2 wrong side of the tracks 334 level starts secrets 510 524 528 551 two secrets 645 649 736 episode 1 mission 3 phantom express 748 level starts

secret to be counted episode 1 mission 4 dark carnival 1136 level starts secrets 1142 1208 yes you can drown 1251 1257 use jump boots 1308 i highly recommend saving before kicking each head in the mouth i finally get the secret at 1431 1500 use jump boots 1505 1 save files dont work game is trash very useful guide you should put the time codes on the comments so its easier to navigate subscribbed i found that playing build engine games duke blood shadow warrior would strain my eyes and make me feel a bit queasy this was just as bad with doom so i think it had something to do with primitive 3d graphics does the fresh supply version have any improved 3d rendering for more true 3d perspective or does the space render the same please do a grid of 4 screens nblood gdx fresh and dos it was a retrospective device is not something i ever expected to hear blood is so overrated in my opinion i love 90s fps games like doom quake and duke nukem but i just cant get into blood contrary to what yahtzee says bloods later episodes are great and feature some of my favorite levels e2m4 the overlooked hotel is phenomenal from a design perspective the year is 1996 no it isnt yahtz its twentynine it was a retrospective device you fuck 053 it was a retrospective device you fuck and everyone drives like they learned on a pair of roller skates funnily enough yahtzee just described how the enemies move in blood and la at the same time la traffic and drivers suck massive donkey balls how did i miss this one its amazing yahtzee pro blood when i find bloods 2d sprites much more enjoyable than nathan drakes stupid face no matter how many polygons its got wow civvie fanboys are like a plague theyre worse than those of that what do they eat dude calebs killer laughs and comments are cool but it took me quite a while that the pussy screams when he got scratched were his too btw in bloom caleb lives again i remember that game guns akimbo it wasnt as fun as doom ii quake or unreal but it was kinda entertaining in its own way a more accurate name for this game would be fire explosions blood transfusion already exists actually its a quake tc of the bloodbath multiplayer love you yahtz but the first episode is maybe my least favorite of the original four chapters its super unfair and frustrating because of the clip you acquire ammo and powerful weapon and so have to inch forward as you described but the later episodes get bigger and better and introduce lots of new locales and enemy types it ends up feeling like the fps equivalent of thief the dark project props for breaking the giraffes legs in correctly wrong directions i live in america that shit isnt a given i thought you moved to la i saw maranax infirmux and instantly remembered shogo monolith loved referencing its own games best manthrashingaboutonfire sprite alright ill give you that but 2nd place is metal slug good video but he just totally dissed stephan weyte shoutout to my homies who are also late millennial early gen z called caleb and grew up whilst it wasnt a very common yet its being used more now so whenever anything says caleb you get weirded out and turn to look seriously i have this problem i cant watch ex machina because of it and only just got through season 5 of brooklyn 99 that closing metaphor was pure gold why is there gravel in the bat anus sanguine supply wouldve made for a better title shorter catchier and alliterative blood is one of the goats damn kids these days dont get the sheer glory of it in its heyday 044 fun fact thats actually the name of a source port ill have you know that rampage came out in 1986 thank you very much and the original took place in various north american cities so duke nukem can kiss its entire reallifelocationhaving ass p im sure there are others but thats the one i distinctly remember the tommy gun cultists in the grey cloaks are the hardest enemies in the gameuntil you run into those bastards with the tesla cannons in that bonus episode are you sure you were california because you pretty much described the phoenix arizona valley no one not a single soul yahtzee los angeleese the thing i remember most about blood is the cultists death scream and the phantazims the goddamn phantazims yeah this game is a lot more fun if you play on custom difficulty and lower the cultist accuracy and maybe even aggression when your cover art is a bloody handgina you are going for a niche fetish audience waves at agony fans sorry i dont speak los angelese crouching negates hitscanners basically fun fact if you are crouched you cant get hit by flying enemies also as far as the drivers out here in la go the only place i know where people drive worse is tijuanaohwait waaaaait i swear i remember the cultists yelling curtains for you before the whipped out their tompsons did they change this in transfusion throwing terrorists out of burger king as old as this game is its more fun than most modern games ive been going in circles playing the same bunch of games and this is the most fun ive had since doom 2016 i knew because i had been playing it for hours when i died and realized this is one of those games you have to save every couple steps and that i hadnt had a smoke since i started playing trying to beat it right now on extra crispy and i feel like im a couple deaths away from a rage induced stroke 520 oh come on yahtz full 3d wasnt blood 2s main problem it was the randomized damage that meant no weapon was reliably effective i like the on fire dude sprite too small things count man hitscan this reminds me of how brutal doom improved upon doom classic not because of the gore but because all ballistic weapons are hitscan no more aw blood i remember this game was pretty fun back in the day yahtz hitscan was a thing up to at least hlflife 2 it is not as outdated of a concept as you might think 023 i live in socal so yes had empathy until u mentioned la like a guy complaing that he lost a toe to a guy with one foot whom doesnt bring it up because he lives near the people with one leg make more letsdrowndout you lime fuck at this point i feel like not even death can stop yahtzee from keeping up his monolithic frightening recordbreaking unwavering upload schedule i wish blood fresh would get a physical copy release for modern consoles like duke nukem 3d 20th anniversary world tour 017 that probably surprised him more than anything else lol 044 transfusion was already taken by a mod team who tried to recreate blood in the quake 1 engine specifically the dark places version of the quake engine the mods still incomplete but i still associate the title transfusion with that mod that subtitling the blood remaster transfusion wouldnt feel right fresh supply works just fine as a subtitle review my friend pedro plz yahtzee should try out darkwood hed love it dark atmosphere similar to silent hill2 and pretty gritty story to boot your description of la is amazingly accurate but can i suck gravel out of the asshole of an owl and get the same effect as if it had been a bat asking for well me cos my little english muffins need icing blood 2 the chosen was a focking classic the only reason why nobody knows about it is half life came out at the same time feels like youre trying too hard to comment on it your voice is too annoying for that yahtzee thinks he works for a living you should do outer wilds oh hey ending quip is back nice blood 2 was actually released in beta the devs got royally fucked over by the publisher i suggest people go watch civvie 11s videos on blood 2 blood 2 wasnt bad because of early 3d it was bad because of almost any other reason you can think of i love old games only old games can do angers himself to life a thing never owned blood though but i remember playing the shareware and fav was putting everything and everyone on fire they should revive blood like they did doom i guess they might mess it up though the great city of los angeliz i loved the blood games and caleb was just an amazing joy to play as sure theres not a whole lot of depth but its just damn good fun and calebs entertaining even the blurbs written between levels on the loading screen on blood ii can be pretty damn awesome the only bad thing that can reasonably be said about blood is that the sequel sucked anything else is heresy of the highest order i would love him to go back and look at dusk again he covered the early access but its really become one of the best modern retro style shooters blood 2 did have horrible looking characters but man was it cool to set people on fire with a 6shot revolving flare gun just wait till doom eternal now he forgot the dry heeve between blood and fresh supplies is this favoritism too many try hard jokes makes this video unwatchable i miss the early 90s difficulty settings consoles cant handle the numbers its so forgoten its still full of cultists civvie11 hated they had you at e3 hope you at least got pampered on your off time so the blood cultist have the same issue as those guys in that mandalores review on another ones of monoliths game which i cant recall right now yahtzee is without a doubt in my mind one of the most sustainably highquality and reliable content creators theres ever been zero punctuation is kind of incredible when i think about how many episodes yahtzee has made since the shows beginning and now despite yahtzee also making games documenting the process thereof covering e3 in person and probably doing regular irl stuff too he still released zero punctuation on time and the episode is great yahtzees work ethic is something i can scarcely comprehend side note yahtzees novels are pretty darn good in particular i recommend will save the galaxy for food and even more in particular i recommend the official audiobook which is read by yahtzee himself hes a true performer on top of reliably making tons of great content all the time wait the last card during the credits was that an mcr reference was that a my chemical romance reference youre such a charmer loved blood back in the day remember being in like grade 1 and my friends dad showing it to us on his computer one of if not the first mrated game i ever played nice to see it get some attention 418 whoa whoa doom had bullet velocity you can even see the bullets travel on the mini map 3d sprite shooters are hella better than most 3d shooters since the late 90s as most 3d sprite shooters are unique and fun and most 3d shooters are bland and cut and paste with worse level layouts i miss samey labyrinth level design pretty corridors are much more boring i loved it and got scared at first when he said strangers in the nightexchanging lanterns excellent backhand to alternative medicine aka not medicine i played blood when i got home from the movie volcanoewich had a teaser trailer for jurassic park 2 and i was reely looking forward to that film so i saw volcanoe twice just to see that trailer lmao he is so salty about the fact that he fucking sucks at blood thumbed up for the reboot reference sorry i am a day late with this i was in the colorado rockies play warframe accurate description of la of course we know how much commiefornia sucks why do you think we all talk shit about them playing this on multiplayer was a right laugh haxen mixed with duke 3d and the ability to use youre enemies head as a football perfect 90s fun coughkryozcoughcopycatcough to say blood 2 is not very good is quite the understatement its the skeleton of an indevelopment project being pushed out the door by the publisher against the will of the devs its a w f u l you have spent all this time talking about the original blood instead of the remaster perfect place to make some advertising to blood god civvie 11 more victims for the ever growing army of the undead as someone who lives in la i can confirm yahtzees description is 100 accurate i am unsubscribed from the escapist but still get to see yahtzees stuff like clockwork for once the youtube recommends actually does something right ooh do hexen do hexen on next video what a man can dream hi have you played minecraft had new updates i remember when these were mildly relevant but yatzhee insists on beeing an asshole that think himselkf as very smart well thank you for your brave and perplexing sacrifice mr yahtzee lets all laugh at an industry that never learns from its mistakes tee hee hee speaking of build did you ever play ion maiden that ones been winking temptingly at me for the past year the flare gun in blood was both shit and hilarious it was an absolute pain to hit something with the damn single shot thing but having that flare embed itself into an enemy and after a short period explode was brilliant i cant believe they went with fresh supply and not blood crudux cruo i play skyrim on my bathroom scales i remember playing blood when i was a kid im really glad i did but i never knew thats why those cultists were so hard having a supermodel gf is alot like watching a sausy puppet show your really just the audience and there is alot of using your own hands after only difference is you can offer constructive criticism to the sausy puppet show without it taking half your shit and demanding monthly payments what should we name our game bloody ell i dunno thats it well name it blood you what yahtzee a guy who has 25 hours in a day all used up my favorite characters are the ones who angry themselves back to life blood has the best burning enemies sprite have you never played metal slug best thrashing about on fire sprite why did this kill me fire animation finalist a 711 with dodgy airconditioning is the best description of the cityfeel of la ive ever heard holy shit im sorry you had to go to e3 yahtzee c but im glad youre back and were able to do a game review that wasnt plastered with modern hype thanks for doing all you do hang in there 510 you son of a bitch c if only the game would start for me oh shit youre monitized when are you going to review terraria its pink on the inside before but its been patched now so hurray i admit the first thing i remember about blood was the burning cultist sprite when you shot them with a flare gun the first thing i remember about blood ii was that if you uninstalled the game before patching the 10 version it tried to delete your entire hard drive okay well i never knew i wanted to hear about a baby giraffes knees snapping backwards and hitting a lighting gantry yet here we are step into their line of sight and your vital parts will acquire holes faster than escapists content without yahtzee does he know blood transfusion already exists your supposed to use crouch they become much less accurate when you are crouching come back after years and this guy still isnt funny glad the almighty jim sterling went on his own bruh idk who you are or how i never found this channel but i am in love your voice is well fuck its just awesome and such a speedy and concise review 336 i tried it at home you lot made me go to e3 yahtzees excuses to hate his life actually blood was originally being made by 3d realms but they gave it to monolith so that they could finish shadow warrior which is why blood has an easter egg showing dukes hanging dismembered corpse hidden in the carnival level also the real reason mr big has caleb and his friends executed is because he knew caleb would come back even more powerful making him an even better servant but caleb decides fuck that noise and kills him hitscan is the reason why veterans consider the chain gunner is the hardest monster in doom 2 still my 1 favorite game of all time this is what you play for fun man you are doing too much you need to rest the random rants are always the best ones i miss heretic we do not speak of blood 2there be madness transfusion is the name of another fan made blood based project naming it this would have caught the studio a lot of flak for trying to confuse the two i swear the scripts of these videos are poetry blood was cool i loved the supermarket level you came in from outside broke in through a window as i recall loads of fun blood was to duke what horror was to porn or something like that dude you should review bloodstained best castlevania game in 20 years though it really isnt one the question isnt whether its the second best castlevania game of all clearly it is the question is whether it dethrones symphony of the night thats tougher every sentence is gold this one is really making me chuckle i like that classic bloody shooters are still a lot of fun because they get to the point and make you feel like a malevolent god of death and rage one of these days i wanna sit down with yahtzee and talk about super soldiers de va no smodar moda yes its more than 20 years later and i remember lines the enemies yelled at you from this game its a goddamned masterpiece then again i did it my way were all fresh victims for the evergrowing armies of the undead i hope civvie sees this nope cant watch this video or play the game main character has the same name as me its too weird blood 2 was awesome though the outros are back familiar aka boring samey grey concrete crorridors dn3d is what killed fps as a genre after it quake 2 was too boring concrete corridors the king of blood the cover for blood resembles system of a down i loved this game viva monolith the atmosphere was nice and creepy but the dynamite is what sold me remember build a man a fire and hell be warm for a night set a man on fire and hell be warm for the rest of his life blood just proves the superiority of weapons technology to the supernatural a gargoyle cant do shit compared to a nice 44 magnum oldschool 90s shooters thats what i like about you can try bloodgdx its free and its awesome sucking gravel out of the assholes of bats hes been doing this for over ten years how does he still come up with new shit like this it also had a head of cheats and secrets my favourite was putting on god mod and no clip and jumping down a giant hole in one of the levels to find the this is a totally deep hole message written at the bottom they did not need to make the pit that deep oi yahtzee ive been playing blood recently but noticed that you do get a halfsecond if you just hit the crouch button at those hitscanning shits just letting ya know yes there is a damn crouch button wish i knew that back twenty years ago if you crouch cultists have a bit of trouble shooting you and forces them to crouch to hit you 019 yahtzee thinks all his viewers are fat i mean i am but that cant be true of us all right right if hes still on steam he should go and play west of loathing its pretty funny for an rpg thumbs up for the chauvet par can image at the end if hell review blood then maybe back to saturn x as its own game could be possible a vanilla compatible wad that is just fuck man if that wouldve been what doom was in 1993 i dunno what the clones wouldve taken from it as lessons yahtzee used game play loop for the first time two weeks ago and now its in every video i saw that my chemical romance reference you cant get that past the internet haha you can tell how tired he is there is less velocity to this video protip crouching lowers cultists accuracy have fun cant wait to see your coverage of e3 2020 take note escapist think tank we all love watching yahtzee at e3suffering can you put him in a dodgy motel next year and film it as a reality tv show d fallout 2 had a similar flame death animation loved all the death animations in that game calebs very unbland and very uncomplicated he just wants everyone to die while he screams laughter at their fluttering remains and you lot made me go to e3 so whore you to judge ha i saw that mcr reference dont think you got away with it caleb makes the game twice as good sure hes basically just a less crude demonic duke nukem but his voice actor stephen weyte really nails everything perfectly feels strange to see a blood video uploaded by someone who isnt civvie11 chernobog huh im no expert on this sort of thing but could blood be connected to fantasia in some way edit never mind its apparently some 10th century slavic deity shit i was hoping for an excuse to connect disney to an undead devilworshipping cult to be fair the higher difficulties were designed for coop mode spot on review though ive played through all 6 episodes of blood fresh supply shortly after release cryptic passage was far my favorite and i would definitely agree the cultists were the biggest pita especially in post mortem which had more cultist variants i had to use the thirdperson camera a few times to predict where they were the stone gargoyles at least after the first one just crouch down whip out a voodoo doll and circle strafe them to death otherwise i loved playing that game especially when i heard the sound of those cultists dying there was no dry heave where is yahtzee and what have you done with him menstruation the game climbs out of the grave with a raging morning wood now everytime i wake up with morning wood ill say i live again i remember the burger king doesnt disney own churnabog ive had to look up his origins and nothing came up otherwise oh here we go ben under contract to do what escapist tell him croshaw blaming us im so old i rented this game and no cd patched it so i could keep playing it after my rental was over ugh blood was the final reason i needed for fps games there was a million of them and ruined intelligent gaming for ages i dont go to la for that very reason i named my son caleb after this caleb still appreciating that you finally added the credits to the youtube vids escapist most hilarious game reviewer ever a yatzhee quote that was funny and clever give me likes now i earned it i typed out someone elses quote i wonder if they demonetized this because it has the word blood in the title yahtz i would like to personally apologize for los angeles were sorry for sucking you might hope it got fixed by the sequel but nope they didnt monolith never got to fix that issue until fear hell to get through shogo you had to cheese the ai because they also had the same hitscan issue almost yahtzee you picked the wrong retro style game with blood in the title that takes itself way too seriously bloodstained as a midwestern boy i agree with yahtzees description of la i visited about year ago and nobody knows how to drive out there maranax infirbox or something to that effect blood its in you so we can extract it and give it to vampires living among you which is a real thing try not to worry because it ruins the flavour canadian blood services blood was such a good game it was my least favorite of the three major build games back then but now it may be my most 022 so its basically scp 3008 hey yahtz is something up with your mic bloods overall difficulty drops like your moms knickers in the bathroom of a soup kitchen savage cant wait for yahtzee to go to e3 again next year he seems to have loved it gotta agree on that personthrashingaboutonfire sprite though that in fallout 1 2 comes pretty damn close calebs laugh when you kill a bunch of enemies is satisfying you can modify the reaction time mandid you even play the game yahtzee dropped a reboot reference that got a loud laugh out of me i played it good stuff more for nostalgia than actual gameplay but its one of the very few things that provides me with nostalgia this video is better that coolaid personally i prefer civvie 11 reviewpro series blood is cool but definitely niche i loved doom quake duke 3d and shadow warrior so it made sense that id like blood just as much its the honorable mention of the quintessential first person shooters im gonna be that pedantic fuck who mentions that unlike in most shooters crouching turns out to somewhat help make it harder for hitscanners to accurately hit you with the full force of their shots this has been your weekly dosage of sucking the life out of your day and an otherwise good review 3 hard to breath in an atmosphere thats 40 lead xd i guarantee that as soon as the devs saw this they said dammit blood transfusion thats so good why didnt we think of that blood is still my number 1 favorite game just pip to the post over doom duke and quake yahtzee you forgot to say a single word about the remake itself you only covered the original game we did make him go to e3 so this is a small price to pay to watch him stand within 5 feet of jon romero can we please lose the 10second intro la is a state of mind on all the drugs in all the colors of the rainbow my uber driver gave me 15 xanax 2 weed cookie and a beer and shot tequila o i love how sprites from blood to include the burning enemy one found their way into the doom modding community more proof as to why nyc is better than la 547 i gave them blood blood bloooooooood he has a voice like clint eastwood if he made a living sucking gravel out of bats ass holes thats just the funniest shit iv heard all day my favorite review man playing my favorite game same dudes but twice as many of the motherfuckers is still better than same dudes but twice as many hitpoints on the motherfuckers god i fucking love that game i just realized yahtzee did a review of a game called blood and made no menstruation jokes a doom duke nukem before forever and blood are some of the few games that proves you dont need some twat with emotional depth games are sometimes better as bang bang boom boom look at them milk jugs affairs with fuck ugly graphics im honestly shocked that the quality of these videos keeps going up blood from ragnarox and now yahtzee how if youre doing random reviews id love one on simcopter i remember yahtz actually played this game on twitch recently i was wondering if he was gonna review it well this review was my answer and i do remember those hitscan cultist giving him a hell of a nasty time honestly my tactics for dealing with the cultists involves moving like a crackhead who drank too much redbull and got bitten by a rabid dog im just glad you got out of la alive welcome back mate be sure to get your vaccines thank you thank you so much for bringing the end credits text back best zero punctuation this year it wasnt monolith but 3d realms that mad blood monolith bought the rights when it was mostly done its not often i find a character with my first name but why they always weird ones man i saw the thumbnail and i thought he was gonna review the original doom how is a strip club sexist i heard this game was a buggy glitchy crash your computery mess since yahtz didnt mention any of this did they fix these issues or something i fcking miss those ending title animation lol i swear to god every wednesday i watch the new review after work then end up binging like 30 more videos liked for the trashing of alternative medicine if they only fresh supplied blood 2 the chosen now that would be running down good old memory lane this was one of my alltime favorite games from the 90s the blood shower effects were epic and i enjoyed that the manual had translations for all the crazy stuff the enemies shout at you im mainly here because internet is shite atm i loved the amputated hands that would bounce off the floor and choke you while somehow yelling just what are you doing theres new blood doom we have monstrous demons from hell blood we have henry kissinger doom ok monolith you win when are you going to do more judging by the cover if you liked blood you may also enjoy ion maiden dusk amid evil wrath aeon of ruin and im 100 forgetting at least 3 others drops faster than your mums knickers at a soup kitchen oh my that is gold can i borrow that please yahtzee i cant wait for yahtzee to review the sinking city its because of the hitscan cultists why you learn to use the dynamite as your primary weapon in most situations easier to just chuck those from a corner halflife 2 painkiller and dewm so far the only very good full 3d traditional fps games in existence did i miss any yay the return of credits d i never found sooty that erotic i can confirm nobody knows how to drive here the my chemical romance reference at the end of the credits made my day xd man that was my favorite game back then is this a reupload how dare you insult la i went back and played some build engine games this year duke blood and doomyou have to jump through hoops to get them to run but they are good fun they really dont make levels like that anymore to me they did hold up but i would check a guide when i got stuck to avoid frustration blood 2 was incredibly bad it made gameruinning mistakes that ive never seen any game make like they were trying to be terrible in innovative new ways well try and get some rest yahtzee heaven knows the rest of the world needs a good liedown after dealing with los angeles for any length of time never thought id see yahtzee talk about blood its like i fell into a weird alternate dimension where things are just unexpectedly better blood was such a fun game at the time caleb specifically it was refreshing how much of an attitude and personality he had compared to a silent protagonist like doom guy your vital parts will acquire holes like an argument for alternative medicine under any amount of scientific scrutiny with punctuation was yatzees super model exgirlfriend an antivaxer perchance little known fact doom actually did try to make their levels look like real life locations but you could be forgiven for never knowing this in fact most people dont even realize that one act in doom took place entirely on earth and his act isnt act 1 the hitscan bullshit makes this game unbearable to play compared to duke nukem i came for blood i left satisfied with a british mans review of the shithole that is la its been interesting to see how your other game dev project has changed the language and style slightly of your game reviews in a good way even extra crispy has been admitted to being a co op mode only by many i hope it gets ported to ps4 at some point this was smart writing i didnt know yawntzee had it in him whinging about playing video games and being paid to attend e3 poor you i spent 50hrs digging holes this week and cant afford to run my car 457 i felt this on a spiritual level unexpected that with dusk amid evil ion maiden and hedon released on steam he chooses to play blood i mean not a bad game great game actually but it just doesnt feel like time to revisit oldies wouldnt it be awesome if these were entirely unrehearsed stresms of consciousness was introduced to this game by civvie11 thanks civvie this is basically a review of a game from 1997 he actually did it an absolute mad lad if you like fps genre for shooting mechanics its gonna be your new corner stone caleb basically angrys himself back to life over here civvie this video but he didnt review the remake he just rambled on about the original ahhhh blood pretty sure this was the game who made me fail the school that year played it like 12 hours a day incredible violent and fun for the time this is the best plot synopsis ive ever heard thanks goodness something intresting blood is the only build engine game ive played and enjoyed throught its entirety thanks to its wonderful carnage and sound design for the indignant cultists end screen jokes are back 430 here is the thing with the hit scan enemies they always miss if you crouch giving you more then enough time to blast them into giblets xerox shits crows dude just crouch when you face hitscanners it plays a huge role in the algoritm that says if they hit you keep whining about it and well send you to the 2020 e3 too civvies rolling in his grave over this review if he was dead hit scan enemies mmmmmm descent has it worse with a particular enemy appearing at a particular point of hte game where enemies started feeling less generous on health pick ups easily the best shooter of the 90s if you ask me and fresh supply just makes it more accessible and polished angries himself back to life that is the best way ive ever heard a protagonist randomly come back to life be described la must be hell on earth or at least like that duke episode one struggles to breath in an atmosphere of almost 40 lead datz lotta dakka boiz it was a retrospective device you fuck god bless you yahtzee one tip for dealing with hitscanners crouch its way harder for them to hit you their accuracy goes down the gutter was this tip helpful you can thank civvie 11 its rare that i manage to catch a zp video an hour after it comes out this was great as always not to say that the mp in fresh supply is still half broken one of my favorites ah yes los angeles one of the shittiest places i have ever had the misfortune to have to run my semi through fuck that state and its retarded as fuck driving laws that only apply to bloody semi drivers blood and shadow warrior were my favorite 90s shooter and blood 2 was my guilty pleasure i played that game way too much and i played all of them when i was way too young good times what was that about clint eastwood sucking gravel out of a bats asshole pro blood when civvie will acquire holes faster than a argument for holistic medicine under any amount of scrutiny genius yahtzee somehow managed to completely gloss over how cultists throw first sticks then bundles of dynamite on higher difficulties so there wouldnt be too terribly much change in slowing them down since youd be trying to dodge that shit while they hitscan you between throws im going to show civvie this blood is this a civvie video true about the shareware games the first episode was always the best the rest of the levels in the full game were meh funnily enough this applies to dusk the first episode is the best and its downhill form there 110 err its called burger town you uneducated rascal does here anyone know this game it is isometric starts off with your horse being dead and then the game tells you to shoot off bottles to let you know the game controls and it was wild west themed id honestly be quite interested in some high quality erotic puppet shows i still remember the chocking hands to get them off of me id throw a molotov at my feet in hopes that my flame engulfed body would burn the little bastards off and with luck the fire would leave me with some health left didnt know you could hit the e key to remove them till gog released it a few years back erotic puppet shows you say perfection another zero punctuation video is exactly what i needed this day suck gravel through a bats asshole modern arts and fear books c youre the kinda human wreckage that we love has anyone noticed how ever since started developing games for the escapist series yahtzee wont shut up about primary gameplay loops lol ok but why is your porridge dribbling into your hair dryer yahtzee youre either eating porridge in the bathroom or blowdrying your hair in the kitchendining room and i need to know which it is when i was in high school i actually went on a tour of monolith while they were developing this game ive never been into fps but i remember seeing that one of the weapons was a voodoo doll that you would stab to attack distant enemies and ive always thought that was clever and awesome caramacs and fearbooks please review frostpunk yahtzee and his mcr references seeing people complain about blood difficulty is always adorable where those post credit sequences always there or dod yahtzee bring em back i just want to state for the recordi never wanted you to go to e3 i would never want to subjugate you to the public i care for you to much actually yahtz its called anime not puppet shows and naruto is my hero duke nukem 3d came out before quake you plonker can you review warframe to this day the game with the most incredible atmosphere for me was max payne 1 the whole feel of it was amazing played it recently on my phone and then steam good review but small critique many games like duke nukem never needed chrowing they mostly used it for secrets while blood used it for combat because the hit scanning cultist would loose accuracy if you were crouching and moving the foes i hate are the spiders you cant hit them because theyre too little so you need a dedicated button to look downwards cant do it with the mouse and they poison you i loathe the little vermin do the crips get their own fps next hold on this is new the moment i saw the title i just knew he was gonna like the game anyone else damn yahtzee is in top form here i havent had to skip backwards to catch stuff i missed on a zp video quite so often in a while im the kinda human wreckage thatcha love tbf id rather see yahtzee go have fun at game developers conference than torture himself by going to the electronic entertainment expo perfect timing pro blood when civv whoops wrong channel 227 thats the eddison mansion from maniac mansion neat i never learned to reeaaaddd i miss this kinda game i surprisingly character driven story thats not fully upfront a main character with some life and personality and a real lack of good or evil name 1 game nowadays that even comes near blood in those regards dont think i dont see you playing bloodstained there yahtzee as someone who lives near the los angeles area i can say that is a very accurate description 034 why is bloodstained ritual of the night scribbled over its a good game from what ive heard i had never heard of this game before so when i saw the thumbnail i assumed it was some modern indie game that was trying evoke the original doom or something only four dislikes finally a notification from escapist that i actually want to look at getting tired of this movie stuff if only there was a way to subscribe to a single part of a channel i live near la and i always hate going to it i dont go there unless it absolutely necessary or there something that i really want to do man i was fascinated as a kid by the atmosphere and desolated ruins of blood i wasnt even sure it was supposed to be set on earth i find it somewhat bizarre unlike most all other channels escapist puts up their new zp videos like a week sooner on facebook than they do on youtube and by the time it comes out on youtube i have forgotten ive already seen it but hey that just means new zp on fb soon that title doe how original deja vu yahtzee well done reusing old review interspeed with new lines to review remake of old games if angrying yourself back to life was a thing yahtzee would be an immortal god no i havent been to la i live in europe and i am as poor as a church rat only barely affording my internet connection i get the feeling hes a tad upset about his e3 escapades i would like it to be noted that we did not force you to visit e3 we did however greatly enjoyed your video coverage of it and we would like to demand of the escapist to send you again in 2020 for we enjoy watching your pain and suffering like our favorite video game antagonist okay yahtzee ill just ignore that bloodstained steam list ah shit i watched this on the website by accident first blood is a symptom of its period i dont ever think ive heard yahtz exclaim with so much exasperation as he expressed at the huge numbers of hitscan cultists in this game i was really hoping you rest god bless you poor darling blood blood gallons of the stuff give them all that they can drink and it will never be enough so give them blood blood blood grab a glass because theres going to be a flood mw2 reference the next video will probably be on bloodstained ritual of the night but yathz those knees are clearly bending the way they should paradoxically the fact that the cultists in blood make the game so difficult kind of dovetails nicely though inadvertently with the horror atmosphere the game was going with it gives you that system shock 2 vibe of being a few inches from death and perpetually terrified of the sound of an enemy in the distance or around a corner because you know how vulnerable you are oh and there is a way to counteract the insane accuracy and deadliness of the cultists the made to order difficulty added by nightdive allows you to change how accurate enemies are by enemy type so you can turn down the accuracy rating of the cultists to give you a fair fighting chance did he just mention the old 3d cartoon reboot thats california for ya drops like your moms knickers in a soup kitchen bathroom is gonna be my new catchphrase 055 i love how yahtzee hated that imp to death the mcr ref at the end was very much appreciated man yahtzee had a busy month with e3 his zp reviews and that game he was working on i wonder how yahtzee will feel about the symphony of the night spiritual successor he is very morally unbland he just wants everyone to die and you lot made me go to e3 so who are you to judge one of the best videos in a while nice one fact blood is older that most of yahtzee viewers ironically the games with the cardboard cutouts for enemies and like 5 bit for the sound had better emotions for their enemies than any dayvid cayge had for their protagonists i mean i know yatzhee has had a longlong week but i still dont even know what blood fresh supply is is it a remake reboot sequal i dunno too bad the fresh supply port itself is undercooked and while it uses reverseengineered source as reference it is on its own is a reimplementation on a different engine with a bit different physics and behaviours doom 2 on steam yahtzee dont you know of source ports whenever you have the time can you do oxenfree yahtzee its a game where you play as stealing a bit from my review of the game where you play as alex a blue haired young adult who is going on a private island get away with her friends that quickly turns into a night of ominous intrigue when you and your stepbrother accidentally awaken a temporal phenomenon unleashing ghosts upon the land just thought youd be interested just play on still pink on the inside and duck everytime you see a cultist and the game is playable for someone who doesnt know everything about the game bloodgdx ftw new yahtsssss yeah good day my favorite line from the game is the first i live again i feel like yahtzees life has become a lot more difficult after this escapist shake up hes just been drifting gently doing zp but now hes forced to make other content sounds fun i always enjoy forgetting these drop on wednesday and go on youtube for a podcast and see this 022 buddy i was born there i love this game so much one of my favourite 90s shooters it introduced me to type o negative and that alone is enough for me to thank it for its existence cant wait for your next trip to e3 that will definitely happen the day yahtzee reviews roller coaster tycoon marks the day i sold my soul for a cupcake love these videos i think yahtzee would do awesome movie reviews as well they missed out when they didnt collett flesh supply dont mind me im just waiting for a review of the sinking city and everyone drives like they learned on a pair of roller skates maaaan thats incredibly accurate i dont know how yahtzee does it more like blood no supply the electric army get your blood while its fresh thanks yahtzee first lol first bros did u know that theres an update in clone drone its a bloody mess caleb zambros dont need water let them motherfuckers burn ahahahahahahahah btw i say giefy cat its admirable that you obviously know this game very thoroughly to be able to pick up all those details they do matter and they wont be much of a problem for new players but for people who have played this game for many many hours those little details really do matter and are very distacting as a first time player i dont regret buying this at all so tell me gdx or this download link thanks for doing these videos im not the most experienced with blood watched plenty of youtube content on the game and played through the very beginning in bloodgdx but watching these videos is interesting for learning about the new remaster which i was kind of excited for i might still end up buying it soon to both do coop with a friend and support the developers but only if they announce theyll be doing something to patch the game i think nightdive has a pretty good track record thinkthey seem like good devs but what do i know their go at turok 2 was pretty good imo with their remasters and im sure they want to do blood justice considering its legacy definitely disappointing to see the game launch like this even though most things are at least functional i deem it as unplayable until they solve the deatwish problem i demonstrated if it cant play all addonsmaps and you can get stuck its gamebreaking especially when you cant play the most popular addon which they should have tested it with before release sorry to see that you arent enjoying it very much but thanks for the gameplay hopefully nd can provide some clarity on its issues or release a few patches in the future so you will only provide the first episode eh this is so hard to watch haha ok couple tips 1 watching you waste ammo on the flare gun o you only have to hit the enemy once they will burst into flames in a few moments 2 the zombies scream differently when they die for good 3 the rats are much easier to hit with the pitchfork if you duck 4 the life essence is just a health pickup your health goes up when you get it medkit is a different item which lets you keep extra health to use when you like i enjoy watching you play if you learn these things you can go much farther you dont know how happy i am to see a bonafide classic like blood finally getting a remaster some tips for you to help later on 1 crouching helps to make you harder to hit 2 zombies scream ow when they are dead and just grunt when they arnt treat with shotgun 3 you can throw tnt further by holding it dont hold forever though 4 gargoyles have a weakness to fire 5 fuck the water powerups beast vision just night vision reflective shots makes all damage go back to your attacker even rats jump boots makes you jump higher also negative fall damage diving suit breath da water armor blue is physical green is spirt red is fire fun fact caleb wasnt a cult leader he was one of the chosen the inner circle of the cabal prior to tchernobog the dark god and leader of the cabal killing them all that is on an unrelated note i feel like caleb might be just crazy enough to attempt to fuck a train because yknow hes a fucking lunatic xp btw zombies have distinct sounds if theyre either dead or not if they make a loud screaming sound theyre pretty much dead more heretic videos when guys please please do the entire game with your commentary can you anduko play resident evil 6 beast vision means you see the world as corwin does i couldnt wait to see the look on corwins face when he came across that akimbo upgrade really wish you guys had kept it up with the face cams regardless im so glad you guys decided to continue with this series this is a much better train level than the one you replay over and over in blood 2 its fucking raw edit tchernobog is the leader of the cult but he killed caleb and his friends along with his love ophelia however caleb cheated his death which is why he comes from the grave in the first level hes not a vampire hes a gunslinger edit 2 you have 3 types of armor basic blue fire red and spirit green theres super armor that gives you all three men like sabin surplex demonic trains real beast chamion warriors stop demonic trains by bashing their cocks into their motherfucking boilers first this game is goddamn beautiful been watching you guys for years i know i commented on the last video but based on another video i saw i feel like you 2 should know this there are 2 new secret units in tabs the 1st one is located in a dynasty map in between the grooves on one of the roofs the second one is in the reinassance map up in the sky he shouldnt be too hard to findyouve also seen this guy in battle not rushing you to play it but just letting you know love your content btw the only spider momma i recognize is mamma baker called it the boss was a bigger spider i guess ion maiden takes priority once it comes out on thursday huh i never noticed that sound effect when the phantasm shoots out a skull it sounds like cheoghs breathing sound not the screaming of the skull but just as he is firing one out its baffling proper modding tools werent included with fs brilliant thank you so much for creating a version for fresh supply remember guns gore and cannoli vinnie did say something about an exwife so maybe the 3rd one is about his kid or something and i see this going in 2 directions either vietnam in the 60s70s or the cold war in the 80s90s what do you guys think bloods my favorite game your vids rule you should definitely check out painkiller once you finish blood imagine if call of duty had head physics like this game could you play people playground youre nearing the end guys and its been a blast that flesh stage is gross and creepy corwin this makes me wonder what roasted gargoyle tastes like first like then watch so how are you hopping outside the train to take no damage there must me some timing im missing just to make sure are there any movementincreasing technics in blood like strafe running or jumping or is there a console command to show current movement speed thanks in advance zombie scream in 227 is only when they die burned idem grargoyle scream in 252 and you dont die when you get out of the train brown culstists have the same voice of the black cultiststhey should correct that the game is in an entirely different engine remade can you truly still qualify for a speed run or wr with its heavy flaws shameless plug for my blood extra crispy mod for bfs httpswwwmoddbcommodsbloodextracrispy played blood back in the day ans it is still an amazing game it and duke 3d are the best build games also yes go play chasm its pretty darn good you might also like realms of the haunting andor clive barkers undying hope this comes to consoles soon like the n64 turok remasters this was my favorite game as a teen early 20s i want jo jo i want jo jo jo jo jo jooooo we used to make up things to head canon what those cultist guys say none of us parties this should be cool hey mom its almost time for scooby doo matt needs to play alien trilogy some of the baddies inthis game sound like willow aka smackbag jeff hardy obscure fpses from ye olde dayshmmmhmmmmm witchaven 1 2 codename tenka or lifeforce tenka in some regions shadowcaster cybermage corridor 7 tekwar outlaws forsaken operation bodycount those are what immediately come to mind but there might be a couple more of course im not claiming theyre all quality titles a couple of them are pretty awful actually fun fps games from way back rise of the triad use to laugh my ass off playing that one i remember really liking sin also at one point i had 3do and really liked killing time recently tried out the 3do emulator so i could play killing time again cant say that one aged well blood on the other hand is always a blast i miss the old monolith they made awesome stuff blood 2 however was a pile of ass this remaster of blood has mostly good controller support sadly you cant easily save your game with a gamepad unless you map the quick load and quick save actions to the controlleralso i would kill to get a remaster of blood 2 or shogo i love how they referenced civvie in the remake i havent played the original version but im sold on this now just love how the main character starts laughing maniacally while throwing dynamite everywhere oooooh one of the best pc games ever made remade giiiive it to meeee look at this httpswwwmoddbcommodsbloodthecursehunter oh man you played blake stone i gotta look that up on this channel you oddly nostalgia bombed me and reminded me about bio menace which was a rad side scroller shooter man apogee really got me into biotechbiological horror style stuff lands of lore guardians of destiny shadowcaster ultima underworld games cybermage darklight awakening thief and of course system shock solid fps titles with their own twists mostly heavy rpg leans where did the love for supernatural settings go everything nowadays is war and scifi or both this would be an awesome series to bring back cuz im a husky boy and i needed it basically me on a bulk you managed to beat civvie by almost 20 hours over the lips through the gums look out tummy here i come thumbs up for mentioning civvie street creds and all that d play with civvie 11 as soon as they patch the issues people have made videos of im buying love blood bought 1 whole unit years ago and went through the pain of configuring it thank you so much for making a vid on this i had no idea there was a remaster oh boi i remember this game from a shittstorm v a few years ago one thing people should know is that you can enable cd audio in settings to get different higher quality music instead of midi one and of course they did it properly so you dont need to mess with disc images or anything its on stream i was trying to get it to run on dosbox 3 years ago only got the freeware first 2 or 3 levels matt and civvie would be an awesome cross over in red faction 2 the grenade launcher is your first weapon for memorable protagonist alias matt failed to was his hands flophouse cancelled this game is super fuking cool dont worry about the code ill just throw my money at them and get the game myself you should try fear effect 1 and 2 on the ps1 those games are like if ghost in the shell aeon flux had been blended together with resident evil also i remember a bit of this pc game called dark vengeance first time coming across your videos i said i like this guy and clicked the sub and bell button oddworld strangers wrath is a pretty weird fps it came out in mid 2000s and its main gimmick is using live creatures as ammunition have you tried darkwatch if you havent i think youd like it heres a description the game mixes western horror and steampunk genres telling the story of jericho cross an outlaw gunfighter in the late 19thcentury american frontier who has been turned into a vampire and then forcibly recruited by the titular monsterhunting secret organization to fight against supernatural forces the gameplay system of darkwatch is reminiscent of halo combat evolved i didnt expect matt to know gmanlives and civvie those guys to me are pretty niche game youtubers catacomb abyss is a solid recommendation tbf i spent so much time playing that and kens labyrinth as a kid 204 yes please you playing this with civvie everyone msg civvie right now thatld be hilarious and awesome civvie doesnt have time to play with you hes too busy with not doing pro nukem 3d there is a whole reason why he throws caleb in the grave without killing him permanently it ended up being a pretty bad plan someone could remake this in the same way as doom and it would be greatthough i spose these days the movie reference lines might be a problem in terms of the developer getting sued lol cold winter on ps2 and i think xbox is a good one its like a 007 clone but well done or project snowblind is a good one hey matt big fan of your channel please dont be a cheating pedophile i like your channel so dear god dont be a creep thank you i watched thewolfaroth play this game i subbed to him and he plays all sorts of build engine games hes really cool like this game please please please play chasm the riftits my alltime fave weird little fps at the time it came it out it looked great and could play on like any machinetrust meyoull get some enjoyment out of itif anything youll enjoy it for how good it is for what it isya know speaking of good obscure games from the early 2000s timesplitters 2 and 3 are awesome fps games that i dont see getting a lot of love are killing time pc or 3do powerslave pc or psx rise of the triad and witchaven i and ii fps games that arent really talked about that much outlaws project snowblind urban chaos riot response sin kingpin life of crime cold winter maybe even daikatana with the 13 patch but there are still low points including the opening levels one of my first pc games i loved this so much as a kid such memories watching this im pretty sure i still own the discs with the add ons and a shareware copy as well strife was also great underrated here are some fun forgotten fps games turok 3 shadows of oblivion timesplitters 2 and future perfect play them on dolphin or something for that mouse aiming heretichexen sin star wars dark forces unreal gold no one lives forever 1 2 clive barkers undying im surprised but also super happy you know who civvie is he revels in goofy bullshit i watched this straight after civvies latest video id love to see a collaboration between you two god i hope that night dive gets the rights to power slaveexhumed because id love to see them remaster that game im so ecstatic to see this game live again i hope that blood 2 gets a fresh supply remake seeing as that game had some good potential but flopped horribly shogo mad remake when night dive even after 22 years since release i still get blown away by how satisfying blood is to play the level design is hit and miss at times i still get lost sometimes after all these years and the difficulty is absurd until you learn how to game the ai and such at which point it goes down to just really hard but ill never get tired of playing through it and whoever suggested chasm the rift to you i second that its not amazing but its just so fucking bizarre that it has to be seen eradicator is a good shooter from the time its on gog now and was put out by accolade of all companies stephan weyte caleb is one of the voice actors in the miniseries on my channel hes a really nice guy lives right down the street from me you should try out sin its a quake ii based game it has some crazy stuff in it i think youll get a kick out of it i just stopped playing as this video went out damn theres just too much blood for me to handle jokes aside i gotta agree that this is a pretty damn fine update ive been waiting for a good way to play blood on modern hardware and here it is hey civvie please be friends with matt so we can all have a bloody good time nam first person shooter that takes place in the vietnam war seems you arent alone in playing this one the least which is a shame because imho this is the best build engine game i like duke 3d and shadow warrior but blood is the only one i love enough to replay lots im glad the remaster is out so its at least easier for newer gamers to get into it im so happy theres still love for this game i havent been able to game much since around 2001 as life insisted of giving me a steady stream of terrible things i had to deal with but back in the day i played this all the time it was my stress ball you got ahead of civvie he put out pro doom 2 today xd jetstream sam refuses to play this with me whats that smell its blooood blood aka awesome incarnate and you civvie by a mile just a friendly reminder blood 2 sucks dont even think about it even developers completely trashed it in interview after release theres 5th episode you already seen in main menu cryptic passage episode in addons menu and fresh 16 version of fanmade masterpiece death wish campaign which serves as unofficial sequel corwin blood 2 is decent but its not as good as the first one and it kept crashing on me for some reason also its one of the few video game sequels that actually wasnt as violent as the original theres not as much blood in blood 2 as the first game actually cryptic passage is unofficial episode 5 not made by the original devs like post mortem was accessed through usermaps you really should also look into death wish its a much better blood 2 than blood 2 that got released in 19989 waffle bros wish you guys would get back to doing two videos a day again uko is a terrifying god waffle bros i was wondering when you guys would get back to blood i hope you also finish the expansion pack on the channel as well its the final countdown insert epic beats doom was like that too also hope you guys are doing good youre good at this game yo add me on steam and lets play some blood together my steam is karpofsteel i wish my grampa was as cool as you i love your videos man i watch the ads so it makes you money the old school graphics look good william where do you download these games are you an og subscriber to this channel well become an og of mine right now not to be ja but why u got that choker on your nack u look about 64 63 you are a very underrated gamer and being a fps master you are enjoying to watch i remember this game shit awesome game need to see more for me blood is my second favorite fps ever made my top 10 include 10 hexen beyond heretic 9 aliens vs predator 2 8 doom 3 7 doom 4 6 fear 5the ultimate doom 4 quake 3 doom ii hell on earth 2 blood 1 quake ii fun video felt so guilty paying 4 for blood that i bought it on both gog steam to make up the price had the original so discount only tried it briefly but i had some very minor bugs screen went black whenever i changes some display options that im waiting on it to be patched also waiting to see what mods people will recommend the most something to spice it up but not change it too much my limited time with blood it was quite interesting to think that nightdive studios ported it to their own engine the kex engine yet it still feels very buildish in movement fluidity jumping etc keeping an eye on nightdive still need to get turok and forsaken from them that weapon variety in mechanics is insane enemies too seem to grow rather silly as the levels move on love it expansion packs from another creator would be an interesting concept to see revitalised i think overload kind of did that recently by having community made maps packed into a dlc postlaunch with like my review follow me on twitter and facebook for all of my updates support me by buying this game through my humble bundle partner link httpstinyurlcomy4t25cj2 twitter httptinyurlcomy248jn9g always on here facebook httpstinyurlcomyyj4bn6h purely updates still i like more bloodgdx or nblood is a good vid tho d if caleb is having sex with a caribou then that means hes canadian like me yeah i thinkwhats comingis going to be spiderthemed think its time for rereleases of the classics bloody hands raven software reference na tvrce heretic a hexen i kdy fim taky pro ne these are enjoyable to watch and make for surprisingly good background noise while doing other things good job same problem here i was soo happy to play blood and then i see this shitshow and still not patched your game are looking like thishttpprntscrcomnmkdix no problem i found a solution download this program httpwwwmediafire comfile 1vhqoxk68e3arcodxcplexe then add the blood fs exe file located in steamsteamappscommonbloodanuketx64exe in the program mark the option called force warp now just apply and you can play the game just got the game todaygot the same issue i have that problem its a common problem hopefully patched soon awww you missed the secret level its the best in the episode does the remaster have coop 2019 the year of remakes i knew corwin couldnt help but kill those mimes are you guys have true 3d option disabled this is like biggest old build engine issue which has been fixed in this remaster any more manhunt or have you stopped playing that game okay that was pretty cool didnt know that you can finish this map that fast xd no time to waste need to kill tchernobog hei try to use the invisibility for the last point of the level with the flare gun run and fire in two seconds you will kill everything on your way trust me 610 did anybody notice that the explosion blast radius is bigger in fresh supply in the dos gdx and nblood versions the zombie behind the wall is supposed to come out of the ground and attack you but in this version the zombie gets damaged and knocked out by the explosions that unsuspecting kill at 546 lol all secrets you only had 7 out of 8 what a waste of time canadian porn is just like regular porn only the sex performers will constantly apologize for the beds noisy springs about the flags the eagle on the mexican flag is eating the snake while standing on a cactus this game looks sweet they should update the sprites so the big guys bend over and shoot a rat out their butt at you corwin uko anyone out there that would put a living hamster in their neither regions is beyond cruel at least have the decency to kill it first otherwise you really deserve to eaten from the inside by that hamster blood bath time can you play this game at 1440p or 4k i wish i had someone to play this c oh shit this gamea goes straight to my child hoos i was like 11 old when me and cousins played this and with those old modems is there limited lives in a coop i mean like if you die you repeat the missionor just only classic mode where you insta respawn after u die bcs i need a limited lives to enjoy the game no tryhard no fun you know too bad of some bugsglitches otherwise tis a good game yo pagb a blood patch came out today its pretty cool that it can now play coop but this gave me an idea you and lightcrimson ought to do a coop or collaboration sometime in near future any chance of a the carnage continues playthrough i cant find one on youtube at all pagb666 starts recording vid runs into a fanatic puts 3 double barrel shotgun blasts into him and dies me well we are off to a great start dont know why but every game ive tried in this has been so laggy to the point of being unplayable and after finishing a level its like it bugs out and you cant kill anything or be killed or open any doors its like it syncs out hope nightdive is watching i want blood to be the best fps like it deserves soon as cultists spot you they instantly start firing other games theyll play a sight sound first i dont know if it was intended by the devs but makes this fps game more challenging with its hitscanners than most others uko if any company runs with your rat king idea im going to boycott it for the sake of the children that is just wrong corwin outside the universe is incredible this may be off topic but i wish for a mod where caleb fights in medieval times and he has to find the usb stick of randy pitchford this needs rat kings made by geordi la forge from star trek do you know how this game works you only need 1 flare plus a few pitchfork pokes to ignite a zombie but instead you use 3 or 4 on every single one and waste them all you hit yourself with tnt twice once because you misclicked and another when you were trying to blow up a cultist but apparently didnt know that you could hold down the fire button to throw it farther you do not use the altfires for any weapons even when it was obvious the map creators wanted you to use them like individually shooting zombies with the sawedoff and have them come back when you couldve unloaded both barrels and instantly killed them you crouch to fend off a horde of zombies when earlier you neglected to crouch while fighting the rats caleb is not a vampire i gotta hand it to you though you can really imitate the cultist shouts i am so disappointed regarding this remastered i wanted to see modern 3d grafiks not just a high resolution and some tweaks here and there corwins impression of the cultist scream is perfect lol did you just reference electric wizard my dude satanic rites of drugula nice if youre into doom metal wizards great that song just isnt from their heaviest album id look towards dopethrone or come my fanatics yeah theyre not subtle about how they smoke a metric fuckton of weed when your character suddenly looks up when youre moving up ramps and shit thats auto slope you can turn it off in the gameplay settings the room of nothing actually has a doctors bag and basic armor behind the bookshelves if you interact with the cash register lol hey you only need 12 flares for the zombies and cultists also i find its easier to jump from the gravestones onto the fence and thru the window instead of opening the main doors d ambush the fuckers i love how you can take various paths into an area its also on steam you know workshop online coop dm play on steam with pubs and friends is reason alone to get it there you guys should coop this on which difficulty are you guys playing corwin uko hope you do more than one video on this game this time and maybe even finish it i loved blood and i have a feeling that i will love the new remaster even more than the original heard you talking in a retarded voice stopped watching every weapon has two fire modes you can charge the dynamite holding down the fire button this is advertised as having extended modding support does this mean an eduke32 style mod could now be made for this with hires textures lighting effects models etc fuck yeah finally pro tip you need only one flare to set someone on fire use it for hit n runs i also love how you guys cowered in fear of rats modern games need rats its good to see this back the blood splatter is better than ever cough stephan weightcough civvie11cough keep on going with blood to i hope this becomes a series also caleb throws one liners all the time so keep the volume high also good work guys keep the good work up wasnt there a gag in the original train level if you walked too far into the dark tunnel it would give you a warning about turning back also the main character is not a vampire hes an undead cowboy maniac hold fire key on the dynamite to throw it further also show us gameplay please hey you shoot the zombie only once with a pistol and wait for him to catch fire you should coop this in my humble opinion along with the amazing mod death wish its so fucking good hey how come you dont take damage with the e1m3 train trick i can manage to take no damage on dosbox but its impossible on fresh supply do u do anything different i just hold jump and realese it mid air then hold again 055 is that a jojo reference he runs again dermascrolls youmyin here to leave a comment does this version came out with the expansion pack cryptic passage and plasma park this game is nuts if you play this for too many hours youre going to turn into an incoherent lunatic bro wtf how is blood a forgotten game i still play it today dislike plz dont hurt me but i must confess i like blood 2 too two whoa you got nick onboard that is huge found this game at a dollar store about ten years ago love it no one lives forever soulrever020 i remember this on amiga but do you even know what is satanic panic it was social engineered manipulation to ridicule people researching and trying to expose governmind pedophile cultis rings that tortured and consumed human flesh children especially up to 11 years old after blood orgies rapes in glory of you know whofear fills meat and blood and they get high this game isnt forgotten could you do urban chaos the gta 3 before there was gta 3 where you play darci stern i liveagain i didnt forget this game you should eat a rat poison sandwich1111111111 xddddd if this gets 350 quindecillion likes in 314159 miliseconds im going do jack shit because i dont care who else is waiting for a surprise modern version of blood like doom 2016 i wish sony put the game in ps4 store blood 1997 remasterd im kinda new to this channel and im not sure if its been covered but if you want another forgotten gem look no further than the legacy of kain series please ragnarrox cover it if you havent the chibi ragnar was just so adorable its so fucking good and the patreon chamber was hilarious too this was one of the funniest episodes ever i just cant stop laughing and smiling while watching even thou im not a fps type of gal you got good taste in music i still play it and love it too i like old shadow warrior and still play itbut find duke 3d very boring love your videos too tier quality jesus why are you shooting at me that was gosh darn adorable looks cool but sadly windows only what is the name of game at 019 pleaaase make a video about the forbidden siren series its so cool to hear about someone elses gaming nostalgia nblood is a very good port if not the best for purists hit like before i watched this one love this game ps watching this while getting a tattoo shouldnt blood be good as it promotes the murder of cultists as a christian that shouldnt be bad my cousin used to have this on his pc not sure id call blood a forgotten game by any means its always been one of the big three build engine games alongside duke nukem 3d and shadow warrior and always enjoyed cult classic status at the very least id say outlaws and eradicator are better examples of great games no one talks about or get any recognition good choice of bgm at the beginning ghosts iiv is a great thing i dunno if id call it an album officially but thats just semantics bloodrayne is a forgotten gem blood has one of the best suicide death messages i was playing on lan train level many moons ago i decided to jump out the window and has volunteered for population control appeared lool caleb time to donate some blood somebody elses d its nothing but bullshit instant hitscan behind every corner thinking thanks his patreons then proceeds to kill them then requests for you to join his patreon concluding ragnar verifiable serial killer who will kill you if you pay him honestly good video i always look forward to the next i wish that someday blood will be on home consels haha you scored a like with only the intro d cool game in literally what way is one of the build engine 3 a forgotten gem description of the mission for a duke nukem modmap a life of illusion in versailles unknown russian suburbs the city is gray and miserable desperation is the daily bread for those citizens who are struggling to survive but there is something more sinister going on the recruiters men in suit roaming the streets convincing the young people to be part of the circuit of the versailles elite as they call themselves the recruiters are particularly nasty as they charm the youngster alluring to an incredible life the deal is simple 5 years of luxury life inside a fake versailles enjoying life to the extreme pleasures without working plenty of food and drinks living the life of the richest the fake versailles is composed by a few blocks outside gray and decadent buildings inside the elite has recreated the court of versailles at the time of marie antoniette with huge decorated saloons grand palaces luxury gardens and fountans where the remaster that is being worked on lol has issues atm some cool info chernobog literally means black god the words still exist in most modern slavic languages as cherno means black and bog means god chernobog was one of two equal constant deities that appeared to my knowledge no one knowing how and when and why in the slavic mythos at the same time the other being byalobog or sometimes belobog where this time byalobelo means white belo sometimes refers to cocaine but thats offtopic the two gods are sometimes defined as core slavic deities equal to the main god of rod deriving from the coreword meaning a people or a family however how the two came to be is made even more unclear as they are not children or related to rod in any way as most of the slavic pantheon is in some way related to him explaining his names meaning some sources suggest that chernobog and belobog are other common names for rod and veles being the god of the underworld the source i find mos chernobogs name doesnt loosely translate as black god it literally means black god even in modern russian holy shit awesome vid man thank you for bringing one of the creators on board for an interview what a legendary game i would like some coverage of powerslave i just got the chosen in regress achievement so fucking proud of it xd httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwn0ciubx47i wonderful video and it was really cool that you got to interview nick newhard well done man the effort you put into this to get the frickin creator on your show is to be commended mad respect forgotten gems seems civvie 11 is spreading out 1732 bloods humor has a bight that doesnt feel nearly as cringy to me sorry my dude its still prepubescent humor its just the difference between the jock kid and the emo kid its not even a particularly dark game its too busy reveling in its bloody jibs frenetic pace and popculture references to give a second thought to much of anything else i think thats a big part of the reason it still stands up much like duke and shadow warrior 1910 campy is a great description of this game it is really channeling the evil dead 2 and 3 2249 one of the great things about the build engine was how flexible it was even on the old dos versions including the one on gog you can go into the setup program and change the controls to use modern shooter conventions good old wasd and mouse aiming its not hard and the game plays fine with that setup 2540 modern net code is really the reason to get this in my opinion at least for someone whos already got the go maybe i should post a comment everytime theres a game that ive never heard of before like this one could give the title of the show more validation still waiting to hear the long story of gabriella blood was and is a fantastic game ken silverman is god you sir just made me buy it for steam summer sale im gonna enjoy this quite a bit keep up the great content my only forgotten gem is ragnarrox 3 moonbase commander this is the game that got away for me back then i had a choice between jedi knight dark forces 2 or blood i picked the former i cant say that regret it jk2 actually kick started me to play mp games i love that you open the video with the misfortune in morocco level from no one lives forever i love me some blood so so much but nolf remains my favorite monolith game zombies ate my neighbors fits the forgotten gem genere 3 one of my favorite games but omg no attetion to make a remake yet jesus christ whats you next forgotten gem doom theme hospitalwaitdo theme hospital feels good being one of the top players from the golden era of blood on mplayer and kali why would people dislike this video theres something special about this channel i forgot about blood and all i do is actively look up pretty old games with hopes of learning new optimization techniques ive made multiple notes on many computers about blood and i forgot about blood a t e liercrisiscom is a year in juicy prerendered horror stuff thank you 33 his videos are always so great the effort that he puts in is always incredible no ducking to avoid hitscaners i see youre pink on the inside blood is the best build game ever btw they could bring the mapeditor back too lets make bloods modding community great again i love this game to death but jesus fuck it doesnt hesitate to tear me a new one each time i play it there arent enough singleplayer games like this anymore and we need new ones down with the bs games as service multiplayer focused model the fact that included mr self destruct by ni is worth a like great video ragnar the best shooter of that era which probably makes it the best shooter ever i havent had so much fun with any other fps game love the nin i really want a jagged alliance 2 forgotten gem video make a video about unreal the first one since in my opinion its a forgotten gem have you tried the neverhood or star ship titanic the media doesnt talk much about those titles i havent played blood but i still have fondness for it its not a truly forgotten gem for some of us but i wont complain about titles meanwhile theres more blood videos being made more monster of the week soon lucasarts outlaws is a real forgotten gem you should do a video on it that was my favorite game in the late nineties ive never forgotten the blood how dare you dat credit part d subs please wheres the damn source code of this game to make tons of mods like doom all the classic doom clones have been revisited except the best one bring on more blood ill swallow your soul swallow your soul dude how have i not heard of this it looks so badass the stalker trilogy is more of a forgotten gem masterpiece than any other first person shooter i can think of it is also the best first person shooter experience still out there not a multiplayer deathmatch game but it ascends that wow excellent video i discovered blood recently because i wanted to go back and play the old games i could not play when they came out the games back then were so good and with a lot of character thank you for making this video i have fond memories of outlaws too but i dont know how it stands up blood was forgotten nick newhard theres a name forgotten gems wtf you must play minecraft you defending yourself offended me how dare you 5 seconds of blood gameplay screw doom i wanna play blood well thanks to civvie11 everyone is playing it xd i agree with you about the map design we struggled for hours with phonecords to get pcs to play nice together the fort map was awesome hell yeah im always up for more exposure for blood my man hit us with a stone cold ta ta why didnt i get notifications hell yes you finally uploaded your credit sections are outright amazing not only is your content golden but the credits alone are worth patronage the renaissance of old school fps games starts when 2016 doom came out blood a forgotten gem i mean its not doom but any 90s pc gamer knows about this one not only did you summon another genuine forgotten gem to analyze but you snagged someone who had a hand in its creation you have become god tier status i remember falling in love with this game from a get go as a kid it really felt more refined than duke nukem n such this is one of the funniest and most enjoyable patreon shoutout sections ive ever seen i still play this shit on dos patch the best game ever oh man blood i have great memories of playing this game with my dad it was one of the few games we bonded over and spend many nights losing track of time playing bloodbath thank you ragnar i hadnt thought of this game in years awesome videostill waiting on shadowman i am happy blood is finally getting the attention it deserves i think its way better than duke nukem or shadow warrior both gameplay and aesthethic wise 25d is 3d even wolfenstein 3d is 3d even if its gameplay isnt sector stuff like duke3d is full 3d but with limitations because of how the geometry is stored if height didnt affect anything then youd be able to step up cliffs and rockets would climb stairways instead of hitting a step and you wouldnt be able to shoot something over a monsters head and crouching would be redundant and so on if updown is a factor in anything then its full 3d i like pastries what i probably love the most about the game is how cool the exotic parts of the arsenal are the flare gun which seems like the basic pistol kinda gun is anything but basic it has so many things you need to consider when using it and then the tnt which can let you fly due to how explosions work and the fact it is thrown means you have to get that right as well ah its so great nightdive really should have redone the cutscenes i first played blood in 1999 and even then they were hard to look at even a handdrawn slide show would be an improvement 1003 i dont understand this statement i think a majority of 90s shooters has type of game design in my opinion still love youre video i remember back in college taking my copy of blood in to the club room and wasting hours upon hours playing 4 way bloodbath so many great memories this has since remained one of my main games that i install on every pc ive owned since i picked it up way back in the dos days thank you for this awesome vid showcasing my top fave game from yester year romero was right it is the best deathmatch since doom 2 great video will you ever do a video about skullmonkeys or neverhood those games are really great especially skullmonkeys blood is my favorite fps of all time and this is a great video but cmon that tone wasnt necessary 1752 forgotten gems so forgotten that a whole remaster was made holy crap what a wonderful surprise this was didnt expect your guest or the special feature after great job man thanks for brightening a bit of a tough day please go for your new title gems forgotten by a reasonable amount of people which does not necessarily include you personally dear gamer this is such a cool title for your series and so easy i fucking loved this gamegod bless blood oh i wished this would come to consoles man star wars bounty hunter my favorite fps from that era still have an obsession with caleb also fuckin love the nin in the opening forgotten but got official remake i dont think its forgotten at all i always thought it was strange and a big oversight to not have any revolvers in the game i remember playing the demo of this game loved it can you get an interview from the hexen guys forgotten gem by which metrics im genuinely interested in case you have some objective way to measure that were in the blood renaissance and you call it forgotten lol i would hardly call blood forgotten at least online its the most jizzed over build engine game too bad the official port is meh if you like the voice actor stephan weyte hes in the animated miniseries i worked on antihero hey i used a clip from ghosts for the intro of my wifes youtube vids too d blood is not forgotten it just got a remaster by nightdive studios on steam just like what they did for turok 1 2 a few years ago blood 2 the chosen by monolith productions on the other hand starting the video with a nine inch nails song is why your my favourite i just finished this game two days ago againone of the best shooters ever made your videos are always worth the wait me finds ragnarrox in recommendation also me best day ever until the next video i always love your vids man keep it up really good video and i feel your sadness with blood i felt like i was the only one who actually heard about it growing up so i never actually played mp the interview really lends itself well to this kind of video if you can do this with future epeisodes i think thatll be kinda cool nice spin on the patreon naming by the way its so great to see a gaming channel that doesnt whine about evil game publishers damnit now i gotta go replay painkiller and scratch my spectacle shooter itch 045 please call the next episode this way at least once i like that joke omgggg finally a really familiar game in forgotten gems d i wasnt much of a player in the 90s in fact i was more of a backseat player back then but this one heck yeah gimme that pitchfork d anyone know the song around 2728 minutes oh boy yes and it is on ragnar we are going to have some bloodbath together an interesting video on chernobog httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvumbhkskdeoo but blood basicly just got re released so this time it was actually not forgotten d but keep it up mate i love these videos only 45 seconds in and my man already hittin it with the sass i love this channel damn im not a fan of interviews in retrospective videos but ill give it a watch yes please rename the show whats that smell not sure its a forgotten gem when it got a noteworthy remaster over a month ago and has been covered by many pccentric channels over the years not to mention a sequel blood 2 next i think the suffering is a forgotten gem needs more recognition are you assuming im a gamer thanks for the video i love blood too but dont forget the suffering prison is hell walking through gelatin oh the old days xd nine inch nails ghosts iiv and blood 1 this is fucking awesome i love you ragnarrox i was waiting for you to cover this cult classic i love how you integrated the interview in the video so seamlessly this is still my favo fps game second is shadow warrior then herectic and doom new games should learn from blood really neat way of mentioning patreon tortuehm fun members love the video death stranding tho whole new trailer meaning a whole new analysis possibly please mr self destruct whilst playing blood i cant think of a better nostalgia trip thanks as always for an awesome vid wolfensteen its stein brah wolfenstein translates to wolfs rock one of my favorite youtubers finally reviewing my favorite game this is heaven now i just want to see a video on it by grim beard and my life will be complete caught the moment with 6666 views eerie my dad bought this game when we got our first computer i was a bit too young to play about 5 years old i believe in 1998 but after a year he let play lots of fun played the crap out of it great game from my childhood i wouldnt mind getting the new rerelease of the game on steam blood is epic the start of this video reminds me that gamers deserve nothing lmao great video but i have to know whats the track that kicks off at 2742 ive been going through the music list but i just cant find it i think you could really do with speaking more clearly because countless times throughout this video you let your voice drop so low that it turned into a croak or a whisper it doesnt make for the smoothest listening experience if im straining to understand your full sentences but ignoring that your contents well put together and i hope you keep putting out more gems like this one this looks even better than doom i cant believe ive never heard of it before also i like what you do with the patreon thing in every videonot everyone can make something like that enjoyable this literally got a remastered release less than a month ago your videos continue to be some of the best on youtube great work getting the creator for this one blood is one of my favorite shooters such a quality video really excited for future content you have such a soothing voice great video as always man do you think youll ever do a video on layers of fear i think youd have a lot to talk about way of samurai 1 is another forgotten gem a good time to say i liked blood before it was cool you know fps games werent half bad back then perhaps this time around they were made with actual effort behind it i absolutely love blood its not just one of my favorite shooters but one of my favorite games of all time period thank you for doing it justice ragnar and especially thanks for bringing on nick i think im gonna have to pick up fresh supply the patreon shout outs are so cool how long did it take you to make that forgotten hd version came out not two months ago great video but fresh blood is not the best version currently out there lots of people have issues with it including me you can see examples on my channel lots of crashes and small inaccuracies i would say that currently nblood which is free btw is the best and most accurate port i was considering becoming a patron nevermind p ragnar youre expanding my game library one video at a time and i love it absolutely love this my whole family would play this on the lan when we were kids your patreondungeon idea was friggin golden xd so creative loved it i remember my cousin let me play blood on his pc when i was still very young but it was so over the top that it didnt scare me it was just good fun i wonder of you have played strife another incredible 25d game might be a good candidate for your next video regarding the pronunciation of wolfenstein in german i before e is pronounced as ee e before i is pronounced as aye iepun half intendedyou pronounce whichever letter comes last the w should also be pronounced as v and the st should be pronounced sh but thats probably going a bit too far i remember the tricks we had to do with the build engine to fake multifloor buildings with hollow courtyards 612 ssis add games were the best sadly i no longer have the patience to play them anymore fpses ruined me 616 they already had a similar engine for games like eye of the beholder so maybe they figured theyd upgrade that 1525 usain bolts top speed is 4472kph 2779mph 2055 fresh supply was incredibly buggy youtubeekg29enea but at least they listened youtubeofupnlfwiyg 2255 i played doom duke sw etc quake with only keyboard back then i cant do that anymore 046 i like it really rolls of the tongue he reads wolfenstein like wolfensteen jesus man what is wrong with you what ive never forgotten this game how dare you no but seriously i played through it last year and it got me into the whole retrofpsscene awesome gem fun fact the main protagonist name caleb actually means dog in hebrew language the patreon shoutouts keep getting more creative this one and the junji ito are my faves i still have my 2 disc cd version of blood complete with the type o negative love you to death video on it fun dungeon really you had fungeon right there i really should be consulted about these things also i totally play this game with a controller and no one has stopped me yet nice doom review its surprising how little va roles stephan weyte got over the years his work as caleb was absolutely stellar fantastic video as always thanks to civvie blood will not be forgotten you have a slight accent i cant place it irish woah ragnar great video keep it up proud of ya you sir are once again turning a lowkey shitty day into a good one thanks lol how you going to top yourself now jk fucking solid man mine is painkiller obviously inspired by games like blood its not just a fun shooter i felt cultural reflection in every single map every one of them had fantastic mood different monster types were awesome too this game affected me so much the feeling of ancient evil mythology i imagined that every map is a real location but player experiences it as a version in purgatory painkiller was more then game i have never had this kind of experience since so blood is definitely its predecessor i think forgotten gems is my fave series as you are showing us games that are truly fun and underated that patreon segment was top notch how dare he nick newhard is a fucking rockstar it was so awesome to hear his thoughts thanks for covering this man finally this is one my eternal favourites fps of the old school thank you so much for this video i just bought fresh supply a couple weeks ago the game is fucking amazing 117 mr selfdestruct by nine inch nails over quake footage slow clap i wish shooters would go back the style we got in the mid 90s to early 2000s oh shiiiit nightdive touched up blood im a little bit worried that you killed most of your patreon members do you really think that was a good idea fun fact many russian gamers know and love blood it has a little cult in our country i have an unopened original copy of this in a box in my attic i just never got around to playing it also f for thwagum uuuuuuuh blood i still have the nightmares love to see this game getting the attention it deserves probably my favorite old school fps also nice choice of music with mr self destruct lol doom actually has a blood modits way better its smooth and has way more blood and gore httpsyoutubezqk7ptldb8o it is time monolith 4 lyfe i live again totally worth the wait for this gem your videos are amazingly well done keep it up also blood reminded me of gore ultimate soldier i felt the same with hexen and my friends at the lan parties 3 was this a love letter or a review regardless im aroused 1500 thats gibs like giblet not gibbs like goblet stuart brown retroahoy doom why dont they remake the game with more textures and enemy type the levels need more variety and we have better tech so why not brutal doom and dusk are good examples i will write this one more time you have the best content on yt trillions of light years ahead of other channels have not see them all but you know what i mean i dedicate this thread to the unforgettable quotes geroxe cruo forgottengems nightmare creatures 1 or 2 one of those i got on gog i didnt remember why and when kudos for the preachercomicreference blood is probably my favorite shooter i can load it up any time and just have fun blowing up cultists im only 15min in but this is super interesting i love blood and having nick to talk about it is just really great this channel keeps amazing me a new forgotten gems video on blood this is a dream come true you know it is a good day when ragnar uploads a video didnt even watch the video yet but i love your channel for introducing me to vampire the masquerade omg i love that game 3 love a ragnarox videoi didnt know this one so thanks for expanding my horizons huh because of my age at the time i actually forgot that this game was a thing that said i do recall people i knew playing it i was never really really into fps in general though i did dabble with classic doom and wolfenstien simply because they were available on my home computer i personally always thought the look of these games for the time was very impressive for the time and still think it is rather impressive to look at even today i actually thought blood was doom when i first saw it until i was told otherwise but at the same time i had only seen it played once and can see why it would somewhat fade into obscurity which is is a shame especially with what this video touches on also really cool to hear things from the developers perspective too oh my god slightly off topic from the video here but there was a game you mentioned in the video that i never knew the name of for years duke nukem i used to watch my neighbor play it on his pc when i was a kid i was surprised to see a clip of it and recognized the visual style thanks for mentioning it now i finally have a name to that game from my younger days nice another video before watching this video i know it will be awesome anyway just want to namedrop civvie 11 for reminding me of blood in recent months thanks to his pro blood miniseries and talking about fresh supply also cant understate how much i love blood for its themes humorous quotes badass protagonist and fun use of dynamite as well as secondary fire modes more people really need to know about blood 3 i remember this game but only vaguely i think i played it like once when i was a kid the only thing i really remember is the pitchfork civvie11 will never let us forget about blood come on im sure noone would be offended by blood its such a nice tolerant family game i live again man blood looks great thanks for sharing this forgotten gem to the world and hearing the passion between you two about this game feels genuinely good i need to buy blood to complete the build trilogy duke nukem 3d shadow warrior blood are the best fps games in the genre theyre absolutely fantastic ragnar my queen w blood 2 next im always waiting for more forgotten gems videos love your content huh never heard of it looks like doom though 30 seconds in and already the video is so much more polished and well edited feels awesome to see the channel get better and better with each upload fifth clicked so hard when i got that notification great the best guess this is the time i will try into bloodfs again need to play faster than 40 minutes

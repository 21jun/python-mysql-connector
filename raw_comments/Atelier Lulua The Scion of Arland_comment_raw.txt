this looks so much better than ryza 452 that surely is a natural pose to stand in they look like tposing test models i havent enjoyed a atelier game since the arland series i hated sophie wanted but didnt pick up shalliebut am playing ryza and love it i need to play this one does it have a time based system or nah cause i liked that in arland plus it meant a lot for the replayability it always felt good being ahead of the clock on a second play through im really enjoying lulua will definitly go back and play the other arland games ngl the media types try making these games out to be sexist incel fanservice but the gameplay shirrako had looked very marketable to female gamers i notice you dont talk much about atelier sophie like there isnt a review about it im wanting to get into this series what would you recommend to start with also great review very informative and you have such a soothing voice atelier dusk trilogy dx soon on pc and other platform how you feel about it ayevah how do you pronounce ava then eevah lol a can you play any atelier game in any order or is there a specific order to play them in based on storyline etc as i do know there are characters in older games in the sequels b how long do each take to complete c which is the best one i have played atelier iris eternal mana only i think maybe they should stop doing sequels and spend time make the game really good then release not too often looking back i cant afford all the atelier games they keep making too many but i did like eternal mana you know this series is great and all knowing that i played atelier sophie but jesus are you responsible to become stronger manually i dont have anything against the games but i really dont like the fact that i have to go in the mixer and find all the good items to merge with thats why i am stuck in the library in sophie i am not strong enough i have to wonder what it is thats keeping this series from getting more popular gust keeps improving it is it because of how risque ar tonelico qoga was so sad what this series became its like if you took final fantasy and turned it into a saccharine kirby world the artstyle is so cute but i dont think i would enjoy the gameplay which is a shame maybe i just need to watch more videos though cool cool you have a nice voice keep it up so this game is a bunch of gathering no action and a bunch of talking with very little conflict for the characters this is a basic rpg with sunshine and rainbows slapped on it ive just started and do not want to continue because no drive to like these characters nor want to participate in the combat system does this game have english voice actors or is it subtitled in english 810 probably me being extremely nitpicky but actually if you close enough at familar area or character model during cutscene closeup shots you can tell that they reused a lot of assets from the original arland games due to the almostps2like blurry lowres texture quality the arland republic being the worst case scenario as you can see as you are near to the walls you can tell which is reused and which is new which can be very offputting despite being understandable despite that i really loved the game and lulua became my second favorite character in the series first one is sophie despite not yet playing her own game one of elements of the story that i like is how they show how being a family is more than being bloodrelated this is probably because most of stories i watched or read about adopted characters are often painting being adopted as a very negative thing so seeing something that doesnt take this route is a breath of fresh air excellent review had to watch it at 125x though speak a bit faster please my rorona has a daughterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr but not actully by blood i was kinda hoping shes with sterk i never go so fast to sad panda to search doujins this game is full of waifus im getting all 4 arland series because of your videos d atelier lulua got me back into atelier and i now plan to trying the mysterious games since atelier expert on twitter loves sophie you convinced me i just bought the atelier deluxe edition for 100 and will be buying the lulua soon i could never get into this series because of the controls and camera seems like i have to give lulua and arland trilogy a try at some point another awesome review i am really enjoying my time with this game and was glad to have discovered your video on it nice work thanks for covering these kinds of jrpgs just got a ps vita from a from a friend in japan and theres tons of these games for it and it really helps me decide what to get im so fucking out of touch with jrpgs outside of shin megami tenseipersona games good lord lulua has been my first experience with the atelier series such a charming game great review really well made video i came across this game while on amazon looking at other switch games and decided to look into it a bit more your review was everything i was looking for to push me to want to give the game a try d appreciate your thoughts as always sophie thanks surprisingly when i was watching the video an ad talking about atelier lulua appeared and i was like wat koei tecmo made a game like this too huh i thought all they produced is a warrior like games or just one man army genre hey hey people sseth here eva looks a little like hina from blue reflection i also am enjoying this game but honestly my biggest gripe is the age progression of older characters its just odd that none of them have really changed much and i always feel like gust is afraid of their main characters aging getting married or just changing over all totori now 26 looks almost identical to her 1314 year old counterpart i can acknowledge that budget time constants probably has a part in this but stilli really love this gamebut most every character is just a different variant of cute and while it is not inherently a bad thing it doesnt make the world entirely believable atelier lulua is still my favorite title in the series in terms of gameplay and i highly praise gust for breathing a breath of fresh air in their core gameplay with this one i dont even know how i got here but you have a very calming and soothing voice that helps with my anxiety so you got a sub from me lol this year fall on 2019 atelier ryza perfect i just grabbed a copy on switch and this is getting me excited for it i wont have time until the next week though good on you for thinking the atelier series is a good one someone has to say something nice about gust games is there pies so is this game for girls i torrented it but i think maybe this is for my girlfriend and not for me i wonder if you would ever consider trying out the nights of azure games i have watched and loved all of your nier automata videos 3 can you recommend any other games i just got this and played it obsessively over the weekend it really clicked with me unlike my previous attempts with the series will try the dusk trilogy next hi there i rarely ever join the comment section so i would like to keep my post short you should play xenoblades chronicles x it is similar to neir automata except that it is far more brilliant so who is the father how are you not already super famous you have a dope ass voice more videos pls 3 atelier ryze just announced 3 atelier games in a year holymoly we need more exapico games come on gust been meaning to get into this cuzza you but i forgot xd i decided to finally buyplay ff7 sorry xd i really want to get into the arland series but im very intimidated by the strict time limits in rorona is it bad that i dont want to buy this one i love the series so much so that i own them all the english ones anyway but i didnt like firis and the mysterious painting was morelukewarm for me it seems fairly similar to them edit i strongly wish theyd make the game with the time limits again but with an option to shut it off for the people who hate it i like the last game one character is completely op which was fun but the other 2 before that i really didnt like this new one i only just started its im liking it another rorona is it wrong i spent half of this video thinking lulua has such pretty hair but but who is the father im not much of a fan of atelier coz theyre simple and light rpg but i fell in love with its beautiful artwork so i still try to play any entry i can get my hands with show me the alchemist girls lintahlo holy fucking shit your voice is amazing never played heard or knew about this game honestly this is not even my type and genre of games but thanks to such a caring deep and enthusiastic presentation of the story i could not tear myself away from the review to its very end sincerely amazed by the form and content of your story and show incredible labor ive been wanting to play the atelier games for a long while now ever since i found your channel i think i am going to give it a go i wanna start with this game but im going to view the other arland games first yes view due to budget and thennn im gonna buy this this just released and theres already a new atelier game announced atelier raiza the queen of eternal darkness and the secret hideout not complaining tho theyre all really enjoyable games randomly i thought the new pickachu movie would be voiced by sophie not deadpool i feel so saddened i cant quite share your enthusiasm i had some concerns about this game and saw this video pop up making me wonder if my concerns were shared and apparently not which is fine of course and theres certainly a lot i agree with like how it looks lovely how it doesnt relies on its arland setting as pure nostalgia bait or how the pacing is like that of atelier totoris but well i like my time limits a bit too much it feels and their removal for a more main objectivecentric situation does lead to some parts that i kinda diliked like the puni rangers part on chapter 2 while the scenario itself is charming the feeling of having to go back and forth from arls to the checkpoint back to arls back to the checkpoint then a bit further back to arls back to this castle and back again and then back to the checkpoint and through was just something that felt kinda like padding and theres always a bit of padding but in timelimited games its generally hi i have only played one atelier game where 2 sisters jump into paintings on my switch i did not really get into it too much but i was curious how you would compare this one or the arland games to that one are they better i love jrpgs in general and the other games you talk about all seem to be games i love so i thought it worth checking your opinion really want to get back into the atelier series but the time management part is really not for me im glad the time pressure is gone i rather to grind on my time and fight monsters when im ready to do so before i accept the quests to do it love this game just like old times whoa man its been a long time since ive played an atelier series game last being meruru roronas game absolutely kicked my butt and i disliked it greatly the old ps3 version and not plus but i enjoyed the other two a lot lulua looks interesting enough to where i wanna get into it but i still feel apprehensive for some reason like if its not quite what i want with storyitem makingand combat yet which is why i held off getting the other games but your video kept me interested in lulua and to think about getting back into atelier for sure what about ninokuni im really interested in playing the atelier games so im considering picking up the new one since i have a switch to play it on atm of course i do intend to try all the other atelier games but its pretty convenient theres a shiny new one to put in my switch library got it on pc i like it im so glad they decided to continue the arland storyline mel kishidas artwork is so fitting for this series btw do you know series ar tonelico from gust it was an old game now from ps23 era lol man i love the atelier games and this one made me want to get back into them ive always had a curiosity to play the atelier games because they looked cute i think i might actually play this one i was thinking more of a ripoff of deathnote but besides that whats this tit brigade of kawaii those animals look too cute to fight lol love you sophie can i eat your booty i saw a playthough of merurus game so when i saw the top area of this 1 dungeon in lulua i was like omg i remember this area from merurus game this is where she fought that one boss it made me feel happy the alchemist of dusk isnt on steam or any other platform than ps3 rip i just finished blue reflection and loved it if this is from the same people than ill have to check it out i like that theres no time management it was a major issue i had and why i never bought one of these after the original not counting the 3ds game im curious i might get this one can never give enough praise to creators who make proper subtitles for their videos thank you so much atelier iris 3 grand phantasm is one of my favourite games of all time and a year or two ago i found out theres an obscene amount of atelier games to my disdain i find that lydie suelle was so stiff that it made me feel like there was no effort put into the game the story felt nonexistent for the dozens of hours i put into it i tried atelier sophie and i had the same issue it felt like the series of my favourite title is now only a kawaii waifu cashgrab to this day i regret buying lydie suelle what hooked me with grand phantasm was an amazing story flavourful characters good vas and a battle system that i dream about to this day the ost was something i didnt know to appreciate back then but i find myself coming back to experience nostalgia by listening to it now ten years later the aforementioned newer atelier titles were missing all of those factors when i moved in the world it felt like my character glided while a default animation played at a default got my copy yesterday and im looking forward to play the game some time later hopefully early next week after im done with meruru dx at first glance the world system it looks like a merge of sophie and shallie eventlimit rather than timelimit while the combat looks like an upgraded version oflydiesuelle synthesis system kinda looked a bit like eschalogy with all those bar but ill take that having an improved system is always a welcome as long as its not an overly convoluted mess looking at you mysterious series anyway the game looks goodthe graphic is definitely a vast improvement over the arland series cant wait to play the game im glad that you have positive views on the game which means im definitely is going to have a good time playing this later im really happy that gust actually went back to the arland series imo modern atelier is at its best at arland and dusk series btw im also looking forward to gusts new project announced no time limit takes away any sense of pacing or struggle just mindless grind and farming of events so thats where my sinoalice summon book went oh my gawd the character designs and outfits are so cute o im gonna get this one and if i enjoy it enough i might get the arland bundle reflection did look strange i like you love all the atelier titles including some fan translated ones but the less great video you go girl huh i didnt even know any atelier games had came to the switch i think ill try this out having this kind of game on something i can just play in bed or on my way to work seems so much better than playing it in the living room on my ps4 so basically 1010 atelier scale i just love this series 3 would you say that this installment is a good entry point to the atelier series as a whole though i have been keeping the atelier series on the shelf for several years now im told by series aficionados that recent entries in the series are not that great and im better off playing ayesha as my first game the only problem with that is that my ps3 died years ago and i dont have a ps vita so yeah would love to have your opinion on that i came doubtful i left excited to try my first atelier game good to hear you hi can you please explain more in detail how the time management works in this game what you mean by you cant take forever thanks whoa who did the art at the end of the video so beautiful cant wait to play it i love your reviews that art stylecharacter art has to be done by tony taka right dude definitely has a very recognizable style which is both bad and good edit nevermind i commented before finishing the video rip i cant remember one interesting character design after mana khemia its like they are using same template for these anime copy pastes im all for heartwarming stories starring insanely adorable waifus definitely picking up the bundle also is the music playing in the background the ost its very heartwarming itself oh god i love the intro song so much my heart hurts i think ill play this one and wiki the other 3 mainly due to how time restrictive the older games appear i enjoyed escha and firis time systems this game has always caught my eye when im in the ps store but i never took the time to look it up now im about to buy this tomorrow its still so beautiful and full of charm cant wait to get this just love how these kinds of game show off how you dont need some over the top harem like jrpg or some story that gets convoluted 10 times and resorts to summoning gods to fight the god of gods ive been playing abit and im hoping its not as time restrictive as totori was i dont need to feel like i need to rush to the next plot just cause i want to play more thoroughly seeing eva reminded me of hina from blue reflection hey gust blue reflection 2 nice review im having a blast jumping back into arland cool i preordered it hoping to have more arland vibes totori and meruru are my favorites and watching this really helps to know what ill be playing tomorrow thanks for the review why the frick is your intro so good just completed atelier sophie literally 1015mins ago i loved it the last time i played an atelier game was atelier iris 1 i loved it but i dont think i can play another for a while which is a same considering i also got atelier firis and atelier lydie suelle at the same time but this one looks good so i expect ill buy it and add it to the pile d great review im hoping you see this valkyrieaurora because i have a question related to the previous arland games on switch im wondering if you know of any physical releases of the previous games that have an english option i really prefer having my games physically and will import if necessary since i dont think north america got the past games physically on nintendo switch based on my so far limited searching but didnt see any definitive answer on the japanese release related to language options thank you in advance would mean a lot if you happen to know and are able to reply this book contains numerous secwets that was way too adorable name of intro song thats cute and all but who the fuck is the father damn you devs lets face it sophie you are just lusting for anime girls xd i mean who isnt is the arland thing supposed to be ireland ive beaten rorona and im about to beat totori should i jump to this one or play meruru first i want to see more of ffxiv and i think it would be cool if you did a stream on twitch if i had one complaint it would be the lack of a dub i know that might sound blasphemous but i really liked the english voices in the original trilogy and was disappointed they didnt have them here need indiemaus to make a top 10 waifus for this game you play tales of series i havent played the other games but this looks so cute hey valkyrie if you like atelier then you would love trails of cold steel based on which games you say you like its basically all the stuff you want in a game i am still on the shelf of trying one of these games but i do like the look of them its so expensive though i love the atelier games but man they put them out too quick lol cant even manage to finish the last one that came out before the next one is out lol oof i wish theyd include some romance in those games lmao nice review im new at the series and currently playing my first one atelier sophie what i dont get is the appeal of the game it looks pretty but whats the game about have you tried to play utawarereumono i think you would like it yes i was waiting for this video i have been a fan since your introduction to atelier video i have been enjoying this game for a couple of days definitely lulua is also my favorite arlan protagonist but i am also in love with mama rorona i just wish that gust port the dusk trilogy to pc to complete my atelier experience nelke made want to play them so hard your intros are always so amazing ah waifus talking about waifus channel again i fo agree tho unlike most previous ones this one looks coheisevely pleasant hey new gust title just teased too thoughts excited to see more new things from the dev team i know you were thinking it was a rip off of atelier sophie yes i was you got me i am totally versed in this game series yup thats me a true gamer infinite knowledge notice me sophie sama been waiting for this video since luluas release ive avoided most of the recent entries in this series because it seems like it relies too heavily on cutefactor and general anime silliness based on that i havent played an entry since mana khemia 2 and i kinda miss the mechanics am i incorrect in my judgment is the gameplay enough to overcome my distaste for that sort of thing if im correct is this entry different from the others in this regard your voice is very lovely to hear or just i am wired stop it your kindness is too much lol bro i wanna play this god damn game but i dunno where to start its pricey and confusing i loved this review please review the mysterious trilogy i am currently playing atelier sophie its my first atelier game and i got into it because of your videos finally some good atellier video so they finally make totori x mimi canon its worth mentioning the fact that youre reviewing the ps4 version im playing the game on switch and it looks fairly differently for obvious reasons sees valkyrieauroras new video smashs the like automatically love your work no switch sales stop this pricing discrimination already editors also when strim just seeing the cute images displayed in this video made my day better i love how this looks so much my copy was delayed by two days i cannot wait for it to get here but your review has tided me over in the meantime great work then there is the most important thing of totori and mimi are still together thanks for the review i was a little hesitant since the last atelier game i played was sophie and i got too bored to complete it i wanted to give it a second chance and try it out on steam the way you reviewed it made it seem so fun i couldnt help buy it the moment i finished watching i was already thinking of buying it anyways so i took your word hope itll be a good game for me i got a notification for this at the same time as my ltd ed version of the game being delivered now i just have to get through the workday great review sophie i really appreciate the work you put in to help promote these fantastic franchises im a man of culture so ill buy all the arland games firstwhen i have the money to buy games where are the cheats for infinite money can men enjoy in this game i only know atelier iris back in ps2 from your video now i know there is a lot of atelier series and the good thing is i can get them on steam now does the time management system stops after you finish the game story in the atelier games or do they keep going because the time management system stress me out note i played a couple of the ateliers game but i didnt get to finish them i dont know why but ive never gotten into the atelier games despite loving the heck out of mana khemia which are spinoffs of atelier i should give this one a try though it looks like chill fun could use that in this busy school semester yet more stupid translation bullshit from idiots who dont understand the basics of romanji her name is shortened to lulu like every other atelier protagonist she gets given a western name i mean iris is a rare name but it is still used the only real exception i can think of is when they decided to call a girl totally when spelled phonetically in romanji you have to put the a at the end otherwise japanese people would just pronounce it lul the localisation team should really know this basic shit and just give her the western name she was intended to have in the first place element synthesis is back yeeeeeeaaaah i hope store prices will drop as quickly as for the previous entry i just have two questions one how does the time limit work is it exactly like in totori im more of a fan of clear shorter time frames two how do ultimate attacks work in this game are they the good shallie type or the hard to trigger lydiesuelle type for someone who wants to get into the atelier series what is a good place to start and order to go from there great video as always how bad is this game censored completely not relevant but noctis likes boys lol is it me or does the hairpin of the girl in tue thumbnail look like the kingdom hearts logo i am getting atelier on the switch i am 100 sure that your plan from the very beginning was to start a channel on the foundation of good nier videos growing it with more gaming content sprinkle some funny gameplay and reviews and then revealing your true goal make us all go through atelier hell marvelous play i gotta say eh those cutesy kinds of games are not for me wholesome fun is going to be wholesome but i am not a fan of it but its fun to listen to you explaining stuff you like this shit is diabetic what system did you play this on i have the arland trilogy on switch but the mysterious trilogy on ps4 and was wondering which system i should get lulua for im leaning towards switch as these games are really fun for vacations and road trips this is a really nice detailed and well put review on the game well done it looks incredibly beautiful i wonder what their next installment is gonna assume that the book is a horcrux that corrupts the player the intro for this video is just muh muh muh 3 god this fuggin artstyle asthetic owo the main character is so fricking cute truly living to the title of the atelier shill thats some real superbutterbuns energy at 140 the best voice of youtube not an opinion just a fact awesome video hey sophie you should do an adventures on persona 5 so there is no release for ps vita thats sad i pay no attention on what you telling i just like your voice i just discovered this series recently and i love it bruh people out here trying to sleep why you do this lol ive been rewatching a bunch of ventures lately that i totally forgot that the beat drops in the intro lol this is cool i really hope the dusk series gets a hd port to ps4 and a fourth game to go along with it also why havent we gotten a mana khemia hd remaster yet i really want this game but right now its too expensive and they are probably going to release dlcs waiting more is going to be a pain fucking kt dude ps awesome review as usual who needs sleep when you get hyped for atelier by your favorite reviewer now we need a definitive end to the dusk series never mind its good as is just wondering would you say that its a chick game random question time is the picture at the end of your videos you as an atelier alchemist also who drew it wow i was just watching your va11 ha11a vid today i best watch this too cute design interesting story might pirate i mean might buy it later you got a review copy youve certainly come a long way congrats 1131 am whr i am how late were u up for this dude im about to try this franchise but dunno seems really girly its almost half prica in steam u know today i broke 3 toes and ur voice kinda heals me those games not even god has played them 138 i thought you were going to reference the death note here lol upon seeing you upload i was like wtf you already have this game i have such a lovehate relationship with these games its impossible to find special editions of them so i have to order them online and im not in north america so its a pain and they make them faster than i can plat them but boy are these games my drug still beating the rorona remake also i have no clue how i have atelier rorona dx but had no idea that totori and meruru also had the ps4 dx version made more stuff to buy send help i heard there was this one character who was shoehorned in and her interactions with lulua went to a high without buildup near the end of the game is this true oh i was just about to go to bed now i can watch this and end my night right thanks sophie 3 lulua the daughter of rorona me wait what but i just started the game and what wait whos the father i need to finish this series valkyrie posts video at 3am me hearing dat notification bing thank yo u pc users atelier games are on sale on steam and humble bundle this is the best time to get into the games now heres my question if i buy this game will we get the dusk trilogy for switch i really wanna go back and play atelier atesha plus but i dont want to touch my vita any more its a huge bummer that the dusk is left on the way side since to me has the better games i love your taste in games its okay im not sleeping either as a fan of jrpg games like final fantasy and dragon quest is this an appealing series to get into if so where do i start along the way youll meet making things confusing craft but like spike bomb curry pie tea party got pranked from the god andddd little jelly awwwww so can you please elaborate explain the time management system in this game how strict is it when do i get a game over and also is the game world linear because all these are what makes or breaks the game for me but the video was nice and fluffy as always never played these games but this has my interest fuckin love the ventures videos though you have a great voice too you should try voice acting yo whats filo doing in this game sis im trying to go to bed why you gotta upload right now yay another atelier best birthday present i couldve asked for i never played think its because of the time constraint she baccc i was waiting for this hit me with that unbridled love for a fun series this game has dethroned dmc 5 for my game of the year shes alive oh wow this anime game looks like a fairy tale like magical story i have never played any atelier games i hope they arent too complicated im currently watching your atelier meruru playthrough as i type this ill be getting to this game eventually but i have to say its going to be weird to listen to this in japanese when im so used to the english voices from the previous arland games shame they didnt do a dub on this it would have been nice to see julie maddalena and liam obrien reprise their roles among the others by the wayeva what do you need these bombs for little did she know that her friend has converted to islamic extremism and late on these very bombs were used in the assassination of prime minister of arland hello im thinking of buying this game wanted to know if you can still get platinum even without all those extras like season pass dlcs etc thank you in advance you know this series is great and all knowing that i played atelier sophie but jesus are you responsible to become stronger manually i dont have anything against the games but i really dont like the fact that i have to go in the mixer and find all the good items to merge with thats why i am stuck in the library in sophie i am not strong enough is the game fun im planning to get one and i want to know if its good thanks for this i feel like this is the best atelier ive seen so far especially in design choices they keep changing things up in every game usually for the worse but this ones strikes a good chord with me in the 2nd part of act 2 the awakening lions of trails of cold steel 2 paula rean would it be possible to take the horses on board the courageous rean hmm the hold should be large enough from what i remember does that mean youre joining us paula paula you got it im sure the horses want to help out too rean haha thanks a lot jusis just you know slacking off isnt an option once youre on

want to untold more of this story of theirs vita vita im sorry emma i wont untold this story since the story of the zemuria continent has come to an end in trails of cold steel 4 until the calvard arc emma what you thought you untold the other arc story in atelier world vita vita i did but arland isnt like this emma ever since when rorona was the one left her hometown called arklys and headed to arland in the first place when her daughter lulua was little estelle she did really vita of course she did rean why you didnt tell us about that vita and you untold the story of twilight land and adalet and not arland in the first place vita i did untold the story of atelier world rean ever since when the 1st chapter of the liberl arc begins in trails in the sky 1st chapter righ arklys was originally roronas hometown all this time rorona left arklys head to arland when lulua was little theres also have this easter eggs for this game that can seen in other games horses for trails of cold steel ho oh for pokemon johto arc even totori met piana back in atelier totori she using a boomerang blade like sivir from league of legends eva using a cannon similar to tita russell from trails in the sky trilogy until she riding an orbal gear in trails of cold steel 34 unlike her she using a cannon as melee weapons as well as aurel is using a tachi using eight leaves one blade swordsman skills similar to rean schwarzer a trails of cold steel hero so on what in the world is this and also trails of cold steel 4 the end of saga did it first before atelier lulua the scion of arland ever since when trails saga by falcom did made a correct order from sky to cold steel but in future whenever theyll mention calvard arc leman arc or not that the atelier hey i love your channel because it brings games that are not known to many peoplereally hidden and amazing games i wanted to ask you something is this game after sophia because i think there was a game between the two games but i forgot the alchemists name it is atelier something mother rorona darth vader is luluas father i love your video thumbnail also good luck on the platinum trophy i just figured out this exists and im wondering if i have to play any other games to understand this one so i skipped the video to get into the gameplaycut sceneskipcut sceneskipcut sceneskipanother cut scene when do you actually get to play the game this is blazblue central fiction all over again hard pass unless they have english voice dlc i tried to give your channel a chance but the frequent popups to subscribe to your channel obscure the text and the watermark that obscures the minimap mean ill try another channel did you happen to buy digital deluxe edition for ps4 i did it on switch while for ps4 i bought an le at nisa store cant wait to play it dang no english voice acting three times in a row for the atelier series koei america really cheaping out recently get your copy of atelier lulua the scion of arland here amazon httpsamznto2ygzekk aunz httpsbitly2vsraoo i love it till this day i even played ryza but i still need to say lulua is my favorite for me lulua is the best atelier series like battle and music so interesting thank you for the review you sold me on it and the removal of a timer system is great news no matter how forgiving a timer is in a game i just cannot avoid worrying about it constatnly couldnt play majoras mask because of it and have never been able to enjoy a dead rising game gotta be honest story is lackluster compare to atelier escha logy the part in order to get the true ending in this game just didnt click for me its like with just the power of yur i mean friendship anything is possible the best atelier with its bonus content behind a huge paywall you know this series is great and all knowing that i played atelier sophie but jesus are you responsible to become stronger manually i dont have anything against the games but i really dont like the fact that i have to go in the mixer and find all the good items to merge with thats why i am stuck in the library in sophie i am not strong enough i havent play the other arland series and i just finished lulua yesterday and i enjoyed it so much im surprised at how good lulua is i set low expectation for this game but after i get in chapter 3 or 4 i get obsessed with it and yes alchemyriddle is so fun awesome been wanting to check out the atelier series sjnce i loved gusts blue reflection so nice to hear this can be played without the prior games i wanted to get into this series back on my ps3 but alchemy is not my jam nice review i bought the arland trilogy a month ago and playing totori atm then meruru i cant wait to finally play this one after the whole trilogy ps atelier ryza looks great hopefully theyll release some gameplay soon finally i can get back into atlier games lol i stopped playing after totori couldnt enjoy the game with those constant deadlines hanging over my head i cant take time pressure lol i will get on pc what an epic game so you can take your time and go anywhere you want without wasting time in this one thats the one thing that prevented me from getting into these games if its gone then im totally sold despite the fact its the first game in the arland series to not have an english dub option thats great all companies should take the example from this and stop butchering foreign media jay thanks for the thumbs up with this one the arland trilogy dx is definitely considered the best for a reason the way it weaves the world into what it is that youre doing has just been fantastic i started playing atelier with mana khemia and then played the iris games after and when i finally got a ps3 i got the trilogy and just loved it im surprised at the lack of english dubs as well the series has always had superior dubbing so id figure that theyd call on the same people but i guess it might be because some of the former english vas phoned in a no or something and they couldnt do one authentically i got the game and have to say i loved the other atelier the book and firis a lot more than this one i dont know what but i havent touched the game since a week the other games i just mentioned i played for days and kept playing this one lost my attention already maybe i will start over eventually but on pc the frames dips quite a lot i hope they will fix it not normal for a game with such graphics has big fps drops in some areas when it rained the game even crashed not good glad to see more love to the atelier series ive been a long time fan of it and its one of my favorite series ever lulua brought joy to my heart hoho at last another jrpg yeah but they make mimi x totori canon already im choosing to buy this game or atelier lydie suelle since both are the same price which one do you recommend i played most of the arland and mysterious series so i have no problem playing both im choosing to buy this game or atelier lydie suelle since both are the same price which one do you recommend i played most of the arland and mysterious series so i have no problem playing both play this and its like youre playing barbie atelier series really needs more spotlight looks good but no english dub means a no buy for me mumu guess ill try it out we get this in the west and right before they announce the new game a to the ryza moe thigh gap chronicles i want to see the next of mysterious series in the future i love sophie so much i also will buy atelier lulua of coz what a shame this is the first aterlier game ive ever seen and the lack of an english dub is the deal breaker of why i wont be giving it a try whats the framerate like shallie was horrific on switch glad to see gust making something good after blue reflection and nights of azure i was ready to give up on them used to love them playing previous arland series is not a necessity i just played the mysterious series and still enjoyed atelier lulua why i love atelier lulua music battle machanics story and waifus hmmm i might pick this game up the no english voice option is a huge turn off as i prefer to hear my entertainment in my own language i even stopped buying the other games in this series once they stopped offering it fewer consumer options is always a pet peeve of mine but ill see either way its a lovely review jay youre my favorite source for rpgs in general awesome review i picked this up physically for the switch day one and i am thoroughly enjoying it definjitely one of the best atelier games to date whos the girl in the beginning i didnt quite get it on his voice alone i would really like atelier sophie and firis on switch that godlike song at the end tho been playing it for two days now and i have to agree with you this entry might just be my favorite its a really fun game thanks for the review i can finally play an atelier game i own all of them released in north america but i always stop playing them eventually because i am annoyed by the deadline most rpgs dont have them and its the worst part of any rpg to me if they have a time limit so i will play this one to the end once it goes down in price enough i find it amusing that the blaster is used as a physical attack hitting with the blaster rather than shooting something i havent heard of this game series before but i might pick it up if it goes on sale thanks for the review never played the series before but it looks fun wish money wasnt so tight right now but hearing you gush about it is infectious definitely going to keep an eye out when i get a chance thanks for the review i have never heard of this game series before but between you and ircha gaming it sounds like something i should check out i like games where you can get lost in accomplishing little quests and stuff and this looks like its right up my alley one question i have is that i am not getting a sense as to how linear this game is is it more open world can you tackle quests in whatever order you please jay rpg you prefer the versions of swtich only for portability but in other games is sacrificed from 60 fps to 30 fps greetings im like at chapter 6 and still dont know how to unlock the special attacks ultimates is there any romance in the atelier games tetralogy not quadrilogybut yes d i never played any of these games the first time i learned about this series was in a game store i saw atelier totori the adventurer of arland on the ps3 the only thing that stopped me from getting it was im not a fan of gathering resources so that i cna use battle skills i loved everything else about it i mean even still calling this the best still isnt saying much atelier is the call of duty of rpgs great review what bothers me with most anime rpgs is that they all seem to be the same kind of thing wheter its because they take place in modern times or have certain other elements that ruin it for me but i am happy that your reviews show that most anime games like atelier are unique never played an atelier game but it interests me is this a good start i agree this might be the best atelier to date cant wait until 28th to see what the new one looks like im not mad keen on these games but i do really love the art style if this game was an action rpg i would buy it switch sells two versions i think should i spend the extra cash this looks really good might have to pick it up after i finish xenoblade chronicles it really is amazing how great this is it feels like a better sophie to me great review ive also been pleasantly surprised at how good this entry in the series is i love atelier series and also will buy this one of course i hope they make an atelier iris 4 im a big fan of atelier iris 3 good review i think will buy it next month only played the mysterious series so far and the other arland games will be played too at some point atelier love a couple months ago i got so hooked on this series went from 0 to 9 games and finished the mysterious trilogy now working my way through the arland games to pick up lulua shes so friggin adorable xd i have no idea if i manage to wait 3 games before getting this one not first lulua voice is older than her mom rorona 040 haha trash item there you know this series is great and all knowing that i played atelier sophie but jesus are you responsible to become stronger manually i dont have anything against the games but i really dont like the fact that i have to go in the mixer and find all the good items to merge with thats why i am stuck in the library in sophie i am not strong enough i soo miss the english voices but ehhh i guess good game im using the same combination if lulua and piana as support it will deal more damage atelier meruru sterk is finally let go of his scary man reputation atelier lulua hell naw imma remind you of your sins rorona sterk i dont remember the girls with the puppets hmm i always wondered what a more mature rorona sounded like not too different i guess i know this is video is 3 months old but combat animations are skippable on controller its either lb or rb to skip animations 033 nope you messed up on atelier and scion lacry if you had to rank atelier lulua atelier ryza atelier firis and atelier sophie how would you rank them im going to get the best 3 out of these 4 1 i think number 1 is ryza 2 3 4 tbh anyone that has some knowledge on the series can answer can ryzen 5 2500u w vega 8 handle this the game looks really good on graphic nice dungeons and many things to do but the combat system is round based otl suddenly hooh passes by and i am like wat then a girl asks for a bomb this game is going to wild whats your opinion of the game so far ive had my eye on it wow the graphics is no joke but need 16 gb to play it what is your pc specs why people said single player games sucks this game is amazing death end request deluxe edition pc first hour of gameplay 1080p 60fps httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxn7kuvtvdae how do you run it in 60 fps mine doesnt have choices of fps how do you get 1080p the configuration screen i have limits me to 900p cool preorder atelier lulua the scion of arland here httpsamznto2ygzekk timestamps 0051 alchemy crafting 0412 side questrequests 0943 explorationworld map 1140 combat gathering 1620 new town cutscene whats the difference in the original and the deluxe edition version i have a few questions is it worth playing is it 1080p on switch is it smooth on switch is it an open world game is the game linear jay rpg you prefer the versions of swtich only for portability but in other games is sacrificed from 60 fps to 30 fps greetings playing right now and this is better that lydie and suelle o love it is it 30fps or 60 ive been playing this for about 10 hours now and its definitely my favorite atelier game ive played so far although i havent played all of them beautiful video left on the best possible cliffhanger ive never played any of the games from this series although this video showcases the gameplay aspects i still have a question what exactly is this series or even rune factory about i get that its a crafting game and youre trying to make your store the very best like no store ever was or something like that however whats driving the game forward otherwise whats the end goal is there one i suspect that its not a save the world country or even town style plot its probably not a game where you stumble upon a god or megalomaniac wanting to kill everything or a corrupt government to rally against youre also not some mystical creature like a dragon and are the last of your kind where people are out to get you youre not the only person who can do a particular thing nor does it seem like you have some magical ability or artifact that everyone desires probably not the sole survivor or a thing or event that exists or existed i also dont see a cheerleader to is there an english dub of this is there a timer on this game do you have to finish at a certain time frame or is it free play i really wish it were dubbed so far looks like a better port than the other games of the series hey whats your favorite trilogy i like the mysterious series do youre items refill each time you go out like in logy thats my favorite thing about atelier and i cant stand the way the do it in the newer games because the eyes are 30x larger in this game whenever lulua winks it looks really awkward wow at last they do some improvement on the graphic engine from what ive seen here looks like the core gameplay are pretty much the same but id love to see a video on whats new on this title please make it jay d something in particular i want to see english voice acting you should make a short video with tips for people starting an atelier game for the first time i would definitely watch looks good i just got my switch limited edition in the mail yesterday but have yet to start playing thanks for the video wow it runs so smoothly compared to lydie suelle on switch will be getting switch version since id rather play atelier games handheld is there any way i can download the menue sounds ive been curious about this series for a while this will be my first atelier game looking forward to the review video already preordered this should be coming in today did they remove the synthesis board where you can get bonuses by putting them in certain configuration on the board like in firis and lydie i dont mind it bring gone but i did like that system after watching lydie and suelle series im finally made it here well this its different fixed the underscan issue on the previous upload somehow its a bit of waste of plot story i mean this game just saving a person stia which is not really authentic human despite this game has a lot potential cool easy to obtain a lot of work for true ending to be achieved i wont watch since i want to see for myself later but curious do you think this game holds up to the other arland games let me know down below also if you would like to buy the game help support me use one of the links below i no longer have a partnership with playasia but i still have an affiliate account with them amazon a few other companies its not much but any little amount helps me out thank you for supporting me ill surely pick it up after finishing firis and lydie seems like a good step up over the last games though i never understand how the games dont run at 60fps on the ps4 considering theyre not even that intensive visually you know this series is great and all knowing that i played atelier sophie but jesus are you responsible to become stronger manually i dont have anything against the games but i really dont like the fact that i have to go in the mixer and find all the good items to merge with thats why i am stuck in the library in sophie i am not strong enough ive never played any atelier games before could i play this game enjoy it or do you recommend i play the previous games well the dlc just sounds lazy since they were in previous games but it looks miles better than nelke what a shitty game moar atelier waifus butmore koei tecmo greed sigh i love atelier but koei tecmo is such a shitty company ive never bought a season pass from them and will never will is that a costume for lulua because i hate her standard design its why i was gonna pass on this game are keina and mimi playable characters what shocks and appalls me is that despite how amazing this looks koei tecmo feel the need to utterly ruin it with three disgustingly overpriced season passes that gate off major characters and that they cant be bothered to dub it for the west it just shows a complete lack of care for the series cant wait to see the dlc for this i wonder if it has english voice actors like rorona so is the time limit tied to the story this time around i really dislike having the game end due to time restriction since item creations do not carry over to new game plus outside of weapons and armor and then you have to remake them over do you need to play the first 3 arland games before picking this up i been waiting for dx trilogy to go on sale yay its actually good bout to preorder the collectors edition i do not know english much but i like atelier series gamesi have atelier arland series and atelier alchemist series question ps4 or switch with sonys questionable censoring practice with jp games makes me less incentive to buy this game since i dont have a switch and nintendos easing off on their harsher policy makes me want to buy the game in that system top koei tecmo greed also shows when there games go on sale digitally why is a game like dynasty warrior 9 and warrior all stars 30 to 40 dollars when they go on sale digitally so who is the father koeitecmo is indeed one of the greediest japanese publishers they never lower msrp even years after release so when there is a sale its almost never a good percentage off the dlc is so disappointing only 3 characters all females mc from previous games is this playable on english and is it out on pc and one more thing do u read japanese thank you for the early review ill have to hold on the review since i want 0 spoilers also i know ill deliver it must i really like this series but i wish they would revive mana khemia it wouldnt kill us to have some more male protagonists now and then so this is the same universe from atelier escha logy does anybody watching this know how to get the ice bomb and the lightning bomb hi goten i play sao interfral facter i need your advice which is the best way for me to get kirito skills usa version have 50 of cover full off information useless that crop on the photo and text of the game they not best version to buy ur unboxing are a bit to fast need to make pause for see well hey i just bought the ps4 version of this and the bubsy paws on fire from your ebay listing that makes 4 games ive gotten from you so far you can ship them together to save postage wont lie this look cringe xd ive never played an atelier game before could i start with this one and still enjoy it understand the story ps4 will always look much better than the switch version but this is an improvement bummed out that theres apparently no english dub i was super hyped to see a lot of original characters return but not hearing them in their english voices like im used to really lessens the experience sad imo bruh how can this shit be for 104 can any1 tell me what the fun point of this game ive never play this series before and it looked interesting omg this looks amazing im so happy they did a good job with the switch version shame theyre moving away from sprites during conversations i can only hope 3d models get good enough to be indistinguishable its not quite there yet is it just me or all the girls there have the same face their difference just their dress and hair who did rorona get together with though mmh damn you can recolour the boots to black if only those boots had heels as well shame man i hope gust makes some traditional rpgs soon still feeling an empty hole where atelier iris mana khemia and ar tonelico used to be ive never played any of these games before do you think i could hop right into this one and be okay will we get this game in an english dub like atelier sophie or atelier rorona looks great i cant wait to play it day one purchase for me on the switch if this character is the daughter of rorona im curious who the father is im getting the game on ps4 but wanted to say it looks like gust has the game looking just as good now on switch the visuals load times are incredible on nintendo switch hey look its emilia can i ask something did they make a low graphic setting not like lydie where is the horse definitely a huge improvement over lydie and suelle looks amazing in handheld i hope they patch lydie and suelle because it still runs crappy in handheld holy fuck theres a demo wait it says trial version but is nowhere to be found on the eshop atelier games ive always hated cos of the timed thing but their still ok thank goodnes the characters dont look blurry and the textures arent bland like in the switch version of lydie suelle i will get this when it comes out for sure holy shit ty i dont understand what are they saying but hey i really really want to play this game only 360p wow what an amazing review for a game ive never seen does the game ever mention anything about what became of gino it feels laggy when shes running or walking or turning the camera its not included on your review i hate the time change ive never heard of this series and it looks like amazing rpgs which one do you think is better to start with on switch this series really needs to get the attention it deserves can i pick this up if i havent played the previous ones hows the challenge is there any difficulty setting available how is the loading screen and i am interested just because the time limits adopted daughter oh for crying out loud i was eager to find out who her father was they really just didnt wanna imply that rorona had sex with anyone i bet the seasons passes are probably just kt imposing a quota on gust because their two mainstream releases were massive fuckups gg kt you hack frauds disorienting godamn games when they release a title every month you know for certain the quality will be bad what is what where to begin if some people have trouble placing ff games in the right order these are even worse does this game have an english voice option ive always preferred playing the atelier games with english audio i havent played the newest series of games but i heard that some of them dont have an english voice option is it the same with this one while i love this series im not going to justify 80 to get the full experience i like the atelier series but annual releases dlc season passes is too much for me needs more time in the oven imo to be worth that what if i havent played arland is it still worth getting what id like to know is has this game been censored on the ps4 or not thats all i really care about cuz sony sucks and nintendo a fucking homie i would love to try one of these games but they all look so cheap and careless as if the developers dont even care just pump one out ever year and if the developers dont care i dont think i should either glad the review is positive but not sure if i want to play this game on the ps4 any longer but i dont have a switch either i like these games but the time limits always stress me out for some reason lol i always feel like im playing the game wrong very interested in this one not having time limits the interrupt feature sounds very neat too i think ill pick this up after work today should i play the first 3 games before this one thank you very much for your review good review thanks great review thank you even tho i bought the game already lolglad there is no time limit at all gotta pay for totori and meruru pass bet you cant even play as sterkenburg i will buy it it looks amazing great review cool i just recieved my switch collectors edition yesterday but i havent played it yet good to know its been done well i love this series thanks for the review ive never played an atelier game before do you think i could hop into this game enjoy it without any knowledge of the previous games are the dlc characters only available through season passes or can they be purchased individually thanks for the review great job 320 how much space is between the legsyou dont buy this for the graphics thats for sure im looking forward to ryza i play mostly on switch right now for these types of games for pc i like to just stick to games that push the graphics over there because its a bonus to have mobility in my current state of life that being said if you do get the chance id love to see a graphics comparison for ryza i noticed a huge quality shift with nelke the switch version seems to lack a lot of graphical details or maybe its my imagination pc always better than any of console thats why im always buy from steam rather than other consoles xd can do it side by side for better comparison great video why did you say you wouldnt want to buy the ps4 version of this game just curious so you are telling me they actually did a good job with portable mode sold at least its not like atelier firis on vita maybe you must comparison with ps4 and pc or ps4 and switch i want to support the 3rd on nintendo switch and gust makes a great progress in lulua switchs pitiful spec is due to the limitation of current silicon industry and it serves as the only portable choice for traditional games anyway if they support multiplatform cross save i dont mind to buy multiple versions luluas run animation feels a bit strange to me like shes running underwater pc master race the two shadow thing is actually ambient occlusion which appears in the whole scene instead of characters feet just look at the object corner and youll spot them their implementation isnt too good tho also pc version has reflection on floor in the dungeon scene so i guess its the same here as for the neptunia games get the deluxe packs for console for the plushies and stuff and get the pc version to play it i heard the pc version is quite bugged i am new to the series and just started rorona year 1 almost over i was wondering if i can play lulua after or if i should just play totori and meruru first i have those two since i got the bundle but looking at lulua it seems like a really lovely game so im excited to try it just dont know if its wise to go roronaluluatotorimeruru perhaps characters and plot points introduced in totori and meruru will be in lulua also having a hard time deciding on the switch vs the pc version i do want the game to look as good as it can yet on the other hand i would love the limited edition you unboxed because it looks so darn nice is it still available in the eu very nice video can agree that a gtx 970 can run almost all recent games yeah it does support higher resolutions in fullscreen i play lulua at 1440p the other atelier pc ports function the same way i like graphics comparison videos do more maybe a senran kagura one would be fun especially stuff like shinovi vs on the vita versus pc theres probably a huge framerate difference there also some games like fateextella have lower enemy counts on the portable versions normally i dont talk about the same game two videos in a row uh neptunia this is a big step up from atelier lydia and soliel on switch which ran like hot donkey doodoo you can use a thing called dsr to run games at higher resolutions that what your monitor can handle basically allows you to run a game at for example 4k then it gets downsampled to 1080p isnt gust own by koei tecmo yes theres a ps4 version but i dont own it and honestly i dont really wanna buy it either i might be just imagining it but man so much emotion in that delivery love it graphics comparison of neptunia shooter please im just kidding unless you actually want to in which version can i pet lulua a la senran kagura what are your pc specs im a nerd the pixelated edges is known as aliasing the switch seems to lack antialiasing or at least doesnt have a very good implementation also it looks like they might be covering up some draw distance with depth of field in the same cutscene as the book 024 attaboy personnal opinion the game looks great on switch people should matter the gameplay is the same and really enjoyable i put 13 hours in the game in 2 days and i cant stop playing buy it i think a ps4 pro vs pc comparison would be interesting jesus im the first person who gave a like to this video im suprise nice video btw keep up the good work another thing is in 5 years when your 3rd switch broke into a thousand tiny little pieces and they dont sell em anymore youll still play your steam version just fine with the new pc you just bought this was extremely useful for me i was debating on getting the pc port of the atelier games but wanted to see the differences whilst they arnt the most significant i know i would enjoy the games more on pc greats stuff as always ysn i am stuck on cheaper 3 how you get past that please help hey im stuck on chapter 8 do you know where i can find nostalgic spice is this a demo hey ftwrthtx have you tried an option in the settings where you can resize the game to fullscreen settings sound and screen display area settings max this out helped to get lydie suelle on real fullscreen for me without the black borders sorry i missed this one homegirl looks real cute though great review and video putting atelier lulua on my amazon wishlist great review im going to buy it on the nintendo switch all for one one for all plus ultra i just wish they put a guy as the main antagonist why does it always have to be a female alchemist first its great to see a new fresh review format from you also this game definitely on my wishlist now dont have this one on ps store brazil why tt arland isnt that the town in king of the hill even ficus is afraid nice another great addition for my nintendo switch untouched poetic license collection is this game censored is so than no buy on ps4 im so happy i have a pc i miss the experimental jrpg thing they did with the atelier iris games the games are still fun sometimes but mostly it just feels like waifu bait cant this be an open world xd or like sao are there any ps4 for i dunno 5 bucks i seriously want to i feel like this series is overrated because of so many entries gust should do a another unique game like blue reflection i wish i had a ps4 as always minimum effort was put into animation and graphics for your average anime game animmmmme games even tho i havent got a ps4 ive played the atelier games since the ps2 they have mostly been lightheaded jrpgs but this one looks pretty impressive the series looks to be more grown up and more open ended the atelier games have always had ups and downs i know the 20 hour time limit has been abandoned multiple titles ago i usually dont look to run through a game right away i like to pace myself and see the ambiance of the game i just hope this game isnt heavy on fetch quests that turned me off from atelier shellie i love playing rpgs the longer the game with great depth and large variety of things to accomplish is something i enjoy im trying to get every atelier game ever made including all 3 ps3 hd remaster on ps4 i know i have to import from japan but completely worth it i would like to see atelier ayesha remastered on ps4 or switch or both i like the game a lot but the 20 hour time limit has to go i thought the atelier series would have died years ago because they usually arent big sel im glad i met atelier game underrated but it satisfy my weebness for romance and slice of life rpg genre eventhough romance part is little but it was there im prepared for another 100 hrs to make complete gameplay a very under rated game the atelier series looks comfy im gonna play this on swtichbecause 1 its portable and 2 its probably isnt censored wish gust would make a similar game with older characters their art is beautiful but the characters are too younglooking join our atelier series group on ps4 fellow atelier fans me father i want a ps4 father sure son me wakes up lol hai sony plis ad facebook app on ps4 and live stream from fb like youtube twitch plisss so i never got into these alchemist games which one do i start with looks beautiful as ever thanks to kishidasans artwork just wish there were more playable characters from previous arland entries like astrid gio pamela mimi cordelia rufus and melvia that a nice game to buy on switch or steam not on censorstation 4 male protag when how come there no english dub for this playstation can you ask vr chat put it in playstation please never say this series bored game atelier always the best for soft gameplay atelier sophie the alchemist of the mysterious book was the best one and its been dropping in quality with every sequel sadly i love atelier but i miss the 2d art plus this looks like a psp game come on make atelier awesome and sony port grand phatasm on ps4 already i am so in love with this series really but i do wonder if it would be possible to get a remake of some of the old games from the ps2 atelier iris 2 the azoth of destiny was my favorite looks like a game small girls would play just missing barbie in the titel i hate this game its for girls dslike does cordelia make a comeback in this one if not i think ill pass id love to play these games but im not giving money to koei tecmo between their obscene monetisation practices and being too cheap to dub mlse of their games theyve lost all my respect to anyone who gets this get it on switch its most certainly censored on ps4 dear playstation will the playstation 5 have better super sampling or 4k rendering like can i get 8k super sampling and can i watch 4k and 8k movies using super sampling because that really big deal to me because i dont want throw away my 3d tv speaking of 3d will the playstation 5 still have a 3d player that and pc fans have a way to play all there games in 3d so why cant us playstation fans have thiswill the playstation vita be updated to link to the playstation 5 i really want the playstation 5 the greateat and most equipped console on the marketplease and thanks playstation bring on the sony censorship if you close your eyes you can actually hear sophie screaming gawd another one finally not a port from a smartphone game censored by sony i dont play these games but i watch them on youtube the game would be best on the switch possible uncensored version lulua is adopted by rorona enjoy the game waifu material game approved someday when i get a ps4 i want that game too for ps4 but not for psv atelier el was the only one ive played well that i actually liked enough to finish how much content is censored projared cant wait to get his hands on this i loved atelier iris trilogy and mana khemia ill play this so many games so little time love the atelier series they really change the game style since atelier iris days so whats censored why do all girl anime characters have to sound like little babies i see lulua mmmemilia thats you i ate a massive salad for dinner and now my poops are indescribable i am so disappointed that this game is not getting an english dub i want all these anime games but im too broke matsuokas everywhere rule 34 is on the way waifu trash game take my money i only played sophies arc are these the same timeline

3652 27 song of trees and water 3850 28 primula im both a lumberjack and professional bear trainer but i cried like a little bitch theyre making these games on a conveyor belt honestly not a single bad track so looking forward to playing this game all the classic gust composers came together and outdid themselves does anyone knows which one its the final boss theme i still appreciate that your uploading atelier ost into one its nice since the atelier series isnt too known in the west the editing is good as well keep it up lulua chasing stars chorus ver 023516 sounds like a soundtrack from nier automata i could get lost in this soundtrack 3 thanks for uploading awesome sis this is the kind of video i need because its been so looobg time since i play atelier series rpg thanks for the detailed guide never play those games on easy you gather better materials on higher difficulties is this game anything like zelda because i dont like those games too many puzzles for me lol watching your reviews are turning me on to new games so thank you for this im a dude can i still play this i like jrpgs this is a great video i received atelier lulua as a birthday present yesterday and i wanted it just because it was cute but i didnt really know what to expect after seeing your video i am so excited to play it seems so sweet and fun plays like the earlier atelier games you say im glad you have said this because i was unsure about getting into the new games ill have to pick this up i love your channel i cant believe you dont have more subs gust is making a rpg based on the manga and anime series fairy tail that means more people are likely to look into their other works including atelier valkyrieaurora has a really good series of videos about the atelier games shes my goto for all things atelier thank you for the awesome review i am now convinced to buy the game in terms of over world etc it seems similar to say final fantasy tactics but with exploration and the obvious combat difference would this be accurate you know this series is great and all knowing that i played atelier sophie but jesus are you responsible to become stronger manually i dont have anything against the games but i really dont like the fact that i have to go in the mixer and find all the good items to merge with thats why i am stuck in the library in sophie i am not strong enough this i need to get have you played the tales of games if so what do you think of them my first one was tales of xillia and boy was i hooked i collected every game after that haha im glad you said it was the best place to start i really want this game but was concerned about where to start ill definitely be picking it up soon i think your channel is going to be bad for my pocket i have seen so many games that i wouldnt have picked up if it wasnt for your reviews this is the best review ive seen of this ive been really curious about these games but thought it was far too expensive for a game i hadnt heard of im going to buy it this weekend i read the description and lulua is on the xbox this review is spot on i am a newcomer to the series and made the switch thanks to this video i already have lydie suelle lined up to play next i am addicted to this gameplay just ordered the physical version after watching your review and now i rewatch your video again and again because i cant wait it also is my first game from the series i hope i like it so i can buy all the other atelier games atelier ryza is coming pre order now available the game looks rather fun however the price is absurd got the game but still havent beaten the trilogy just beat rorona slowly making my way hi icha i love your channel esp when u make a video about the farming simulator games keep it up only here cuz youre really hott you know shes saying the game name wrong synthesize is she brewing electronic music xd not much for jrpgs not even a big fan of final fantasy except 15 and 12 which had open combat where you were free to move around and could run around enemies im just not too into trying to go to a location for a quest and haveing to waste 10 minutes on random encounters so was this a new port to the switch i didnt catch if you said so or not if you ever go back to reviewing all console games ill resub im just tired of these channels that jump on hype bandwagon and only focus on switch this game looks so pretty 0 this game has one of the strangest magic items i have ever seen in a video game a magic book only lulua why because it smacked her in the face lol im not sure how i feel playing as a plastic doll looking main character and i hate crafting so probably not for me but good review ircha this is a chiiiiiiickan kinda game grate video ive not played any of these game i guess they slipped my radar but now seeing it its probably not for me my wife will love it however i play a lot of rpg games but this one just dont jump out at me like xenoblade or finial fantasy fire emblem dragon quest etc ill pick it up for my wife and probably have a look at it just out of interest soooo i can play this game without the other three im not new here im missing the english dub for these games but im used to japanese dub i probably turn down the vocies noticed any stutter in the game im oblidged to get this at some point this lady is so beautiful the game looks like a typical generic cut and paste jrpg it looks like it belongs on the vita i always prefer loud voices quiet music i hate it when there isnt individual sliders theyre still using the same dead engine hi ircha love how you sold me the game definitely going to buy it once i finish the first arland trilogy beautiful as always ircha xx love the vids keep up the great work darl xx this is it im doing it ircha im taking the deep dive into this series after finding your channel by looking into this series however long ago that was im finally coming full circle and getting into this series it will be my actual first atelier game since i was never actually able to decide which one to buy first if you say this is the one this is the one im trusting you im so excited ive heard of the atelier series but havent picked one up this video is doing a good job convincing me to try this game in the series lulua is definitely showing signs that atelier is going in a good direction if only the english dub was back i didnt really like the music either it wasnt bad but it was just ok once the free bgm pack drops i will set my battle music to royal blue from atelier judie great review btw cool too sexy in the thumbnail with lulua compared to lydie which one do you enjoy better thanks for the newcomer explanation these games catch my eye more and more as you talk about them i really need to make time for them not i never heard of this series however after surfing through your videos over the past few days i have come to the conclusion that we have very similar game tastes bright colours check good story check hate rouguelikes check loves cutesy sim experiences check i guess this means im going to have to try this game out this one would convince me to buy a switch ten years ago but today i only can stick to casual mobile games awesome review loving this game so far instant subscribed because of the great well in depth reviews for many of your videos i just downloaded this game on the switch and its my first atelier game and i love it so far easy to understand and very fun gameplay it looks beautiful on switch damn i didnt menage to get trough the arland trilogy and lulua is already out i need longer days d great review this will be my first atelier game to play id like to see a game with a main character inspired from sandor clegane which wakes up in a fantasy world and starts screwing up the entire said world by humanizing all the characters heya ircha awesome vid as always love your accent and humour ordered my copy of lulua for the switch the order will ship together with persona q2 d a very girly game one for the female switch players me thinks unless there are any men who are playing this ooh cool i wanna try never heard of this game before thanks for the great review so glad to hear you liked this one after the previous atelier game that you hated although that one to be fair was a spinoff while these games do feel a bit rough on some aspects one thing the atelier series definitely has going for it that sets it apart is its gorgeous shoujo watercolour artstyle which is what drew me in initially it is as you say beautiful i dont know how to feel about the high pitched japanese voices though i guess they are fitting in this cute universe but lets just say there is a reason i cant watch anime in japanese nice review your reviews always make me smile because you can tell you really enjoy the games you like i like the atelier series because they are addicting and the characters are designed very cute also the more slice of life nature of the games is relaxing and a nice break from when im playing bloodborne and dragons dogma or skyrim thanks for the review i have my copy but havent started playing yet for me personally this is the best review of atelier lulua lydie and suelle was my first in the series i was pulled by that game when ai watched your review of that game now im being pulled againthis will be the beginning of my atelier journey haha i love your reviews i was really waiting for your review of lulua nice job on the video im glad youre enjoying this great atelier game its slowly becoming on of my favorites of the series on a replay ps4 or switch i cant decide with this one i preordered the game from best buy and they delivered it through ups ups sucks and rarely delivers games on release date even worse they delivered it to the wrong address and because someone signed for it i cant even get best buy to send me a new copy so i am stuck waiting a week to a month before i can even play this game sorry for the rant hahah this was an awesome video i love your little dances haha they were cute anyway keep up the awesome energy and i hope to see you soon i hope to see your review on dragons dogma when it comes out idc about this game i care about your face hehe i ordered this yesterday from best buy this video literraly put me in a good mood oh gosh you are slowly convincing me to buy one does atelier lulua have time management by the way very useful review good job whoop whoop mark just before i started studying can you make an overall video comparing all of the atelier games since you adore this series so we can know which game is for which type of gamer keep it up 3 thanks for another good review so excited to play this game thanks for the review i have not played any of this series and watching your reviewi am hooked payday tomorrow cannot arrive soon enough is that the game sony censored by zooming in so you wouldnt see her legs i recently started playing dragon quest 11 and its kind of my first dragon quest game ever and this game looks amazing it connor reminds me of dragon quest 11 just with a girl which i think is awesome i mean more power to when theres females protagonist hey irchop how r u thank for the amazing review im decided to buy this game but im waited your review and your review really makes me want to play it now but do you recommend buy it digitally or physically because i saw

everyone is having a blessed day great job on your review wait rorona had a daughter good song 023 lol she teleports seriously thinking of getting this one but i cant decide weather to get it for switch or ps4 nice game so far but i played it safe and got it for the nintendo switch didnt want soyny censoring even the slightest hint of fanservice plus the portability option is nice as well for the 12 year old girl in all of us this game looks great and good animation have some great story but i dont know about any about this game is under fanservice or not that game is nice gust it would be great if you could buy stuff for motion capture animations seems so old now is there still that timeday management bs in this one i wish if you put better story in this series i do not know english much but i like atelier series gamesi have atelier arland series and atelier alchemist series this my next atelier cool waiting patiently for my copy to arrivepatiently gust and koei 3 hope you keep doing atelier games and bringing them to the west forever i wish more anime style games upgraded the graphics to current gen love playstation when your mom said shed be right back and you had to pay off her debts back in trails of cold steel 2 when the war started the courageous began an independent operation right before the heimdallr was occupied since the noble alliance is up to no good victor entrusted towa to take command of the courageous making class vii started their journey since trails to azure final chapter is based on act 2 the awakening lions entirely enough said as for lulua however totori gave this atelier business license normally cordelia was in charge in the adventurer guild even she uses a gun as a weapon but this sure ayesha uses someone else house to place the cauldron to make items while sophie gave atelier tent to firis after she made an atelier tent back then now lulua has an atelier but in act 2 the awakening lions of trails of cold steel 2 towa has more experience than lulua since she the student council president in thors as well as the captain of the courageous when the civil war begun even she got an art gun made by zeiss central factory while lulua hey im having trouble with the barrel bomb i cant max out the fire i have two more bars to max out and for some reason i cant i need some help do i need to play any of the other games to understand this i hope you want to be an alchemist cool giveaway 3x 20 nintendo eshop gift card enter to win httpsgooglzhnrvw top upcoming switch games for 2019 triple a httpsyoutubefx7fretc730 racing

translate please i got a fever and the only thing that can cure my fever is more uploads thank for playing this game great video i love atelier series and i just started playing this game its amazing game and so colourful and i loved the main characters i watched all atelier rorona videos in your channel and i wished that you continued atelier totori and meruru too i dont know why but the oooh at 43 seconds in makes me automatically want this game i love arland series since meruru its got me to play atelier games so you are a totori fan uh well i like more rorona x ty it was a good review d atelier ryza the queen of eternal darkness and the secret hideout looks great i want to see more about atelier exited to play this i really like atelier i would like gust to make nights of azure 3 as i prefer those games over atelier but i am exited to try this game out i kind of wish youd include what console the game is on in the beginning since your reviews r long and often sell me on a gamefranchise before its finished knowing if id even be able to play the game to begin with would help i know google is my friend but that does require a bit of searching on my part i think mentioning what console its on would help immensely anyway gr8 review looks like a very cute game keep up the good work loving your videos do you have to have any knowledge of the other games to get the story how i can destroyed the rock in the mine i am stuck here heeeeelllpppp this game sure loves to eat away at my time instead of progressing through the story i instead create the best item with the best traits while making the quality as high as possible and that can take hours i completed everything but idk how to craft that certain caliber i am stuck in the same place where can i find materials to craft this quality i have to be level 50 for that dam im behind the first one is to craft a 35 quality of the craft item not just any item the bomb with spikes on it im kinda confused about the pearl one am i supposed to craft the mining bomb into destruction lvl 2 if it yes how to find the material i crafted everything i can with quality 35 but it still wont trigger the 2nd one of 31 am i missing something which one does it requires quality 35 i craft stuff with higher quality but im still stuck love jrpgs i am sucker for them i just love everything about them what do you think about this atelier game so far wt if you change lulua to center you will get 2 assist attack from both eva and piana ancient technical civilization hey bro olgerium u rmb the chapter to get this item this game

the only dissapointment is we cant visit totoris hometown mimi changed doensnt look good as the 3rd arland ep i love lulua i glad i played meruru as well i beat meruru twice once pc and ps3rpcs3 is anything mentioned in the game about what became of gino jrpg jungle does sterk ever age hes like 60 years old now isnt he xd he still looks like hes in his 30s just wanted to share some jrpg gaming news with you httpwwwgunghoonlinecomnewsgrandiahdcollectionfornintendoswitchtmgrandiahdremasterandgrandiaiihdremasterforpccomingsoon httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvh70gmh6f8lq i was considering linking the individual sources but its easier to link video since i dont know if his links contain all the info just downloaded it ready for it to be finished good video tara i hope that one day youll try out the dusk trilogy between your and valkyries atelier videos ive finally decided to get into the series i think ill start with the arland trilogy and then pick up lulua as soon as it goes from 90 to like 60 im afraid to watch this since i have lulua but havent played it yet dont want to spoil the story and that never know what to aspect that a new game brings excellent video ive just gotten into atleier because of your videos on this series ive never heard about it prior to your channel thanks i got spoiled on this so wont be buying this shame tbh i picked this up day one on my switch and i am enjoying every minute of it i have played all of the arland titles and i am definitely enjoying this one the most i do love all of them though thank u for taking the time to make all of your videos as u have become my go to for jrpg reviews know i want atelier on the switch much as i love the arland trilogy or perhaps because of it i just cannot bring myself to play this without an english dub because im too attached to the voice castplus theyve gated off totori and meruru behind season passes and that is unforgivable glad youre enjoying it though thanks for the video im starting to think youre becoming atelier all knowing master i nominate you to do did you know gaming atelier series fun spotlight thanks for the time these quality videos take to edit an script an upload have a fun weekend i gathered the dragonballs my wish is that all women age like anime girls my thoughts on the arland series are decent i thought rorona dx was a nice breeze with decent characters i hated totori dx overall i enjoyed meruru dx about the same as rorona and from what ive played of lulua its a nice entries in the arland series still wishing the series would go back to the iris mana kehmia style since it was so much better i dont if i will ever play this since i never played the original and it looks like they wont stop pumping out these game any time soon i cringe everytime i think how much it will cost to buy every single game from this series ive been wanting to get in the series so im saving up for the arland pack on switch yall ready for the thicc new mc ive only played totori on the vita but it made me smile seeing totori in lulua she best garland gurl x3 thinking about it i find it a bit odd that arland of all trilogies got a 4th entry when there are others that need an extra game to wrap things up mana khemia especially but that aside it is nice to revisit arland one last time and see characters from all 3 games so grown up and how the world itself has evolved since roronas debut as a lover of the arland trilogy lulua is a warm welcome if random entry season pass aside and i hope that past trilogies that can use a new entry get them im always down for more atelier and i cant wait to play lulua eventually and the eventual coming of raiza on the horizon ive just started to get into rpgs from getting octopath traveler on the switch then i saw this game and god i want it but getting all the games is gonna make me go bankrupt a girl reviews a game made for girls would this be a good entry game to the atelier series i love jrpgs but i havent played any ateiier games art works and music from the series caught my attention jrpgs game that i enjoy are the final fantasy series tales of series and persona i started with nelke then continued with lydie and sue now i can say im addicted to atelier and i just got the complete game and playing already got the early acces yay i didnt watch much to keep away from spoilers but this is a sequel to rorona you say also is it me or are the graphics much better looking than current titles i got sophie a while ago and was struggling a bit to get into it so thought about giving a different one a try i am a newbie but i want to buy this your video is well broken down and i hope to have fun no time limit hey i can finally play one of these games the biggest question i have to this game is how ronona is luluas mother i dont know who the dad is unless its someone we never heard of but it could be a church baby scenario you know rononas working in her workshop one night hears a knock at the door looks outside finds baby lulua in a basket at her doorstep no one in sight takes it in for the night but after spending time with her devolops a motherly bond with lulua decides to raise her theres always that possibility you say there is no time limit but i still see the month and day there i want to get through the arland trilogy set before playing lulua pretty sure i played some of rorona before it seems familiar but i definitely want to get this one the visuals are so damm low quality come on we live in a world were persona 5 devil may cry v and re2 remake exist is roronas husband sterk finally i can play as emilia lulua reminds me of her mother though its heartwarming they added funny comedic atmosphere and silly stories i cant wait for this game will be preordering a physical copy in the next few weeks for sure thanks for your opinion im a big jrpg fan just got my copy of lydie suelle for the switch i wish i liked the design of lulua better for me atelier went downhill real fast after sophie i just hope this ones good i love your channel do you know about the dlc ive been very nervous towards koei tecmo because of the recent lydie game with a season pass costing more than the game itself does this game have one as well i actually stopped buying any atelier games after ive been burned with far too much dlc thanks wow just found your channel love it already so theres no time limit like lydie and sue cuz that means i can take it real easy and take my time to enjoy the game im really hyped to play the english release even though i havent played the older arland series i love your voice seriously good review im just wandering who is rorona husband i loved playing the original arland games when they came out on ps3 i also preordered this game as soon as i heard it was coming out how does it compare to the mana khemia sideseries those are some of my favorite ps2 games and ive always hoped to have another game similar to them i wasnt that much enticed by the dusk serie but another chapter of arland defenitely a buy i cant wait to see rorona again she was my favorite charakter 409 they see me rollinthey hatin man i really miss games line mana khemia ar tonelico and atelier iris games well written review subscribed 3 the only differance i notice was on the draw distance shadows and maybe resolution gust has knock it out of the park on the switch with this release and i hope the continue with this standard going forward i finally decided to give the atelier series a try i only have switch no ps4 ill start with lydie suelle hope its alright to get familiar with the series if i start with that entry im a huge atelier fan yet i never got to play rorona and down except mana khemia 1 o mana khemia was my first game ever from them and i later found out atelier torori existed in a shop i was in and had no idea it was the same developers i just got enchanted in the alchemy now i dunno if rorona is too good to this day but im so happy to try out lulua d piana playable o must have and that crazy girl using a gigantic shuriken hellz yeh h seeing the switchps4 versions back to back makes me wanna get the switch version more though it would feel so weird since ive played all ateliers except the book trilogy on their respective consoles i do like that it feels like arland while still modernizing the elements and keeping whats familiar to the veterans hopefully its a good mix of old and new while still feeling fresh totori and roronas remake are my favorite arland games meruru overall felt too overwhelming for me and im greatly interested in lulua after finishing the dusk trilogy recently might give this a go and then get the book trilogy later thank you for the impressions they help a lot in my decision will subscribe mana khemia will always be the best ones love it im so excited for this title as both the arland trilogy and its artist mel keshida were amazing together all games since other than escha logy havent really clicked with me thanks for sharing this video already have the switch version preordered also looking forward to nelke coming out later this month the arland trilogy meruru specifically were definitely my favorite games of the atelier series looking at the greatly enhanced visuals of lulua i am super excited for this game lulua looks positively adorable waitdidnt rorona get turned into a kid im gonna need some answers lol i had never heard of this series before but i found the demo last week on the japanese switch eshop gave it a try and really liked it im getting atelier lydie suelle this month and ill be getting the full version of lulua when its released here in may just started playing atelier games this year and after i get to finish meruru ill wait for this one instead of moving on to ayesha hey can you or someone else confirm that this game will be localized for north america if yes i will definitely buy this game im so happy fans are going back to arland im getting nelke first unfortunately the armand series wasnt my favorite i love them though still my favorite is the dusk series but maybe if i played the repolished versions ill get a better perspective you ever just want to hug a video game seriously this game is both adorable and totally gorgeous i cant wait for this one do you know if this demo is available on the ps4 japanese store yet im so glad they didnt use the time limit system i think these games need to be more relaxing and the time limit had me stressing out in the old games did you get nelke or planning to get it ive been playing through it and while theres time management and resource management it seemed fairly simple except where i currently am at i have heard that if you play thorugh to the end you can continue playing that save forever i have game overd before and you get a clear save with a bit of a bonus for second playthrough that makes it easier to complete the game i was careless i was planning to get it on ps4 but looking at comparsions might as well get the switch version is there a frame rate difference holy shut now i want to play it soooo badly astrid is the father if sterk isnt her dad im gonna be lowkey salty why are the parents in atelier games always away from their kids lol lulua youre 17 now so as logic of our world i must go half way around the world and miss out on your life alright good luck and try not to die i would like to see an atelier game with a family that isnt broken xd hooray no time limit i couldnt get into the arland games because i felt pressured to complete quests in the most boring way possible all the fun things like adventuring and alchemy cost time so i felt pressured to just buy the needed items to complete quests which is very unsatisfying 3 person party is a deal breaker for me glad to hear lulua has the modern conveniences of the later atelier titles since i wasnt the biggest fan of the arland trilogy ill certainly give this a go when it releases in may looks good good video jrpg this looks interesting currently playing lydie and suelle still need to play meruru totori sophie firis goddammnit i cannot wait to play lulula and nelke how you level up becuse i am at 1 someing on my level up did you have to blow the door to get that far how you do that thank you so much for your guide series for dragons heart go to arland in december and buy something called dragon piece for 5000 anyone having luck finding boa gland cant make the poison and cant for the life of me find it i dont remember fighting any snakes do u have a guide for the final black page in the riddle in the first one when it says fine sand it wants you to synthesize a sands of time with 101 quality another typo probably its 30 uses for the terra bomb in case someone wants the exact numbers can someone help me please i made olgenrium that 101 quality and its not working i made it like 15 of them and still nothing im sooo confused does using the tonic in an area to increase the item quality help with the traits they carry nelke the legendary alchemist playlist if you are interested atelier spinoff game httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplciuxkb2dsvpzodh54hggsfyjfvmt8xwb looking forward to getting into this game its great so far d this is probably the best looking atelier game graphically the models look more detailed than previous games the book reminds me of plachta too the book part does remind me of atelier sophie i wonder if that book is where lulua will learn most of her alchemy recipes lulua is probably short for the last part of her first name elmerulia rs and ls sound the same in japanese the giant bird flying by reminds me of ash seeing hooh in pokemon evas smile is scary where does she pull the cannon out from and why does she need a bomb i wonder if there is more to mana than meets the eye yess youre playing it now xd i gotta give you a round of applause for pronouncing all these names miss back in the ps1 ps2 days before voice acting we all just pronounced things as best we could like all the names in the final fantasy games xd looking it up i cant believe theres been 20 atelier games wow ive played the atelier iris games which where more action turn based but this is beautiful the last few seemed to be named and based on a certain character right lulua sounds a little like that kizuna ai this seems like the perfect relaxing game for you nice miss youve got your anticipated game im not sure whats wrong i am alchemy level 50 and made the gamma 999 quality several times but i cant pass it do you have any idea where i can get the trait ancient power any idea when you will update gamefaqs with the right names for the equipment traits and how to create them did you unlock the boss fight im getting nervous that i might not get it xd the boss is another fight with mana shes stronger and forces you into a fight of all the series you do this is one of my favorites damni miss whale monster in arland i need to learn about the history of chemistry and alchemy i tried this just with the rapid interrupt not deadly shot sure shot confidently sauntering into the hills only to get my arse whooped whoops i wish id not accidentally used up my deadly shot before i realised how important it was from the dark area theres a treasure chest with an item there which always has deadly shot shakes fist at self some of the bosses are a lot easier than others to defeat im fine with the one which seems to award ghost orbs with divine mastery but some of the others are kicking my butt and im finding myself more and more in debt for item refreshing good technique though i just wish i could get the deadly arts trait this video helped me a lot i was short on cash thank you i am still struggling with deadly art and mortal blow i tried many times still not working do i have to beat the game or what i am on final chapter and final boss i am on level 76 final boss is impossible to beat traits make me feel annoyed and make my brain headache please help me thanks i already made my first 999 black supplementmedicine base now im ready to spread it and register all the synth items i also found out you can do every advancedbasic alchemy riddle tasks as early as chapter 9 for chapter 111 everything except the main part some are possible in 8 but i did all of them in chapter 9 this is when i did the quality exploit thank you i finally got platinum because of this i leveled up to 100 in like 20 seconds haha for anyone thats confused for some reason it wont allow you to combine up to mortal blow on a bomb you have to make the trait ons omething else and then move it to a bomb i try to combine sure shot and half critical and they wont combine i was looking through my basket and found deadly art on a dicine iron piece so i guess you can get it from gathering im still halfway through ch9 btw edit after thinking about it theres a chance i mightve gotten it from a white chestjust found out that you cab get them from white chests so ignore the comment only when you beat the game though how you level up a lot how did you manage to fit 95 tp into one omega craft thank you so much deadly art is grayed out when i try to combine it with sure shot do both traits have to be on the same item the rabbits say 16k health and the bomb did 3k dmg on your vid how did they die from that is divine mastery transferable to supplements i know this may sound dumb but how do you obtain deadly art i have been struggling to get it for around 4 hours how are you getting so much moneyxp per battle i was getting around 12k xp and 6k gold on hard the traits are in the gold key boxes you only get one with the trait i like that lulua dress too looks fit cute perfectly wishingtikal great walkthrough wishingtikal cant wait for atelier ryza with its updated graphics and its been rated pegi 12the atelier series going dark this time what this game has done has basically explained those spin off games where you have characters from different series all in one game they just create the true dragon hourglass jump to a different universeso all the atelier games are connected in one multiverse so every atelier game ever created is cannon and no one can argue otherwise what have the atelier games taught me normal alchemy alchemythe science of understanding destructing and reconstructing matter however it is not an all powerful art to gain one must give something of equal value this is the law of equivalent exchange there is a taboo among alchemists human transmutation is strictly forbidden for what can equal the value of the human soul atelier alchemy create an immortal body and transfer souls mysterious sophie create entire un cool game i was afraid the frame rate would be as bad as in atelier lydie suelle thankfully this doesnt seem to be the case for this game i downloaded the japanese demo and im very impressed ill be picking up this one for sure i was kind of worried after playing lydia suelle but this game looks great and runs great good effort team wow not bad the team is finally figuring out handheld mode this is a massive improvement over every other switch game theyve released i think finally dropping the vita probably helped since theyre not stretching themselves so thin anymore well now i really want to play it x looks like it doesnt have time limit and its using the same engine that lidie and suelle how you make elixilr at and where you find it shes hard lol how much did you level up on this part this feels like the 4th atelier arland game i played all 3 armand series in my ps3 and the thing that annoys me is the time limit in the game which made me end up not completing the gallery i hope they change that in this game when she introduced her self i heard her say she is lulua illamera frixell roronas daughter luluas boobs are so perky instant boner inducing only atelier can create such wonderful waifus were getting a new arland entry the game looks so clean i gotta play this series 11139 there are cracks in spacetime alchemy in history ficus is my favorites character of this part by far duude thank you soo much for these guides you are awesome what jewelry store the only thing i have available are aterier meruru town hall pamelas shop and the inn did i do something wrong am i not far enough in the chapter or something how do i get the recipe for tanned leather i cant for the life of me find it anyways thanks for the videos really helpful is there a special way to get water tree fruit in the eternal spring cause ive search 92 of the place so far for the last few hours found every thing but that material toukiden 3 ultimate open world single player demo for the playstation vita and playstation and playstation store i love atelier and i get that most of the gameplay is synthesizing but still you could have picked a slightly more exciting gameplay video to show off at least we get to hear some of the beautiful soundtrack which i cant wait to hear more of im slowly accepting that we will never get english voice actors again for atelier its not a decision i agree with i dont mind jp voice but i have seen a lot more typos dry and literal translations in your sub only atelier releases still as long as we keep getting these games at all i guess i should count my blessings please dont let this series die gust deserves so much better than these lowquality localisations any one can explain whats the allure of these series thunder fire tehe i wonder on opposite elements like fire ice 24th of may cant come any soonerplease kte i absolutely cannot wait already wishlisted in my future favorite game d thanks ea i knew i could count on you i guarantee a season pass is on its way a shame those two costumes were locked behind preorderday one bs and are no longer possible to get hacking shenanigans aside of course i got the game the last weekend and im enjoying it so far good memories have flashed to me when i got to the chapter 2 and 3 from the previous 3 arland atelier games how did you change the clothers or how did you get them has anyone figured out ho to break the big rocks i assumed bombs but they dont work i watch the atelier mysterious games you heard of the forbidden alchemy right wishingtikal i love your work alchemy is amazing power im upset that this thing wasnt released on amazon or best buy or any other game or tech store in the usa show us your collection of physical japanese games im jealous haha you make great content and youre a fellow canadian have another sub i love this game all of my free time since it as released has been dedicated to lulua man i really want to get into the atelier series if only i had the money and time to do so at least i can watch your videos theyre just as good so you cant buy the lulua le in europe atelier ayesha is the best out of the series for me got the standard version my 4th atelier game while everyone is started playing i am still waiting on my copy from amazon canada and was going planning to give up until every other retailer sold out probably because i order on may 13 and you are also from canada how much did it cost you and any hassle ie import fees etc did rough exchange rate and got 135 cad and tempted to grab one if i wasnt for the fact that i am trying to save money because i keep throwing money at limited editions at least i managed to download the 2 early bird outfits onto my nsw because apparently you dont even need to own the game to download from the eshop i want my game too bad it wouldve cost me 110 to get the le including shipping otherwise i really wouldve gotten it thanks for showing it off 3 but i still really wanna get my hands on that poster lulua is just an absolute gorgeous girl 3 maybe im lucky and someone sells it on ebay or something that no one explained you got it i did not see that there was a limited edition well then it appears as though it works in canada but one question did nelke and the legendary alchemists have a limited edition as well this channel was nice but has become a weaboo top 10 anime kind of channel recently ill just show myself out bye 238 whats your favourite anime nis america also rerelease the first three arland atlier trilogy on ps3 on one disk it which i got into the series this series just doesnt grab me as much as other jrpgs probably because it focuses more on gathering and creating items the ps4 cover is different maybe nis is the distributer for koei tecmo and that might be why they make the limited edition atelier series where to start hint for next video hey at least i got another game for my switch about the slightly different cover art someone asked koei tecmo about it they said its because they wanted the logo of the game at the top of the cover instead of at the bottom they also said the reason is that if the logo was at the bottom it would be covered by most retail stores nah they censored horsekun because hes actually the final boss in the game oh in regards to the cover someone actually asked koei tecmo on twitter and they replied that due to western store shelves often favoring the game title logo being on the top of the image note the japanese version has the logo on the bottom so they had to move the artwork so the logo wouldnt be covering luluas face i wanna buy the standard variante but nearly 70 for this no thanks do you actually complete all these games in regards of atelier ayesha i remembered that the issue was that koei tecmo did not include japanese audio in the game for the ps3 just the english dub in the western release nice vid at least there is a game inside interesting video but i still wonder why there is no reversible cover as usual for nisa releases i dont think i will get this though because i only occasionally bought atelier games only own totori firis and sophie never really got into the concept of alchemy and all the repeated changes in game flow didnt make it better for me even though the ones i played were really cheerful and lighthearted which is a nice contrast to most jrpgs more dramatic plots and cute as well i want this but i also dont want my family to know im a weeb then again the first switch games i ever bought were the valkyria chronicles series so maybe they know ok and i may have all the neptunia games on my computeryeah they definitely know if im honest i really wish these limited editions would switch to including a usb stick with the music you can move onto your pc which you can use to put them onto your mp3 or phone i got the switch limited edition several days ago nisamerica is really good at delivering things on time i feel obligated to get the switch editions because i feel they have more value to them but everything within it is amazing i love collecting these collectors edition from nelke to lydie and suelle thanks for sharing this video the difference between the japanese and west cover has to do with the change of the logo from the inferior to the superior part of the image for shelves purposes the the image needed to be adjusted so the logo didnt go over lulua head are we able to dive into this switch version without playing the previous ones this video came about 3 minutes ago and hows the other guys comments is from 18 hours ago great video honestly this is a series i have been desperate to get into over the last few years i own all of the games from iris arland dusk and mysterious and honestly i just really havent been able to get into them yet i adore the music characters are super cute and the game play i know i should love but just havent maybe this could be another series for a where to start video but i gotta say im really upset that i cant get into one as i know fully well this is a series i would adore thanks for the great content as always ysn and i cant wait for your review i guess you should traveling another place for finishing quest basic open many material for help your battle wishingtikal will you please finish the ty the tasmanian tiger playthrough wow cool its here now 1 thing for sure in guts is in its cutscene glorious quality and music edit already fallen in love since the first atelier iris note that if you use anything that has a tp enhance of 5 or greater such as using a black supplement as your awakened element item you can use ultimate quality professional and quality up since that takes 65 tp for a total of 85 with ultimate quality and ultra quality alone however youre looking at 58 tp required for 80 quality your recommended setup of ultra professional and quality up are only a combined 65 increased quality for 59 tp though it can be done before you ever find the ultimate power trait and upgrade ultra quality so there is that in its favour just so you know quality release 2 lets you craft up to quality 500 on switch how you get to 999 how do the bombs with this thank you for this the awakening feature while great can get a bit confusing sometimes and ive been playing the atelier series since the very first one i have to say though this series just never gets stale youd think after 13 years theyd ran out of ideas on even just creating a new items to play with in the game but thats not the case at all atelier lulua is probably one of the best title in this franchise bringing back great relateable character surprisingly deep storyline and a slew of qol improvements for the title i cant wait for atelier ryza unfortunately most of this is completely over my head i can get the medicine base to 999 quality but i still dont understand how to use that to get other items to 999 quality from what i understand i need to use the medicine base to make a black supplement first no matter what i do i cant get the black supplement to 999 quality even using the 999 medicine base if i use two 999 medicine bases the item turns into a pollutant i need to use ice items to make it a supplement again but after that even when using the quality traits and the dark firefly booster it barely reaches 600 quality every time if i dont use ice items i need to use a different booster to raise the ice value which also cuts the quality significantly transferring effects so an item is treated as a different item type is also so far over my head i cant even begin to understand what i need to do even after watching this is buff consumable items affected by quality because on atelier lydie and suelle it does but i think in this one it does not thank you for your guide i have some question about omega craft that you suggest to build it is not possible to build omega craft with sure shot maxed fixed value damage and ultimate destruction trait right from your guide in gamefaq due to tp limit are you going to be doing a best weapons armour and accessories video as well figuring out all those combo traits this is probably even more useful then the riddle guides great video how to find more different water in this game im in chapter 4 but only have puni fluidclean waterand ointment water thanks for this i ended using hay and living rope but this looks a bit easier since you can use medicine base to make medicine base thanks thanks man cant wait to try this out i was lucky and had a bunch if angel charms equipped my first fight and with roronas increase all def attributes was able to win i still have yet to play this amazing fourth installment of the arland trilogywhich ill eventually get around to this game to add to my jrpg collectionbut right now im saving up for atelier ryza and i already have my hands tied full playing bloodstained curse of the ritualdragon quest 11 and blue reflectionlol alsoits great to see the dusk trilogy ayeshaecha and lodgy and shallie being rereleased in a remastered package collection soon and hopefully they also do the same for the mysterious trilogy sophiefiris and lydie suellep this review is quite organized i consider getting this game i love your reviews and i agree this game is really fun thanks for the review but is it on the switch i love this kind of games i love the graphics the environment looks awesome thanks for the review i suppose we can expect a review of atelier ryza someday that game will be released soon october 29 in america to be exact koei tecmo has been publishing these games very fast lately if we dont get a review of blue reflection at least i hope that you keep making review of the atelier games even though im not a fan and hey many people on resetera have already complained about the design of lila decyrus a new character in atelier ryza even though atelier games have had sexualized character designs in the past in fact ive been playing atelier firis lately and wow drossel really looks like an adult or mature woman as they say in the game even though she has short hair and as many people know she has large breasts in any case shes just one of many examples and although the atelier games arent exactly known for fan service unlike the neptunia games in one way or another fan service in the series is something that almost always has been there i admit 3 this series mayor fuglycool ive spent about 100 hours atelier lulua is a joy to play and has easily one of the best turnbased combat systems filling insolving the alchemy riddle felt both rewarding and justified as its a good way too unlock new locations some of which are from previous arland games and to grab some powerful recipes like na wooo yeah alchemy synthesis all the things i could listen to you all day long but honestly great review i have never finished an atelier game though yay new gg review d and wow a 1010 not interested in any of the older arland games due to their horrible time limits but im very interested in this one since we are free to play the game at our own pace but i think ill get it after ryza which looks like a huge stepup of the series and its relatively coming soon btw im curious what do you think of ryza so farare you excited thank you i really wanted to hear your opinion of this game like you i really liked this game the charackters the graphic and i loved the storry to see all the old charackters again and see them so mature was really cool and i really like that this game has no time limit i mean to explore all this dungeons was so much fun atelier lulua is one of my favorite atelier games so thank you for this video i am still waiting for the arland trilogy dx to be in sale on eshop before binging them then i will probably play a lot of them youtube needs to fix there notifications because i should be getting all ur videos anyway its ok lets gooo wow cool

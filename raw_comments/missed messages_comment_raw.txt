if you ever feel like the world is too much for you and that youre completely alone please believe me when i tell you that youre not youre never alone so please reach out to someone and get things off your chest my best friend shot himself 25 years ago everyone knew how depressed he was but he refused therapy and medication sometimes people are way further gone than you realize and as hard as you want them to heal its not enough the only good thing is that i know hes not in pain anymore thanks this helps im so so sorry shawnsorry i suck at spelling names and stuff im so sorry that you ever had to go through any of that stuff and same to everyone else i hope that everyone is okay rn im in a bad place ive watched this game 5 times now and its helping me so so much i hope that everyone lives a happy and healthy life and know your never alone this game hit me hard dude why am i same w may even writing and writing topic i feel like everyone has those type of days not matter what your doing who you are but there just days and they pass you can see this comment in a sea of so many but and think it just another but its not its a person with there own world when i came back home i felt cold nervous but i didnt know why ad gold fish flavor blasted aaaaahhhhh i felt cold nerv ad hey friend do you have taxes sure ya do heres turbotax ignore your roommate dying in the restroom i saw the scissors on the title page that when i predicted everything sad my dads dad my grandad killed himself when my dad was a kid ive grown up to develop mental health issues that have caused me to self harm and attempt suicide on a basis a lot of my family help me but my dad always says its selfish i can see why he thinks it is but at the same time i feel more selfish for forcing my family to have to deal with a brain that even i cant understand or control ive gone of all social media becuase it was maing me depressed i dont even use my phone anymore becuase of this great video i come back to this video all the time because it resonates with me so much i feel like may is all of the feelings i have that i dont say developed into a really beautiful character and i just cant describe how much i see myself in her and it makes me feel not normal it resonates with me because i see myself in a critical character but also in another critical character i know how it feels to lose somebody to suicide and how it feels to look for them in everybody ive met since them i dunno i feel kind of vulnerable and stupid for feeling this way ive actually been going trough a tough phase and kind of been dealing with self harming it might sound a bit stupid but this video actually helps me cope idk its stupid my friend tried to kill herself and i didnt see the signs i hadnt seen her in a while and thought about her and wanted to text her i didnt act on it because of my own mental blocks but after the next few days i saw a post on facebook from her mom talking about her attempt and how she is still alive because of her mother catching her i dont blame myself at all but i wish i would have talked to her that night i wish even though it was 1am that i would have just said something that even if she hadnt seen it until the next morning that it would have helped make her feel loved is someone grows distant from you reach out to them they might need it even if they were to ones to distance it might be for a reason she hadnt texted me in weeks and i thought it was because she didnt like me want to talk i am kinda a busy person i thought that i was just busy and forgot to text people not just her but she felt like all her friends hated her and didnt like her when its okay to hurt sometimes you just wanna hurt with someone ya know rewatching this fuck this is important the soundtrack is awesome in this game i think that alot of us needed jacks talk at the end i know i did at least i cant talk to my own mother anymore because i feel like ill do something wrong like they will find that one thing wrong with me that i over looked like my family doesnt care anymore i barely talk to my friends except for two who know exactly what is going on i wish that i had more people to talk to but sadly as a middle schooler in my little town the teachers dont offer help or anything else i just want to say that there will be a way out of this some how you will find a way to get better sometimes it may feel like its getting worse but you have to power through it im am sorry that this took a turn i have no idea what im talking about because im a dumbass as my so calledfriends called me if you need someone to talk to find a good friend or if you trust your parents talk to them once again sorry i love how hes so genuine about himself this meant so much to me it felt like you where in the room with me i really needed to hear this your the best this has literally been on my recommendation page for so long and i finally watched it u happy youtube thanks this really helped me as i have been experiencing these kind of issues myself this genuinely helped me and i cant express how glad i am for people like you me isnt looking at the screen jack mentions pride flags me reeeeeeee hecc yeh i dunno why but i thought this was gonna be mystic messenger this really helps me thanks sean i am the type of friend that will comfort you and listen to all your problems but the bad thing about this is that when i try to talk to my friends about my problems they switch the conversation around to talk about their lives and they never never listen to mine so now i dont even bother trying to talk to anyone because i think they wont listen to me i cant keep going on like this sitting in my room that i share with my sister crying my heart out every night i know she listens to my whimpering and sobs but doesnt say anything i even tried talking to my mum but she disregarded everything i said how do i fix this problem do you ever wonder if sean ever wonders if he has saved a life because he save mine thankyou i love you sean this is from jacksepticeyes you left me comment section from ray i feel like this should be somewhere in comment section because of the theme of

days ago i started my search of the game and searched far and wide for this for days and once i gave up i gave it one last try and looked all the way down my youtube history and found it im scared my friends going through something like this but much more serious and i want to help her get better but im so overwhelmed and nothing i say is getting to her ive convinced her against suiciding but im not sure itll hold out as shes already attempted it before help he didnt do the last ending we all are lights to each other dont hide it okay shaun this will be buried among all the other comments but i need to say that i really do appreciate all that you do for the community and also for yourself it is really strong and brave of you to play this game to talk about your own experiences and to share them with the world i hope that this video will help at least one person and if it does i would say that you should be incredibly happy for having saved someones life if this had been out back when i had my darkest days i could have been able to get help sooner to talk to someone and i do genuinely feel that someone will be helped by this video i love you for you shaun we all do if you need to take any time off take time off you need to focus on yourself in the first hand and there is nothing wrong with that keep doing what you love and we will keep loving you jack remember that the real fans care about you we love you and if you need to take a break do it just do what you need to we will just wait for you to come back and when you do we will see what you give us to watch love you and your videos i literally loved this game shes such a beautiful artist and ah this made me cry because i feel everything may says on their bed this is too true i cant stop crying ay i heard that shiloh dynasty in the background i swear i thought this was theres this girl legit was doing work and as soon as i heard gay my attention was fully focused on the video lmao im to gay for this i was gonna write a comment about my mental pain but it doesnt matter eventually i wont be able to know if you reply hell i wont even know if people think of me this sounds selfish but this comment is me screaming for help screaming for someone to stop this pain anyone else crying the minute may says harry potter fanfiction be my friend is it bad if i hurt myself cause i do it is it that bad thanks for showing up on my recommended sean i needed this when he started to tear up i started crying this video actually made me face my depression and seek out help its been a couple of months and i feel much better now because of this video i want the sound track to this game i genuinely enjoy listening to hank talk about real problems that people deal with especially when i can relate to them it reminds me that i am not alone at the end of the day youre only human and so am i ask for help you will get it 5000 welp he got me there thats me yes and lot of people i suppose i dont deserve any happiness i mean just like jack said everything is horrible in my life i tried killing myself so many times i even past july and august 2017 starving myself and not eating or drinking for days or even weeks now i have a wonderful girlfriend i love her so very much but it feels like things in life nightmares or bad thoughts are blocking the happiness my gf is giving me like im not realising i guess how lucky i am to have her idk nobody ever wanted me properly before its the first person that isnt faking to me or pretending or anything but the outside scares me and i just dont want friends or anyone to care about me even though i want to be loved and cared about sighs ive had a sht childhood and im having a sht life except for my relationship thats the only thing i like in my entire life for now at least ive thought about running away and if it would be better without me thank you sean sen you never talk too much never we love you so much im not about to give all the details of my life but this game hit really close to home for me some days i cant move and some days im the ruler of the world there was a point in my life where i was addicted to cutting myself and the only thoughts i had where of suicide watching seans videos whether its him ranting about depression or whether its him being a complete spaz on gta 5 he has made my life so much better and sean i know you wont see this but you helped me come out as trans with your sam is missing videos and you helped me seek help with my depression with videos like this so thank you just thank you you can really hear how his voice wavers more and more as the game continues you can really see the sadness in his eyes too he is here for us he understands and is listening to us he is here you know your a sad teen when you can recognize the shiloh music playing in the background 536 anybody recognize the song in the background i did its losing interest great song thank you i didnt even realize how much i needed someone to tell me what sean said at the end of the video until i heard him say every bit of it thank you just thank you this might sound exaggerated but i feel like for me personally thats all i needed to hear all this time i thought this was lofi when it popped up in suggested i just started watching you recently and my respect and love for you grows more with every video thank you i am just a comment on your video just like all the others thank you thank you so much open up to a friend you well feel much better at least i did i cried watching this my mom was very mentally exhausting she always would say i cant do something i would never be successful she brought me down every time she could i always try to be so positive and happybut when i am alonewhen i shut myself awayi feel sad againbut than i thinki think about my friend my cat and the people who do care i feel happy again seeing my cat on my side when i wake up makes me so happy ive tried to end it i still think about it but than i look at my wrist and my thigh i smileits made me a stronger person in a way things get bettereven if you think it wont i needed this thank you i just wanted to say thank you jacksean for helping me through my depression and suicidal thoughtsactions your videos helped me through bullying break ups depression ext im very appreciative of you being a youtube and taking care of yourself i hope you have a great day stay happy and healthy take breaks and dont do drugs kids this game reminded me to check back in on a game i have named kind words i recommend you who need to speak about important or little things should try it out its soothing and has chill beats 800 i watch the sunrise and sunset everyday no matter what is going on and at midnight i go into the middle of the woods and look up at the sky does that count his side job is therapist im not too good with helping people hell i dont even know how to help myself but even with that i want to try this you are important youre cared for by somebody in the world you have to keep your hope if youre feeling suicidal then please talk to somebody its not easy i know but gather up some courage take as long as you need nobody is forcing you but try to get help this is probably horrible im probably going to cringe at this in the future but hey i tried the tags im trigger warning sensitive topic bro jack is so caring i waitive heard about angela he before i played one of her games before and it was called theres this girl the game was pretty cool d i think i saw a trans flag i cant express in words how much this game has helped me so im going to do it how everyone usually does it thank you very much i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars 2620 what if you dont care about anything and see it all as hopeless i used to have depression and self harm issues but fuck it its jack this is essentially my life may is the female and more adorable me the thumbnail looks like nigahiga with a pink wig this game is created with a scary level of accuracy and the worst part is is that i have and still am going through now remember i am not may in this equation i am the one who tries to help but the thing is is i am not good at it and i scares me because i love this person too much to give them up thank you for all youve done for us sean youre so strong to hold back the tears i sobbed this hits home so hard but i dont have someone like the main character in my life things are so hard right now im quite late to this video but watching itit lets you know that someone else understands and that youre not alone it makes you cherish what you have and realize that sometimes its okay to be sad help is okay and talking to your loved ones will help you so much even if the days feel like theyre on repeat you just have to change it change on little word and everything changes do what you love no matter what if there is people that are going through the same as me i just want to say dont give up break through that bubble and see the world for what it truly is things may be rough sometimes but keep claiming i know i havent yet but spread your wings soar above and conquer sadness dont break yourself because of others in your life telling you are not good enough or what ever it is because if you do youll just be letting them win but you should keep pushing through find the light in your life and hold on to it you dont have to hide behind a mask like me dont make the same mistakes i did tell someone you can trust how you feel find someone you love and have them love you back i am a friend of everyone i just want to say you have a beautiful heart spirit and soul and i love everyone i am creating a channel for those of who need help i may not be able to respond to you but do not let the lullaby die i love you all jack this video made me realize that i am going through dark times and it feels weird to say this but i just feel as if life is a game that we all play and death is the end sometimes i think about hurting myself or even others but i have always been afraid every day i just get more and more tired but i dont want to sleep forever the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that there is someone out there that will care but i just have to keep on searching sadness is a bubble that keeps you from seeing the good in life and life is a game and death always wins i have been sad hiding behind a mask but sometimes i just want someone to care a shoulder to cry on and jack your videos brighten up may day they clear the thunderstorm that brews over my heart and just make me feel that there is hope that there is someone out there and i just want to say thank you for being funny but im scared that if i tell someone this ill be locked up so jack thank you my anxiety is kicking in gosh i just figured out jacks side jobbeing a therapist does anyone want to be my friend i feel so lonely going through what i am if anyone wants to be my friend my insta is elvrtic theres this game called theres this girl which is probably a part before missed message other woah bro deep thots me is that shiloh dynasty playin theres a cute mobile game similiar to this called so theres this girl from the same creator me the entire time to may and mc kissssss virtually hugs everyone who sees this comment i can honestly relate to may so much like she feels like a genderbend version of me but i lack that you person that person that cares about me i sadly dont have have that probably cause im a boy and since im a male im almost not allowed to show my feelings when i was a little younger like 12 years ago i think 2 by 2020 i told my mom i felt depressed and that i wanted to see a therapist she denied it and wrote it off as puberty and then i believe the 20th of febuary this year i slit my wrists i still have those cuts on my wrists it wasnt for attention i wanted to die and then the same summer my father wanted to send me to therapy cause i never got out of my room and never met up with people i wish he did but he didnt cause my mom thought he was overreacting writing is off as puberty again i should mention i was in therapy in 3rd grade cause i had anger problems not gonna get deeper into why and it was also to prevent depression one ok but like jacks talk at the end made me cry like i havent in years it actually felt like i was talking to him this vidoe made me feel so much better knowing that others go through the same things as you does make you feel better i struggle with self image and depression but the thought of not being alone is something i cannot put into words thank you jack thank you so much almost 17 years down the drain thanks for lifting my spirits up for a bit we appreciate it x thank you for this message and talking about these things this video is so powerful and i actually started crying doing stuff like this making videos takes a lot of motivation and time to do it and we cant thank you enough for that and of course this is with everyone as well for me i used to wake up everyday not wanting to go to school not wanting to do anything and i never really cared about myself a few months ago i broke down i thought about the people i had in my life the way i was living the things i was doing and i finally realized that i need to do something now ive taken better care of myself and opened my style and weirdness i still dont find the thought of school appealing but i found other hobbies that i love to do like drawing and cosplay ive also found people i connect with well and dont feel too bad around i havent become the desired person i sent out to try and be but its a start that i like so id like to say thank you thank you for a while now ive been depressed since i started highschool its creeped in and pulled me into a dark abyss of loneliness fear and anxiety i was barely gripping the edge as the unbearable force pawed me in about a month ago i let it take hold of me completely i willingly let it drag me to fall endlessly inside and hell i was kind of glad i felt relieved i let myself drift away from all my family my friends even my boyfriend someone whod tried his best to make me smile and laugh whenever he could be around i sat in my room tears falling from my face and my chest heaving with sobs my parents and i had been in a huge argument about some lgbtq things for about a week and id been unable to hold in the fear and pain i had for the past years i messaged everyone i knew saying goodbye and that they were good friends and that i loved them i really thought that death would free me i really thought that it was going to kill me i cut my hair in boysstyle in omg the fall out boy meme oof i love save rock n roll shusososis i clicked on this thinking it was a song but this is even bettet the end touched me i have been through a lot recently thank you for helping me understand that im not alone bro watching this again but late at night hits differently whats going on inside youre own head matters way more than the validation of what anyone else on the internet can give you may harry potter fanfiction my brain my immortal flashbacks angela he would most likely be pronounced as ho i really needed to hear this thank you sean 3 after seeing seeing part of this game i quickly went to go play it as someone who has been diagnosed with depression this hit me very hard i have self harmed and even attempted suicide multiple times during the game i was in complete shock and drowning in my own tears while playing i felt as if i were may i understood the feelings she was describing and everything she didnt understand i felt like i was may and every choice i made was to save myself i dont think anyone has captured depression any better than this creator and i thank you jack because had it not been for this video i would have never found this game its nice and i think more people should play it because it gives a good understanding of a lot of signs of depression and how its mostly hidden and we need to see those signs and the message at the end of the video was so beautiful because i am always in a mental state that no one will ever really see me and no one understands me and theres so much worse go bro the second the game started up i was like this is gonna have at least one big tiddy goth gf mene in it thank you ive been suffering with depression and possibly schizophrenia for nearly 6 years and just starting to get help and when there is people like you here it makes it easier omg i just realized the dream that may had the epidemic was depression and mental illnesses that can drive you to suicide and the mc im not completely sure what her name is helped her get through mays depression why am i only just notice this im so dumb soo my boyfriend broke up with me why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars him talking for those 20 minutes literally saved me im just crying my eyes out at 4am sean thank you bone deep tiredness ha i could never figure out what to call the way i feel this is it i did eventually work up all the courage to tell one of my friends that i wasnt 0kay but then i felt so messed up when she replied and ever since i graduated from primary ive been feeling pretty shitty theres never a proper reason and one problem why i feel messed up its just that my head is completely screwed and what makes me so mad at myself is when people actually give me a chance to open up and i dont even know what to say because i dont even know what im feeling i dont even know why im depressed i dont know anything about myself and i wish so hard that i could go back to my childhood when everything was so much easier and i didnt care what other people thought about me i was cutting and one day my older sister caught me crying so hard in my room and she told me how she noticed that i was upset and that i needed to open up to help her to help me i told her everything and she told my oldest brother who shut the door so all three of us when you started talking i had a blade in my hand ready to give myself another cut but you made me put it down im gonna try to quit my addiction3 bro i started crying at 1937 3007 3459 and 3959 everyones talking about how emotional jack got while im over here fangirling over the fact that they used a fall out boy picture with joe in it im so happy that more and more people open up about topics like this because the worst thing is that depression makes you feel so alone hearing about other peoples struggle with it can already be so helpful so thanks for this sean honestly thank you for this you made me rethink a lot of stuff that was going on in my life you did good and i hope talking about it helped you and someone else too i know i watched this late but damn sean you made me cry with your speech you get all of what im feeling rn thank you i love the soundtrack of this game its so beautiful my friend tried to commit suicide about 9 months ago i always told her she was always welcome to talk to me i tried to reach out to her to bring her back close to me and theres not a day that passes that i dont think of her and how shes feeling now she is alive and well but shes with a bad bunch of friends im not dragging her away from them but im trying to let her figure this out on her own without her becoming devastated i offer her my help and will always have my door open for her shes my best friend what friend would i be if didnt at least listen to her problems and work through them together she is the world to me she will always matter to me her and the rest of my family and friends mean so much to me they are my world and the universe i grew up to cherish if any of my friends see this comment know my every word is true maybe not to always to a literal extent but know you and my family are the most cherished thing in my entire life aside from this video tought me that i ahve so much to live for my friends my lesbian self actually my family and others i come to realize that life is meant to be difficult but someone will help you get through it thank you so much for uploading this i wouldnt have had and open mind to my situation otherwise thank you jacksepticeye his acting when he reads is everything ive played this game before and when he clicked accept goth gfs iphone i was like noooooooooo im learning how to love myself there are these 2 people that i deemed special one had a lot of friends the other always smiled so many would always greet her in the hallway and hug her i guess i leeched onto them and as i kept following them they revealed another side to them one cut with scissors the other did not have any friends at school so they moved to another school to start a new life and make friends hearing these stories its depressing that every human being has this theyve all gone through this at one point in their life it made me sad that i was blind about that everyones suffering and theres me so naive and oblivious as well as naive i was helpless i hate that the people that i wanted in my life would always go away in a year or two they did not die they did not leave me we just parted i was so stubborn i remember that those two were also stubborn i push away others that get close or want to get close to me in case if we eventually split up in the end if we become friends i i have been watching this everytime i feel like this thank you jack i was diagnosed i have severe anxiety and depression i used to be suicidal before this video helped me to get this thing out of my chest to my parents i am going to get treatment soon thank you lots of love rena and for those who feels like this do not be afraid if there is someone you can talk to friends or family members talk to them and get this feeling out of your chest in my case i opened it up with an online friend she was very nice about it and she helped me way more than she think she did do not think it is a bother i have realized that it is not she told me i feel happy when i help you so lets be happy together if someone out there experienced this your not alone you can vent to me i like how jack can just flip a switch in his head and go for some lovable potato boi to a serious and troubled individual or yknow a person i ignored the trigger signs but i dont regret it thank you sean thank you hh when jacks voice cracked i actually teared up i didnt know i needed this thank you this video helped me a bit i can relate to this video and the game in more ways than im comfortable with im currently dealing with friends who have harmed themselves and have thought about suicide almost every day im helping them as best i can and yes they also get professional help but i just cant stop helping them and i dont ever want to helping my friends is one of the most important things to me and its something i enjoy doing because it makes them feel good and it makes me feel good i do have depression and i have also harmed myself i am getting professional help btw i think about suicide daily it hurts this video has helped me realize that yes life is short but i dont need to make it shorter 426 as soon as that cam up i banged my fist on the desk and went fob fob fob fob peterick oops you need to be a motivational speaker bro this is beautifulthe end tho im not crying your crying thank you jacksepticeye jack oh uni rever sees thats what it actually says bahahbahaba as someone who has lost a lover to suicide this game hits hard may reminds me of me so much im definitely not in an okay state but im struggling through ill get through it the hard way going into stores and them asking you to leave becsuse your self harm scars is horrible i needed someone to love me and i still havent found this person but im doing better than i was im not so lonely anymore if the men find out we can shapeshift theyre going to tell the church i really get may i just wish i had someone like angela that i could talk to every time i get the strength to talk to someone i get knocked down by my own fears and lock myself away again im trying to get better but i have no one that i can really open up to edit what i mean is that i get bullied a lot and those who are my friends wouldnt get it and only say things like its a choice to be sad and you just need to be happy i dont know why this is funny but the way you say constipated almost made me pass out laughing thanks for talking about everything that you go through because it helps others relate it helps me understand about myself so thank you it means so much to me that you talk about the things that most people dont want to even think about pleasedont stop going on tangents and losing yourself when talking thats when the best comes out i enjoyed every single breath of this thank you thank you sean im really thankful to have sean in this world right now i love this man aghhhhh im sick dont make me cryyyyyyy ahh and the doggyyyy reminded me of bts yeontan memeeeee i love watching you play these kind of games and really open up about yourself along with the incredible gameplay know that youre really appreciated and so is anyone reading this no i am worthless thank you i remember getting the bad one the first time not knowing what the game was about played it again and it scared me the resemblance of my friend hey if anyones wondering im pretty sure the song is closer by shiloh not sure tho lmao wow really cheesy comment alert thank you jack honestly i really needed this talk recently i havent been in the right place to the point where i cry until i have a headache or gag and maybe puke and it really sucks i went to the point where i took a handful of tylenol i hated life it sucked im still kind of in that place but im kind of better thank you again anyways im going finish my nachos lemon 538 oh i know this song shiloh dynasty losing interest i really want down a comment but i cant find the right words all i can say is that i cried throughout this whole thing y u play games that have the ability to smack the viewers r i g h t i n t h e f a c e with depression i know im a little late to the party but i didnt realize how much i needed this message until i watched this video i relate to may on such a level that its almost like she was based off of me no im not suicidal im not using self harm im past that now have been for a while but im still not really happy or even content with where i am right now im going to my first formal event today and i just wasnt feeling it today but this helped a little a lot actually and if theres anyone like me who happens to see this comment just know that you are strong you are beautiful you can get through whatever struggles come your way you can do this you can get through it all i know reaching out is hard i know its so so hard to do but all it takes is telling the right person hey can we hang out i told a friend we werent even that close at that point but i told them hey can we just sit here for a little so we talked and eventually i was able to build up confiden jack starts talking about how the internet is bad me about to sayok boomer jack starts talking actual sense me shiloh really fits this theme and i love how she adds it i have a condition where every month right before my period i get this thing called pmdd its like pms but worse like an extended depressive episode its hard its really hard and it makes me have terrible thoughts theres no reason for it nothing that prompts it i just fall and i think about everything and have horrible thoughts my friends know about it i talk it out but sometimes it feels odd to because i cant explain why i cant tell them why im feeling that way and they can only help to a certain degree i would see someone but its so expensive and my mum doesnt believe in therapists i have been told to see one by so many doctors but its hard and im just now a young adult if i see one it will be from my pocket and i dont have a job yet i ain to be happy and positive apparently i come across as confident and happy all the time i try not to fake it but its hard to break the habit its really hard shit man i try to hide it but im going through thought shit and im crying right now you really helped me dear comment section or sean if you see this the end of this video made me feel like i really meant something for the first time in about three years watching your videos has helped me through some rough times the feeling of being tired all the time may talked about really resonated with me no one has ever described my feelings in a better way than in this game and id like to say thank you for making me realise that and thank you for being my favourite creator ahhh i love ittt that one not emotional comment that makes you mad the girls room is vsco ish the artstyle too i love the game its just too damn good and it gives messages too i mean in a lot of games they give messages you know what i mean never knew that ill come back and cry like a little baby but hey at least now im ready to vent when i watched this video for a first time it really hit me i have a friend who has problems with her family and also does selfharm and i am really worried about her i am scared that she might need me during a very bad situation and i would just miss her message and now i rewatched video and found myself associating not with mc this time but may ive been a golden child myself but now i got kicked from uni because i havent worked hard enough i barely even worked actually i found myself dependant on my parents to afraid to make a wrong choise a wrong step i feel like a prized vase always beatiful always perfect my only relief is art which my parents dislike cause all i do whole day is draw but drawing makes me happy i know i need to talk to a profesional its just hard hard to say to yourself that everything is not fine that you need help hard to so i saw this pop up in my recommend i remembered the other games the this person did and thought why not its good i did i definitely needed this the end part especially because he was firm but kind and honestly you kinda need someone to say they are proud of you sometimes im happy he is taking a break for himself and pacing i hope he has more happy days to come and i hope whoever is reading this i hope you are ok and if you arent thats ok just please talk to someone it doesnt have to be right away just say something it doesnt matter who you are or what gender etc everyone has bad periods at the same time remember that there is someone who cares remember you are worth it in the end always say something always if you dont think there is someone who cares there is there will be i promise find people who appreciate you is such a hard concept for people to implement but it is so so important being yourself is crucial to finding people that will care about you and you can say something to be unapologetic just this moment i burst into tears youre the best jack you deserve a like ill keep moving thanks to you even though i dont know probably anyone in this comment section im here for you i just wanted you to know that you are important and im always here for you have a nice day or night junji ito the artist that speech just hit me so hard and now im crying help i feel for may i waspretty good in school not having to study and still get pretty good grades but after a while i didnt put any hard work into anything what i really wanted to work hard in is the creative arts that i love but mostly writing it was strange i never heard of a similar case like mine like this before this whole conversation is getting to me its odd the way this game resonates with me seeing it from both angles being the one who is suicidal and living with another person who is suicidal i can see it not only from both angles but before and after getting help and even slipping after getting help its an odd feeling empathy and selfpity at once wondering if at any moment you could lose them anger because if you tried they would follow in your footsteps to feel alone in a room full of people who get it who understand what your feeling and still wanting to die to feel so empty and yet fulfillment is arms length away but that one step feels like a thousand but once you take that step and you allow yourself to feel that pain safely with other people who understand its freeing and no it doesnt last forever but that resource is always there there is people who have been through what you are going through people who understand your pain you are worthy of help you are no less worthy because you fee thanks sean the message at the end really helped me sean dammit man you made me cry your amazing and a beautiful person thank you for being you alright im gonna say this once angela he is an amazing artist and game developer change my mind i feel proud i played this before u i played this game a month ago and holy crap nothing has ever hit this close to home slowly my depression has been starting to get better more and more over the years and to others who also have depression i wish more than anything that i could say things get better but in all reality it doesnt but youre never alone though and to be honest that is better nno im not crying my eyes are just pissing thank you 2513 aw jack honey your gonna make me cry so sweet we love a down to earth sweet boi who accepts people for who they are and have fun with what he does i am in tears i was the friend who would no longer be alive if my special person didnt pick up on notes he saved me and i returned the favor later i think i got the good ending a new life my true love and a place to call home i swear i have a friend who cuts and omg this is an absolutely stunning game but man this is like an actual message about the real world that just everyone is missing this is why i go on youtube its because it feels as im talking to a friend rather than a person who doesnt know me at all as i have move schools my friends are making new friends and i feel as i am drifting away from their lives and i wasnt even a small bit of their lives i havent felt happy since 2017 my life just went so downhill and has yet to stop i dont go to school i dont have any friends at all im always happy on the outsife but i really just feel numb and hurt all the time and it sucks its horrible i know im not alone but its so hard to not feel that way its like the saying that ur in a crowded room but you still feel alone it sucks thank you i needed to hear this thank you jack sean what cunts disliked the video 3646i wish someone told me that at the beginning of this year 2018 was the worst year for me except the day my mom attempted suicide and to be honest im so happy that you always put a smile on my face without your videos i honestly dont know where i would have been so thank you i love how they put trigger warnings before their games thats so amazing lord i love this creator damn youre okay jack you dont need to burn out just to satisfy us you can take breaks you can rest and take steps back its not a bad thing to do that i saw this game and just by reading the title i knew it was going to be like this depressing game i am known as the popular kid at our school i was popular because people know me as a dancer i have classmates who didnt know that i was a popular student everyone in my class was a transfer student they didnt know anything about me until there were was a time when i performed with my club at school i didnt expect them to like me at all there was a boy in my class who confessed to me he was my best friend in class he walks with me home it was a new feeling because even though i am a popular girl i still stay as humble i dont show off im not the most confident in myself i still have a hard time in believing in myself to this day that boy he confessed to me he told me that he liked me ever since our first day of class started he said that when i walked into the room he was looking at me i know it sounds cliche but it is true i did not expect him to conf thank you he should play the last two endings its always a gut felling for me too to say i fine but no one really comforts me and it seems like no one cares thank you so much for your honesty sean i love your videos and they help me smile when im going through a hard time myself ive struggled with depression my whole life and i have lost 7 people ive cared about to suicide im grateful that you addressed these topics especially as a man because there is still so much stigma around mental health keep up the great content thanks for being awesome this is the first time i have ever commented on a video but i really felt pushed to speak i wasnt always a jacksepticeye fan when i first saw him a few years ago he just wasnt my cup of tea athough i had nothing against him over the last two years i was reintroduce to this channel and felt really drawn i feel like he has changed but thats not a bad thing i have also changed as we all do the thing that pulled me in this time i think was a real and genuine kind person doing what they love i jus t wanted to say that no matter how we change that their will always be someone to appreciate us for who we are ps the fact that you are a bit quieter now didnt hurt either because i have sensitivety to abropt loud sound and early jack was just a bit more than i could handle one of the best videos ive watched thank you i needed this this video hit me really hard being someone who has been depressed from a young age without knowing it and that feeling only getting worse i can really relate it honestly feels like nothing works and that nobody is ever there for me even though that im still depressed watching you jack and all the people that i watch on youtube it really makes me happy im so grateful for people like you i hope that people who are suicidal and majorly depressed i wish them the best jacksepticeye seani actually cried when i was reading thisyes i know im late to watch this videobut most importantly if you will ever read this thank you for helping me escape the toxic thoughts of some stuff im going through with your absolutely amazing content that im watching for a long time nowand also thank you for being you my mind is so noisy that i developed anxiety i didnt know why but i felt cold scar guys does anyone have a charger were dyingggggg i used to think i was alone after both me and my brother would get bulled from my old best friend but i have my big brother so now i know im not alone hey sean thank you for this video and for going over so much thats going on and meaning all of it you are so worthy of fame and love because youre are so good and so intune with what it means to be happy im happy you are growing and hate that people would ever say youve changed like its a bad thing its amazing to hear one of my heros saying its ok personal happiness is important and its what we as people should focus on in a time like this i love you thank you for being here for us i used to feel like may till i discoverd your channel thank you for playing this game i would never have known about this and i would have never had the help i got from this game if you never played it what you said also helped very very much i just want you to know that you saved so many people including me with this video i really needed this thank you so much i love this developer 3 she makes cool games and for computer and phone if u opened the door she might still be alive bye the way gf means girlfriend everytime i watch this i just cry but feel better after it nice to just left it out but i hate crying i get really big headaches but sometime i just dont care i need to cry to feel better i know im late on the video but i just wanna start off saying its okay not to feel okay and not have a reason you could have such a good day or nothing happened and you could still feel like shit the whole way through it or when its done and that its okay it doesnt make you ungrateful it doesnt make you a bad person its just a natural feeling and you dont need a reason for it these are just some tips i wanna share when helping those that are depressed some people dont wanna go and get help but they want someone to talk to sometimes its just easier to talk to someone that wont look at them like theyre crazy or somethings wrong with them another thing is we have to stop with the dumb assumption of fake depression now im not saying just assume they are indeed depressed cause i know for a fact there are people that try way too hard to grab peoples attention but maybe try to understand a lil more cause this shit is serious the last thing is when talking so as someone who saw the signs in someone i love i know its hard but please get help talk to them let them know you care if i hadnt done what i had done know one knows what could have happened if you feel a certain way please tell someone please you are never alone no matter how hard it gets you are never alone i love watching you play these types of games because of the deep talks you have afterword or during them its so inspirational and motivational to hear someone talk seriously about such a real topic its very refreshing and i always appreciate these mental health jack audience talks i definitely need to hear them sometimes and your advice helps greatly it has really helped to change my perspective on things after the hope ending i couldnt watch more physically i couldve but mentally i couldnt everyone is serious me feels bad cause i thought kfc tw i dont talk about this very much but this reminded me of a time when one of my friends were going though a hard time and she texted me telling me she was about to kill herself shes still alive honestly that was one of the most terrifying text msgs ive ever got i honestly still blame myself for not being there since i know this is gonna be buried in the comments im just gonna say it im honestly planning to end my life this summer there are so many reasons to my mom has always jumped boyfriend to boyfriend ever since she divorced my dad and i was forced to move this year because she was fired from her job and she made us move in with her boyfriend who she only knew for a month and met on a dating site he lived 3 hours away i still sleep on a couch and its been months since we moved i started at a new highschool and still have no friends my old friends hate me because it was on such short notice and i let them know only a week before i moved i used to self harm and i still have scars looking back i know how selfish and stupid i was i plan to die during summer break i am insignificant and naive nothing can change the fact that i deserve to die i see myself with no future but i dont want help i want to just be gone this life ismine and while everyone elses life is a rollercoaster of good and bad emotions mine is just a slow ride that will hopefully soon end why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 25 well shit lmao i did cutting i still do im pretty young im still a kid feeling alonedepressed broken even tho i have ppl that care for me it feels like they dont really tho the demons the voices hurt u listen to them more and more till u die i want to die so muchbut to scared to but im scared of living my parents caught me cutting 3 times i think they said theyd get me a counseling they forgot so i keep doing it wont stop no oneexcept one personthey my everything im crying because this is relatable 254 heythats ice bear from we bare bears sean please dont worry about those people who have been saying those terrible things there are people who genuinely love you and your videos and will keep watching no matter what one of the reasons why i like watching your channel is because it feels like im playing video games with a friend and you spend more time connecting with your audience than some other youtubers do youre doing great dont worry about it 3 i just finished the video and all i can is thank u 2019 sorry for a person who has depression and a friend that is suicidal i have seen all these signs or messages and didnt realize that whats it wasshe was put in a hospital for 2years and so this really gets me i feel a very close connection this hit home i love your point of views dont ever feel like your rambling or like you need to get to a point there are a lot of fans out there that value your words me included i like when you talk at the ends of videos a lot of what you say are words to live by and we as fans can relate to you this video has been sitting in my watch later all this time i came across it today and oh my god this is pure gold dont be like me i feel sad a lot ive convince myself im fine or youre over reacting and i guess i have no proof im not ive caught myself crying in my room after long days of school or locking myself in my bathroom sobbing yet i still end up convincing myself im fine ive told my friends that im soooo sad trying to make myself look like a joke it always works i dont know if i should be proud i made my friends clueless on how i feel or sad that i lied to so many people im dear to yet over all i still cant pin point why i feel like a pile of pain and tears i want to tell someone that im trying to be happy but i dont know how or who to ask dont be like me seek help everything will be okay even if you feel stuck therell always be a good side remember no matter how hard life hits you you can even if its hard you can get up and succeed even if you need help you can do anything i believe in you when i see someone who goes through things like this i want to help but it gets hard carrying it all im the type of person that helps people regardless of how im feeling but sometimes it weighs me down it hurts and the thought that i cant be there to help everyone really burns me up inside i just want to help everyone with there problems even if i suffer because people deserve to be happy if youre going through something i can promise you youll get through it it wont be easy but eventually youll get through it and youll live to see the beautiful pink and orange sunsets and to smell all your favorite foods or to listen to music that makes you feel so happy youll grow whether it be fast or slow paced and youll meet lots of new people some of which will stick with you youll get to look forward to so many things or you can do so many things i promise i swear it gets better i love you and out of the 78 billion people on earth im positive youll meet great people who wi wow thats a lot of monologuing thank you so much for this video it made me rethink some things in my life and i already feel better 3828 the pain in his voice after saying this makes me so sad i thank you you talking about this means so much to me just thank you it really makes a difference to my best friend thank you thank you for listening to my problems that keep me up at night thank you for trusting me with the problems youve suffered with for years we both are may we both feel like ending it but we help each other ive been in hospital from a pity attempt and i was stupid but now i regret it because i met you you made my life better you made my depressive days into days that end up being my favourites no one knows that we are close but we know we are and even if people get surprised that we are friends and we get a bit awkward about it you made my life better so thank you no one will probably see this in the sea of old comments from when this first came out but if you see this take some time to yourself i believe in you every day when i watched this video for the first time i balled my eyes out for a long time i was in such a dark time and i was scared of almost everything i never thought this video would mean so much to me watching it back again my dark times are slowly disappearing i sometimes reflect on myself and see how much im improving it baffles me every time if i could go back at the suicidal and depressed person i was a year ago i would tell them it gets better just you wait little guy youll meet some and reconnect with people who will change your life thank you sean and thank you creators of such a beautiful and deep game no matter what your fans are always here for you even if you dont wanna talk about it we are still here for you no one is always happy its ok to be sad no matter how small the reason i remember when i played this game and afterwards i texted all my friends to make sure they are okay wow i needed to hear this right now im gonna put my phone down thank you sean ive veen through this stuff my self and still am but im slowly getting better but i wanted to say who ever else is going through this even if you dont care about your self try to think of what happens to the ppl you care about like if u did succeed whod find you what would that do to them how would this affect your family what about the future youd be throwing away what about the ppl around you im gonna stop here because i could go on for hours but thats what i think about you effect every one in your life and you matter so much so no matter how tired you are you have to keep fighting if not for your self than for the ppl in your life and for the bright future you have game i feeled cold nerves but i didnt know why ad water hitter im chinese so when i heard jack try to speak it i laugh but realised oh shoot i dont know how to speak irish ok this is very loud for my earholes my brain your very loud for my earholes was listening to music clicks hurggufteibzugeybz me ahhhhhhhhhhh no one no one at all me angelahe angelaha angelahehe angelahaha no hate to the artist loved the game just thought it was funny lol hey jack thank you for doing this it can be hard to put a mask on for the people around me so thank you so much for talking about this sometimes i feel like i dont even deserve to be sad so thank you for doing this always remember we as a community love you and what you do really youre amazing that moment when youre watching calmly and dont know what youre walking into and by the middle youre crying but then sean has his talk at the end and you actually do feel just a tiny bit better about life thank you so much for the heart to heart sean it really means a lot that you played this game and talked about something that is so difficult to hear but also so important and dont you ever give every piece of you away you are your own person and you deserve to keep your problems and thoughts to yourself please dont lose yourself we love you so much stay strong everyone and be happy please ok so ive played this game before and i know this is unimportant but woah i just noticed thats a fall out boy picture at 428 the speech at the end hit deep to me but it spoke to me as ive had depression since m fianc left im better now but not 100 im still working on me when may was talking about every day being the same it really resonated with me me having severe depressionanxiety and dealing with self harm anorexia yep im going to cry by the end of this arent i yep im crying oh god i wasnt prepared thank you so much really thanks the talk with goth gfamy was very important and sneaky about foreshadowing things i may be looking too much into it but an example is imagine needing to cry but you cant because your foundation costs the equivalent of 20 shamrock shakes this represents how depressed or suicidal people cant openly express or feel like they cant how they feel on the inside or about how toxic their mental health is but you cant because your foundation costs the equivalent of 20 shamrock shakes this is basically saying that they feel like its too expensive to let people know how they actually feel many suicidal or depressed people dont let others know how they feel because they feel like theyd be too much of a burden on others or its too bothersome to let others know this game is really amazing it honestly hit home is sorry but like im too gay for the girls in this like lowkey crushing on the art style right now the character looks like belle delphine to be honest i have been mentally horrible and im still not okay 100 but im happy now compared to before i feel better with myself hearing more than just my friends tell me im worth more than dog poop it gives me hope in life thank you jack for this video that was ice bear i just wanted to thank you for saying those words it really meant a lot to me i needed to hear those kinds of words when im really feeling low i leave your videos playing so i feel like theres company here and you usually end up making me laugh which is what i really need im glad youre still here thank you oowee didnt expect to be cryin rn yeeyee i just noticed that amy is may arranged differently or the other way around wonder if that symbolizes anything or uessss ive been waiting for u to do this this is a beautiful game thank you very much jack you are amazing and helped me with what im going through right now watching you and your friends have helped me a lot ive learned lots from your advice before ive given up on humanity because of bullying and other negative things happening to my mind but listening to you and nice people like you have given me hope im recovering faster now thank you dont know if youll see thisbut i really needed this im sure a lot of people needed this today especially its shocking how much i need approval for every little thing i do which would seem nice to get approval and compliments 247 seem nice but needing that in order for me to feel happy is toxic i hope that with you being a role model for so many encourages them to get off social media more its become such a way of life that it really does ruin mental health something i need to work on for sure cause its been there so long so many years of this it can be hard just my thoughts on that wish i got to actually talk to you at pax i was so nervous i couldnt get much out haha im glade i clicked on this video jack said this in a general way but my favorite meme is the wholesome edits and bongo cat i know you arent gonna see this but jack i wanna let you no i really appreciate you i grew up watching you you helped me threw harddark times and listening to you is like talking to an old friend ive moved so much and its a relief to here a familiar voice to know theres someone thats a real person and isnt fake like everyone at my school so on behalf of everyone thank you old friend we appreciate you huh well it looks like it raining behind my glasses nice when the flags are gay and trans and u feel very happy it was you left me i think also 3217 h old o n p ain e nds that note she left her tho i felt that so much it was like i was buried alive without no reason but i know i want to survive i scream i struggle i fight but no one is listening ive been 6 months clean now and kinda forgot about it then when i saw that part those memories came back and almost made me cry because those emotions came back i felt the emptiness the whats the point the drowning the anxiety the i dont know why i feel this way but im too tired to find out why everything i felt it all even the suicidal thoughts i tried to end myself about 2 times before my friends started to help me not saying that im fine now or that im better but im grateful i can still move after staying in that pit for so long for everyone who felt the same way there is always a rod for you to take the choice is up to yours you either choose to end itgive up or you keep moving and keep hooing that evetually youll get what you want aww i played this game and i just found out that you played this its such a cool game your speak at the end ment a lot sen thank you so much i need to cry but my foundation was 48 the vine jack was talking about this makes me wish that i still had a girlfriend my mom passed away when i was 12 my dad was busy working for the family so i didnt have the emotional support that i needi bacame more and more sad i didnt believe i was depress because im not diagnosed by doctors yet but i became more and more suicidal thinking ways to kill myself but it became better once i open up to my friend it really feel so good i dont feel lonely anymore just keep goingdont give up on yourself yet i kinda wish i had friendsespecially ones like her when i had friends and hurt myself theyd hit my fresh wounds the pain kind of echoed in my skin even the guy i had a crush on for years walked up to me and made a cutting motion over his forearm smiling i did have someone though she was my sister is my sister i never talked to her about it though but everyday shed make me smile and feel like aa golden statue without even trying to help me she was always there when i needed her id cry over guys whod use me and she got me tickets to your how did we get here tour and marks youre welcome tour anyway i know you wont ever see this but i need to act like you will you sean have helped me and my sister with our family problems and our own separate problems youve also helped make my own mom laugh after a crappy day at work we my family me and everyone else love you this hit me hard because my sisters friend committed suicide and one of her friends friends did too life is really hard sometimes especially when she went to invite her to her birthday party this weekend then remembered that she wasnt there she ended up deleting her off her contacts my parents are on and off and cant decide if they are going to get divorced i would be fine if they split or stayed together but either way the indecision is killing me on top of this chaos they won a trip to hawaii for a week why does this happen now of all times never apologize for being human these videos help more people than you could ever know thank you i wish i came to this video earlier lifes hard ive gone through some stuff and i attempted some stuff my mom was the only one who seemed to care and i just said i was tired because i didnt want her to worry last year i was pushed to far and i regret something i tried to do but i made some friends actual friends and they made me feel at home its almost been a year since i was that deep and im still getting better but now my lifes going good i have an amazing girlfriend who asks me if im ok and i trust her so if im not i just spill and she helps me and i help her i was losing interest in a lot and i wanted to sleep forever i had very low self confidence and was heavily depressed i was put down and quieted but then slowly and surely it got better i have been doing art music and sports and it wasnt just my friends internet people helped me like you sean so thank you for everything thank you a lot i really needed this pep talk ah shit why am i crying ugh love this game it really speaks to me ok this game is amzing and im 1 min in and love it i needed this video thank you sean im glad that someone with your influence is talking about tough subjects like this it is so important to open the dialogue so more people know that there is hope for anyone who needs it something that i have learned this year is that you really need to make sure that you take care of yourself mentally and physically i have also learned that you need to find at least one good thing each day to hold onto my dad told me a few days ago that i need to find something good in my life to hold onto no matter how small and hold onto it with my life i have so many chronic illnesses and a few super rare chronic illnesses this year has been the worst for my health i have danced with death both naturally and by my own hand mostly to stop causing pain to the people i love because when you are very ill it makes the people who care about you so sad and it makes them feel helpless so many times this year i had to quit working the job i loved to d for me at least i feel as if even my friends and family only ever get to see parts of me because i close off the parts i dont want them to see its hard to consider burdening them with the deepest darkest parts especially when i value my time with my friends so much and want to keep it as light hearted and fun when we get together since its uplifting to be with them its a thing most people do i feel like each with our own reasons and parts of ourselves anyway super emotional message and happy to see your perspective on it all its nice having inspirational people like you posting heartfelt content even on some scary or darker topics thanks for everything i need to cry but my foundation was 40 dollars did is what u mean jack 940 this was wonderful thank you summary of video depression sucks pma rules only six minutes into the video may was giving me sayori vibes it was just the way she spoke as if this was her last day or something and the main character was sketchy its good that may got to somewhat confess and reach out somehow the things she were saying were hints and she wanted no she needed the mc to realise her sorrow and needed help people need to take way more notice of others emotions there has been an incident at my school where a member in my friend group has acted strange and very sorrowful ive begged and pushed other friendgroupmembers around by pleading for them to take more note of his emotions despite all of my begging and pleading they take no notice if hes alone looking out at the clouds talking strangely or just in general silent and sad im the only one that cares for him and try to enjoy his humour even if i dont enjoy or understand it he was kind quiet and gleeful but now hes kind quiet and sad like i sa 4700 even if you are just ranting were all hear to listen we care about you this was actually really beautiful ive struggled with what may has gone through along with millions of others and this game portrayed what happens behind closed doors you never know if youll get out alive its scary to be alone by yourself your mind wanders to the deepest depths of your minds and pulls out suicidal thoughts everytime i feel like im ready to just end it i tell my friends i love them so much and how great they are and i wait for them to respond which causes me to continue i just appreciate them so much you never know someone might just need you to tell them you love them i love you all that art is beautiful i played a game by this artist and its sad oh my gosh inspired by junjiito this game is really cool but if you experience similar issues it hits so hard i didnt watch this specific video when it came out because of the length and i generally wasnt interested in at the time today in change up in my recommenced so i decided to watch it now knowing why it was so long i really regret not watching it when it came out i am taking seans words to heart and you should too i lost it when he said this is tumblr the video game awesome video i love this game but why is the character putting her feet on the window like why the advice you gave definatlly improved my life mostly likely others and i just want to say thank you for being our favourite supportive youtuber man the art style for this game is absolutely gorgeous jack has spent almost half of this video just to give us a heart to heart to open up to talk to all of his fans to help them this this is why jack is one of the top people i look up to at the very beginning i saw her laptop in their world they dont have apple the have orange instead woah as someone who has attempted suicide its so real to see everything i went through here and to everyone out there who think theyre alone youre not you have people who love you and its ok to not be good at things someone should make a tw timestamp im just sayinggg this is such a beautiful game they play lofi music shaun needs a podcast talking about personal stuff cause its so inspiring also sorry if i misspelled his name i actually just recently got baker acted because i had suicidal thoughts and thoughts of hurting my self i always did my best not to show it but it just made it worse to keep it inside im happy now and im ok but if you feel this way dont keep it to yourself reach out and talk to someone whatever is making you feel this way it can be fixed but taking your own life you cant take that back talk to someone its ok no one will judge you heck you want to talk to me ill listen my insta is megandweber is it weird that the main characters hands seems to be cupping her own breast sorry my english sucks im already talking to people shiloh dynasty could it get any better we love you unconditionally ahhh im spoiling everything by reading the comments ill just watch it in full screen im lejitimetly crying right now im a born lesbian i see a pretty girl i click this game is literally the best game ive ever played in my entire life i love this shit you can say cause of my profile picture lol jackaboy played a lesbian game i didnt know he was supporting this made my day thanks for playing this game jack it was a bad decision watching this now im crying sean i play the videos and the first one i go on is you because u are my favorite than the others i help this girl she was sad and she not have no friends so i ask if she whats to be my friend and we are friends for a long time im the first person she looks up to i helped her in her other world of sadness and now she is happy she hang out with me every day and that makes me happy and sean u are not alone i am suffering too anyone know what is the song title at 0122 why am i crying no but for real ive watched you since i was like 11 youve helped me with so much which is why im so thrilled youre doing better now i couldnt imagine my world without you i just recently found out about how many of my schoolmates are on antidepressants like i am david the creative and funny dude committed suicide last month i like the way youre talking especially in the end how youre explaining and tbh you could upload a 1 hour video of you talking and id watch that cause i like listening to your voice that sounds kinda weird and i like how you talk about that topic thank you i i dont even know what to say i was so low lower than i have ever been just really fu deep down and i just happend to find this video and now i feel like i can keep going again i know you wont see this but thank you you changed a life i cried when i heard losing interest by shiloh in the background brings back so many memories this is now what i watch when i have a hard time it is so amazing that someone who some people think of as famous really has had the same problems as some of the people who really think they have no one or nothing to turn to its huge for him to be able to post something so personal yet so relatable to so many people i wont lie i have a lot of mental problems and i dont think i have no one i think there is someone to talk to but in all honesty my trust levels are so low im getting dear evan hansen vibes from him too i played this andoh jeez the poor girl ive had this vid on my recommendation for the longest time and ive never knew thought that id get a reality check at this level i see so much of myself in may and now i dont know what to do its been along time since ive let myself cry but i cried watching this it hit way to close to home and a lot of the times because things are going really well in my life that it feels like the stuff that i have to complain about is so trivial and so benign and so pointless that it feels like you cant complain about it i totally felt that it almost feels like because maybe my life isnt constantly throwing curveballs at me or that my problems are lesser than someone elses that i cant complain about it i guess thats kind of something a lot of people get caught up in that their problems dont really matter thanks for sharing that i feel like commenting this because everyone who ive talked to have only ever called me an attention whore or told me to go outside more and to just be happy im 17 and ive been having suicidal thoughts for about a year and a half maybe 2 years summer before last i started to execute my plan to suffocate myself i was literally in the process of trying to end my life when i thought about my mom or sister finding me the next day trying to wake me up and finding im not alive anymore and thats what stopped me but still to this day i go for a bath and i think about how easy it would be to fill it up and drown myself or electrocute myself how easy it would be to walk in front of a car when i walk to school i always think things like that and to be honest the reason im still here is because of my sister shes the same as me and recently when i found out she had also attempted we made a pact that basically was that neither of us would kill ourselves no matter ho i might be going to the hospital for having suicidal thoughts i talked to a social worker and might be going to the hospital inspired by junji ito you saiiiid we love you sean even though this is kind of an old video we love you and to anyone going through a mental run around we love you as well 3 i struggle with finding something i love doing i also struggle with my parents telling me that im not good enough that i wont get money out of drawing and playing games all the time i have straight as in class but i have no goal in mind no job im looking for hes probably stopped reading the comments in this video or maybe he doesnt read any comments altogether but im proud of him for his personal growth and for valuing himself over the validation his maturity has reflected on his content and the wellbeing of his stable mental health shows through in his content even if he doesnt put more time into his videos i still enjoy them more i respect this dude i played this a while ago and cried whenever i dive into this game or just see it my hands are like shaking and it just hits hard on me because i feel like i can relate but not sure if would have the strength to do it this game just proceeds to put tears iny my eyes but i dont have the power to cry anymore its just weird how a normal game can just make you feel scared stressed sad and in many more ways like you are in the place i should be just found someone to releate to to talk to but its only a game if you are reading this have a good day 3342 i feel you jack i felt the same even though im only 11 im always stressed and stuff and i will wanna hug you if you look in sans eyes he is crying the first time i see you cry though i almost cried and i know im late and stuff but i wanna say look to the positive side always i do that alot cuz im always stressed and sad my friends make me happy i really wanted to hug but i cant and im so sad after watching this vid i wanna say thank you san making my day every single day i love you you make me happy and thank you for working and doing this for us i wanna support you so much but i cant but thank you sooooo much san im 14 and this is deep jk and im not 14 but really it touches me so much i wanna cry djjfkskzurosb this is literally the best video ever so helpful to others with need of help ive never related to a person more in my life thank you so much even though this was made in june this help me so much i used to wake up do things i didnt enjoy and go to sleep and i felt like i was trapped in an endless cycle i thought things would never get better i thought i could never find anything i truly enjoyed and i wanted to give up every single day im thankful for the friends i had at the time some of them arent in my life anymore but they were when i needed them the most and im always grateful for that they pushed me to keep going every day and its because of them that im still here five years later im at a much better place in my life i still have bad days and stressful weeks but overall im very happy in life and im doing things i really and truly enjoy to anyone who feels like theyre trapped stuck being unhappy and feel like itll never change hang in there things do get better with time you just have to push through until that time comes and from someone whos been through the same thing from someone who almost ended my own life its wo damn it jack you made me cry off 50 of makeup this is very touching this situation is not easy i know how it feels to scream your lungs out but not being heard i dedicate myself now to hear people that think they cant be heard yes you can ill hear you ill always be here for you ill go to people what no one could do to me i didnt have anyone i felt comfortable with to talk id rely to cut myself and after just say that i was okay when i really wasnt i didnt wanted to be a burden for people yknow its not easy i know how it feels i always say this to everyone if you need help im here for you and ill always be here for you when no one else is i dont care who you are and what youre going through i love you and keep going youre amazing i believe in you youre not useless youre not a waste of space youre a very beautiful firework that once you put a little spark in it youll blow up and shine youll look even more beautiful than you look now because you do look beautiful you just need yo you know you tell people to reach out for help but that goes for you too sean never feel like youre obligated to feel a certain way and dont push yourself if youre not happy or you feel like the world is crumbling around you dont be afraid to ask for help listening to jacks voice go soft soothes me more than jazz wow that was deep i love you all who tf is cutting onions at 2am its fucked up how much i can relate to may just change writing to writing music and here i am weak tired bored person with no motivation to live just be you sean and we will watch sean what you said in this video man it hit hard thank you ive reflected on my life myself after watching this thank you so much for being who you are and fuck those who try to bring you down 1149 the black and white picture is loonas kim lip in her music video solo eclipse i dont want to seem like a hero but my best friend went through some dark times and this game really hit me hard im so happy that i was able to be there for her and im so so glad that i was able to talk to her and support her i dont know what ill do if i ever lost her shes my motivation and inspiration in my life i like u dude glad u played so many fantastic games he needs to voice act in a gay romance this hit home i have scars on my arms and thighs and stomach mostly my left forearm those are now covered with a tattoo which i love now i get my arms out without worry you can still see them kinda but people see the art of my tattoo first i see it too it proves that im not doing that anymore i still get urges but im not doing it thank you for being one of the people that i can listen to and laugh with youtube is where i always go to tune out my problems it helps i know you need to take breaks for yourself you really deserve them and i hope that every single one of your subscribers support you that the community support you because i do and youre doing so amazing sorry for the rant alot of people are talking about how amazing sean is about caring about his mental health and how his fans are ok with it me im having rain coming down my freckled face 0 just watching everything i dont think youll find any other youtuber more real than jack especially in the gaming community he talked about putting up a front because its what you want other people to see i feel like jack puts up a front not because he wants us to see him like x y or z but because he cares about us and wants his own personal life to be well personal i can see that it would be hard for you tubers that have youtube as a career to forgot that thats what it is their career its not your personal instagram or snapchat its your job and i think jacksean is just perfect everything he says is perfect its crazy im not even two minutes into the video and i already know im probably going to cry at one point but am i still going to watch it frick yah when they tell you yee haw but dont ask haw yee thank you jacksepticeye if i could talk to you in person jack which i would love to do but i just dont have the money to go do stuff like that i would just thank you for everything youve done so so much for me without even knowing and im so sorry for how you feel sometimes because i know how much it sucks and that if you need a break from this just tell us we will understand your mental health is so important i just want you to know that and i would really just want to give you a hug and i would end up crying a lot if i ever met you just because you have helped me though everything and again just thank you sen for everything watching this hit me hard ive been depressed a lot but ive had people to help me with it but what really hit me was the first play through you did because 1 year ago i lost a very very close friend the exact same way i was texting her that morning and she seemed so happy and the next day i found out that she had killed herself right after she texted me i blamed myself so much i still do i fell into a bad depression but i had really amazing people to help me and you helped me jack your videos helped me on the days i didnt feel like getting out of bed or doing anything you made me smile and laugh so really just thank you i still get moments where im depressed but i can get through it so much easier my friends name was mersadies she was so beautiful and caring and so so sweet she was going though a hard time and had been for a couple years but i was doing my best to help her i thought she was getting better but i guess she just hid it really well you n i can relate to the girl who cut herself now im healing from my cuts i have so much respect for sean using theythem when with their name most people would assume sheher is so amazing and he is such an amazing specimen in other words we stan i started tearing up near the end i really hope you know how much you help people ive been going through some stuff in the last few years and its so nice to hear that not everyone is how they seem and that im not alone in feeling a certain way thank you so much i know you wont see this but you mean so much to so many people and i just cant put into words just how much youve helped me but if you do see this just know that you have bless you sean this is my type of game with my favorite youtuber playing it d its been awhile but a game like this still packs a powerful message i have been through a extremely dark section of my life and now im on the other side of that storm nobody knew what i was going through until i was finally forced to open up which is incredibly difficult but has made a change for the better i might feel like im doing better but i still have darker days and it should be known that if you are feeling very low please open up its so hard but it will change your life for the better you will still have dark days but you wont have dark weeks or months or years like before finally i agree with sean and its something ive always said before you have to be kind to people and help them because you truly dont know what they are experiencing or the gravity of how they feel it you have to be the shining light in anothers life i waited until what i thought was too late to get help where i was burdened by thoughts of death every day for years i got help i honestly love the way you are now before all the yelling and overestimate was a little overwhelming to me i dont know why this you feels happier which in turn makes me happy i appreciate you sharing how you feel with us it honestly makes me feel less alone youre probably going to always be one of my favorite people im just getting to this vid lol you know what i hate all of you guys whom are so optimistic and i hate hippocrates do you guys really think that trying to say things will get better helps well you arent entirely wrong but you arent entirely right you have to give them something worth fighting for make it worth it for them make life to where it is not an empty void i gave up on life long ago i have been diginosed with ptsd and maniac disorder and a few other things that i will not mention the only reason i am here today is because of my boyfriend my puppy i would have died days ago due to me killing my self slowly my time was almost up i could feel it how ever i met puppy and he gave me something to shoot for again i risked everything in my life just so i could be with him and if you think he came to me knowing my problems your wrong he came to me with problems he has problems everyday and there are people who make him feel not wanted or just use him he n i just played this game before i ever saw that he played it and i was like this is a game he should play its an amazing game and i kinda wish it was longer but its amazing how it is 430 oh you know this is a good game when there is a fall out boy meme im sure you wont see this especially since its so long ago but i want to say thank you for not only helping me but for showing me how to help others and for giving me a way to bridge the gap between me and them through you i can break the ice by talking about you and thank you for showing me a light in the darkness thank you you deserve happiness truly the ending was so touching i love the theme but i also think its kind of sad that he didnt play the game to save her until after she had killed herself dont be afraid to reach out when you first see these warning signs because you dont get that second chance in real life hes entirely right killing yourself wont take away the pain it just moves it on to those who love you you are loved you are important you can do this 3 3 3 am i the only one who thinks how sad people would be if i die i love my life so much and my parents so much that im worried what they would do if i die thanks for playing and i didnt know junji ito worked on a game thats cool i am like the mc but its true and all but im like may thank you so much for everything you do i just started watching your videos and they are amazing thank you dammit i love you jacki know that i dont usually watch you as much as before but what you said is really hit me those hard time things im really glad you happy now really i wish you best for everything you did for community and all damn this game is hitting way to close to home like im actually may the whole time you talked i was okay but that last sentence you said brought tears to my eyes love you 3 and im happy youre okey now ill try too 3 ariana grande god is a woman me god is a man not a woman youre talking about a goddess my life is stuck in a constant patternim scared something terrible happens things calm down a little and im happy then something at least twice as bad happens and it just repeats over and over i barely survived the last thingim scared for whats going to happen next i dont know what to do things keep piling and im told that i dont have it bad at all and i am grateful for what i still do have left but its becoming too much nobody is there when i need themiim sorry im just rambling itsits really not that bad everyone around me has been through worse i shouldnt be the one complaining im just stuck thank you i really needed to hear that stuff at the end baby steps i dont know why but im feeling more good for my self cool 33 may gives me sayori vibes from doki doki literature clib it feels like im sinking and the harder i try to get out the more troublesome it makes the situation thank you for talking openly about these things peple need to communicate its hard but its posssible and im grateful theres someone out there like you sean who has bravery to point these things out one thing my father usually said everything passes the sun is on the other side everything passes that has helped me in my low moments okay i know the game is super deep and serious but can we please talk about how accurate the wlw dating scene was in this game the song losing interest softly playing in the background makes this game better were cogs in a machine that is designed to separate us modern society with all of its individualism incentives is contrary to our roots of togetherness we have to band together sometimes i want the work to stop turning or for my heart to stop beating either one works for me is it weird that jack feels like an older brother to me ugh theyre all so pretty omgg thank you so much youre so brave to share your experiences im sure were all so glad youre feeling better now and can be more happy with the person that you are and its good to put yourself first and make sure youre enjoying yourself the fact you addressed this topic really does mean a lot and it provides a very real viewpoint that anyone can feel this way no matter how good people think their life is this video means a lot to many people im sure so thank you again youre really such an inspiration jackaboy playing the best story game in a while yeah boiii eyyyy i played this one its so interesting the things you said at the end really helped me youre a really good person im like 10 minutes in and the art style and the beautiful story and omg im crying this game is so sweet but sad does anyone know the song around 311 my best friend has been depressed for a long time and i only found out recently i dont know what to do im not depressed myself so i dont know how to help them ive tried to help them find a therapist but all of them are to expensive for them this sounds super cheesy but i would love it if someone here could help me help them it would mean the world to me dont feel obligated to though play the game its a completely different experience than watching it its goddamn beautiful and a treat for not having that much time with how short it is not gonna lie but may in every panel is so fucking hot in every shot like literally any panel youre like bruhh you cant be this beautiful sean i love your hearttohearts they allow me to think about everything and they just opens everything up and allows me to see theres more to life which i really appreciate especially since i personally do still struggle to find happiness in myself etc but im not giving up i love you jack keep up the great work both on youtube and in your personal life never lose grip of hope gah you have no idea how much i needed to hear this today it just helps so much knowing that you understand what im going through i have been struggling so much with similar issues i actually started the process of therapy today it feels like god led me to this video to remind me that theres no shame in asking for help well crap this game made me cry one of my first names is may and id be lying if i said i didnt relate to the character in the game even now im still having a hard time to push through with life this was posted the day before my girlfriend committed suicide funny how the world works like that no im not asking for pity or im so sorry because its no ones fault i just want you guys to look for the signs to look at the people around you talk to them ask them if they are okay you might save a life if you are going through a hard time yourself i understand it will hopefully get better just have that pma ouch my feelings i almost cried watching this because i relate when may said sometimes i think about it then im stopped by the thought of the pain ill cause others at 1950 girl and guy or girl and girl game wow just wow those really are some deep word from both jack and the game a lot of the time i can understand what that stuff is like i think weve all kind of been there whether it be self loathing or not seeing the point of living it can be really easy to find yourself not wanting to live anymore especially when you feel alone and that there is no one to talk to in my life at least ive felt this way because of several reasons not feeling that i matter not fulfilling with what is expected of me and in my worst moments feeling that i abandoned and killed my dog and i wont deny that life can suck in the worst possible ways but even if you cant see the end of what you might be going through always remember that giving up is not the answer go to therapy talk to friends strangers if dont have any but always make the most of your life think of the future and strive to find happiness or at least in my opinion thats the best you con do when life goes to shit this hits actually so close to home im literally in tears from myself and the loss of my friends the harry potter fan fiction really called me out the back story for mey was me to a t only im a guy i still think about it alot but itd hurt too many people dose anyone have a suicide hotline phone number i cant find one thnks jack i needed that making this comment for my future self if i go back to this video just to listen to those last 20 or so minutes of you talking i relate to that so much im doing a lot better in life now but im having a few wobbles here and there but if ever i need a little boost ill come back and listen to what you said thanks jack starts from 3248 this video really hit home and hearing him talk was heartbreaking and also made me think thank god that i saw this video it must be fate sean said he has changed a lot but the copassion kindness and positive nature have all stayed consistent just because you have grown up doesnt me your completely different were lucky to have people like sean and angela sean i know you probably wont see this but i want you to know that this really hits home but it opened my eyes i know how it feels to have those thoughts i know how scary and sad it can be but i am so glad youre still here your videos save me from myself you are the most down to earth person and i wish that i could know you you seem like such a good person and thats only from what i know theres so much that we dont know about you like you said because of that barrier but you are an amazing person and please dont let anyone make you feel any differently thank you for being strong for sticking it through for saving me 4340 hmmmm sounds like a familiar sayori poem grabbing all my bottles happy thoughts happy thoughtsdo my friends really want them that badly but when i try to give them all i see are my happy thoughts happy thoughts all in shards in front of my feet besides that im glad to see should i use his online persona prob not san has opened up even in the slightest even though he said it felt like it was taking a piece of him off but no this was great i doubt anyone will see it but i feel compelled to respond to what jacksepticeye said with no you you explain having similar experiences despite being a youtuber well that road goes both ways though all of us may not be youtubers weve been in similar situations and we understand you cant be there for everyone no matter how much youd want to be its videos like this that should really shine a light on the fact that you as a person are doing more than enough for your community there will always be people who want more an in many cases they are in their own search for that person that will dig them out you may not be that person but you certainly do inspire that in others and that is enough thank you im here to say that your life matters people love and truly care about you i know from personal experience so please if you are having dark thoughts about hurting yourself please im begging you reach out to someone and seek help your life is so precious and you are worthy of happiness love to all shaun if you ever need to talk contact me on facebook tony francis i fkn love this game after playing it i wanted more games like this and i went onto youtube to see people reactions its crazy how a video game can make such a strong spirited person open up about there life a bit more i really like your videos jack and i hope you continue on this amazing career that you have created for yourself this really made a difference in my perspective my father at age 48i was 6 committed suicide bc his heart was brokenand the day i last saw him i didnt say i love you or goodbye and i regret that every day but even though not saying that still was unacceptable hearing jack open up and say that you never know when somones suffering and it isnt your fault it just really felt reassuring i guess its just that people should know that if you didnt say goodbye or was never given the chance to help out when they needed it you never really know if they need extra love or extra help sometimes and its probably the most important reason why people should spread the love as much as possible anyways because you could save a life and you make the world a better place by doing so anyways you have every right to complain about anything no lifestyle is perfect and you deserve privacy and compassion those poking into things youd rather not talk about sometimes just need to be reminded that you are only human we love you jack sean i know im super late but for someone who has anxiety disorder talking and doing something else makes me feel more alive and motivated im gettin there i feel more confident i felt this on an emotional level and i just want to say anyone who is going through this its not easy but there is always light at the end of the tunnel and someone will always care and if no one does im your someone this may be late but were all here for you and your not alone weve all been in your shoes and we still managed to get up wash our faces get dressed and headed out to wherever our legs took us it may never be easy but dont give up cuz this little family of ours is here for you when you feel that all hope is lost try remembering a single moment of happiness cuz thats the moment youll remember that its still worth living jessy young you have no idea how much i needed this doctor you have aids me no uno reverse draw 4 sometimes i come back to watch this again sean i just want to say thank you for helping me forget the things i dont want to remember for helping me throughout my life ive been subscribed to you for years now on different accounts though i know you get this a lot but youve really helped me through hard times and i could never thank you enough after this i just wish i had a friend who cared enough to talk to me i also wish that i was able to talk to someone ive held my emotions inside for as long as i can remember now i dont feel that i can actually speak to anyone at school im numb to almost all emotions but at home im just depressed feelingi love this game and hope for everyone to be ok if you ever need to talk to someone tell themdont hesitate sean youre just great truly amazing you probably wont see this but its out there im scared to watch this i watched it literally thinking about suicide all the time now all the things that bother me in life are just kind of blended together i cant distinguish good from the bad or important from small i feel so utterly alone i even told some people but it didnt help just makes me feel like they dont care i tried getting professional help just made it worse now im waiting for another appointment witch will take too long on top of that im also anorexic and i cant eat again right when college has started so i keep getting sicker and weaker i dont know what to do anymore my future just seems blank i want to tell people that i think im depressed or something like that but i know its probably wrong but like i make jokes about being depressed and hating myself so sometimes i think if i tell someone theyll just think im joking and i know that would probably make me feel worse its just that jacks videos help me this community helps me and i just wanted to say thank you to anyone reading this if you watch jacks videos thank you for helping me more than the actual people in my life because you showed me that even if i think it youre never actually alone and theres always someone to help you sorry for writing so much i remember watching this video when it was first posted and it really hit me hard and close to home but every now and then when i feel like absolute crap i watch the near end of this video and when he talks it just helps i dont really know how else to pit it other than it makes me feel like hes talking to us as a community and it just makes me really happy you helped jack thank you absoutely loved that last part this is worth so much hopefully a lot people get to watch this that is why youre a great person sean ill be honest i needed to hear those words thank you 116 suicide and pride flags no thanks this game is very important the song is called loosing interest i always come back to this video skip to the end and just cry what jack ends up talking about hits so close to home in a way that i dont even recognise i only ever cry if im having an intense breakdown but otherwise theres just nothing but this video always manages to make me tear up ive been so empty for years that when i try to talk to someone about how much im struggling i cant i forget literally everything when im dealing with people and when i try my best to tell someone what messes me up it turns out to sound like me just asking for attention which im not i dont want attention i want help ive been so lost that ive thought about how id just do it those thoughts always come back to me it fucking sucks how jack talks about that part just makes me cry more but its nice to cry i dont feel anything while im crying im an empty husk but it kind of relieves something inside of me and i have to thank jack for that its kind of relieving to listen t excuse mei need to go cry now jack i have crippling depression i have suicidal thoughts everyday im ngl i played this in june and was like this is a beautiful free game on steam i wish youtubers would play it i feel accomplished this video hit me pretty hard i have been feeling very down lately im tired for no reason and i dont want to make food for myself because i just cant be bothered i know what i need to do to to stop feeling like this i just hate that progress takes time im so sorry you felt this way but im glad you have brought these feelings out because it is in all of us nobody birthdy song plays disney you stepped in the wrong house jack this is my 4th time watching this video this honeslty really im not sure it just really effected me this is one very truthful honest video jack dont feel like that u have to fund the right moment just a be you b keep going and be honest i remember seeing this video in my notifications months ago and i watched it for a few minutes before deciding that i just didnt want a game with this theme running through my mind again recently its been in my recommended and tonight i just went hey what the heck i never had the guts to finish this one it really surprised me but i wont ramble about all the ways it hit home and your talk at the end also brought up some things ive thought about a lot lately i really appreciate 5036 til the end of the video a good piece of advice that id forgotten about completely my friend went something similar she would cut her self and i felt so helpless my friends and i didnt know what to do but we decided to tell her my mom about what was going on and she got the professional help she needed but wasnt happy we told her mom and i dont regret it but we dont talk anymore since we are going to different schools since people were bullying her she had to move schoolsi just hope one day she realizes that she has so many people that love her and i hope when she thinks of this dark time in her life as an awaking of her getting better sigh i played this with no idea what it was a few months before sean did it hit me and my bestiecousin so hard because we had no idea what was gonna happen so honestly ive been going through a really tough time i havent opened up to anybody about it ive been acting like ive been perfectly ok and better than ever i found out that im pregnant and im having a little boy then i found out that the father has been cheating on me and he recently got severely abusive i broke up with him and moved in with my parents where i continued to get verbally abused by my family my entire family and i was on the phone with someone who was telling me everything ive done wrong in life and how im not fit to be a mother and after that phone call i grabbed a knife and i almost killed myself what stopped me was that i got a notification that jack posted untitled goose game and i decided to put the knife down and watch it and i smiled and laughed and for the first time in months i felt happy and that video was literally the only reason that i am still alive right now thank you for everything you do sincerely you may not know it but you also jack can i give you a hug omg fanfics my friend needs to play this game i lost my best friend to suicide 4 years ago i still miss him so much it was so sudden think about him often it hurt so bad because we used to date and it was magical but i was young when we did please there are people out there that work their life so hard to help people that need help maybe its you maybe its someone youre loved and amazing and theres a spot for you in life because youre here in the first place 3 thank you its very very very hard to let people in please play he beat her or i woke up next to you again by angela he next theyre both interesting and deep as well i use to write harry potter fanfiction theres a spotify playlist called missed messages and its the whole list of songs used thanks jack i watched this on my birthday lol they really put a lot of details like how you can see old scars on mays arms at 3100 and how get chat bubble changed colour jack you need time to relax it is difficult to say this because you have a channel and that job is really demanding but from time to time it is necessary for people on social media to have a life for themselves also people is going to miss you or judge you when you take time off for you but now im happy to hear that you are a new person after you traveled to la i know youll keep growing thank you so much for your kind words an inspirational followup chat jack well done ps i dont believe youtuber channels die their followers just change as the youtuber changes with time with life with experience its an evolving relationship that scene when she finds may cuttingidk i just had such a strong reaction to it ive seen cut marks on my sisters arm and i wish i had hugged her too done something said something jacks reaction when she saw the girls arms ive been a victim of depression at one point i had people who helped me get back on track im so thankful for them i was a cheerful one the one that always wore a smile and i seemed so perfectly happy i didnt have any reason why but it all felt happy and fake i felt like a parasite and its hard to explain but yeah i get this i used to cut a ton every day i cut so often and so deep and it hurt and i felt a comfort in that i was able to control something i regret it because now when i look at my arms its a reminded all my scars each of them are a reminder both of the past but also that i survived sean your outro made me cry thank you forget about you how could anyone forget you sean your our hero my hero we all adore you and too the people that hate toward him think about who you are hating and leave him alone usually i just skip over the talkity bits in youtube videos but im so glad i stuck around you hit so many points that ive thought before and plenty of new ones that i needed to hear thanks for this omg at 548 i heard the backround music and it was losing interest holy crap and also i dont know why but this video gave me a reminder of what my mom told me last night her best friends husband killed himself and remembering that made me feel sad but jack thank u for being there to boost my spirits up most people couldnt resist accept that air drop on their first playthrough until may the way i see it and everyone should is that we have to perfect ourselves before we can imagine perfecting or helping others and groups of ppl youre personal space is more sacred than anything i think this game is a test of intellectual integrity but it says that in the introduction i believe it falls short in outcomes its still a beautiful illustration of the complex human nature there is a game on the apple store called theres this girl and it has a similar art style and premise but i dont know if its by the same people who made this game but its quick and short but cute also this is amazing and gave me to many feels by junji ito did you mean the horror mangaka cause i swear i know the name oh my gosh junji ito the one and only horror story writer terry tv reads theirs a lot this hits close to home although its sad to admit that people who said they would help did absolutely nothing i had to decide when i was well enough to take action to keep searching for people to help after about 5 therapists who all brought me further into despair i finally found someone who actually knew how to help me and actually took the time to listen and admit when they were wrong or even apologize when they caught themselves sounding dismissive it is so nice to at least have someone i can feel free saying anything to medication after 710 prescription that all made things worse i found something that kind of worked but i havent been taking it because it actually gives me energy oddly having energy wears me out so until my life can be more active im taking a bit of a break it is good to get help but also good to be prepared just in case it doesnt quite go well because when you see a professional and they dont live up to their degree due to inexperience or l place your hand on your heart feel that thats called purpose youre alive for a reason dont forget that my teacher is mrs mcloughclin im very happy that i clicked on this video jack everything you said was something i knew i needed to hear even if you felt like you were rambling you couldnt say it any better than what you didthank you for existing and being and living the way you want thank you i love you sooo much can i just wrap you in a few dozen blankets and feed you your favorite food you make my day everyday when i watch your videos i cant explain what your videos do for me and how you help me love you to the moon and back man damn i know im late but who cares i just want you to know that you mean so much to me like youre kindda my antidepressant really and ive watched a lot of your videos talking about all that heavy stuff but this oneid like to say so much but lets cut this short i love you the way you are when you are a happy bubble tea or the honest touching sen we saw here yes because by i i mean we most of the community thinks like me i guess i love you both ways youre so true and i think i start getting better thanks to you so yeah thank you i really am so sorry that you felt so down and i hope you feel better to tell the truth you touched me so much i hugged my computer cause i needed to give you all the love you deserve all the love you deserve for all the hope and joy you give us and we are here to support you not to put pressure on you so if you ever go through tough times like these again and you need to take a break do not hesitate do ma markilpliers new vid series bout a drown man while playing a kinda lame version of zak from ghost adventures is making me sick n depressed can we talk about this its terrible ive dealt with depression for years and im still stuck in it and its hard now im not gonna get into me but we all have problems and its okay jack if you need a day off its alright man if you need to cry fucking cry man you give so much for your subscribers its crazy your my favoriet you tubers and i have no words for the amount of time and effort you put into your videos and your channel in general you upload a video everyday man and even if you are having such a shitty day you continue to put a smile on your face and upload a video but man dont ever feel bad if you just need a day off and i appreciate it so much when you spend 20 minuets of your day do give a speech that could save a life take a break if you need to were not going anywhere were always here for you at first i refused to watch the video due to my friends telling me about the suicide and self harm but i finally watch it and im glad this video makes me feal so much better i have been watching you for three years now and have loved you and all of your content every step of the way i have loved watching you grow as a person and as a youtuber you are hilarious and deep and kind and good and such a wonderful irish bean and you prove it constantly dont listen to the haters luv keep your head up 3 3713 i cant give you everything because then i have nothing for myself i cant give you everything because then i have nothing for myself i cant give you everything because then i have nothing for myself read that sentence over and over and over and think about it if you ever wonder why somebody wont give all of themselves to you or open up about absolutely everything there are things that have happened in peoples lives that you have no idea about you dont know how much it hurt them how much it changed them how much of their life is still influenced by it no idea people deserve to keep that part of themselves a secret if they wish its when that secret part starts making them hurt themselves and become suicidal that it becomes a problem you do your best to help them solve and its not cowardly you dont know how much it hurts to hear that when youre at that point just listen be there for them love them you are not alone 3 jacks eyes getting redder and redder he feels everything so hard i hope he feels how much we all love him inspired by junji ito im sorry what am i the only one thats gonna acknowledge that he said brazy 512 i loved this video and it made me cry jackgives inspirational speech on suicide me screams damn he got that positive mental attitude 2343 yaaaaaaaas me too fam thank you sean its okay to take time for yourself and do what you want but at your own pace during the years ive watched you youve helped me through everything i appreciate you and love you and everyone needs that time to themselves which i need to learn more and all you said at the end made me so happy thank you for everything sean 2604 thank you so much this constantly annoys me jack dont ever apologize for being less involved in this community we love you yes but you are not obligated to us youre mental health comes first and we come second its okay to change and step away more the people who love you for you will stay with no matter what happens or how much you change also thank you for sharing your emotions with us we care about you and want you to be happy no matter what well said lad its hard when you have no friends but its still possible to get out of that funk ive seen a few videos of you doing these and decided i wanted to finally speak i wanted to start by saying thank you and hug because i have been in a pit like the girl in the video for a long time all the while aspiring to be a psychologist myself even though i still have trouble discussing my own feelings i have at least started seeking help i found a therapist but its a work in progress for now though it helps a lot to just feel validated so yeah thank you ive always noticed that you cant just let everything out because then you wouldnt have anything for you but thats when you gotta share youre passions your feelings your real you ive always wanted to be a therapist but i just cant not cry people always tell me your not fit to help anyone put your efforts into something useful its pointless if you are useless it hurts ya know ive been at the cliff too many times but then you feel the tugs on your sleeve and see and the people who actually love you you cant leave them it hurts to know theyll think you left them ahaaaa im rambling i procrastinated watching this video until now and i kind of regret it i did not expect this video to hit me as hard as it did i do suffer from these things and i do hide it i didnt expect to sit and cry so early in the day but i wanted to thank you for making me think about things im trying to get better im just amazed by how surprisingly good jack is at reading the lines i love how for the second half of the game background music just fits wit what sean is saying jack dont cry i cry if people cry thank you for your words i really needed this wowso deepwho wouldve thoughtkeep being yourself sean thank you jack thank you on those days where everything felt monotonous and i just felt like getting up was a challenge i remember at the end of the day watching your videos and felixs too they really helped me get away just for a little while and im forever grateful i love you and felix both and i hope someday in my lifetime i can just get to tell you that in person 2859 this hit me hard because i used to cut the dirty bandaids the blood the razor i relate oh thank goodness ive never been so happy to be wrong ever this is going to end the same way isnt it with that whole big lesson about things happening no matter what you do to change them ive always hated that bull ive always believed you can find a solution to any problem as long as you keep looking though i know thats easier to say than to do but still never give up on anything especially when theyre important ever you telling me not to worry only makes me worry more god damnit i hate when im right well the warning in the beginning makes more sense now mm somethings up i dont like it something bad gonna happen my radar for bad suspicious things is going off i dont like where this is going this video discussion and the game itself are all so important for people to see i struggle with depression and anxiety as well and can relate to many points in both what you talked about and the game im thankful for not being suicidal anymore but i dont know something about this video made me feel like i wasnt alone i really appreciate everything about this video i used to like your channel now in the last few months and especially now that you got that message out i absolutely love it thank you for this you are absolutely worth it and take your time to yourself you deserve it everyone does im such an idiot this made me cry so much legit cried i can relate to may quite a bit my best friend is called may and she tried it a few months ago im glad she was smart enough to stop and get professional help she is okay now im here for her everyday 3 sometimes it doesnt have to end like this people get help 3 i like the thumbnail thank you very much your videos always make me smile thanks for the pep talk dude 3 i know im late and im watching this now and all i gotta say is sean you big dum dum you made me cry thanks for opening up and giving motivation i really needed that tbh the part of being miserable but not showing it its so relatable ive been there too my dog really helped me on those times she needed me and suddenly i had a good reason to get up every morning when i didnt wanted to wake up please san do not give yourself away just for us we would much rather you have youre own life than being social media robot keep youre life while it is yours it is great for you to share this dont be scared im struggling with this everyday but today was a really bad day sean this was a light in my day i cant really explain it to you but youve got me out of my own mind im glad ive watched until the end thank you so much 3 i got distracted and i started to cry because i felt like i ignored the girl in the video adjbsksb help i cant stop crying hey seanjack just wanted you to know that there have been many times in the past four years or so where your videos helped keep these thoughts away id be sitting on my bed getting caught up in that dark noise in my brain and id look for a jacksepticeye lets play series watching you play through stories made everything feel cozy and safe again id even catch myself laughing for a moment everything was okay and it would be enough to calm me down help me sleep get me through the day whatever even in 2017 when you were in your own dark place you were helping me through mine so thank you for doing what you do even when it sucks and you dont feel like it and thanks for keeping things real love you man thank you for sharing sincerely it was great to hear especially the part about trying to take time for yourself something im trying to get a better handle on sometimes it feels like i have no excuse to feel as sad as i do since theres the so many people have it worse argument so its inspiring to hear your struggles and how youre trying to improve so you dont feel that way im really glad youre feeling better now ive been loving all of your new content because i love watching you as a person plus youre still very energetic and bubbly and i love hearing your laugh in the videos keep on doing what you love while taking time for yourself and im sure the vast majority of us will be along for the ride okay i tried to watch this but i suffer from depression and when i went thru this i didnt have anyone there for me and its just bringing up bad feelings sorry i couldnt watch this all the way thru shawn 3 i think you have added a little bit more time i can spend waiting for something worth living for i truly do feel alone thank you sean i need help i cant help myself and i dont want to ask for help im afraid but im tired too i wanna end it but even wanting that is tiring me since im afraid of the outcome not for me but for others i want to leavei just want to leave you are a great mind and i hope youre doing greater time flies by so fast that we dont see our problems until they are right in our face we do not seek help because we are afraid to bother others or that it will become a waste of time am i the only one that hears x in the background i used to think about walking into a road not to die but to be injured so then i could go to hospital and get the peace i longed for i didnt want to die because i didnt want to hurt people but i wasnt being left alone i was under pressure and as a result put myself under the same pressure i just wanted peace and quiet in a place where no one could be angry with me and just let me exist in peace thank you so much sen i needed this today 3 also i like more your videos now you look much more happier and that is awesome the dislikes are people who where listening to jack so hard that they got the wrong like button i wasnt expecting this to hit me so hard but i was just like may only a couple months ago i was in a job i hated surrounded by negative people and didnt think itd be bad if i just vanished after seeing a psychologist and talking through with him im writing a novel and going back to school im finally excited for my life and whats coming so im glad a game like this exists i have a bad relationship with my father made hp fanfics since im 11 im living with bipolar disorder i always tried to solve my and others problems but that shit got too heavy and almost two years ago someone pushed me to seek help so i did and when this feelings that the game showed been there i got trough them even better so this game was really good i felt it also the art style is lovely but yeah shit hurts and i really cherish the people who help because most dont feel comfortable with mental illness and do not get involved in that portion of you thanks for brightening my day you help more than youd think your my alternative to self harm when i feel miserable i can always count on you to remind me how to smile thank you sen this was an emotional rollercoaster and i mightve cried a little oo thanks to this video im thinking about looking into therapy ive always thought i didnt need it and im not in the darkest point in my life i personally believe im at the happiest point but i think because of what ive been through now i think my past does affect me more than i thought so thank you for being so honest and reminding me i deserve help whenever i am feeling down and thinking about bad things i like to think about what ive come so far for what ive lived these 16 years for and what i want to see tomorrow when i wake up im not a super active fan of yours but i watch your videos when i cant sleep i found this video and i cant stop crying i feel exactly like this and that speech you gave for most of the video speaks volumes to me thank you so much jacksepticeye you are such an inspiration i really love this video thank you the artstyle why is my life so meaningless my family wont accept that im depressed and they say that depression is not allowed but no matter what i say i am ignored im miserable and it feels like life so worthless my family hates what i want to do in my life and what i feel is constantly validated and i feel like everything is miserable in my life is worth nothing and that if i move forward no one will believe me if i tell anyone though to see a liar because i always just ugly im fine i was up to say that im not upset and i am always perfect but if i dont tell anyone i dont know no love or feel about myself so i have a few right now im negative emotions i was thinking what would happen to others is it one town and i was the person who decided i dont belong life is tuff 2054 so i think what the dream means is the snowstorm is mays pain and shes getting lost in it the person jack is playing calls out for her which indicates her trying to help may but it isnt enough and may walks deeper into the snowstorm therefore the player cant see her anymore because may disappeared which indicates her committing suicide 3131 im dead i do that to my friends all the time and i always end up winning rawr xd thank you so much for those last twenty minutes of you just talking about mental health and all the adjecant stuff it really means a lot also dont feel like you made the game all about yourself i think thats exactly what a game like this is for to connect and find yourself in it and find hope too ugh the 10 minute rant at the end about himself i went thru this with so many friends that i thought would never do anything like that and than missed that i had been going through it myself and i was just wanted to help them though it and stop worrying about myself so i have been just pushing it away not trying to fix myself and just trying to fix them that i got to the point of cutting myself to just hide it from every one so i could help them and they not worry about helping me till it got bad and one of them notice then everyone started worrying about me and all i said was im fine guys i know that im not right mental healthwise i know this ive tried to tell my parents but my dad doesnt really believe in mental illnesses and my mom refuses to let me get medication or let me see a therapist that isnt preapproved by her aka a strict catholic that wont tell me that its okay that im a lesbian and that in itself has made me feel so much worse but its videos like this stolen time on the internet that help me get through so much of the shit that happens in my life or the little things that push me over the edge as you so aptly put it its times like this where i can forget everything bad and just laugh like i always love to do like youre always able to make me do i know youre not going to see this but i wanted to put it out there ive been a fan of yours since mid2017 and i remember that christmastime when you first said you were having these problems and needed to take time for yourself honestly that was such a jack using theythem pronouns makes me happy the foundation vine is so he broke up with me why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars we werent designed at all you have no idea how much that speech at the end touched me thank you so fucking much for being the person you are im usually not much of a comment person but thank you for being the super positive person most of the time and still being able to understand to feel and to help to talk about all of this openly without hesitation it is so important to talk about any kind of mental problems at all times because they are always there and you have this amazing way of talking about that kind of stuff when i see people that have such a positive view on things they mostly tend to only do this happy stuff and deny theres any bad in the world or even talk others problems down describing them as not that bad or just a bad day it feels so good to have somebody like you on this platform somebody to acknowledge the bad things not ignore them and somebody who can openly speak about it and spread more awareness i see so many people old and young joke about it all and make it seem like a weakness to talk about feelings telling others to get over it i just really really apprecia thank you so much for this i support you 100 and i hope that other people see themselves in this and decide that they want things to be better for them and begin their journey i watch your video for who you are and no for the person i want you to be even youre not the same a appreciate you woah i remember playing this 3 months ago thank you i wish i had friends but i dont need them cuz i always got betrayed so i cant really trust people man this video hit hard i relate so much to this game and to you and thank you so much for opening up it means a lot and i can tell you genuinely care 446 fall out boy every time i watch this video i get happy since he says my name but even though i know that he isnt directing it to me hehe qwq how perfect the shirt hes wearing is for this video you wont ever become irrelevant because thats not something a person can become 3 youre you sean and your videos make me so so happy i hope youll keep doing them for a long time but if you dont or if you start posting less frequently thats okay too you do make the world a more optimistic place youve taught me quite a lot about enjoying myself and just having fun with your videos yeah youre an influencer but you exist for yourself first and foremost we all appreciate the effort you make how you care about the people who watch your content but dont ever forget to be with the ones you love too in your personal life you owe us nothing not a single part of your life not a single part of yourself that you dont want to show to us thanks for everything you bright up my day a hug from brazil damn this game is so underrated i played this recently and was blown away by just how amazing it is i wish more people played this ive been watching sean for 56 years it feels like and he still gets to me with the speeches i can relate so much thank you sean thank you for helping me through dark times im truly grateful your made me so much happier during my dark and rough days which come across often and during anxiety attacks i just watch some videos of yours and i calm down and get a tiny bit happier now my life will end soon im sorry your help wasnt enough i plan to leave on the 5th september 2019 i just want to say goodbye and how much i admire you for your hard work no one knows how i feel im not diagnosed with anything

amazing person youve achieved so much im so proud of you 3 ill miss youre videos yours sincerely kai thanks sean w so much haha your talk really made me cry ive been thinking of suicidal thoughts likeatleast once or twice a week theres been lots of things happening and i dont know why my mind is a mess thank you for being able to talk about this and im able to talk to a friend because of this i never really saw help from others as a choice because noone really cared because of my melancholic nature i just want to say all in all thank you for being you ily sean do what u need for as much i as i loved u screwing and swearing ur channel will never die if u still care about ur content and ur fans i love never stop watching bc ur talks like this is why ive kept watching and how u have saved so many lives jack this game is made by angela me um i dont make games thank you i needed this i really did the scissors at 3240 i have always wanted to go to the desert and look at all the stars too bad i live in the middle of nowhere dreams crushed remember you only have one life so just live it to the fullest do what you love yeah money is important but your own happiness is more valuable i love you jack youre a beautiful person then and now you inspire me this game this video jacks speech it hits home so damn hard that it hurts the deepbone tiredness feels like you want to give up on everything because you feel like youll would fucup wishing to just do the things you love is my dream reallyi remembered these feelings of last year i felt like i wasnt getting anywhere in life and doing things i wasnt happy doing at all made me feel this heartwrenching deep tiredness of living the same routine i felt like feel likei didnt have time for myself and explore my hobbieshonestly all ive ever wanted to do was shut the world out look we love you thank you for doing so much for us but thank you for loving and giving and doing so much for yourself too im so glad and proud and just inspired from your 20 minute talk i listened to every second of it i cried thank you so much this game is so good 3 i really appreciate this video thank you thank you thank you for sharing your personal struggles and focusing on yourself it really shows in your content because you seem more genuine than youve ever been and everything you make seems to benefit as you improve upon loving yourself your past and present thoughts difficulties and experiences help people like me to know that they arent alone that even someone they look up to like you have the same struggles the decision to reach out for help and to take a step back for yourself can be one of the hardest to make it wont be easy at first but as you go along and start looking back to where you were youll realize that you made the right choice finding someone to talk to whether it be a friend a professional or even just inner dialogue at first is never easy and wont always go right on the first second or fifth try but you have to keep going because you never know what amazing days could be lying ahead if you dont fight to see them now that was a tan thank you for this really if youre ever feeling alone there are people online that can make the world seem a bit brighter there are numbers you can call to let out your pain you can go on welcoming pages i heard the warm sides of tumblr help people places like that people will help you its surprising how much a stranger online will want to save you youre strong keep fighting i love you 3 edit this is for people looking for signsthis is all i know from seeing signs myself and helping people bit more on edge distancing picture like smiles random longs sleevesjeansbigger shirts i was cried when i finished the game hey sean thank you hearing how you felt and still feel and your thoughts and advice is so nice to hear to know that youve been through similar stuff and got out of it gives me so much hope 2017 was super bad for me too it was kinda the start of everything bad and i really didnt think there was a way out but two years later and im doing so much better i still get thoughts i always will but i dont wanna die anymore thank u for always being able to make me feel happy and hopeful i really appreciate and love u anyone need a hug because i sure do this is the only video that made me cry i think you are awesome and i really appreciate you this is heart breaking yet you made my heart smile i just found out you made a video on this game i played it before you and it is truly a good game im so glad i watched this thank you for saying all that you said jack when you said so many other people seem like theyre doing so much more than you all the time but theyre not that really got to me i actually cried genuinely during this video haha but well also always support you jack its okay to disconnect yourself sometimes we understand life is gonna be a bitch and will always be but theres always good sides to life as well the little things like the wind blowing through your hair on an autumn day little things like that make me appreciate life just a little more and i hope others can appreciate the small things as well maybe thatll help someone out there who knows i havent commented on a video in so long ive been watching jack and other youtubers for atleast 5 years or longer out of every youtuber ive watched the only one that meant something to me ive never stopped watching and helped me grow along side them was sean of course everyone will miss the changes hes made to the channel and to himself but seeing him grow really has helped me grow in ways that i wasnt sure i could there are people in my personal life that ive reached out and talked to also that has helped me grow it is not just sean influencing it times when youre struggling you need the comfort and support from the people who care about you and the things that you most enjoy there have been times that ive had dark thoughts about why things were happening to me and causing such pain that i wasnt sure if i wanted to continue living since then ive gained a new perspective on my life and havent tried to please so many people to make sure they were happy my happiness matters too shaun we will always listen to you we know your human like us we are always here for u i dont think anyone will see this and this comment will disappear in the comments soon but i just wanted to vent even if no one sees this there are many days where i cant get the motivation to move or get out of bed a lot of time my only happiness comes from my friends after ive lost most of my hobbies i honestly did relate so much to may and something about it made my eyes open a bit more i wish i could talk to my friends but im scared that id become too much so i bottle it inside because i dont want to lose what i have i hope for the best for others going through similar stuff i want to be more open but personally im afraid since i dont want to lose everything and i cant seem to be myself good luck to all who also deals with similar stuff someone out there cares about you youll find them dont worry thanks sean for playing this game and dedicating a chunk of this video for a heart to heart ads put themself in front of the door opening part on purpose i know anyone from philippines i wish more youtubers would talk about this this hit home i found a gap of joy and enjoyment in this i felt bad but you made my day and your words made me cry which is rare ha but you helped me alot and the comment you put also helped you are more than a youtuber you are the navigation for what every youtuber should be like i love you as a person i respect and a role model for me you can say i admire you immensely 100 and i wish i have that moment to meet you and get to know you on a personal level one wish i would like before i pass but dont take it personally because that is selfish wish love chris k im crying just imagining having a friend who looks out for me like the main character do they have a name idk i relate to may in a lot of ways and it really does feel sometimes like no one is really looking out for me besides myself fuck i feel that shit and i dont know how to talk about it we love you jack i am so thankful for your content and especially for how open youve been with us throughout all these years your talks have been so meaningful and helpful for me and so many others thank you so much its great that you have more time for yourself and that you are living more peacefully and i promise we can all still feel how much you love this community mate this guys made it big i fucking love this guy much love i just wanted to give you a hug when you started crying i would cry too like i am now your words brought piece to my mind i

little happier however im still extremely depressed a lot and watching your videos make me feel so much happier you and your channel will forever have a special place in my heart love ya jack at 2127 when she was talking about the epidemic what if she was talking about her depressionsuicidal thoughts because thats actually becoming a type of epidemic in recent years and her friend saving her in the dream was actually her saving her from going through with what she was planning on doing this is such a realistic representation were often in our own worlds not always thinking about others

because they want their family to be proud of them sean i know you wont read this but i really mean it you do so much for your community and maybe you dont realize it as much as you should just the

love that you can open up and reach out to your fans and that we can also feel that appreciation from you personally for each of us individually there are a lot of us out here and not many people are as talentedspecial as you to be able to do that and its amazing thank you soo much for this video and your commentary it means the world to so many of us and especially for me a lot of us needed this you should make another channel just where you take about things 2947 do you believe in the ancient surgical procedure of blood letting 2651 heck yeah i dont even know what day it is lol the song playing during jacks date with goth gf is losing interest timmies 3 437 lol the guy in the background is actually loathing the people hugging lol not that i am i almost clicked away from the video before his speech but i am so glad i didnt i really needed this thank you jack im really glad i watched this video all the way through i havent been having the best week mentally just been feeling so empty but so filled with anxiety at the same time this video has made me feel happy and weirdly relieved i guess ha ha thank you i didnt realize how far off i was until you opened up here you are valid and im glad youre better the pink girl reminds me of myself tho i havent cut i been on the verge for a couple of weeks this video is really similar to his play through of far from noise to me ive watched both of them late at night finding myself relating heavily and both times ive stopped looked at the ceiling and cried while listening these videos are part of the reason why i love this channel theres the fun stuff when youre happy or need a pickmeup and then theres this kind of thing where even though youre actively watching something you can take a breather from life and i dunno that just makes me really happy who would dislike this he was literally talking about getting help if you were thinking about suicide and helping you out with your own life jackaboy quit this sentimental shit before i cry i feel you though i need to cry but my foundation was 48 did anyone notice shiloh dynasty singing in the background when they were laying on the roof i like these kind of games the story they tell and the emotion it gives off is just so phenomenal jack i have to say i went through a long time of being low and went through the things in this game you heloed in dark times knowing you were human still were so awesome helped me stay true to you the youtube and real life you we love you just the way you are 1424 irrelevant to the beautiful game but the trans flag on her room made my heart go oop you matter a lot to me sean and you matter to a lot of others as well i can relate to you on so many levels you help me as well you have impacted my life on so many levels i hope that you can stay happy and dont let others get to you thank you for being you and not changing because of what others say thanks again that speech hit me the title of the game says it all sometimes you look elsewhere because you dont see whats right in front of you and you miss the most important message and then its too late to go back if you take a choice youll miss the other anyways but at least may is alive and now i wanna ship these two im bisexual for the girls in this game man im crying right now can u please react to cosplayers cosplaying u i didnt even know i needed this but thank you hope you hang in there jack love your videos 2154 hit really close to home for me im only in high school but my mom makes me feel a hundred and twelve last school year i had a b in my english class i was fine with it because it was a high b and i was gonna pass with it my mom found out and when i got home one day my mom was furious i mean yelling middle name everything i went into her room and she said why do you have a b i said did less than perfect on an assignment but it was fine she goes its not fine you should have all as in all your classes year round you just arent trying you need to be more responsible i was already having a rough day i had a headache i was late to school and had a pop quiz in algebra i just wanted to go lie down and take a break from the world but i had to sit in there and listen to my mom scream at me because im not trying hard enough naturally i start crying and my mom goes you baby and sends me away i wet by the kitchen grabbed a knife and went at 2750 i just saw that she had her arm under mays head so she could use it as a pillow i know that this comment is a month late from when you posted it and will probably be drowned in the other comments but id like to start by saying thank you sen for going over this game and these topics its really helped some days and even now i feel tired and just dont want to do anything and have had the what if thoughts before but thanks to you ive stayed positive and managed to get out of these places from personal reflection too your advice is truly very helpful and has helped many people including myself through dark times id like to also say that im glad you reiterated that your a normal person and like a friend to us and like any friend needs personal things and time to themselves its good to hear youve matured and grown and took care of yourself also and to be fair in my opinion the people that say you have changed is good as change is a natural thing and youve become more like yourself and not necessarily a persona of the past this part may be a bit its weird you mentioned how sometimes people think no one cares about them in my experiance i know everyone cares i had a lot of suicidal thoughts at one period of time but everyone cared about me i knew everyone cared and for me that was the worst i dont know why anyone else felt like that one part of me thought fuck now suicide is out of the question because i will ruin my family i will ruin my friends its really strange that most people want others to care whereas here i fucking am complaining about it thank you jack when you said that this happens more than what people realiseanother thing is that it happens but people believe its not to a far enough degree you can not say and not show and when you explain to someone they dont see physical proof and dont believe that youve held the pills in your hands or the knife to your wrist its a world of competition that if youre not bad enough they see you as attention seeking this video hit home to me too and im sorry youve gone through this i was not emotionally ready for this lifechat as soon as he cut deep i started crying i cant even explain why god just having a friend to just talk to about everything is amazing someone who wont judge you or hate you for what you say or what you are sometimes its that my parents wont listen to or believe and just having a best friend to sit and talk it helps ground me and relaxes me a lot 4214 or something everything is not avoidible this is so tuching and relatible thank you sean ive been needing an extra push lately since ive been dealing with this kind of stuff but i wanted to love myself so i could go back to the bubbly happy person i used to be but i dont have to that was just one side of me i used for show i can be myself here in the real world and not have to hide who i truly am i may be ugly but idc i work with it i may be fat but me and so many people love my chub i may act depressed all the time but thats cuz i am i need help but ill work with myself to get better im going on a tangent now but know sean i love the character you put out but i bet id love the the real you even more keep up the amazing work dont listen to people who say your channels dying theyre wrong its thriving even if it were dead id still be here til the end your channel isnt dying and i hope that you dont worry too much about that there are people like me who are only just finding you and loving you and your videos more and more still do things which make you happy sean even if that doesnt feel like what the fans want you dont have to tell us everything we are happy when you are please stop clicking the dislike button we all know you meant to click like the things you said in this video made me thought about too much like i really understood you in some way i felt like you were inside my head and i really really appreciate you for being who you are and thats a part of what i wanted to say to you im very very proud of you your speeches are such a big part of the hope i still have in life and my own self i could never thank you enough for taking the time to talk to us it means a lot to me its like you reached out your hand and i took it you inspire me thank you for being who you are im so grateful to be here listening to you thank you thank you thank you thank you im gonna keep it simple been there can relate to may and jack because it fucking sucks man it hurts like hell but let me tell you one thing dont give up becouse if you keep going and try to sort things out try to find help etc it will get better but you dont know when so you just gotta keep fighting believe me its worth it i think 2130 is a reference to another game angela made its called grey plague i played it and its honestly an amazing experience artworks are beautifully done the story is original and simply great and the fantastic music choice is back big recommend jack is a lesbian confirmed this is why i look up to and respect sean he is not afraid to talk about depression and he is brave enough to be open with his viewers he constantly gives hope and support to everyone yet we hardly give back i want to say thank you for the support the motivation and for being an amazing dude jack we love you block all the haters block all of the bad thoughts even if you take a break for yt all of the real fans will still be here for you just be you we will love you the way you want to be its not our decision love yourselfbe yourself and do what you want to do hearing you tell me to chase the happiest life i can havethank you jack i honestly dont feel that i deserve happinessthat all the horrible things happening to me i deserve them sothank you for your kind words is it weird that this just made me want to die more at the part around 2000 i cried because im suicidal and my friend hates talking about that and doesnt even want to sit down and talk to me about it ever i want to kill myself and i plan on it once i find a way that isnt painful my only friend hates me because sometimes i accidentally say something suicidal whatever i feel connected to this game more on the heavy weighted depression anxiety and self negative thoughts about myself and everything and how i fear the mental health care helpers would not help me like i hoped it to be i know you cant cure expression but itd be nice to not be tired from the constant crying i miss the old days without me overthinking about stuff w i also feel connected with the whole parents pressure my mom doesnt really yell but i know she wants the best for me out of love i just feel like i cant do much compared to others my age and all i do is draw and game but even that is fading cause getting exposure isnt that easy to get noticed i always draw with love and happiness it would just be nice to get complimented that i did something right and the past of not knowing what to do id love to draw all day every day but i fear what others might think im the worst negative critique to my own art that i love doing some days feel so the and i have a tik tok vid about that im sad this really helped me and im only nine and im sad sometimes thatbi think that do better then me at everthing by them self so i feel annoying jack you are amazing ive never wanted to cry so much in a video in while im not going through anything major right now but it reminded of stuff i have been through and you were just so inspiring thank you jack youve helped a lot of people through your videos everyone who is going through bad times please please please let someone in and persevere cause it does get better he never fails to inspire me i am sorry you had to go throut that we all grew with and we are here i lost a friend from suicide not to long ago you never know when someone needs help so just be nice dont cry ahhhhhh my love this shit touched me man and while i couldnt relate to all of it i feel like everyone who watched this video could relate to at least one thing that jack had said to him it must have seemed like he was ranting and going on a tandem but it was so much more than that he was spewing out life advice that we knew really meant something important and could help everyone reflect and realize whats really important in life this one hit home for me i love who you are no matter who you feel you need to be sean you be the best you i will still be here even if everyone else leaves people need to remember that their best self is always a work in progress 3 im going through something like this but not exactly i cant explain it thanks for the talk sean i know its weird but i feel you like a genuine friend of mine i have so so much to say about this but i wouldnt even know where to start so im just gonna say thank you this game was absolutely beautiful and it hit so close to home for me and for everything you said thank you so much it meant more than i can describe3 this the game i wanted u to play cuz the story was good when i played it jack i want to give you a virtual hug hi sean i am a single mom 47of two girls 18 and 14 and we have been watching you since you started your channel you have helped us through the darkest times and i mean dark you were the one who made us laugh you were our constant we made and still make sure we sit at the dinner table and watch you together you were the one thing that helped us through everything i want to thank you for that the past three years have been extremely difficult for us more then i can say but thanks to you we pulled through it we found joy and laughter and hope so if you ever doubt your self again please think of what i just said my girls and i are forever grateful and keep up the amazing job you are doing thank you again dont you just think what goes though someones mind when they dislike a video like why did they have to dislike man i need me a may appreciate you opening up sean you really are helping people very touching game even more touching talk ive been in both places i think people forget especially on the internet that people grow up and that means change it doesnt mean bad it just means different and that scares people you have changed but i dont think its bad you seem so happy and truly living life and enjoying it i remember when you used to be so lonely because you had no friends in your life seeing how many people you have now makes me so happy to see youve grown and youve changed ive grown through the years and i dont religiously watch this channel like i used to but i still watch it i still enjoy it more than any other channel and im so happy for how far youve come in your career and what seems like your personal life just enjoy life thats all we can ask of you and that goes for everyone i know this was like a month ago but i cant help but coming back to this ive never cried so damn hard during a while video in my life thank you angela for making this game really appreciate it lolmao i listen to this 540 i loved the game i made sure i had found all 4 endings because i couldnt leave it unfinished its a small masterpiece i wish i could thank angela herself for it it hit hard becausewell i never actually did try kill myself but sometimes i felt pretty damn close to i started to think about this stuff some years ago i was dating this cute girl we met live 12 years ago in school but i moved way from the small town i was from to the big city i wont mention names or places so dont bother 2 years after i moved away i start thinking about the friends i had in my old school so i used facebook to track them down and to catch up i was never the popular guy or had the looks or been good with the ladies i was very shy and just had a year being bullied which made me change school again thank god stuff improved a lot i was still very shy but i made 2 huge friends by then anyway back to facebook and to my old colegues i couldnt find them all but i did find my best friend from th i actually like how he is more now its authentic and hes much happier when she mentioned she wrote about harry potter fanfiction i felt my heart sink my boyfriend whos been dealing with depression for a while now writes the very same things we live so far apart that its impossible for me to meet up with him until i get a car but i worry about him every single night talk to him all day im just so worried about him hes really struggling its been 3 years of struggling it made me tear up were both transgender and the people around him havent been as accepting as they should be i really hope we can meet up soon so i can hug him and take him away from everything that ever made him hurt but sometimes i worry i might be too late i recently had a very important conversationintervention with one of my best friends my protagonist if you will ive been going through rough stuff and she inspired me to have hope i have to try to get better and thats really hard and i dont always want to do it but i will this game reminded me of that i have to have hope i hope everyone has a lovely day 3 i just really want to thank you for this sean i didnt know this was what i needed this talk im glad to crossed path with this video and im just really thankful im in that moment where youre just fresh out of high school and you just feel so lonely and depressed in your apartment and theres no one to talk to yes i do have friends and families but i dont have the heart to share to them how i feel because somehow i felt like im going to let them carry my problem with me by doing that and i dont wanna be a burden to anyone so yeah i may have rambled too much but im just gonna say thanks for saying this because thats what i needed to hear thank you sean for reminding us all that it is ok to be human and feel things i got physically bullied today not even the teachers noticed nobody cared i had friends online and i want to vent out to them but i didnt want to disturb them i was planning to just bottle up all these emotions i planned to just kill myself cause i feel like i already reached my breaking point i had homework i needed to do but i decided to watch this video instead and then the speech holy crap i had to get inside my own closet so my family wouldnt hear my trying to choke back loud tears im getting small tears just typing this out i dont even know what to say but this video helped me cry out those painful tears i tried to hold back i think i can push through my journey isnt solved nor is it finished but i think i can carry on just a bit longer thanks sean when sean opened up i nearly cried i just wanna find the creator and give her a hug bro btw jack youre amazing js damn i know im late but you made me tear up a bit lol soo ive not been able to watch jafks videos for eight months and i forgot how frickin loud he is lol my volume was up a lot and its really late at night does anyone know the jazz musicsong at the start hello psychology major here i just want to let you know what yes although we are technically getting paid to help you our number one priority is to help you to be there for you to give you advice and to help you figure things out and become better if anyone needs someone to talk to i am here please come to me i love this community so much thank you jack for bringing us all together your words mean so much and im so proud of you and what youve done and are doing trigger warningmy friend attempted suicide twice i was there for one of em and god its been tearing me apart ever since that was four years ago and i know i saw the signs but i ignored them ill always regret not doing anything sooner than i did the thought of her succeeding kills me inside and ill never forget the look on her face and her eyes my god her eyes i dont know what id do without my best friend and im lucky to have her today some may not be as fortunate if you see signs or think there are signs please please try to reach out to them even if they arent considering it its better to reach out than to regret it way later hi sean if youre in any way insecure about how youre handling things now that is totally okay but let me tell you how you describe your mental improvement and how youre trying to make life happier for yourself how youre putting yourself first and learning to enjoy life it warms my heart you always tell us were doing great so let me throw that right back at you haha youre an amazing person your duty is to yourself first and foremost end of story and it sounds like you know that also there is no right way to do things nothing is black and white what we love about you is that you try your hardest to be a good person and thats all we ask youre still human you get tired you grow you change as a person we understand also youre sorry if you seem more disconnected from the community dude if its because youre sipping coffee and reading a book and enjoying life then dont be also personally i didnt even notice whenever y thank you i have these thoughts sometimes and i feel like thats a lot of the time and i do desperately want to reach out people but i dont feel comfortable sharing things with people i dont know my friends yea i could go to but some will just tell me to get checked by a doctor before i come talking about depression and being this way which i completely understand you should self diagnose my other friends i dont feel as close as my best friend is busy most the time so i dont really even get to talk to her on a normal basis i cant go to my parents because of some of the reasons why i think i feel this way my other family members would say the same things and act the same way my parents would i go to a therapist but i dont trust her because i only get to see her once a month and shes my new therapist and i felt so much better with my old one because she made me feel like i could just open up to her because i felt like i knew her for years ice bear its hard to stay strong when you have nothing to live for i started crying because at the end when the game was done i wanted to click away or distract myself but i couldnt because it hit close as well but i couldnt click away so while it was playing i opened up my instagram and jack began talking about not using phones often to help as soon as i opened up my insta the first post to show up was one of those messages saying how special you are and how you should always be yourself thanks for being here sean thanks for everyone being here even if i dont know you and you dont know me i felt mays problem with writing although my parents dont make fun of me for it my brother sometimes does and it feels as if i could never be successful with it like everything has already been written and everything is written better than i could ever write i still write regardless but sometimes i wonder if its even worth it i appreciate you and the talk after i just played the game it was a steam recommendation then found you played it and its good to have the talk after i love and respect you so much jackie sean b this really brought me to tears thats why i started my own channel it may not be much or like all youtubers but its helping me and makes me happy you are very good at sending out good messages thank you to you and to angela he this game was beautifully done is there more endings 428 wtf does fall out boy there lmao 3247 damn that hit me hard thanks jack 3 luv you if you want to keep the mood light just keep scrolling so i am currently in a relationship where the other person only wants me for sex and nudes i am ignoring their messages of requests for nsfw pictures i am realizing that we never actually talk about anything except for ex even when i try to change the subject i have missed messages that i dont want to read but i dont want to break up with him because it will mildly inconvenience him and i hate hurting people even if its a little this has been the case for every single one of my relationships 020 seconds in and im realizing that no one has ever loved me as i loved themouch may oh yeah its your birt ad have you ever wanted better deodorant this is amazing this message is for everyone you are enough there are people in the world who are going to make you feel like youre not good enough the way you are and they want to change you into their idea of perfect there is no perfect and someone elses idea of what makes a good person may be right for them and yet not be right for you it is okay to be you it is okay to not be what others want you to be its okay to not be perfect anyone trying to make you feel like you arent good enough its because they see a failing in themselves that they find uncomfortable to recognize and acknowledge and theyre trying to put that on you maybe out of malice maybe just so they dont have to feel so alone in the world but you are enough exactly the way you are never forget that for the 893 people who disliked fight me when i was at my darkest time i felt like i couldnt trust anyone the person i loved and trusted most became one of the reasons i fell so deep during this time you sean started heavily advertising pma and along with me starting to meditate starting to take a break from everything starting to just let thoughts pass without holding on to them that was part of the reasons i kept on going kept on looking forward to this day i still feel tired most of the time and still have the occasional suicidal thoughts but it has gotten so much better and i want to thank you for that and yes sean you have changed but for the better youre way more serious no longer just the loud irish guy but someone to take serious someone that helps people someone with a message and to everyone being at their lowest try meditating it helps a bunch if you need someone to talk to contact me ill try my best to help you but also i advise you to get some professional help ill do so too in the near futu im at the moment going through depression and selfharm my parents and some of my friends know ive had depression since the beginning of 2017 or 2018 im not sure ive just been feeling inhuman if that makes sense in august im going to start going to a therapist and talk about how my life on a daily basis is like and with this i want to say that you definitely not alone talking absolutely helps maybe not the first time but over time itll help and dont be afraid to reach out love you whoever is reading this 3 thank you for sharing for anyone out there not wanting to continue you are worth it and ill listen if you have something on your mind anyone recognized shilos music sean you need to relax take a break when you want i dont care most people will not care if you take a break sean if you see this wich you will probably not but still if you need to relax being healthy and relaxed is worth maybe a couple 100 or 1 thousand views compared to the views it may seem like alot and is probably alot but it does not matter your health matters and your mental state matters a couple of loss views for no reason dont matter you matter if you push yourself it always ends bad dont do it chill and relax and take a break if you played it before its nothing youre not used to you only want with the antisuicide closest to you come on jack theyre both suicidal happy ending is if you can save them both sean i really get where your coming from we all have our moments we all learn from our past we all grow up eventually the you on your past was someone i looked up to and you still are you are still a good person and you are fun to watch i get that all the negativity can get to you sometimes but i really hope you dont give into the sad things and keep on doing what you love i will always support you also im happy you put this out here there are so many people who are suffering and are in the dark place cause of the things that they shouldnt be caring about i hope this could help at least some people out there really people you should just fart on the haters and move on sean honestly when i heard you speaking at the end i remembered how about 3 years ago i decided to look for help after watching a lot of your videos where you kept saying that there are different ways that talking to others actually helped and it fucking did im alive i still strugle with the same things but now i know that i can get out of it and that i am not alone now i can actually look at the scars on my wrist and be proud of being alive and do things that will make me happy anyways i just wanted to say thank you for always being there for me and saying the things that make me feel like my life is worth something and that i deserve to be happy again thank you sean hey jack i really want to say that the motivation you give and how you talked about that really felt good and i really want to thank you for that and i want to thank you for talking about that and sharing it because it really felt good to listen to it and i really do get you with how you are and that stuff i do get that and i just want to throw out how much of a great loving person you are its always fun watching your videos and everything you said is tottaly true so again thank you for throwing that out i never told it to some one but i sometimes think about it and this video changed my mind about it all thank you for speaking up about mental health and sharing your thoughts it means a lot sean youve helped this community a lot youre my hero sean thank you for this video plus dont worry i understand what you said this game and seans talk at the end yes sean because thats him talking not jack helped me put things into perspective for me ive been feeling burnt out recently and because of this video i realized i need to take a step back and breathe because the world will keep turning if i do it or not thank you for this video much appreciated i must admit i havent watched jacks videos in a while i just felt like i didnt enjoy his videos and him in general anymore as i used to he changed a lot and he is not the jacksepticeye i was used to years ago some people stopped following him because of it and at some point i did too but i was kinda still there though just really behind but yesterday i thought about all of it should i change this and come back will i click out or will i stay i promised myself that ill watch at least one of his videos in the morning well i actually kept my promise and finally went to the channel after months i decided to watch this video and man i cried actually the game was absolutely beautiful and is the one that really catches your breath and the stuff that he said after playing it made me realize that hes still that man i always loved so thank you sen for everything your words were really important and needed itll take some time to catch up to the things youve jack one of the first videos i saw of yours was the beginners guide your warmth helped me during a falling out with a once best friend you brought my mind some peace you know sean i think a lot of your fanbase will agree with me when we say thank you what you choose to share is yours to choose and we wont be mad at you if you need to hold back sometimes i hope they can take your words to heart me since my birthday ive been heavily depressed and afraid to go get a diagnosis about the lumps i found i found the only reason i cant let myself die its because there could always be that day where im in the right place when someone really needs my help and as for all of you fellow fans hes right you are not alone i dont do twitter anymore havent for years but if any of you want to help me get this message to him id be grateful with my personal experience writing has really most of the time i didnt know what my feelings were and didnt know how to start but i would just come up with incredibly fanciful stories and different worlds i highly reccomend it you can write about your feelings or you can create new universes in your mind my mind was a big ball of jumbled yarn and writing helped me find one end of that string and start detangling it all whoever reads this do what makes you happy and dont let anyone tell you not to if you dont know what makes you happy take some time to figure it out everything will become clear in the future take deep breaths and appreciate each one oh crap not hp fanfics so i know this video has been out for some time now but i just watched it and im crying so hard i related to every single line from may and a lot from sean too i felt their pain as i felt and still feel sometimes my own in my darkest days this is just one of the best videos ive ever watched specially for someone who has been or is going through depression i find it awesome that sean does both funny and serious videos and i feel really fuckin lucky to be part of this community thank you all not a native english speaker i apologize any mistakes sean thank you thank you for everything we all appreciate you so so much this made me so incredibly sad yet so touching thank you to the creator of this game for understanding peoples sadness thank you for opening up and sharing it really meant a lot love you she dont get the shaft if she dont play the sax the end of this video made me cry jack please play butterfly soup when jack predicted the uno reverse thank you for making this video this game also hit home for me as well and im glad you made a video on this subject because mental health is important we all have those days weeks or even months where we are not in a good place and it is hard at first to ask for help or want help honestly its a fear of mine that i cant help someone who needs it because im a piece of shit and dont know how to help someone who is in that kind of situation i fear it so much that someone i love or someone i know is in that situation and i dont know it or dont know how to help i just want everyone to be happy but that is impossible its also weird that i kind of saw little bit of me in that may character i just feel like im tired for no reason and because of that i sometimes find myself crying for no reason been talking about these feelings to my family best friend and to my schools nurse that helps alot yeah i played this game before before i saw this video and it was so sad and i actually cried 449 game you want to go want to go out with me jack immediately moves his mouse to no i havent watched your videos in a while and for that im sorry but i feel like coming back to your channel and this being the first video that i watch is a huge sign for me ive been feeling so down and out of place lately i havent felt like doing anything and ive felt like i was drowning even though i havent kept up with you you are always here to bring me back up during my bad times and i could never be more grateful for you thank you sean and im so happy that youre still here and i hope youre able to keep your head up and if not thats okay too like you said we all have our days just dont leave this world sooner than your time stay strong i love you the end of this video the positive message of dont compare or feel like life isnt going where you want it to just take your own time and get there is something i genuinely needed to hear and im tearing up writing this thank you for being so open and honest with your fans its something that is really vulnerable to do i will continue to support you and your content this is one of the main reasons youre one of my favorite youtubers to watch its sooo important to talk to people about mental health and think about it this single rant you went on about various mental topics has to have helped at least one viewer i value mental health and helping people a great deal and im in a mental health club at my high school im going to introduce pma to the club and hope it goes places i really want it to do wonders for others just like it has done for me oh and btw we 100 know you care3 never feel bad about going on these tangents dadsepticeye btw i loved this pls play more games like this oh this is sad 2340 i stfg thats what i am reading like right now right now what are the odds lmaoo thank u so muchsean this helped me with life i was just like this irl thank u for helping me and yeah this makes me so sad were here for you these moments when he stops playing to talk to you as the viewer realistically its really inspirational and i love watching him for it tbh i was hoping that the game was an hour long based on the video this makes me think of my life on a moredeepdarkermaybe just a more intense version of my lifeless bloodless suicidal thoughtsmall scars instead of bigthe only difference is that she had ppl that cared i cried so much in this video u have no idea its a good thing thank u in that second ending that you played may reminded me of myself and i wish someone had sat down with me and talked with me during the hard times i went through i made it through though and im glad i made it this far i can now see the world and love almost every moment of it your videos helped a lot during the dark times and i want to thank you for being yourself in your videos as someone i can laugh with i dont mean to be dramatick but im litterly crying may is the type of person we need to savehelplove ive been there my parents yelled at mei cried every nightive thought of suicideran away but one day i was savedloved which changed the way i lived and now i want to love and save people like may i may not be the most clever most wise or anything youd consider good amazing or the best but in this world we may be strangers just know i care for you love you we are all one kind and ik not everyone are the samebut theres many others who care and since ive been therei know how it feelsand just keep this in mind youre not alone edit im not sure how to put this in better words so im sorry if this sounds wrong at some point its crazy i dont know how i was able to do it but i felt just like may except i had nobody help me i felt like i couldnt trust anyone so i never opened up and even the closest friends i had seemed to push my cutting and depression deeper into me i finally made it out myself and im so glad that i could get myself back together im not trying to brag about it but ive attempted suicide many times luckily i made it through still i have many moments where i feel like i should end it and i always have to reflect on why and calm myself anyone still reading this and feels any connection with what ive said please find some way to make it through even if you cant find someone to help help yourself its hard its fucking hell its worth it though this video really saved my life thank you sean this game made me cry even though i read the trigger warning man its too real i loved seans speech at the end it gave us a bit of insight to him as a person while still not giving too much away while also showing us again what an amazing inspiration he is thank you sean for brightening my day if even a little bit i may just be in the worst situation for someone with depression and suicidal thoughts somedays i just dont want to be on this earth like i would be a hell of a lot more useful in the next life no one deserves to deal with me my family is splitting apart because of me my mother tried so hard to have me and i ended up coming out a piece of shit a burden a problem i should just end my life and be done with it save everyone alot of time energy resources and pain but at the same time if i took my life my mom would be devastated it would destroy her maybe even literally and thats the problem no one else cares only my mom and its only for her that i continue to live to this day only because of the thought that my mom would suffer for my actions but then at the same time i do that living every day i wonder if the tradeoff would be worth it to save everyone from my problems at the expense of my mothers emotional stability 5 times i have and tried 339 when a yeehaa turns into a yeenaw you are probably one of the most genuine youtubers out there thank you guys omg my cheek is wet what is this what is coming out of my eye oh im crying with youtube news like etika me nooo your gonna make me cry again 700 whats the remix in the background 532 they are actually playing shiloh dynasty this is gonna sound kinda weird but jacks eyes look like the perfect candidate to pencil draw there very bright and lively thus the reason to draw them thanks sean i needed to see this so bad i was dissociating myself from everything including my body because i couldnt handle all the stress im putting myself through my arms didnt feel like mine my job didnt feel like mine i finally just stepped away and walked through some trees and now i feel like im slowly coming back into place with life and am starting to have a more calm mindset the part where you hug her after you find her in the bathroom really hit me it reminded me of when my school guidance counselor told me my friend self harmed so i went looking around the school for her and found her in the schools bathroom i remember crying and hugging her i knew what it felt like to be in that much pain and it hurt to know that i hadnt seen the signs before that ill never forget it unfortunately we lost touch over the years but i hope shes doing better now listening to sean made me think of this quotedont know why i there was a time when i stopped talking just like you my reasons were a little bit different but i think the feelings of being ashamed of myself and hating myself are the same here it says to like yourself what does that mean good things how are you supposed to find them i only know things that i hate about myself because thats all i know i hate myself but even if you force yourself to find good things it feels so empty it doesnt work that way people like your teacher just dont get it i think when you hear someone say they like you for the first time then you can begin to like yourself i think when someone accepts you for the first time you feel like you can forgive yourself a little you can begin to face your fears with courage fruits basket look at the main menu at the start and youll see bloody scissors awh jack is so wholesome i really needed your message jack thank you this is the first time ive ever seen a trans flag in a game your videos have always helped me so much even when some times i dont want to wake up so thank you for helping me through some of the darkest periods of my life headphones all the way up sean top of the me holy fuckin shit jack recently people have been saying oh youve changed so much and dont care about the community and that shit really gets to me everyone time for a fucking crusade im going through some some rn and i got to that point where i just seriously thought about ending it all and the stuff you said was pretty cool and relatable not the youtube and work part but the advice for getting through dark things might help me and i thought it was really cool that you shared that thank u jack thank u i needed that so much shits rough jack i want you to know that its ok u matter more than u think and ur so important thank you for everything i cant say this enough no high five i feel paralyzed when i watch your vids i left for a while and came back to such a great video i enjoy the chill sean instead of the hyper active jack keep up the good work and keep spreading those positive vibes that shiloh dynasty lofi mix gave me life angela he angela hoe angela whhhhhhyyyyy sorry this was the first thing i thought of when he said her name these games are always so blunt i understand the intention but its incredibly unrealistic anyone else realize the song loosing intrest by shiloh dynasty is playing in the background in the beggining seani just wanna say thank you for this real video it cant be perfect every time in life but even if its dark and you feeling lost there are people who care about you i know its hard to believe at moments like this but believe in yourself and dont let life get to you and make you lose yourself im so happy i watched this video because it woke me up again because i realized im not alone so thank you anyone know all the songs in the game i think the main one is losing interest shiloh dynasty but i wished i can get the games version of it on soundcloud or something else so proud that you could get all this out i completely relate to the message of this game and the way you described everything i think these minds of videos where we can connect with a creator is so important especially on a topic like this because life is so hard but seeing other people feel the same way helps us know that we are not alone thank you aw i saw this pop up and ive played this game before seeing this i saw the signs and i couldnt handle walking away from the game without helping may this game is just so emotional i dont think i could ever express how grateful i am for what you shared at the end of the video i needed to hear those words im in a dark place i felt less alone when you shared that thank you i love how the music keeps playing while jack talks about his own depression ive been with you since 2015 stay strong bro thank you sean what you said really spoke to me thank you for opening up about difficult things it helps me to know that i am not alone here are some real life missed messages be careful when you see them goodbye youve been a good friend lately ive been losing interest in things im kind of tired of life in general sometimes i wonder what itd be like if i was gone there are far more but ive found those are the most common ones ask them if theyre depressed then slowly move into the conversation about if theyre suicidal at least thats what id do take that with a grain of salt thank you from the bottom of my heart sean thank you i cant watch anyone else play this without thinking of you playing this game here is the meme random girl why are you looking at the ceiling the girl i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars random girlwtf who the fuck disliked this this is motivational as fuck i had to stop watching this for a while to cry because i began to notice how much i related to may though ive never been suicidal sometimes i wonder if i will get to that point my counselors have always told me its just teen things even though ive been diagnosed i want to get professional help but its scary and nobody supports me it also amazes me that some people have such happy lives they dont worry about everything they had a childhood and they never had a problem its all so hard to believe sean i love you so much edit this nearly made me cry who else can relate to some stuff in this game jack is such a good therapist 1010 would recommend great video as usual and i can relate to what you have been through a lot like most people 2017 was the hardest years of my life both my sisters were taken away and i was left alone in a deep depression with no one to comfort me i even sometimes still get thoughs thoughts but im in a better mind set but where i am right now it sucks and i cant do anything and to anyone dealing with depression right now stay strong and think of the good times you had and the ones you can still make good luck and i care about you even though i dont know you 3810 that little noise though is it just me or jack sometimes sound like gamer meme version of bob ross thank you jack you have no idea how much this video means to me thank you for sharing your thoughts your feelings regarding this particular topic it certainly reached a lot of people because i myself could feel it and to everyone who just happens to read this heres a virtual hug jack god bless your soul for bringing not to all these people you helped a lot of people get through there may experience we ate here for you we love you and if you need to take a day a week a month whatever you need jack thank you for helping us get through our may now you need to finish getting through yours your a human just like us you can care about yourself its ok well be ok were not ok if your not ok so jack please take a few for yourself anyways youve been talking about that lately anyway jack god bless you for what you do for us so what im trying to say is take a gosh darn day off a week off a month off a year off ok maybe not a year but its ok why am i crying sm i watched this late but this had made me feel better just your upbeat voice its hard now to smile jack ive been going through a rough patch and your vids helf so much so what ive learnt from this video and all the comments is that we should all kill ourselves nice thank you im glad i took off my makeup before watching this otherwise it would be all over my pillow and my sheets shit from personal experience every word that jack said at the end of this video is so true every word and this game is spot on anyone who is going through depression of if you know someone having a hard time just reach out everyone goes through stuff some of us have a more difficult time dealing put there is always someone who will listen just reach out jaaaaaack i miss the old u your hair your hat i miss that about u i have been watching your videos since like 2014 but i never leave comments or really interact because i never thought you would see them but i feel like it is very important that i say this on the off chance that you do read it sean you care way too much about what people think i can tell from this video that you are aware of that which is good but you obviously still feel like you need justify taking time for yourself which is so unfair to you even if youtube is your job no one is ever entitled to your entire life and all of your energy you have no reason to feel guilty you cant please everyone and i would hate for you to suffer trying to i hope you know that a lot of your fans care about you on a personal level and care more way more about your wellbeing than what kind of content youre making we want to watch what you want to make and were happy when you seem happy we dont think that you dont care because youre working less your channel should be first and fore jack i was that friend that helped a friend in dark days she believed a rumor about me and is now billing me and i now suffer with depression and suicide everyday and i have no one to talk to i dont have any friends btw my name is shannon and ive even moved out of the city away from her but it still hurts everyday this game gave you a good frame to work off of to get this very important message out people often overlook mental health concerns because of the stigma put on seeking help as well as constantly being told that high levels of stress are just normal for everyone its important to recognize the warning signs of depression and getting help as soon as possible i like that the game included having a bad experience with help in the past and it being discouraging anyone whos had to deal with this kind of thing has a similar story and that the solution was support in seeking out a good fit for a doctor its important to have support irl but its also important to acknowledge that no one person can handle being anyone elses sole reason for living this game while it did make me cry had very important and good messages about mental health i also really respect you for shining light on issues like this and im honored that you would share personal issues discretely like t i needed this more than i thought i did sean thank you for the message you gave it made me want to cry at the end when you said your doing great keep believing in yourself i feel like i havent heard a positive comment even though its not directed towards just me i needed that positivity for today thank you your doing great too we all just need to take life one step at a time thank you jack im so grateful youve found a way to value yourself morethis video is very helpfultrust me im so happy that youve gotten into a better place than you were in 2017 yes youve changed from the person you were before but i think its a good change because now youre happier it doesnt matter what amounts your channel has changed into now be it less videos or different kinds of videos or whatever because you arent miserable doing it anymore and thats what truly matters youre doing a fantastic job with this channel regardless and i love watching your content keep doing what makes you happy thank you so much for all that youve done for us currently deployed and everything is going to shit and its only been 3 months my girlfriend wants to leave me or so called take a break my mom has been in and out of the emergency room and my coworkers dont like hanging out with me all on the span of not even a week i feel so lonely it hurts in new ways is it me or do i enjoy current sean better than past sean 828 is that an ariana grande reference i see aw san now im crying im glad you are in a better mindset nobody deserves to feel that way i have also been in a dark place but you helped me you helped me get through it every time im sad you make me happy you have made me happy for 3 years now so i want to thank you you are a wonderful person oof i felt may yikes and when she was first talking to you before meeting the goth chick i knew too this game made me cryyy did no one acknowledge the fact he did hi five us your vids are so old and cramy imagine that like when you die you have a chance of another life and you and everyone else keeps thinking that you all only have one life and everyone keeps forgetting that they died but they still have all the memories ya know what i mean cool right idk wat i just typed i finally started to cry at the last minute captions spelled the intro as common morning ladies no matter how stupid or funny or stupidly funny this channel is something good or a really good life lesson always comes out at the end of the vid when he starts talking is jack about to cry the world needs people like you jack why find love in myself when there is no love to give alright i was feeling really bad and randomly watched this video because it was in my recommended so glad i did i love you ugh i just wanna give sean a big hug i remember following this artist on deviantart for ages its so amazing to see people now playing their games so much respect for them i actually cried during this video because of how much i can relate to just about everything that was said there were several times that i tried to take my own life but ive found help in taking time away to do things for myself and spend time with my friends and it has helped me tremendously i cant say that those thoughts dont happen but i am very happy i am not attempting selfharm like i used to youre doing great dude i love your videos and i think the way youve grown makes you stronger whats wrong my boyfriend broke up with me but why is your face like that i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars sarah s thats the vine thank you i will keep believing in myself in all honesty this is one of my favorite videos i has seen from your channel then again im new here but i appreciate the honesty about your own struggles the affirmations and the encouragement im at a point in my own life where things are rocky not sad just unsure so just thanks i guess thank you for maturing and giving us the chance to yanno grow with you in our own waytime youre so sweet man thanks and may god always bless you this is tumblr as a video game me a tumblr user oh my god me youre right in my school i am very lonely tbh i wanted to be a

im glad youre coming out and talking about it love you and wish you well door exists doki doki fans ah shit here we go again what really makes your content so great now is that you do what you want to and you talk about what you want to youre real and thats why when i first watched one of your videos i wanted to watch even more you mean a lot to a lot of people what music is this i needed this so much today today is a hard day not going into too much detail i just recently got out of the hospital a few weeks ago and today this was so need thank you jack so much you are such an inspiration to be better 4954 you deserve do have the best life that you can have that was my breaking point i cried for so long just finally hearing somebody say theres people who are out there that are like no i dont reserve to be happy because i fuck everything up all the time thats absolute nonsense you definitely deserve to be as happy as you can possibly be it finally got me to realise that im matter i deserve to be happy ive been repeating to myself that i dont for so many years and its gotten to the point that i feel guilty when im happy this video finally made me realise that thats complete bullshit i should be happy and i should care about myself instead of putting all my attention towards everybody elses happiness sean thank you thank you so much for helping me realise this and giving me hope you always have given me hope but this video is what made me see that life is much more than oh i shouldnt act like that because i might come off as loud and i hope your right that theres a way out of the darkness me writing while listening to this sean voicing his character what do you like to write may harry potter fanfiction me looks at the drarry fanfiction i was writing welp i could hear in your voice the struggle of admitting your darkest thoughts i know the feeling of it but i know how liberating it can be to just admit to yourself that you went there but got help sean you are so thoughtful and you should take time for yourself when you need it who were you or who you are now doesnt matter for us because it is you its you your personality including changes just one minute can change our lives thats life we will love and support you regardless jack youve always been someone who inspires me to be more true to myself and enjoy the little things in life from your silly videos to these serious ones you always make me feel less alone and more hopeful i only hope you continue to do good for yourself too and know what you do is amazing because i was going through a lot recently and watching these two games by angela and your feedback with it made me reconfirm the changes i want to do on things like this thank you you are truly a great person 3 lilana as someome who is not a professional but has talked many people out of suicide the one thing people never realize is how much they mean to this world i know people say this all the time and its frustrating and tiring to here the same its going to be ok but i always just ask people to listen to me and to what happened to me i play a vr video game called recroom on psvr this game led me to people i call family and very close friends a few days ago i saw on instagram that a girl who played the same game had committed suicide i didnt even know her but this hit me so hard someone that plays on the same gaming platform as me is dead i could have done something if only i knew her if only i could have spoken to her maybe things would be differnt for her friends and family i was so overwhelmed by the death of a complete stranger why because she was another human being someone like me someone like everyone around me it could have been anyone but it was her this is how th thanks for making this video i was having a day where i was really low but idk after watching this i feel a lot better yo i started tearing up this fucking vid opened a place in my haert i never knew i had and am getting so fucking anxious i just wanna cry 2858 when ur playing video games when youre not supposed to and you hear the door open i love how sean takes the time to talk about these things he spent the last 30 minutes of the video talking about it and it really helps sean youre incredible thank you for being you for the record to those people saying that youre irrelevant or that youre not a big part of the community thats not necessarily true youre definitely not irrelevant and the fact that you still open up so much on your videos show just how much you care about the channel and the viewers ive been around for a bit now and the amount of grace compassion and humor you consistently show on your channel is one of the most inspiring things ive seen and although youve cut back on uploads your quality and intent is why i love following you you should never be concerned about the uploading time or community interaction the ones who see you for who you are an honest hard working caring human will stick around no matter what im glad that youre in a better spot and that you found help so that you could reach a better spot and share this today your life and your voice matters the comments attesting to how you help with depression shows that and hey jack thank you so much for the supportive words this is something i really needed ive been going through the toughest part of my life rn you are what i really needed youre so amazing and sweet and supportive i wish everyone was like you im not gonna continue cuz i dont really trust social media lmao but thank you ive been hesitant to watch this video because i knew i would cry and im glad that i did i needed those tears thoughts and powerful words thank you i found this right after i played the entire game and got its four endings and let me just say getting the worst ending the missed ending and the best ending the hope ending in just two playthroughs is great you handled everything really well although if you want something truly haunting aim for the survivor ending i find that a lot of people push others to do as much as they can in such little time when more people should be promoting doing things at your own pace life isnt a race and theres no need to rush through it i spent my later teen years and early 20s worrying about not doing anything with my life and constantly breaking down over not having enough time when in reality i was just a kid and i have plenty of time to spare of course dont take things for granted but dont rush take time to love yourself take time to breathe and take time to do things at your own speed since ive slowed down in life ive been happier than ive ever been and ive accomplished so many things because i let myself focus on them instead of rushing to the next project im taking time to learn to love myself and of course there are still bad days but thats just a part of life so sean we hear you and we love you just be yourself and do what you need to do for yourself we will st this made me cry fuck youtube said i already watched this but i dont remember watching this so im watching it now i dont really comment on videos but i felt like it this time theres nothing wrong with being selfish sometimes everyone needs time to themselves room to breathe it shouldnt matter if you put your life on the internet you still deserve to be human and live your best life we bare bears is unexpected i feel like this is a sayori situationand sorry if this is weird but in my vision seans eyes got super red and i thought he was crying it made me cry a lot of that game and that talk really hit home with me during my darkest times the most important thing to keep me going was knowing that someone cared about me my mom has always been that person for me when i have had my darkest hours she has always been there and she also always seen my struggles and opened her arms to me 3 hey sean i just wanted to let you know that youre a great person im glad youre able to enjoy life a bit more while doing youtube keep up the great work on youtube and in real life please 3 i needed this when i was 11 and 12 i was super depressed nobody believed me except my 2 depressed best friends because kids and teenagers cant get depressed i was so sad my mom didnt believe me thats what i thought anyway one day my mom tells me that the reason why she acts like she doesnt believe me is because she doesnt want to accept the fact that i was sad that changed so much i realized that im not alone i got another dogi was depressed because i had hard times and then my dog diedthat dog helped me through some stuff and i still have him we got another right after too and her i love them both and they both helped me through my depression it sounds pitiful and it sounds stupid because i was upset about a dog but you have no idea what that dog did for me 3340 i started to see his eyes turn red when he was talking anyone know when the next life is strange episode will be i have to say that i feel more connected to you this year than in 2017 or 2018 that anyone is saying that you are pulling away from the community or changing in a negative way is crazy to me i love this person that you are that youve become you seem happier less stressed and that makes me happy i think its a really good thing that you are keeping parts of your personal life to yourself im sorry that you ever felt that having a personal life wasnt acceptable sure we like hearing about fun things you are doing with your friends family or girlfriend but we dont need those things and those things dont belong to us keep being who you want to be and not who you think you should be love you sean whoever you are missed messages is a powerful game and it sends a powerful message that we all can all learn is that people hide there true feelings from others because they dont want to bother other people its not healthy to bottle things up and just think they will just go away because if you bottle things up they will just get worst over time so if you ever feel like your alone please reach out to someone you trust because there are people who care and will help you through the dark time and stand with you through both good times and bad times you are not alone all i can say is wow such a powerful video everyone starting like they know shit but they dont they dont know that being depressed is a fucking good thing when you put it in a good thing like your more stronger when bullied because of depression now what if you use the depression into something good like fighting the bully for once depressed because they are a big headed guy do you think they would succeed in life if they had greed or if they succeeded successfully then be more than them and you ask me how can heshe can be smarter successful if heshe is depressed then dont think that is connected to each other like dont think that being a depressed person means your a un successful shit if still interested talk to me fuck i needed something like this at the moment a good cry and encouraging words that i can replay as many times as i need i feel scared sharing this but here i go ive been emotionally constipated yet unstable and erratic at the same time the numbness was something i couldnt put into words but this video honestly sums up a portion of what i wanted to say depression has been a constant struggle like it is in majorities life and gets to the point where i cant take care of myselfeat go to the bathroom pick up my room brush my teeth change clothes shower type breathe let myself cry the selfharm portion of the video made my body tingle with tears running down my face because i felt the urges itching their way back i wanted to cry but it just feels stifled i am seeking professional help but at this point i sorta want to end it all to stop trying to seek help cause its such a waste and im just a bother i know i have people that care and lov 4231 so many people seem to do so much more then you this often gets to me an artist i adore shares a new piece and i feel ill never draw anything as good i cant help but compare my work with others and it makes me so scared that ill never get better i cant see any improvement in my art and cant imagine that changing ever ok but is it really that easy to get a goth gf cause it took me 3 years to ask out my current fiance because shes adorable wow im that goth gf and my names amy lmao this kind of hits hard to home i have a cousin were he started cutting his arms and i talked and i was like his therapist but the thing is i have my own little things and i cant talk to anyone because they dont understand me and i become mad very easily which ive learned to control my anger but i some times take it out on people i love and the thing is some times i feel like there is some much work and i and suppose to be this perfect person in my mothers eyes but the reality is no im not perfect and i just went to my school therapist for the first time and when i left that room i felt like almost all these chains were lifted if you noticed the picture at the start her leg looks a bit cut up this video game is touching thank you jack so much my family has no idea that im actually depressed and your small talk and videos help me so much god im crying while talking abot this lmao thank you jack youve been my greatest help and inspiration you have made me so happy suicide and self harm has always been an issue this game and you they creator of the game is amazing the aesthetic to the gamr and the lightness to it its soothing calming helping this was just a small thank you message ive struggled so hard with life and i want to move on from this bad side and youre helping no i dont want to meet a therapist im only 13 this is not ok lmao but nevermind thank you jack so much when i first was thinking about these stuff i was not good i even started drawing in 2 weeks after feeling like this when my parents found out they were shocked cuz i were always positive they wanted to take me to a therapist but i refused it everytime they asked me to cuz i dont need it and i know that they wont change me after that my parents told meif i drawagain they will put me in a mental hospital but i didnt change yea i stopped drawing but i was still feeling empty in front of my parents i laughed and acted positive is still do but i didnt feel anything insidei still dont even though that i still feel nothing i started to take some time for myself like i started to read booksi didnt want my mother to go on the shop if i wanted a snacki just went myself and the nature was beautiful but i didnt feel satisfied im still trying to find true love there was a boy my bestfriend we met and were friends for a year now and i started to develop sean i cannot tell you how great it is that youre talking about mental health like this a lot of people use the phrase its ok to not be ok and this is such a good indepth depiction of what that entails i feel that mental health issues are demonized in a lot of ways like its something that people would rather avoid since its seen as too delicate of a subject to burden others with but the way you talk about it in this video and how openly you talk about it is beyond impactful to state so matteroffactly that youve felt depression like this and to just be honest about how difficult it is takes away the stigma around it i wish this world was a world where someone could say im not feeling my best today ive been feeling depressed and the whole world would reply with hey man it happens lets get you some help i want to see a world where mental illness is treated as something normal not insignificant just normal something that you can talk about this is so sad my mom made me get rid of this game just because the girl killed her self and she thought i was going to kill myself because she did i almost didnt cry almost thanks sean i needed it that hit deep thanks sean what a powerful title not just messages a person sent you and you didnt see but signs you didnt see that something was wrong i relate to this very much because one of my closest friends is named as may and has depression where i helped her not committing suicide before but luckily i was there 247 talking to her and able to help her find someone she trusted enough to get help the pause and little noise at 3831 made my heart sink sean i didnt know i needed to hear something like this just as i began to feel life was just one giant carousel repeating days over again ive been proven wrong that theres hope and so much more to it than stress and long work days more than staring at a tv or my phone screen when i could be playing fetch with my dog when i could be honing in on my sketchbook thats collecting dust and go outside and sketch the first thing i see when i could turn my phone off for an hour and sit at the curb and watch the stars pass by i didnt know i needed to hear this thank you so much sean talk about tumbler the game ohmygod the creator made an app like this im gonna cry yes jack y e s everyone should try a 30 sec dance party using your fav song as a start i never realized this before but i like to imagine that all the characters have jacks voice hey lovely people of youtube if you need help there is no shame in getting it you are valued you are worthy of being here of love of happiness please dont make a permanent decision over a temporary feeling get help if you need it keep your head up loves this made me cry like a baby omg 302 oh iceberg from we are bears i genuinely wish i had a friend who wasnt dealing with their own things so i could talk to them about the stuff that goes on in my head jack dont be sad we all love you and you make me feel better when im really sad and i wanted to see you when you came to iowa for your tour i lost a friend to suicide in may what you said after the first ending was so true often they show no signs the people who commit suicide are often the ones that seem the happiest he was always joking around making people laugh his roommate found him too just like this game no one ever could have guessed that he was in so much pain the only thing that we can really do is talk to our friends check on them and make sure that they are doing okay mentally ive made it a priority to be more open about mental health since he has passed but i will likely never forgive myself for not talking to him more not being there when he clearly needed someone it really fucks me up honestly when i say i cried i cried hope is the harsdessed acheivment survivor missed and forgive are a bit hard too but its a good game i love how jack spends time alot of time over 20 minutes in this video to just open up spread feelings help you and gives insight helpful insight all these other youtubers dont they play the game ask for a like and subs and thats all jack makes us feel as if he went through what most of us had is or will be the best thing is that you know this aint scripted its true heart warming and emotional this helps many and possibly all of us that have suicidal tendencies are depressed am anxious and many more so jack let me say that you mean something to youtube your community and me your talks like these help me so much and i dearly mean that thank you me for the most part of this video dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry this game is too relatable and seans speech is beautiful taking action and getting into as many clubs as i can doing my hardest to get good grades and learning as much as i can outside of school so i can make my dreams come true your talk at the end pushed me a little bit more to do better i said it once and ill say it again you are one of my biggest role models sean were here to listen i left school this june this is me right now sitting in my dark room sobbing not interacting with anyone not having any motivation to accept commissions or play games or talk to anyone in fact there isnt anyone its just me some days i drown in alcohol and blood or sleep for hours on end or not at all and it hurts i cried when he said i wanted to end it allthat hit me hard because i always felt like that and sometimes i still feel that the only way out is to end it allbut here i am still alive and strong if you like this please play the mobile game theres this girl 426 every single slightly emo kid fall out boy bitch the video i thought was going to be all chill actually just blowed up my mind sean you are an amazing person jack dont let unimportant comments get to you we will always be here for you and when you need a break take it because your health is the most importance and you have to live your life and congrats for your girlfriend wow im totally speechless this was an amazing video you are amazing thank you so so much for sharing what you said was extremely personal and im so glad you shared it with us it really helped me and probably helped a heck ton of other people too thank you definitely on the nose to have not experienced it its very accurate ive been legitimately suicidal since i was 4 half of me doesnt see a point and the other half is too stubborn to stop looking for a reason but it is very tiring especially dealing with a life of poverty bad health loss loneliness and failure so i once had this dream that made me realize im bi in the dream i fall in love with this girl and may from this game looks like the girl from the dream i fell like i need to add this tldr girl from dream that made me realize im bi looks like may therere 4 ending btw good luck with that xd its so amazing seeing such big influencers open up about such common problems like mental health coming from someone that spent most of their youth in and out of scary and destructive mental spaces that now when im an adult its hard for me to realise this is okay and it happens cause im always just so scared to go back to probably the worst head space ive ever been in my life but when i see people like you jack that open up and just giving people a reminder that it is okay to be sad and you arent alone keep living life and remember we aint pussies hi guys im getting bullied in another comment section about my depression and suicidal thoughts i came here as i know there is much more love here jack i have been a long time sub i was here since before 1 mil subs and i havent been watching you for a while since like october of last year but im happy i came back you are still 1 and this struck me where it matters and i hope that people get help and dont give up and im happy when i came back this was one of the first videos that i watched and i know you will never see this but i still want you to know we will always be here for you this game really hit hard for me cause i could end up in that position im about to head off to college near the end of august and ill most likely be living with a roommate ill probably end up becoming friends with them but they could have inner demons i couldnt possibly comprehend and one day i could lose them ive had depressed friends before and its never an easy thing to see or deal with but the reality of this game hit me really hard and i realized i could end up having to talk to my roommate about this stuff or worse yet i could be the may ive always been the golden child just like she said so i never had to try much then middle and high school hit me like a truck where i actually had to try and i fell behind a bit it really didnt help that my mother died right before middle school kinda killed my motivation to try at anything anymore thankfully tho my parents dad and new step mother are super supportive and they understood where i was coming from e i get how you feel jack to some extent im kinda just a ghost in my head living like sand through other peoples hands i have for a long time now and im not sure how to really change the real fans will stay when may said she wanted to write harry potter fanfiction i felt it man i know the struggle too haha hey jack i was just wondering if you can text me i would really appreciate it i just im doing with the same problems they are in you said you were depressed when you first started and wondering if you had any advice i hope you see this but you dont have to if you dont want to i dont want to be a waste of time and if you do just make sure you have time just make sure you theres a pain in the world that people are blind to it infects the heart it infects the soul it creates a hurricane of emotion that seems to have no end do not despair for there is a lighthouse in the dark that will bring you home all you need is ask thanks for all the good youve done jack memes cute girls and depression yep thats the world in a nutshell dreading and looking forward to the point this game gets too relatable and i spend the night in an intense state of melancholy wheres the green hair i love you sm jack in a role model type way you make so many people happy this video reminded me of when i was getting bullied in school and then i cut myself with a knife because i was so sad and then my dad cheered me up so much because the day after he figured it out he played a game a basketball and it helped me so much its nice to just live in the moment sometimes i love it when jack just sits down and talks once and a while it reminds me that people do care and jack has helped me so much i could probs write an essay if i wanted to on how much jack has helped me and shows that im not alone and its okay thank you jackshawn you are literally the best i know you probably get this all the time but i just wanted to say even if you never see this you are my favorite youtuber and thats saying something i watch youtube alot and i watch so many different creators when im sad or need some laughs or just want to relax i watch your videos sure i watch a bunch of others too but seriously i think some of the best most inspirational videos ive ever seen were yours keep being yourself wether yourself changes or not ill watch as long as you keep being caring thank you so much for this what i found was helpful is just to move forward there is no way back so keep going there is always that light at the end of the tunnel i still feel like this with 4 years of college and not getting anywhere as everyone around me graduates with my 8 year relationship everyone around me is having children starting a family and getting married and here i am poor because of college and changing the wedding date like 10 times already i feel like im not going anywhere and i felt it jack aw i could use a break youtube try the taco bell all new chalupa b i used to scratch myself and bleed myself but my best friend helped me its like this game is talking to me love you and do you need a hug everyone needs to see this video that is dealing with stuff im going through some stuff and sean you really help me everyday every time i watch one

my parents i told my close friends whats really happening and i already feel better i go see a professional next week and im meeting up with my friends tomorrow i believe everything will be better and your encouraging words made me believe even more 3 jack opens door ad this is fred hes dancing like nobodys watching 4128 social media for the most part is just there for noise yea noise to distract me from my miserable life can someone tell me the name of the three songs on the spotify tab for this video umm excuse you ho i had my high five ready im so glad youre taking time for yourself and learning to value your personal space thats so important i know this seems like an out of place comment with how sad yet lovely this game is but i thought it was sorta selfish she died on her friends birthday now the only reason she remembers her birthday is because her friend died i swear this just hit home for me i need to tell someone this so for any who read this please let me have a moment of your time my name is madisyn my parents are kim and philip i have a black lab and i love him i have a bf that i love dearly ive had depression for 4 years now i think about suicide often but i dont think ab it seriously my mind is always full of static music means everything im always tired and i get upset for the smallest reasons my parents and i argue so so often i feel so lost thank you if youve read till here it means the world thank you so much for this message jack thank the lord im not sucidal and have a amazing life but you put every word in the right context and you are a amazing person and thank you for being such a impact on my life when i was sad or mad hearing you yell and laugh made everything better you konw what jack li love this video and i appreciate it i have some friends who could relate to may i always wish i could help them more and more but i just cant get them out in 10 seconds i wish it could be possible but depression is a mental iliness and not a little video game but for those who need help just give it a try and find somebody it might be scary but if you want to talk to someone do it dont hesitate just because youre scared you dont have nothing to lose you are not alone i barely made it 6 minutes into this video originally because i just couldnt face this subject at that moment im glad i came back to it and finished it it was nice to hear what you had to say im still in a bit of a dark place so this was nice i needed to hear some of this but damn you for making me cry when ive been trying so hard not to lately thank you sen ill keep trying may is adorable no one ive known has ever commited suicide but i have had someome close to me die and the feeling of shock is horrible my nan on my mothers side died in 2009 k was at school it was a tuesday i think mum come to pick us up i dont know if she told us at school in the car what happened or when we got to the hospital but nan had died i pretended nan had gone to visit her sister she wasnt really dead i didnt really say goodbye i was in shock we saw her body i was given thd choice to say goodbye but i couldnt i shut down i wasnt even sad i didnt feel anything she had just gone to visit her sisters for a while and wasnt coming back it all come crashing down on friday at her funeral i cant remember if we had the next three days off school or not i was doing a speach and ended up crying i think i ran out i cant really remember i do remember what i was wearing a black and white cheakered knee length dress it was a lovely day the sadness thing was the graphics just like the content is important and beautiful youre just so damn inspirational sean your videos have always helped me in the darkest of times when i feel down and empty i load up one of your videos and just sit down watching for hours and hours on end you always make me smile and laugh its just very helpful when i feel alone youre always there for us and we appreciate it we really do all of your subscribers are subscribed because we want to watch your videos not because we feel like we have to no thats not it we enjoy watching your videos and going through the motions with you like with your resident evil 7 videos now im not going to lie here i legit squealed when going through those moments with bug mom and i honestly wished i had recorded that so i could look back and laugh at it im getting off point here i guess what im trying to say is we care about you and who you are i hope you know that sincerely a big fan last year was the hardest of my life i was at a job that was stressful and i was trying to finish my degree i suddenly lost my emotional support dog in october and i felt my world was crashing down around me i felt broken and i could not function for a while i lost my 18 year old cat a month later and in last december just two months after i lost my emotional support animal she was just so much help for me and my grandmother had a heart attack in front of me she had to be intubated and spent two months in the hospital and really really struggled i was totally lost i had to try to keep together for my mom and my brother but i was constantly restless worrying about her we have been so so close for so long she is back home now and finally back to a somewhat normal life i am so thankful i pushed through the hardest part of my life i was so dark for so long but somehow we all came through okay just remember that even if it feels you have nothing anymore its not true you when i grew up with a poor family and i worked so hard to get into my dream art college and was actually accepted but only got partially covered and couldnt afford 5000 a semester when i was eating a bag of rice or a bowl of cereal for dinner bc of how poor my mom waswhen i was sitting with who i thought was my friends and i tried to say my little brother was hit by a car and no one looked or reacted to what i said and so much more to living years and years with what i called static in elementary school and when i grew up to know as depression to my therapist who made me feel emotionally dead and to my mom i would hear crying in secret talking on the phone how she was broken bc she couldnt help me i battled this battle in secret i was in the school news about how colorful and cheerful my paintings in art class were when inside i was nothing and worthless i stood on the edge of a bridge and didnt even know how i had got there if i didnt have my siblings my famil my tattoo artist committed suicide almost 2 months ago now i was fucking crushed even though shes ashes in the ground now every time i go to her house i wait for her to come out and say some smart ass shit or a dirty joke i seen her room and couldnt even breathe your life matters even to those who barely know you people love you you will be missed wow sean that 15 minutes at the end are so great you are so open and we all appreciate that i definitely feel that good idea for mental health is to turn off all social media for a weekend it definitely helps you to turn off and remember what really matters in life harry potter fan fiction me too i gots drarry hey jack thanks for being here for all of us you cheer a lot of us up everyday and you keep that smile on your face youre always there for us and were all here for you just thanks we love ya keeping this vague but ive also been in a bad place before and believe it or not it was because of chinese parents huh fuckkkkkkkkkk yea transgender as someone who has gone through this and as someone who is still going through this i cannot tell you how much this message meant to me im still living at home 17 with no job not knowing where im going in life and looking into my life youd think i had it pretty good loving mother caring stepfather siblings who love me it seems like a picture perfect family there are probably only five people in my life counting my family members and a friend who know that i self harmed and failed to commit suicide i tend to hold my feelings back in hopes to not bother people mostly because i feel as if they have bigger issues and shouldnt be held back by my problems the message that this game sent was absolutely close to home and it was so so touching to watch i love these types of things just remember to be there for people of course not all of the time people have their own lives and to each their own but still if you notice the signs of suicide or self harm pleas ill admit this made me cry so much think you for making this video to have a cousin that is cutting i think its scary ps im 9 pma i played this the day it was put on newgrounds i fucking love it for what its worth and even if i dont know you sean youre a good person and a very fantastic guy i cant express how much your speech meant to me i cried a lot but this helped me a lot and i wanted to tell you that you helped a person even if youll never see me or even if youll never read this post its okay because you helped with a little video so much so thank you also take care of yourself and be happy you deserve it and also everyone deserves it youre right so people please remember that even in the darkest times you can see the light and things will change for the better you just have to grit your teeth and surround yourself with people that you love because in the end love and i mean also the love for yourself will win everything im glad i stumbled upon this video its heavy stuff i lost two friends barely even two months apart both lost to suicide i struggle with depression anxiety and an eating disorder on top of it all im at a healthy weight now for the first time in a long long while youve helped me through so much sean thank you em excuse me but how many years has jack sean been a youtuber and a part of the youtube community ive lost count but like its been years and they expect him not to change heck to the no people change people grow people learn they mature especially in the media they need to be their own people youtube is his job not his life he shouldnt have to share his entire life or anything like that i mean its not fair to expect thatim sorry jack im sorry that this community has brought so much pressure in your life only at 1331 but had a noticing on the cover there are scissors that look to be bloodied and redness thats dripping off of where the two are sitting suicide hinting or am i looking into it too much and missing the message also i feel you may i think about it so seriously plan it even make notes then stop because im afraid of other people and how theyll feel but for me its not depression its anxiety may is my spirit animal also wolves though she was reincarnated the dream it meant that you were slowly losing her after she died and was buried the first time you knew what to do the next time you heard her cry for help the second time and came to answer it she hears about your dream and her note says she was buried in the blizzard she was buried feeling cold with no one there and she felt unappreciated because no one cared about her just about how she died so she screamed hoping someone would feel bad for her and not her death and you answered take that time to yourself you dont owe the world the entirety of who you are thank you for saying your peace there are many things stated that i believe fans will understand and even empathize with oh we bare bears thx jack i actually needed that im not able to watch this video but i just wanted to say i still support ya can someone give this man the recognition he deserves i felt so touched by his words and this game i deal with anxiety and depression on a daily basis sometimes it gets so bad i dont even want to get out of bed and he is right you should get some help and you are never ever alone bravo sean i cried because the most in this video i can relate to i relate too may other than being the best in school i was always the dumb kid and my family always pushed me to be better but no matter how much i struggled and fought to at least be average which was one hell of a bitch to deal with i was never enough for anyone not even for myself no matter what i was always the criminal that deserved to rot in hell for being alive it was the people that i loved the most that caused me the most pain i quickly realized that i was just one of those people who just didnt belong anywhere other then 6ft under the cold hard ground on new years 2019 i realized that i had two options one spend the rest of my life in physical emotional mental and spiritual pain while simultaneously being falsely accused of sexual assault on my younger cousins by my socalled family or steal my aunts medicine bag and take as many pills as i could and finally feel free from the bullshit known as life i didnt though now im in a 2 b coming directly from playing through this game its not a game my self it was really jarring hearing your intro im sorry but it would have probably been more tactful to have toned it down a bit for topics of this magnitude please like so sean might see this as someone who has had failed attempts at suicide this video really hit home im glad i watched it even though it hurt sean always just be you and do what you need to do no matter what anyone says you have helped so many people you are awesome and amazing and i hope you have found your balance if not just keep working at it and to all the people out there that have these thoughts please talk to someone sometimes friends and family arent enough to help even professionals can only do so much sometimes talking with someone who has been through it as well is so much more meaningful then anything else be proud of you dont worry what others think especially family and friends because only you know what you need and if any of you dont know what to do im a good listener and you can always send me a message on facebook im sierra lewis i live in kenai alaska look me up and send me a message ill be more than happy to help yo hey jack there is four different endings try to figure them out on your own can someone please soundbyte jack saying im glad youre still here i think jack i was also in a world full of fantasy and i guess i had a gut instinct that i say everything is fine even my dad said you need to be more open about your problems i think the only reason is its because one time my mom scold at me for having such a big reaction to someone scaring me and like i suffered from that day of hiding my feelings because my mom thought i was overreacting it does seem like sometimes is easy to put everything aside and not put anyone in to your problems s a good thing i dont know thats just my story why is suicide so hard and the thought of it is so easy thank you san for saying something about this and telling us all that you felt like you needed to this whole video made me need a hug so im sending a virtual hug to all the fighters including this great youtuber youre a great man im definitely not a longtime fan but i can always tell how genuine you are everything youre saying ive felt that ive been on the lows im slowly learning about the highs i value how open you are i love 100 respect you keeping what you want to yourself you do care about the community your message made that very clear you are absolutely wonderful sean stay amazing 3 thank you i love jack for defaulting to theythem even with a name like angela much love im crying so hard its so hard life is hard and im so tired 20 minutes until the end of the video and jacks finished playing the game guess im probably gonna end up crying then edit so its raining behind my glasses i just stopped the video at harry potter fanfiction and i just me too may me too hp is life omg junji ito i love his stories there so good i want jack to actually react to them he would probably b haunted forever but the stories are so good hey jack youre such a warm safe place for me i really really appreciate you and i hope youre always happy love ya x this really hit too close to home for me a few years back i hit a real low point in my life i wasnt motivated to do anything and i just wanted to hide in the darkness of my room i cried myself to sleep multiple times and then one day i just broke the littlest things got to me and on that day i just stormed up to my room i paced back and forth thinking about jumping out my window throughout this whole time i had a little voice in the back of my head that seemed to be controlling me i thought about what would happen if i did it and who would even care i eventually decided against it and climbed in my bed to cry for after about an hour the voice came back and i thought about the rope i had in my drawer this time i spent no time thinking about what would happen i just grabbed it and tied it around my neck in my closet right before i lost consciousness i came back to my senses and started to scream for help as well as bang on the door my mother came in and helped this is just how i feel depressed hoping for help but no one sees it whatever talking about these topics especially with this platform is so important youve personally brought so much joy in my life but the words you spoke in this video were ones i needed to hear i relate with the feeling of monotony every day is the same day eat sleep work repeat im working on that part of my life right now thanks for this sean thanks for everything this video literally made me cry i was struggling to love myself but this video made me realize that i am beautiful the way i am and that i shouldnt care about what other people think of me beautiful meaning inside and out i was going through really rough times but there is always a way out of it please find someone to talk to it can be me too i will always listen so please tell someone how you feel it can be anyone i love you all and stay safe big mood the most relatable thing is this whole game bipassing every other ounce relatability in this game i screamed when i saw the fall out boy meme i need the music in spotify period i watched this when high and it felt like so beautiful watching this game and i felt so inspired me not gonna cry end of video oh jack you are so beautiful its so clear how much you care for us it will take time you are right but i hope that we as a community will be able to learn and grow with you and maybe one day everyone will learn how to be happy a few years ago i felt like that ive struggled with depression for about a decade now on top of anxiety for less time but nothing compared to that time in my life i was in college and i was struggling with school and had to work a lot to pay bills and my relationship and friendships were so rocky i knew i was getting really down again but it was nothing new to me it started getting worse when youre walking down a flight of stairs and think what if i just jump but again not totally new then everything just broke all at once i failed a class and kept forgetting huge assignments because of work i couldnt even care enough to go to school anymore and dropped out and then the thousands of debt became real my boyfriend and i broke up my closest friends at the time turned their backs on me i quit my job because of problems with coworkers my car broke down and had to ask my parents for money i felt like such a burden on everyone around me i felt like i was letting eve this hit home pretty hard in my own personal experience it took years to even admit to myself and others that i wasnt ok that alone wasnt enough though someone i call a friend literally saved my life and im forever grateful life is hard yea but im glad i was reminded by my loved ones im strong enough to face another day woah this is deep and meaningful and just relative what sean talks about at the end really resonates with me i actually started watching him not long after id had one of the worst mental health breaks in my life where for the first time things got so bad that thoughts of ending it all were persistent in my mind i was still in recovery mode basically and watching seans videos were what really got me into youtube where over time ive found that a lot of people both creators and their fans alike struggle with similar stuff and it helped me realize i wasnt alone and things could get better no matter how bleak they seem sean really is one of the best youtubers whos always genuine and heartfelt about what he does and who he is and im really happy someone like him who just truly cares about everyone and everything is here on the platform 3 game mentions suicide ddlc fans ah shit here we go again frick the hope ending made me bawl im watching this at a time i really needed it thank you for your thoughts honesty and optimistic attitude sean your videos make me smile i hope your day is lovely i am glad you took the time to share talk about and relate on such a touchy subj as a person who struggles with depression and even scars still on my skin from self harm seeing jack open up made me smile and cry at the same time depression sucks and this game illustrates it in a beautiful artistic style but keeps it serious at the same time thank you jack for opening up its

my friend send so i stop my self thanks for playing this game and talking about this your the best and you should take a break true fans stay and dont care if you take a break thank you for being a youtube like if you agree i always love these sad oneoffs sean im at work youre not allowed to make me cry at work not gonna lie my little lesbian heart fell in love with may through this video thank

ending with both gf and amy 148 the scalar eqn for planes is actually d on the right side pls or in other words axbyczd 0 if this is too personal or weird i totally get it but could you maybe do a cover of friend please twenty one pilots its on a very similar vein to this game and i mean honestly this is just kinda a personal request but it would mean a lot to me but also maybe to a bunch of other people too in your audience i mean singing is also a pretty personal thing and like i dont mean to ask you to give like a big part of yourself so if its weird thats totally cool and i totally understand especially with that boundary that really is a necessary thing to have but ive just been listening to it a lot recently and then saw this video and it sorta struck home a little more so yeah also i really dont want this to seem hastily tackedon because i really do mean it but it also was just really nice to see that youve come so far from where you were a few years ago and im really really glad you felt like you could share that with us jack can you get back to little miss fortune ya know jackthis video has really made want to help peopleya know and im not the greatest when it comes to talking or listening to someone but after seeing this and you i found this game on steam literally 2 days before this video came out and tbhi couldnt really make it through the whole thingbut after seeing the way you did this and the way u explained everything at 3400 ish but i really just want to help someoneits very inspirational and also sad toobc ik a lot of ppl who are like mayand ive felt like mayand i just want to helpso i have to just say thank you i cant tell u how much i related to may especially the part about everyday feeling the same i feel like i have to do something different everyday just for it to be memorable otherwise it all just blends together theres no point in living the same day everyday i relate to both of the characters so much i do and say things like the girl you play as but sometimes i feel exactly like may this game hits hard but im happy someone came out with a game like this it really shows what happens to many people in this life as well as how some people react of course everyone reacts different to depression and many other things its important to put light on these things and its good that especially now more people are recognizing and trying to help mental health issues to anyone whos needs it youre amazing and many people are here for you we love you and youre not alone sean i wanted to talk to you about this since the video first came out and i cry everytime i watch it cause this is so fucking sad cause i want you to know that there are people are there to help with this and i wanted to talk to you personally about it and if you see it i love you man doing your best does not mean working yourself to a point of mental breakdowns you made me crying this is tumblr the video game goddammit jack that made me do a spit take coffee is now everywhere me what happened to the other girl also me probably became a professional makeup artist we see how much you care thank you sean we love you sooo much youve done so much for us well always be here whenever you need us thank you i wish you all the happiness in the world youve given me back a chance at mine so many times just thank you 3 hey random person scrolling in the comments ive hit a super hard time right now this is my first time trying to reach out u could totally ignore me but if u had any free time at all please dm me on insta katiemayz427 thanks heres a thing to anyone that thinks their friend is depressed dont assume but be ready of course if theyre very bad then assume and seek immediate help but when i had depression never got serious enough to even think about suicide or anything but i had started lightly cutting my parents pushed for me to seek help and i eventually organised a meeting with the school chaplain but before that my friends picked up on it and reacted they never confronted me never brought it up but i did notice that they invited me out much more often talked to me more since id stopped joining conversations and sat in silence and didnt let it get bad prevention is much better than intervention it doesnt need to be serious and you dont need to bring it up maybe its not depression maybe its just a rough patch either way pull them out as fast as you can invite them out keep them busy and remind them of all the wonders of life i never went to see that chaplain bruh i played this before i even knew you made this vid hey jack i assure you i dont mind you not uploading so regularly i hadnt even noticed because i never got to watch all your videos anyway you make them too fast xd but ill give you a quote my mother gave me when i graduated high school and first started working you work to live you dont live to work you work to get the money and recourses to do other things in your spare time work should not be all you do and no one can fault you for taking time for yourself quality over quantity love you jack youre a wonderful man that has been a big part of my adolescence and i imagine will be a big part into my adulthood take care of yourself 4200 i was staring at a tree at that moment and i had to laugh dispite the context of all this i love when you talk like this because i can stare into the distance or get one of those adult colouring books and just listen to a wise man or sometimes a screaming man depending on my day sometimes i dont even listen i go back to a video ive watched so many times and let my mind wander away i listen to the same thing with a familiar and pleasant voice and let the pen move to fill the spaces of the book without caring how it looks im not depressed but if anyone reading this just needs to disconnect for a bit listen to music you know well or a youtuber that calms you and do something simple colouring sewing knitting working out lightly anything that doesnt require brain activity its very relaxing and youre much more likely to be able to focus after an hour or so of it hope that someone will read this and find it useful i need to cry but my foundation was 48 jack is keanu 2 i dont know how to spell his name thank you there was a time where i felt absolutely lost there was a time where i put myself into a hospital watch for a night because i couldnt trust myself to be alive and you were there you didnt heal me but you distracted me from my pain you were one of the things that kept me going thank you sean 730 as a person with tinnitus i feel u chief this is so inspirational game itself is utter bullshit the room in this game kind of reminds me of the room in the other game jack played the one night stand thank you for all your hard work jack im glad that you finally get to live offline now its yeontan 249 pic of the dog wait lets scroll down the comments for every social media post you look at it doesnt have to be immediatelybut just remember to take a deep breath and forget for two seconds just let everything go and forget because most of the stuff people stress about wont even matter a couple years later sean you are and have been my favorite youtuber for this reason you talk about real things im sure its gotta be hard to always have people in your business but nonetheless your feelings are always valid you have gotten me through some hard times and thank you for that people will always have something to complain about but you really do mean something to people just stay the amazingly caring person you are just stay you 435 i need more dreams i needed this thank you for sharing your story and your wisdom i feel like jack and many others have been dealing with duality and the issues that come with feeling conflicted jack makes a lot of videos anti vids or games or just feel good things i still always notice theres a duality with what jack is saying and how hes presenting even with his background lights being in contrast his transparency is amazing but its also a difficult thing to do in a society where being this honest is abnormal i support anyone who is this honest but if it causes a conflicting duality with you take some time for yourself stop being so honest with others for a second start being honest with yourself for me this just shows and bringmout the love i have for people in genralthere not all the best or pefect but everyone just needs love mananybody i mean anybody it a wierd offer i get cause i a stanger but just know if you need someone to talk to comment and im johny on the spotive been the kind of pearson to miss those messegesand when you find yourself in the moment im in now jacks righttheres always a way out and its ok to feel sad but theres a genaral care i have and im justwhen you get a text and a pearson you love is goneno goodbyesno explanationthe self guilt the want to just hear there voice and the mannerisms and justyoud do anything to get that backand we cant so if anybody needs someone to talk toeven i do judt comment cause i couldent stand myself if there was a single soul that i had a chance to touch and couldent justlearn to love and hold your loved ones close cause life is a ride with twists and turns and it gets rea thank you jack i really needed that talk that you gave i pretty much hit the the same way jack did i was thinking that way but never really went through with it i just felt like no one liked me no one wanted to hang out with me or talk i just felt like i was just nothing in a world where everyone was important and was wanted by some one and no one wanted me i know that sounds selfish but when its your entire life of just that little stuff that even your own parents say or do to say no your worthless let your brother do it instead its hard i just kept it bottled no one knew about how i felt i never opened up there was cracks where i was sad enough for some one to notice but i just said i was ok before all of the break down my sister was going through a toxic relationship and while she was in that relationship she had a baby my nephew and one day i was home with her i was in the basement she was up stairs taking care of the baby then i hear screaming crying from the thank you jack for the warning i would give you watch time but i am very very sensitive to both suicide and self harm so i will not be taking part in this adventure with you wow you should be a motivational speaker because that was deep and good you got your plide flags in the distance this game is so much of my life i dont even no how to respond properly the scary part is not only the mental health aspect but i am in college with a chinese roommate named mei may and i am gay this hit me on a different level and thank you for taking the time to say all you did at the end because i know i had to hear it and im sure many others did as well i relate to may so much i still dont know how to study or work hard at something so some things that i really want to getdo i let slip out of my hands because its too much effort as a sophomore in college i want to start working harder but i really dont know if i can since i never learned how to ive been on a dark road for about a week or more everything you said every word it means a lot to me im trying to still learn on that learning to work on myself and not only to others but im including myself now im taking what you said to heart thank you sen thank you i relate so much to may this is making me cry did not expect to be attacked by how similar i am to maynever learning to trybeing berated for itnot having things i like to doturning to writing even the hp fanfic was on the dot lowkey unsettled 2018 was the worst year of my life so far because my gran died of cancer and i thought those thoughts and i never thought them before but i spoke to my friends and they helped me through the dark times your speech honestly helped me so much and probably others too thank you i appreciate you 3 funny i just finished playing this game and now i see it on your channel sean you will never be irrelevant you my good irish bean you have saved me you have

life bro i literally cried that speach meant so much to me thank you hey jack i know your probably getting a lot of comments like this but i hope your doing well im really glad that you shared kinda what your towards the end of the video hope you know that you can share whatever with us your most defiantly not being a bother and your not talking too much its good to vent with others like you said again hope your doing well we love you omggg zephy was the first channel i subbed to before she began making game and only did speedpaints damn the art in this game is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for expressing how you feel it means a lot seeing how you understand it is a powerful message and game and it is hard to tell sometimes i am lucky to have people who can notice i know not everyone does sometimes a game like this is what we need sometimes i have to be reminded it can be worse and that right now right here im ok anyways my best friend told me once that im one of the strongest people they know so strong because i have been through and have to deal with so much but im still here im rambling anyways youre awesome keep making videos and remember that you are strong because your still here 056 aw shi im gonna start crying its so hard sometimes to see the best in things growing up with big influencers and people with heavy social media presence faking their lives and making them look perfect its hard to break down the barriers life isnt perfect life can be a shitstorm its so easy to look at an influencer like jack and think of how easy it seems for them how they have it good but they dont no one does no one has a really perfect life this is the sort of thing that helps people with such big audiences taking the time to interact and break down those walls that trap you in and make you feel alone your words really struck home and left me sobbing so honestly jack thank you from the very bottom of my heart you dont know how much this meant to me and plenty of others we love you i almost didnt watch this video because of the theme and the fact that ive not been too emotionally stable myself as of late but im glad i did ive struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 25 years generally i have things that help me cope and im often doing my best to pull others out of that dark spiral sometimes tho i feel like im the only person suffering and that everyone around me is just so happy and things that i fight and struggle for daily just come to them so naturally that its all too easy to get discouraged to give up i really appreciate the fact that you can open yourself up to us your audience show us that youre also vulnerable to this struggle and remind us that were never really alone pay no mind to the haters youve done more good for this world than youll ever really know just keep being you i accidentally put myself up for adoption listen who needs a cute internet girlfriend the beginning was so cute angela he making them people want to reflect so bad after playing her games those impacts shes a great creator and she really makes you think thank you i watched this video before but im and watching again now because i just had this conversation with my mother about therapy and she said that its useless and why should i go for something i cant rely on and spend my money on it i just needed to hear somebody say that therapy is for everyone we love you sean im so sorry you suffered in 2017 we are always here if you ever need a break we get it always remember to look after yourself first you always help us you always encourage a positive mental attitude and youre a great advocate we understand take care of yourself damn this hits so close to home how beautiful and heartbreaking also when you think about it shiloh dynasty the singer for the background music also went missing from the internet and people assume she ended it all thank you jack your message at the end really hit home me i went through a lot and i didnt even realize how much self reflection and actually reaching out for help when needed was i also just brushed it off like may it was truly was a gut instinct to say im fine when im clearly not i recently quit taking all my mental health meds because i believed i was beyond fixing now im going to go back on them and if i feel i need help im going to reach out the reason i was so afraid to reach out was missing out on your uploads and being afraid of being out of the loop i was honestly also afraid that life would move on without me and id always be two steps behind god thinking back now that was trivial what i shouldve done is reach out is get help you really helped me see things in a new light i always looked up to you and now i know why i just wish i had reached out before i got the permanent scars and im definitely going to stop saying everything is its these kind of games i love the most where you feel so so much jack just loved this cause of the gay i played this game before seeing this but i didnt get all these endings thank you jack needed this people should be grateful that any person on social media takes time for their fans if you are going to complain just turn off your computer awe jack we value you as a person you need to be happy and the main goal of life is to grow and those who love your content will grow with you thank you jack im glad you opened up that inspiration was amazing we love you and as long as youre happy itll mean more to true fans friends than what you used to be i personally love happy jack and i love you too person reading this comment stay strong i dont usually comment on videos but thanks jacksepticeye i mean it thank you jack for the out pour of support and care you show us your fans i dont know really how to articulate this well but i found it very touching and i could tell that it was very difficult to talk about i dont really know who will see this comment but please try and find help find time for what makes you happy and what helps you there is no one who can completely understand someone elses pain so i will try not to keep this to long winded thank you jack for all that you do and have done for us jack dont care about the bad he care about the art when sean started cryingit made me want to give him a hug and tell him that its all gonna be okbut the worst part is that i cant and it hurts me so much thank you sean for your honesty you didnt have to explain any of this but im glad you did its important for people to hear jack and to anyone else who feels that way me instant tears the second ending has such important messages about getting professional help and finding things you love its okay to not know what you want to do its okay to love something thats not stem or will make you money if you ever feel alone its okay to reach to someone for help people out there care so much about you even if your brain wont let you realize opens door ad ive been dancing on top of cars i fucking love this man this type of content is why i love you plz whatch the whole video my therapist is my best friend lol i just played this like three days ago and umim addixted jack your

therapist and while im not completely dependent on you thank you so much for being yourself and telling me its all right to feel this way other wise i really might have ended it all a while ago so once again thank you every single feeling and thought may had i went through i remember feeling like that thank you for playing this game it meant alot more than you know looks down during his talk feeling like i shouldnt feel this way i really should be asleep right now but i saw this video and started to watch it i got so deep in my feels cause i could feel everything that was going on in this game and i was on this point in my life once but i pulled thru it and i wish everyone that is going thru something similar that they have the energy to do the same life is good and has your purpose for you go and do what you love and dont care what anyone thinks of you everyone who reads this i love you your a good person and if you need somebody to talk always hit me up thanks for sharing means a lot i just noticed the scissors on the title screen with blood everywhere who the hell thinks sen is disconnected or doesnt care about the community he cares a whole lot and anyone who thinks that he doesnt care anymore talk to someone sen needs to take care of himself and live his life let him do his thing and you enjoy what he shares with us because he does all of this for us his fans his friends his community thank you jack the last sentence was a deal breaker i went and opened up to my mother and after an hour of tears i feel better and we are seeking help i completely relate to how you feel its where i currently am seriously thank you im kinda going thru this right now where i feel like nobody care about me i hate myself and i talked to one of my brothers and he made me think that my family cares and will always love me and he made realize that they do care about me and jack also helped realize things will get better and thank my brother and jack for that and jack if youre reading this thank you is it bad that i can relate to may i just havent found my way out of the darkness yet i mean im going through depression and my anger gets the best of me and i dont care how anyone feels i feel like ive lost my good traits of my person i dont like telling people and i put on a fake mask and be like yea im fine and couldnt be better of course im shy sharing my depression with people i dont even know i dont like telling anyone because i dont want to make it a serious thing and then my parents will get worried about their son and thats not what i want and i know i shouldnt keep it a secret from my parents and pretend and im fine and cramming down my real feelings when i know im only hurting myself mentally im hoping i get through this and to anyone reading this comment just know that someone cares for you even if you dont believe me i know ill get through this it may be a tough fight but im willing to fight it and you should too know that i care for you even if you dont know me please take care angel if anyone is wondering what the song is probably not its losing interest shiloh dynasty there are others but i cant really hear it this is why youre one of my favorite youtubers sean the fact that you spent twofifths of this video just giving us a hearttoheart is honestly really special im glad you got some shit off your chest buddy ill think more about getting help i had to rewind the video because i thought i was hallucinating that jack didnt use his high five sound but then i realized i wasnt thank you for what you said i am so glad you are helping yourself and doing what is best for you i want to do that as well im not saying this for attention or anything but my best friend loved you and you really helped her a lot i feel selfish but i have been going through a really hard time my best friend passed away last year like may did in the game i wish i could go back and help her more so that she could still be here it makes me cry so much i have been in some really bad places mentally but i started therapy i want to get better and work on myself as well thank you for reading this game is absolutely amazing 3 3 3 3 the fuck happened to visage i love and appreciate you so much sean aw jack thank you for opening up to us we will always support you no matter what hey im a fairly new subscriber just felt the need to say that i enjoy the way you narrate and play your games especially ones like this and doki doki i kinda knew what doki doki was like and every youtuber that i watched made it way too comical and actually annoying your way of narrating is still entertaining to watch but also seems respectful of the topics and themes as you play you dont do crazy annoying voices you give insight on gameplay and dont gloss over important details so yeah thank you i always enjoy hearing you talk as a person to us this was very well articulated sean it makes my heart happy that you have grown so much and see your own value as an individual thank you for reminding us what is important that last frase was so heartwarming ive thought darkly like that before i dont much anymore but when i do or did its always theyd be better off without me i used to also think about suicide but then id think about the ones that would miss me and it would help me stop im glad youre here jack whether you directly or indirectly helped me doesnt matter you make me laugh and i enjoy you for you i would like to say thank u jack for the jokes and the hard work im going throw some break up right now and me seeing u make funny jokes makes me feel better thx again well this was exactly what i needed i feel like every time im feeling alone or upset i find one of these videos i was having a super rough night and sat down at 4am and decided to catch up on jacksepticeye videos to try and cheer myself up and instead of glossing over my hurt with laughter i got the pep talk that i needed to really hear so thank you thank you this talk at the end really reflected evverything in my life that was weird but so helpful because i couldnt put it in words but you did thanks a lot after watching this i just felt like im living right now it just really hits me the fact you spent so much time making this video depression is something i go through a lot through different periods of time much like jack i dont want people to feel bad for me or make myself an attentive person i just want people to understand what i go through what others go through fuck it what everyone goes through if you guys would like more info on what i just explained ill be posting a video on my channel discussing my depression and anger issues i am not trying to self advertise either if you read the whole comment i appreciate it and thanks for your time seeing this video and crying at 4 am because i think about suicide and dont have the courage to reach out to people about it this video hits hard especially when youve experienced something like this personally i love you thank you for this i really needed it so my boyfriend broke up with me other person wwhy are you looking up them because i need to cry but my foundation costs 48 im watching this at 11 at night and by the end of it i wanted to talk to my boyfriend we are both trans and we have both been through shit phobic family members and parents when i saw the trans flag in the bedroom and when i heard jacks speech i felt a sense of pride and sadness i wanted to check in with the one person who has been there for me the most i didnt even know how much i needed to

thank you jack for youre words of inspiration they really helped me get in a good mindset and just keep on being you who ever you choose that to be why cant there be a love heart button we all need one 1550 means its too bad why not oh my god to see how restless jack was when he was talking about his personal life i have so much respect for him and to have the courage to talk about these subjects is so amazing to be able to find out what you love to do and be able to do that to help others that may be feeling the same way and to make their day brighter what an amazing person i cant even count how many times ive thought about those dark thoughts and its almost every day it really is hard and i know that all too well im typing this as im listening to your words sean and i broke down when you said theres always someone who will care because i always feel like theres no one that cares you opening up about these topics is amazing but i honestly dont want to see more of these types of videos but the same amount youve been doing for the past few years ive been watching your videos why seeing you happy and laughing makes me happy and laughing seeing you restless in your chair thank you for this game and ranting this is completely relevant to my life now if you havent already check out under the skin with jay shetty jack your so inspectional when you were talking about do what you are happy with and i love basketball and im really good at it but just i feel like i cant make anything but you said do what makes me happy soo i started practice ing even more and play even harder i was suicidal my whole life i would always think about me as a person who cared about others and tried to help them even though no one helped me then a great friend of mine killed herself i never saw anything that would lead to that i didnt saw it coming and that shit really hit me how could i miss it even today everytime i think about her i just see her laughing always happy but she wasnt i shouldve known jack i actually really appreciate your tangents you may have a accent but i understand you all the way and i appreciate this cause its like a rhetorical therapy session instead of a rhetorical question and it really cool thank you besides the beautiful story and deep thoughts the art style is beautiful if you dont go check out her channel she literally creates the most beautiful art pieces with so much emotion and that i can appreciate im sitting here listening to you read this out and fighting off tears i may be a little drunk lol love you jacksepticeye i feel like there was 1 more ending cause you never replied to goth chicks messages im going to work harder at getting my life back together its tough though yea its hard to work on something you dont like welp that broke me dear sen im currently suffering from anxiety disorder you helped me get through a lot recently i was watching your videos for a long time like since 2016 so i wouldnt be empty and depressed all the time i just wanted to not feel the way i often do i was hesitated lately in what i wanted from life in what i do and what i will in the future and that was hard for me just a teen who has a habit of running away from problems and ignoring intrusive thoughts i was and i am afraid to talk to someone because i dont want to bother them and its very difficult to believe that some people really do care in this environment staying truly motivated and positive is no longer an option sadly lots of people feel that every day i never liked myself i tried to be who i ever wanted to be tried to change like dyeing my hair pink or changing my style completely considering getting a tattoo or wearing makeup so i wouldnt feel disgusted of myself im slowly learning to love mys jack im sitting here finishing the video and i just wanna tell you im sorry im sorry you felt like you needed to give so much of your life away to us im sorry you pushed yourself so hard and it caused so much strain on your mental health but also thank you thank you for being you thank you for doing everything youve done and do for all of us thank you for taking time to yourself and your life outside of this thank you for being happy in yourself ive been watching for a long time now and ive noticed youve calmed down a lot but i also know that youre still the hyperactive swearing and funny loudmouth that i love to tune into and listen to you are such a great person and honestly i love this new positive and happy you i love that you have cut back to take time to yourself to do the things you want to do i love that you spend more time tending to the garden of your life and keep growing the beautiful relationships you have you deserve to be happy you dese thank you this man is one of the

this jack it was really deep and powerful and so many people needed to hear it im so grateful that you addressed this just wanted to say youre very precious thank you so much this was very emotional i think knowing that people in the public eye feel this way is very humbling and brings closer as human beings and breaks that barrier of entertainer and viewer we are all here together fighting to be

all get there together thank you for the little message at the end i really needed to hear that as for you im glad youre taking more time for yourself and not constantly burning yourself out im not exactly good at long motivational things but no matter how irrelevant you may feel to the internet you mean the world to many of us were here for you just as you are for us okay so i know you wont see this but ive never once thought youve cared about us any less or that youre becoming irrelevant even as your content has changed youve changed and helped me and saved my life more times than i care to admit youre a hero to me and to so many people and im so glad that youve put the boundaries up that you need because you need to look after yourself too watching you and your channel is sometimes the only thing that can get me up in a morning and even if you didnt post for weeks that would continue for me because sometimes this channel is my escapism im so glad you can have some time for yourself and can have some self value you help me grow as a person and help me understand myself and when you say things like this it helps me further ive hit rock bottom too many times and youve always helped that regardless of any barriers there are you make me and so many others confident so many of us just want you to be happy and to hear you developing i got so emotional from your speech i never knew i needed to hear that i feel so lost sometimes and honestly even a hug can help and mean so much to me right now thanks for the great message jack i would love to believe in myself i just wish i could walking into the darkness of the world we hope to find the light it many to reach the end but only few can find the light light is not something that is easily found only once we stop and look in side our self can we see a flicker of the true flame to light the fire we must look into other and trust the fire they hold the light is not a place but its the idea the can learn and trust other to be our light jack fully opens up for 20 minutes and has a genuine talk its nice to know hes not afraid of the internet and feels brave enough to speak from the heart its really inspiring im not crying you

for yourself thank you so much sean this touched my heart hi i dont know wholl see this but im chinese and my parents always want me to be successful and to be either a lawyer or a doctor and i write for a job and my parents arent accepting of it and this game just really hit home my brother is the golden child and can do no wrong in my parents eyes so they push me to be like him or to be someone they want a kid to be im in my room crying right now and my depression really fucking sucks and this is so fucking relatable and i dont know what else to say you are the same person just everyone seeing something else thank you hey jackieboi you should play life is strange its alot like this thank you sean she will burn with gay satan thank you i needed to hear this i love you i know this might not relate to the topic of this video but thank you for recommending that same great coke taste with added vanilla flavor i love it this game was so beautiful but sad at the same time kudos to the person who made this this is so sad thank you thank you for everything i really appreciate it i played this game and i fucking cried shes my favorite game developer i just fuck her games hit hard it scares me how much i relate to this in more ways than one when i was younger i was labeled as a gifted student i never had to put in a lot of effort to be good in school and i was never pushed to work harder now i have bad study habits a terrible sleep schedule and i feel like im slowly disappointing my parents and im not meeting peoples expectations i used to want to be a bioengineer because ive always wanted to help people but now i cant imagine myself working in a job like that id go crazy singing acting and most of all writing are my favorite things and i want to be a writer but im too scared to tell my parents theyll say im wasting my potential potential i know i dont have im not smart enough to cure cancer or save the world or stop climate change im a pretty good student at this point but everyone else is so much better and more motivated than me my parents think all the time i spend playing video games watching youtube or liste i love this always take care of yourself first always you only have one life and should make the most out of it x the art is absolutely gorgeous and thank you jacksepticeye for being so open with us im really late but i honestly feel tired of everything and scared every single day i scratched my hands until the skin broke multiple times im only 1114 but i have these thoughts of suicide and such and i want to tell my mother but im scared of how much itll be to get therapy and maybe shell think im joking so im scared to reach out for help i told friends but they dont really get it that much due to our age group i just feel cornered i think about wholl care if im gone but im also too scared to end my life because if i do ill be gone forever and wont be able to talk to the people i want to the people i care about this video encouraged me to talk to my older sister about how i feel thank you sean you are an amazing person and you make a lot of people happy so glad youre here i started crying around 3000 you have helped me so much over the five years ive watched your channel thank you i love how shilohs music is playing in the back 3 play the walking dead again please jack eat some hot nuggets n i dont know if its from the nuggets or jacksepticeye relating w us holy crap this game breaking news irish man is competing against keanu reeves to be the nicest person sean we love you take care of yourself we find you as a friend not as entertainment thank you for being here for us i cried at the end of this cause im scared of getting older and failing at life your words really help sean what is you have to be positive all the time because everyone around you looks up to you thanks jack wow your speech really resonated with me this is what i needed right now thank you so much sean much love everything about this game is 100 correct that spun me out more than anything thank you because ever since i was young like 67 i have hated life and ive been suicidal but ever since i started watching you you have helped me when times are st worst thank you because you have helped me but you have made me feel better when my depression is at its worst thank you i feel like this everyday but you and my friends have helped me with life and everything gone wrong and you make me feel like i have more in life than just death and sadness but you make me a little happy sometimes my world has been a wreck but you and what you do make me happier mainly one of my friends only really care about me my brother never personally cares but if something is wrong my friend wont leave me alone about it like he needs to help to care and he is the only one who feels like that because at school i never feel up to doing anything but he wants to do things with me and he makes me happier but eventually i just couldnt take how i felt so i wanted to tell him what was wron ive never related to a game more this is so perfectly done i love it your the best sean your words have really moved me and i appreciate you you should also take time for yourself we are still here for you no matter what we support you i had friends who done suicide as well and i personally have had my ups and downs with these sorts of thingsself harm may help you feel better as the healing from the cutting goes to your brain making you feel better its a liebelieve me im going through a break up thats crushing which can be depressing but remember if youre going through anything people are here for you like my few friends who i bet dont want to be named so i thank them youre the most true person in social media sean this is so goddamn important very glad i watched this today thank you this is my favorite video of his it really hit home when he said that when life is going so well and then theirs something so small that pushes us off the edge cuz our emotions are so high im just a different person now im not sure why but this sentence just made me cry changing is very hard and when people want you to stay the same you feel lost and confused and tbh kinda scared this is where i am in my life i feel stuck and confused and i dont know what i want to do my parents and even my siblings expect so much of me that i dont know what to do because whatever i do doesnt feel enough i cant enjoy the stupid little things that i used to do or watch anymore and everyday feels the same slow boring nothing exciting i just dont know since youre a youtuber your subscribers care about you we understand that you have a barrier between us but you continue keeping that barrier because as you said you wont have anything thank you just thank you for this video i cantbegin totell youjust how much this video saved my lifei was deeper in the darkest parts of my thoughts than i have ever beenabout ready to drive my car into a river thanks to you opening up here i found the strength to call my sister and got it all off my mindi really hope that one day im able to meet you so i can thank you in person thank you sean even though the warnings shouldve stopped me from watching this video im glad i ignored it because seeing jack open up about these issues makes me really idk at ease jack if you need a break sometime you can you mental health is really important who else noticed the shilohs song while the sky scene if i remember its name correctly i just want you to know that i love you and i love everything that you do every video you put out one little thing is all it takes to make a change and effect someone so drastically i just want you to know that you put a smile on my face and you make my whole mood change you really helped me back in 2018 when i got cheated on for months i was alone and crying myself to sleep but when i watched your videos you were the only person that made me laugh and feel less alone you dont know me of course but it meant so much to me im still struggling a bit now but i am trying and thats what counts 3 so thank you man i appreciate you i hope i can meet you again some day meeting you in 2018 was fantastic sen also this looks like a face me looks at pillow it does i cried when jack no one has ever told me that and i just started crying am i the only one who can relate to may i would rather not share my feelings online but i have cut myself and tried to kill myself multiple ways but i always act happy around everyone thank you jack i needed that i really love this game the first time i played it i thought i was supposed to save amygoth gf so the ending is missed and thats when i get it that i was supposed to save may and as someone who struggled with depression i put myself in mays shoes and what are the things that i gotta do to make her feel that her life is worth living and i got the ending hope and god the happiness i felt when i was able to give her hope and so of course i played the last two endings left i am really happy that you also played this thank you for opening up angela hes games are really great with amazing art and real issuesstories this is a large portion of the reason i call you jack and not sean if i were to meet you in real life i feel like i should feed you my life story a portion of it at least before id start calling you sean because not all of your life is known to me yet right now ive only met jacksepticeye i have yet to meet the real sean 3647 sometimes i just need videos like this tvt sean you are absolutely amazing thank you so much for making all of us feel like we matter and helping us along the way in life i wish i could reach out to people but no one listens to me when i say anything i could be as loud as you and still no one hears me pretending i dont exist ive long since learned to never say anything because no one cares about me made apparent with how no one listens to a word i say or acknowledges me when i speak the only one i ever had was my sweet little alicethe cat ive commented on another video that got hilariously startled by your intro once but i had to put him down in february because he developed cancer in both of his lungs lifes been more rough for me than ever before but no matter who i talk to my words falls on deaf ears and as a result i keep everything so deep inside that i can convince everyonemy boyfriend my mom and my two new cats i adopted from the shelter because they needed me the most that everythings okay when in all honesty nothing has ever been okay and never will because literally no one hears me when im speaking at 1055 an add came on and i almost craped my pants from the scare and vietnam flashbacks of ddlc my job is solitary i drive around the countryside to remote sites and im alone pretty much all day it can be a blessing but it can also be terribly lonely sometimes i have to make a conscious effort to reach out to people when im not working even though im tired from work and want to relax because if i dont i end up too much in my own company i feel like it must be similar for youtubers as they spend a lot of time in a very solitary situation breaks from work and making effort to connect in the real world is so important xx sen you do you man i know how that is im currently going through it and knowing all of this i mean like i respect you so much more like ive known about some of this from past videos and respected everything that you said and i respect everything you say now depression is one of the worst things someone can have i am currently struggling with depression i have a therapist because they dont want to give me medication a because im younger than 17 and i mean its not working but i know what its like to have those thoughts its good that you havent acted on those thoughts but you do you and take your time on everything and take as much time as you need to keep yourself as yourself so you dont lose you i understand and man i have mad respect for you you took time to find yourself even though it caused you to lose some people you took a risk that so many ate afraid to take thank you for the inspirational words and i hope that encourages people to go find sean we will always be here for you even when you dont think so we support no matter what if you in time alone we can understand you do so much for us we can do the same for you if you just want to talk we are here not matter what we will always support you never forget please you are a person just like us jacksepticeye im so sorry you had to go through that but im glad you did because your my antidepressant please dont stop and if you are going through this please get help its like i dont understand my emotions until i watch videos like this and then i cry and jack does his speech and i take a deep breath and im ok again thank you for helping me im happy to grow with you i didnt even know how badly i needed to hear that until i was crying thank you just thank you thats all ive got really there are times when i dont even know im going through it and itll hit me really hard you dont even notice sometimes every day has just kinda beenthe same day over and over i even started missing work again but now i strangely feel likeive gotten the answers i really needed so thank you for that youre not alone any of you im here if anyone wants to talk whatever it is its not your fault even if you think it is please believe in hope no matter what it is theres always hope reach out scream out for help the world is a terrible place but there is always someone who cares and want to here you arent alone weve all had those times where we feel low ive been there we all have i dont want to make some soapy bs like weve all heard in school about finding help i just know from personal experience that whatever it is its better to walk through the dark with someone holding your hand you are not nothing you are not something you are something else and to the people closest to you you are everything please find hope love someone this is my favorite youtube video by far so relatable thank you sean 3 i have never dealt with depression but its always heartbreaking when hearing others have dealt with it in such a heavy way when i was in college one of my best friends i met there revealed to me that she had severe ptsd from spending 4 years in the army i always tried to be there for her one day she came to class looking like she had been crying i asked her if she wanted to spend some time together and she said yeah that would be nice and we went out to lunch and she just talked while i offered what comfort i could she said it felt so nice to have someone there to listen rather than judge so remember whoever you are you arent alone in this world and if we just took an hour to talk to someone it can change everything 233 guys yall know thank you sean i love you so much i am going through a lot of shit atm and i am currently reaching out for help bc deeper things i dont want to go into you give me so much hope i am really really thankful for you i cried through the whole video this is very relatable one of my best friends is depressed and hes very closed off about it i want to help him but he doesnt want help i dont know if he is suicidal or not but i think he needs someone to talk to about it i dont want to push him about it but i want to help him yo the gay hipster meme that is this game perfectly embodies me as a person and its pretty neat o yo the room looks exactly like mine down to the pride flags its wack how many people really understood may not like just being depressed but actually understanding what she was saying unfortunately i can say i do if you do as well im sorry and we can get through it together just hang in there good things happen and you focus on those not the bad things just hang in there and know you have people who love and care about you hesitated to watch bc i know abt the game but didnt regret it thank you for this aw jack youre so amazing stay happy do what makes you feel good jack whoever says that can go take a walk you are a amazing man and you inspire so many and youve definitely helped me through so much and i cant thank you enough for it but just know that if you see this we understand if you need to take a break and thanks your fan mary i loved the way you were and i love the way you are now im enjoyed watching you grow as a person and a youtuber your an amazing person sean and you have helped me so much in my own personal growth ya kno this game made me think of we happy few that one gameplay a while back that i think jack got deep on about have a question if you dont want to answer thats fine buthow did you get passed your depression i am getting help but did you literal sad boi hours dude you dont know how much this means to me thank you so much catch me sobbing through this whole video thank you so much sean 3 the trans flag yayyy that was deep jack me just learned a life lesson wow this game really spoke what i cant find words for im probably gonna rewatch this a few more times cause wow also jack thank you for sharing how you were feeling and dont worry a lot of us are still here no matter what i dont yearn for an old you because i joined during this change and i think everyone needs to move and change as life goes on i should have watched this sooner like sooner as i wish it was out like a year ago i really feel a lot like this i know you dont need our validation but i appreciate your existence i dont care about the amount of videos you upload or how often you upload or if your content gets views or not i care that you are genuine and that honestly is worth more than two videos everyday seven days a week i like that you dont follow trends like others and make your own content you are a breath of fresh clean air in this dark hellhole called the internet even if you decide to quit youtube dont quit being an awesome person 3 i really want to believe you but i dont omg3338 that broke my heart when your eyes got red you are so strong and so loved by many people on youtube remember that because you do these videos it allows for thousands of people to escape especially during hard times thank you for being you thank you for touching the lives of many even if you dont realize it ouch this video but hard i cant give you everything because the i have nothing for myself you said it so perfectly the entire part about may being a golden child whos good at everything thus having terrible work ethic as a result and the part about how interacting with her mom makes her sick and angry hit really fucking close to home also the way may describes feeling stuck in a loop that she hates but has no idea where to begin getting out of it ive never hurt myself or thought about killing myself but ive definitely thought about situations where i accidentally die like if a car hit me right now and killed me on impact id be okay with that or if someone threatened to push me off of a roof i probably wouldnt fight back im not sure if those are considered suicidal thoughts but the way may describe how she could vividly picture iti fucking felt that my girlfriend has lived most of her like with very severe depression caused by childhood trauma shes even attempted to end her life twice over time you get better at understanding the right things to say and do making sure to regularly check how theyre doing even if they seem happy focus on giving that person both the attention and space they need i feel like this really hit home for me with may where i just felt like i couldnt do anything i didnt know what i was doing i didnt know why i was sad and it was bottled up and i had no one to talk to so i ended up hurting myself and imagining what it would be like if i killed myself i felt worthless and so down i was blinded by the sadness i had inside me and then i met someone who was going through the same things and we both helped each other get through our hardships and now to this day we both still get sad but were better now and i personally feel so much better just talking to someone and getting everything off my chest even if i didnt know her at the time so please please talk to somebody even if its a strangera friendor a therapist i promise you everything will help and dont kill yourself you are worth every second and even if you feel like nothing i bet you 100 you make someone happy so please stay alive for them and dont give up jack thank you so much for being candid i know everyone says it but youve made a huge difference in my life and im glad youre here 3 sean you probably wont even see this but you dont need to do things to make us happy you must do what you want do what makes you happy because seeing you happy makes us happy i and a lot of other people dont love you for your entertainment we wont throw around hateful words and insults if you need to stop we will support you and encourage you in your choices i dont love you for your entertainment im watching you because of your personality even if some of its fake youre doing it to entertain us to make us happy but you dont need to i know you put this out to help us but part of me is getting a message that you may have been going through this currently i started having dark thoughts at eleven to twelve fucking years old im only thirteen right now newly thirteen but i have a weird and twisted connection and relationship with darkness and depression etc i know how much care you have for your fans and i can see youre kinda out of it you can anyone tell me any of the song names theyre so so super pretty and i wanna add them too my playlist thank you for sharing your experiences and for the advice i didnt even realise i needed it thank you so much you ever just uno reverse that shit i love videos like these make more of these jack we love you thank you for opening up just thank you if i just go outside and stare at trees moving my mind im sending pictures of the most amazing trees i am glad i watched this video made me feel better oh yeah i remember wanting jack to play this a good game sad at times but good im loving the we bare bears references is this lofi hip hop simulatorno jk intended 138 fantano is crying right now 2601 im sorry is this some sort of normie native grammatical mistake that im too fluent foreigner to understand its also important not to feel guilty or blame yourself for not living up to the expectations of others whether its friends family strangersits your life and its none of their business unless you want it to be dont be ashamed or afraid to follow your instincts as long as your actions dont harm anyone i had close family tell me in a million subtle ways throughout my childhood that i was different to them that i didnt live up to their idea of a good kid that i needed to change to be happy they still do but these days i tell them that im doing what i want to do and im happy i can tell that they think im lying covering up some secret sadness that im not more like them but they can think whatever they want it only affects me if i let it i know it sounds like a platitude and im not going to tell you its easy or straightforward but sean is right keep trying and you will get there and theres nothing shameful about asking for help you are n there is always a way out always if you ever feel alone seek out help hell if anyone needs someone to talk to im here even if im just stranger on the internet ill gladly be here to help anyone out no one deserves to ever feel that way it hurts it does but just know it is not the end for you there are people out there who love and care for you we love you jack dont ever forget that this game really connected with me and im so happy youre making and have made so many strides to improve your relationship with your own self 2017 was a bad time for me too i didnt realize how nice it would be to hear someone talk about how they have been going through it and have pulled through as well love the lofi this game is really good for me i like it but im not gonna cry cuz im in a better place now still wish i could get a girlfriend tho oof may is me ive literally described stuff the exact same way she does haha oof thats rough sean looking directly to the camera and saying youre doing great meant so much to me and made me feel validated this game reminds me so much of night in the woods and the relationship between mae and bea when you take beas route or the relationship between gregg and angus so cute omg losing interest is the background song it kinda mad the whole mood sadder sean you have such a great heart and character i had no clue that i would feel this encouraged by someone playing games i really appreciate you taking the time to say everything you did you had me in tears and even though you were worried about not articulating well you spoke so clearly and your eyes showed so much compassion keep doing what you are doing and enjoying your life and those sweet moments with your girlfriend in the end your side of the screen is all that matters and taking care of yourself and those you care about is so important again thank you i really needed this monday motivation thank you for all your hard work and dedication to doing what you do well and being meaningful we love you sean 3 instead of yearning for what was look forward to what will be love you sean dont change the moment before he opened the door 1057 a mcdonalds chicken nuggets add came on and it scared the hell out of me heh thanks for the talk jack lets just hope it helps me heh yup im depressed but luckily i dont cut but jack i just want to tell you when your depressed you feel alone you feel like your trapped in a dark room with no door and no windows so you can only stare a dark corner for the amount of time your in there but when someone helps you with your depression it feels like someone just opened the door that you couldnt see in so long but if no one opens the door you feel like no one cares enough to even open a fucking simple door for you so the dark room is your home now but you cant bare the darkness so you feel like the only way out of this darkness is to go to the light god damn this was so triggering for me i have gone through this it is i just cant help but see the video i am so curious that it hurts me urgh fuuck jacksepticeye enjoy your life loved the energetic you but i also love your mature self now you have every right to enjoy and take time off those who say your channel is dying are just blind your videos are still great and are the absolute best today ive done nothing i havent wanted to do anything ive layed in bed and slept and ive been so so tired and drained but i have no reason too because life is good right now and its a lot to deal with so thank you jack i really needed this today to be honest i really like the person youve become you keep changing for the better when youre at the moment when youre trying to see if the roommate killed herself but a random upbeat pillow commercial starts playing randomly before you get to see anything i hope your okay shaun ive been through similar struggles be strong time heals all wounds 3 3246 when he started talking he looked like he was going to cry because he had tears in his eyes but at that moment i wish i could give him a big hug because sometimes thats what people need 3 we love you jack losing intrest i liked how most of the comments that has replies are jokes and only some deep shit chicken waffle depression bread gets comments because of this video i noticed that im lying to my self everyday lol i was just looking at harry potter series shit man just seek help talking about it will make it all better i know it hard but you just gotta push yourself its the worst feeling to see someone commit suicide and knowing you coula stopped it red stuff on the floor is blood mays blood there were scissors on the ground i cried when i saw this whys everyone lesbian im scared i heard shiloh in the back ground what was the game that jack played like this and by the same creator youre going to make an amazing dad one day youre an amazing person sean im glad youre here thank you jack for everything you said at the end i really needed to hear that a hole mother your lazy why dont you kill your self depressed mayyour right ties hoodie string around neck if youll excuse me i am going to go cry my eyes out now this is so weird how this works one of my best friends just almost killed himself two hours ago he gave me a time and he gave me minute number until the time hed do it when he said 1 it felt like the shortest yet longest time ive ever experienced after so many missed called and messages he answered i cried for so long and made him promise not to ever do that again i hope everyone knows that somebody out there loves you whether you see it or not somebody loves you if you feel not so theres so many people on the internet that would love to give you their time and love to be there for you i hope everyone has a great night morning day love all no idea why i felt this video as much as i did not suicidal but i care a lot about other people and can be there for them but suffer to my own mind more than anything overall i dont have a good view on life it doesnt seem to be getting better both personally and in the world in general death struggle emotional disconnect lack of remorse lack of empathy and here i am in the military where suicide is more lethal than gunfights and bombs romantic relationships are very untrusting with high divorce rates and cheating and people you get close to wont be around long while also bring away from all my friends and family im very reluctant to even want to extend myself to people out here in this new life in a new environment because i feel im just going to be let down again i seem to not be able to let go of the past stuck in a state of constant nostalgia wishing things would go back to the way things were past friendships or relationships that turn sour and ruin t congrats on finding yourself and making time for you you deserve it everyone does as a burnt out creator this whole videorelatable is way too weak of a word for the way this makes me feel and it pisses me off how unfair it is that these internal struggles are so hard to defeat for anyone else selfdoubt and apathy have the most insidious claws thank you for being in my life jack you make it so much better damn making me cry as always jack thank you thank you for being such an inspiration to everyone thank you for helping people each day thank you for making videos thank you for being who you need yourself to be you really truly inspire me to follow my dreams ive recently been doubting myself but your speech and this video along with your channel in general have helped me to keep doing what i love and staying true to myself thank you sean 3 you left me alone had a beautifully heartbreaking song ive kept in s playlist since watching that playthrough i cant forget you by rxdlxst jack gives me so much hope for the future hes such a bright light on so many of our lives he deserves all the appreciation we can give he saved so many of us without even trying he has such a good head on his shoulders and he has such a way with words he allows us to believe there will be a brighter tomorrow he deserves so much love 3 may reminds me of sayori from doki doki literature club i didnt know how much i needed this thank you youre the best sean i wish you could disown your parents rather than the other way around thank you jack i really needed this im really happy that i took the time to listen to this play through tomorrow im getting on a plane by myself for the first time to visit a dear friend of mine that i havent seen for years its been a long time and im worried that when i see her well be two different people then we were when we were younger butim also excited the reason i mention this is because ive made a promise to myself that i wasnt going to focus on social media during my trip maybe a few pictures here and there or uploading of art but other then that im going to focus my full attention on spending time with her because i dont know when ill see her face to face again to hear this same mentality before my trip feels like a sign im doing the right thing thank you so much sean i fucking love and appreciate you you gorgeous and amazing irish bastard jack have you ever thought about dropping youtube to be the worlds greatest therapist this really hit home thank you for this he has so many subscribers but never gets many views jack opens door me braces self youtube ad dont vape your content means so much to me especially when you play games like this you give such amazing advice and im so sorry for what you had to go through to get the wisdom you have now hope you have a wonderful day everyday waffle studios will remember that thankyou for talking things out at the end it really meant alot videos that jack opens up in are my favorite thank you thank you jack this game hit hard it was beautiful thank you so much sen if im honest its been a long time since ive really genuinely smiled or let myself cry i knew it was bad for me but i didnt let myself out i wanted to be like you i wanted to be positive and loved by others youve always inspired me bacause you always seemed so much better people love you and you help them all i wanted was to be you you made me realize today that me is all i have and thats what i have to work with so i promise from now on i will be true to me and allow myself to love ill let myself cry from now on man sean opening up and tearing up made me cry because i went through a tough before and it just reminded me of it i may not know who you are or what youve done or what you plan to do but whoever you are you can talk to me you can comment here message my account or something send me a message and ill do my best to help you all deserve so much if youve noticed that a friend isnt the same as they were talk to them they may need just that love yourself i love you 3 sksksks i love this game already purely for the pride in this why not do what you love ok i know this is a really emotional game but my mind drifted off for sec there youre right you shouldnt give all of yourself away live in the moment i need to comment this before i forget but i think i really needed to see this its strange to explain but it helps this helps so much the gamekeeper creators and sean thanks so much i really appreciated this video hold on im gonna play this then come back thx jack i am going trough all of it and you made me realize that i am not alone and that even though i hurt the people around me a lot i should be happy and that just idk thx for being open with your fans cus i think everyone has that kind of toughts in this era because of social medias and everything and someone like you being open to others about that is incredible and it helps more than u can imagine knowing others hurt too and that u arent alone i know you arent gonna see this but its for everyone you should open up to someone because if you keep it inside it will just stay there and rot your soul and mind and you think the world is messed up and then you start hating everything and its just so horrible not being able to trust anyone anymore because you think everyone wants to hurt you with it and theyll tell it to everyone the only advice i could give you is to open up to someone that cares about you not someone that you trust because if you trust be he just doesn your messages at the end of these type of videos inspires me so much these messages inspire me to keep going and do what i love thats why i love watching you play these games because these messages inspire me thank you thank you sean for helping so many fans feel inspired to keep living and its because of you we want to keep going when i was 20 i felt like may did i nearly ended things now 6 years later i just moved into an apartment with my soon to be wife i still struggle a lot with my mental health but i am so glad i didnt end it if i had i wouldve never met the love of my life and my beautiful friends i dont really have a point to make except that i thought i wouldnt live past 20 but now im slowly getting close to 30 and things are actually falling into place and i see a future now and i want to live it thank you for everything you do id never say im depressed but sometimes i just feel exausted for no real reason i wont want to talk to people ill be talking with someone and just not connect sometimes i just cant stand listening to people and my mind is always just exploding and then when i watch your videos not even always actually paying attention to what your really saying and just listening to you in the background and everything just quiets and i just feel so calm thank you i hope jse can read this this video is really relating to my experience and the way u told us about getting help n stuff was amazing man i cried ive in tht situation idk wat to do hope u read this u wont cos it a week old but thnxs for being so positive it helps alot jacksepticeye thank you jack i platonically love you 3 jack you are doing wonderfully your channel has gotten better with each change i couldnt imagine youtube without you youve done so much for me and so many others its time you get it back take time for yourself man and thanks for the words of wisdom ive been in a rough place for the last month or so im an artist i used to draw all the time and ive just been so down i havent even been able to draw i havent felt like doing anything at all i recently took the time to just enjoy some video games and lay off of things that i couldnt find myself enjoying im slowly getting back into things guys just take the time to help yourself if it helping you do it dont do what you dont enjoy just because of others his speech at the end really helped me realise alot thank you sean jack you are so inspirational and heart warming thank you jack i cant believe he has the same thumbnail as bijuu mikes vid of the game thank you i needed to hear this i genuinely hope youre okay the last two weeks were kind of hard and you opening up and talking about mental health issues helped massively so thank you sean the soundtrack is what really hit for me because these songs are a lot of the ones i listen to when im upset holy shit ive seen things like that with one of my friends its just heart breaking when someone you love and care about wont let you help until the last minute sometimes you just dont know what to do in those situations when its someone you love and care about the most but im never sure if im going to do the right thing all i know is that if i help i have a chance in making their life so much different a life maybe where their happier than what ive seen my friends a couple of them suffer from depression and they take it to a different level even me i suffer from it too but i can only see me doing it in my mind ive never flat out done it but i know if i just push through it and not cave in i wont have to worry about it as much as i do now bruh whenever i post a picture on insta if some gay or bi girl comments calling me pretty i have to painfully explain that im straight and then we never talk again its kind of crazy to think that i downloaded this game a few hours ago played it and only then decided to check back on jacks uploads damn if thats not a message to how good this game is jack should be a fucking actor when he caught may and he sounded genuinely shocked speaking her lines amazing voice acting losing interest by shiloh was playing hello i was inspired and if you feel like shit maybe you wanna read this idk i remember this one stupid day years ago when i was feeling so shit family problems were piling up and i was drowning in school life i felt like i was wading through sludge i went to make a bowl of oatmeal as one does and of course the oatmeal exploded in the microwave that was the tipping point i threw the bowl and cried on the ground for three hours straight completely alone in my house surrounded by cold oatmeal on my kitchen floor the point is your problems dont have to be enormous for you to feel them youre valid and its okay to be upset that goes for anyone who reads this sometimes shit just sucks and thats okay be upset let it hurt and then try your best in spite of the suck believe me cleaning crunchy oatmeal off the floor was not the best thing in the world i cried through that too but what matters i guess is that i stood up and did it anyway get out the picture of fall out boy tho not supposed to be watching this crying my face off everyone needs an inspiring sean after each video thank you this really helped me honestly anyone that is going through something hard you dont need to get a therapist or an expensive social worker just find yourself a good friend and talk to them and tell others they can talk to you if everyone has someone to talk to then we might be able to combat depression on a mass scale u woke me up thank you jack you dont need to apologize if you need to take a break from youtube take it we wont get mad or anything well suport you because we love you just the way you are you dont need to be as active as you were in the past because we all know that you are an amazing and mature person we want our jack from now that jack who is like a dad for us please dont cry or apologize for that we understandsupport you and well do until we die dont be sad because of us just live your life the happiest you can all my love and uwus if you need them mara 3 jesus thank you so much man im not really an avid viewer of this channel but this speech made me cry the amount of points that you brought up that hit close to home was uncountable the way you brought everything up was just amazing i really respect you man holy fuck yes im so glad someone with aplatform like yours has found this game its the bestest im watching this on my birthday which is today the fall out boy meme sent me the truthfulness of how it is to be walked in on self harming is unnerving thanks jack this video helped me alot thanks for keeping me alive caught myself crying jack youve been through so much bullshit but you can pull through and i honestly look up to you for that you are so strong and you have every right to keep your shit to yourself you are your own person and should never let those people get to you because they have no idea people change and you have changed in such a good way some may think youve down graded but youve grown personal growth is the best thing that couldve happened to you jack it doesnt matter what other people think it only matters what you think and how you feel i know this is just another thousand comment and you probably wont even read it but i hope one day somehow youll see this and see how truly amazing a person you are and that theres so many people that will support you no matter what you rock man x last twenty minutes of the video jack therapist mode activated theoryis jack a robot sean can i just give you a hug now thats something i really needed to hear today thank you hey sean i just wanted to say im relieved that you could break off and focus more on yourself and your personal life its hard when youre the center of attention and so many people say so many things and you feel responsible for it all but youre in the right to prioritize your mental emotional a psychical self you dont have to feel bad for talking in length about it either or not having everything in perfect order of what you need to say just getting your words out is enough to bring things to a half way point where we as you viewers fans subscribers people that care about you can begin to understand more we see the effort and well support you keep going you got this your probably not going to see this but while some people see you cutting down your videos is bad it has been positive for me i used to depend on youtube on each day watching new content from you and other creators when you stopped it inspired me to self reflecti started to find what makes me happy and now it feels like i know where i want to be and has made me a lot more motivated to achieve what i want to achieve i spend a lot more time away from youtube now but i am a lot more psychologically healthier and i believe this would not be the case without the slower upload schedule as i am really bad at self managingi started to study more and take on volunteering opportunities and i could not be more happy with my life what you do with your life is your choice at the end of the day each person has a different life to lead and it took me a while to figure that out sorry about the length i just wanted to get that out there thank you sean just halfway through the video but it really hit close to home being given so many expectations that youd have to carry because it was what your family had of you and yet when you show a little interest in the fine arts like writing they shun that ideology right away saying theres no money in that field theyre not engineers or doctors is a line i constantly hear in our household i like this game i like games like this who disliked this video wow you are on my hit list now his speech was so touching dudes i will find you i will track you down and i will get my ultimate revenge on the haters that speech hit me so well though d i missed you jack i just relized that in the tittle screen they are sitting on freaking blood i knew someone who self harmed my ex actually i remember she was in really bad shape when we first started dating she had two failed suicide attempts on the list as well wouldnt eat the whole lot we were together for only a little over a year but throughout that year id gotten her to eat regularly again got her thinking relatively positive and i got her to stop self harming part of me is still mad that she left me and that we didnt work out but the other part is just grateful shes still standing somewhere out there you dont know how much i am thankful thank you so much you gave me a push towards the light thank you i really want a friend like me in this story why is may me the golden child of the family and for that my parents never really pressured me not putting in any effort to anything writing then my life seemingly falling apart my parents wanting me to get a real job i relate to her so so much the world needs more people like you jack normally if theres a video that has a speech at the end like this i would click away but this one has so much meaning and felt so genuine that i couldnt recently ive been my own worst enemy as well beating myself up all the time the part in the game where she said it seems like shes living the same day over and over is exactly how i have been feeling for a while goddammit jack youre making me cry you bitch its crazy to think that angela made this in 3 days a game thats sooo powerful and has been on my mind for the past week was made in three days ea and epic have nothing on that i needed this the chinese words mean to lazy why you dont no ive played this game too yay what is the music in this game you havent changed at all or well the changes youve made are good ones for you and they make you happy jack kinda made my heart beat fast out of nervousness thats not good because on social media theyre makin this crap seem like a joke depression is not a joke it can not continue to be swept under a rug this is too serious to be hidden if you are suicidal talk please suicide will never be an option jack you are truly a positive movement on this app please never stop your words and the emotion you show in your eyes means a lot much love bro much love we love you jack no matter what you inspire us and we understand what you did and why just do what you need to this really hits me because my brother is also going through a really hard time and not being able to help is my greatest fear and reality i want to help but dont know how my attempts never help and it really overwhelms me im not in a healthy spot myself its not nearly as bad as it is with him though so i want to help but dont know how to help him when im struggling to help myself everything is in a really tough spot and im really lost fighting tears rn but seriously sometimes i have thoughts like mays i never feel like i should ever cry in front of people the older i get the harder i fight tears i never want to tell people these problems because i feel like so many people in the world are suffering more than me so why should people care more about meshit i dont think ive cried this much in years self love is not selfish you cannot truly love another until you know how to love yourself 919 or you can make your eyes look pretty more than 50 times shiloh playing from 1330 really got me into the feels qq for all of those who are going through a rough time remember this it will pass it might pass like a kidney stone but it will pass me crying for 48 minutes straight wait its been 50 minutes already thank you i needed everything you said i love you and all the people who have shit to say can fuck off literally you are you you dont need to be who they want you to be fuck all those idiots you are beautiful you are real you are valid you are loved you are you i thought about playing this game myself and decided not to simply because of what this game covers i went through a rough patch in life and it was a bad time for me im avoiding watching and playing this game because i dont want this game bringing back memories of that time i would much rather forget about most of that time instead of be reminded of it i definitely have seen you as a person and i definitely know that privacy is important for people seen in the public eye on a daily basis im so glad you talked at the end it really hits home because ive dealt with so much that i never thought id get to my 20s so im you mentioned that motivation because right now i really needed it i want to do something with my life and i believe i can i love how the music had shiloh dynasty anyone wanna chat like on insta or snap i also play xbox in case anyone wants talk and chill in case they need to get stuff off their chest insta ebicslavgamer xbox csgo 4 life 666 just message me i really needed your words thanks for sharing almost like a parent saying be nice to so and so if a person is rude to one and kind to another let them be who they are i dont like forced kindnessniceness if a person is trying thats one thing but having it forced so no one knows you is another i think i know when someone is forced to be nice its after they talk to some one who tellssays be nice or else being nicekind is already there its when and where you express the kindness that its noticeable im not claiming kindness but ive had some one used to talk to me go to avoiding me another asks what my prob was then the avoider started talking to me again i a cant change attitude that fast when you become a prob to me give me wks a month to get over it this hit deep and helped me love you jack 3 thank you hi jacka sean i look into other accounts social media for laughs or s i feel like answering and to see that the ones i follow are ok edit when i dont have time for vids maybe this is a bad idea maybe no one will see this and its unlikely that anyone will pay me any attention yeah this is a mistake but fuck it i have it made an amazing home life everything i could ever want or need and yet i have what i think is bipolar depression theres no damn reason why i should be depressed but there are days when it just hits me like a ton of bricks and i feel exactly like what may in the video was saying heavy tired useless occasionally i toy with the idea of what death would feel like not seriously i would never do it but its something in the back of my head on my worst days this video hit so close to home for me i saw myself in both of those characters im usually the one who will care for everyone else like the character that you play as but i have my darker periods where i feel like may sometimes for days at a time someone close to me have some of the same scars that may had she said that she did it to herself to feel something this fuckin hit so close to home this video is beautiful in so many ways the game is fucking phenomenal and sean got to open up about his feelings sean if you see this you need to know that you are still active in the community and we are all so proud that youre taking more time for yourself its okay to take breaks i paused this video to go play the game i love this game from the music to the art style holy shit its such a beautiful game with such a beautifully dark but knowing message i cried i felt like you hit me with words that i have been hearing and to hear you say it damn that got to me the etika thing was a hard hit too but jacks words here are correct ive just started seeing a therapist for some hard times it may help it may not but ill keep trying thanks man thx jack this video has warmed millions of hearts love you jack a thank you for sharing this to me it help me a lot knowing that you whant though the same thing as me jack i want to hug you so badly right now and just cry is that a bad or good thing youre never irrelevant jack and even though you probably know this just a reminder that you have us and we understand if you need a break or to distance yourself from the routine of youtube it isnt easy and nothing really is but we arent going anywhere and thank you for your videos and way of dealing with people and stress so well and your amazing commentary thanks jack i mean it i was at the verge of giving up already but i saw this and it gave me the courage to try again so thank you and god bless jack this is one of the best videos that shows your open self about feelings we all love youand you just became a you tuber therapist for people and friends that are out there watching you doing your youtube stuff making people laugh including me his video really opened my eyes jack is so inspiring and is always so happy but even the happiest of people go through rough times no matter who or where you are someone out there cares or you loves you and needs you never give up because whatever youre going through is temporary and suicide is permanent seek help for an international suicide hotline call 18002738255 stay safe everyone 3 damn thats deep you should take time off i feel theres a limit for everyone with work or anything whether its enjoyable or not and you need to detox even if its jusy for a day everyone is awesome sean youre awesome hey jack im a man and even i realy want you to do asmr seeing you tear up oh my god i love your thoughts and your reflections and you are right when i was 13 i was ready to end it all and thinking about my loved ones made me stop im now 30 and i think completely different to when i was 13 and i would never think about offing myself now things get better i live with constant anxiety but i get help thanks for your words i can relate to you and im sure a lot of a people can too love you man thanks for this video jackit really means alot to someone who can relate alot to this type of stuff thank you for this hearts of love to sean take care buddy ouchie ouchie this one hurt the music from the game was perfect for his speech as soon as jack said oh shit i got the same feeling in the pit of my stomach as he did edit id give context but this is a 16k comment section no ones gonna see this comment its games like this and people like sean that make me wanna become a psychologist and while watching this video it was hard to breathe and it looked like sean had an apple clogged in this throat while trying to speak its heavy emotional stuff and if you ever need a break from youtube then do it you cant help others if you havent helped yourself first you know it really hit me how realistic and honestly clever this game is because youre given a choice accept the computer messages and insure your happiness or ignore them and help your friend but in the end no matter what you do there will always be missed messages and there nothing do about that you cant always have it both ways most people irl would accept the messages and never know that they could have saved their friend because there are no restarts and behind the scenes messages are so much harder to notice that video was just beautiful sean should be a motivational speaker he would help soo many people get past their problems and insecurities who are the 834 people who disliked this video what kind of asshole would do that i once had these days no one cared about me tho and i felt pretty sad my parents were busy with my sisters everybody hated me for no reason in school was getting bad grades and a lot of homework to do i had no one that could help me i went through it after a while when i felt back in the family again but i never had the thought about sucide because i thought about it sucide means end just think about the good times you havehad and get someone to help you through this time outer wilds now 2243 everyone wrote harry potter fanfiction at least once in their life thanks sean the videos that are like this help me realise that im not alone and people just like me are dealing with the same or worse problems you are really helpfull even if you dont think so jack spent half the video talking about mental health i so sad anyone can be depressed and they seem perfectly fine they seem happy but in reality they could be depressed with no one knowing youre the same person as always jack its okay and totally normal to have mental breakdowns at different times in your life youre a person no matter whats your job nor how many subs you have time passes we all grow but were the same person youre a human too jack im so happy you feel better now i still see the loud boy and your positive mental attitude all around its lovely to see you genuinely enjoy doing videos and enjoying your life in general we love you but we dont own you i got now the notification youtube what you doin bro we need more games like this we need more videos like this sometimes we need to get reminded that you are a person too and you need to be you so dude if you ever read this go be yourself sometimes take a break do what it takes you have a good enough fan base we will stick around i know i will again you probably wont read this but thank you for all youve done youve made such an impact on so many people including me i never get the chance to vent this out so i might as well let it drown in comments of my favorite youtuber a lot of the time i bottle up all the negative emotions from friends and my mom who i cut contact with then college is so stressful to the point where i feel physically sick from the stress and sheer pile of work i have to do every day i felt so emotionally dependent on my ex boyfriend because he manipulated me and used me for sex my best friend helped me realize how much of a mess my life was and helped me take a step back from it all things are still bad but hopefully they get better i just bottle up all the emotions and end up letting them out at the worst possible time jack tears up everyone also starts to tear up i know its not relevant to the game but the trans flag being there as casual representation made my heart happy for all the trans women out there anyways that being said this game hit really hard seeing the game from the perspective on an outsider looking in seeing what these signs look to other people and seeing how much it can hurt someone just shattered me it actually got me to call my friend and ask to hang out cause i fully planned on staying in bed all day doing absolutely nothing curtains closed and not getting dressed not talking to anyone or eating i think you tubers with such big platforms should be spreading these messages and putting this stuff out there especially in the time were in and how many people are secretly suffering i love you sean and what you said but i have to respectfully disagree with you about things getting better life is too short and will end in the blink of an eye and everything will continue without you and you will not know it you will just be nothing nothing that we do will make any difference in the end and we cant do anything about it if anyone can convince me of anything else i will be grateful but for the moment nothing matters we will all be nothing and im terrified of it i took a walk in a park yesterday with my fiancee and it helped so much even though it was hot and got cut short by sudden rain it helped im crying i love you jack anyone else cry when he found may in the bathroom you sound like ropo and its my first time here p for those who dont know this game is free on steam holy shit this was so helpful because im going through shit thats getting tough to handle and like its really hard to handle and i feel so alone and just feel sad and angry all the time and i dont ever know why or how to stop it what really sucks is im really scared to talk to people because i dont want to be a bother its hard and what sean was saying really really helps thank you sean for being you and always there and just its really amazing and ive watched you for like 2 to 3 years and ive watch so many old videos and like you seem so much better now and it makes me so happy to see it gives me hope for myself and saves me from anything like that damn the good vibes bro hi idk if youll see this but thats okay ive watched you for such a long time now and yeah i felt like this then decided i was too afraid of death to go through with it but was still feeling like i wanted to die this was about 12 years ago its really weird to want to die but be petrified of death xd but once a week i talk to someone at school and he just gave me perspective on so much and what youve saying about boundries and pulling away from youtube really hit home because it feels like all the realisations youve said in this video that youve been having ive been having too i turned 18 2 days ago i used to come home strsight from school and watch you then wait 2 hours then watch you again i was in such a routine that when you broke your routine for the first time i realised how much i relied on you and was distracting myself and not doing anything but watch you that was the first step for me to make the first move in growing as a person that was 34 junji ito helped with this wtf no wonder they pulled off that creepy vibe so damn well holy shit at first i thought this was an upload from suicide sheep thank you for playing this game and posting your words after have made me cry as everything you have said is totally hitt home and mean so much i have severe depression and have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for over a year now i self harm and every day i dont want to wake up i bury myself deeper into the darkness in my mind thank you for helping to highlight this horrid state that so many people are suffering in hey sean ive been depressed for 5 years and i cant reach out to anyone becuase im to scared to do so but when i saw your vid i just stared outside and thought about what u said at the point that i was done with staring outside i just thought that it would be heartbreaking for me if i continue to be myself because i really dont want to be me anymore but when i heard u talking i just want to be myself again so i just want to say thank you sean watching ur videos partly cured my stage of just wanting to just end it all thank u for making the videos u do ur my 1 youtuber i know for fact god is a man 5120 you will never be irrelevant to me fan for lyfe thank you so much for making this video i know a lot of people really needed to hear that im glad youve been taking more time for yourself and im sure everyone here would be completely fine with you taking a break whenever you might need one were all here for you all the things that i heard in this video was beautiful we love you jack thanks for saying all of the advice and other beautiful things you have said this hit home for me because i feel similar to this and my friends are aware of it but we never talk about it its hard to talk about your depression especially it the people you want to tell or need to tell struggle with it too anyways just had to get it off my chest i love episodes like this no one knows whats going on in seans life no one knows if hes hiding his emotions and episodes like this give him time to open up and show the public that even famous people have emotions it gives him time to open up we all need time to open up thank you for being here sean youve helped me through rough times i lay awake at night thinking of the worst possible outcomes in life and i watch your videos to make me smile and look forward to the future i love you so much i know youll never see this but i appreciate you and everything you do i was about to watch netflix after this video i drew a painting about life and

felt very lost with no direction in life but it gets better i remember in 2015 on this channel a few moments talking about depression and seeing comments and feeling like those were so unreal it may not be perfect but it does feel damn good there are always people that love and support no matter how you feel 3 this is such an important message im glad large influencers are still talking about things like this thanks jacksepticeye jack or sean thank you for playing this game i heard it from a friend and thank you for your rant it was something that is touching and helpful to many or most ive seen in the comments i only have this to say thank you and to this community of fellow gamers or just normal people i hope you all are doing good dont forget to talk and reach out if your struggling remember someone is there to help just be willing and be strong i love you all virtual hugs for everyone be yourself and stay great this goes for you to jack sen to be honest im trash at

virtual hug right now thank you so much for peeling back the layers a bit in this video i respect and appreciate your decision to share such a personal and painful snapshot of just how real you are im about to hit the 8th anniversary of the day my soulmate took his own life right in front of me with a riflethere are no words i have yet to truly morn this violent and devastating tragedy and left me with a deep feeling of vulnerability and the hole that was left all the way through my soul has yet do you show any signs of healing for obvious reasons of course i am strong and brave in certain ways i choose to always seek out a positive no matter how dark a situation can get and i have faith that everything happens for a reasoln in its own time and without apology but i do not know if i will ever come to terms with the events of that day i am forever changed the story is much more elaborate than that and my wounds are its hard to get out of bed some times but every day i am still proud that i did get out of bed i might not do much some days but whatever i ended up doing is something to celebrate it is a daily struggle but i know i have come far in the last year and i feel ready to push myself more in a direction i want to move in negativity still nags and comes for me but it blows over like clouds in the sky more and more so it doesnt stay with me like it used to its not easy but to slow down and breathe and to be honest with yourself and to be kind to yourself over time it does change everything i dont know how i came across you recently im almost 31 and i dont really play video games well i havent in years but i appreciate you and the end of this video you seem smart kind and down to earth thanks man do you read all the comments jack but i love the art its been a

college im not content in my life yet but i can see a future it took 10 therapists 5 different psychiatrists and alot of selfreflection and work dear god so much fucking work but im over the hill for now and i have hopes dreams not again but for the first time its not easy i still have bad days and im not even really happy but i can be i have been and its ever getting better everyone has a chance its just finding yours and surviving long enough to get there i used scissors when i cut myself i havent done it in about 2 years now but ik that when you use scissors you have to push deep or its just a scratch its still there in my mind but i dont my life did a full 360 i have an amazing boyfriend and hes been the best thing for me and had helped the most when not even my parents could hes my best friend and i love him i discovered jacks videos that same year i was cutting it wad the best thing i found before my boyfriend the only thing that could quiet my mind was his videos and he helped inspire me thank you sean for helping me the best you could through a phone screen im not crying youre crying im legit crying please stop but keep talking 3 ily damn the speech got my crying this video and the stuff you said hit hardim a teenager and things now are really hardbut i feel so much better when i watch you when i listen to youthank you for everything i mean it aww i love you jack im going through shit and have been my whole life and im about 17 and how introverted i am and do nothing but watch youtube and play games has made it harder on me i am happy that i could never hurt myself or suicide because i just couldnt but i still just eat and eat bad stuff and thats how id prob be killing myself but im actually attempting to fix that about me ah this hit hard to home with may and her mom my mom just always tells me how useless i am and how ill never accomplish anything was really depressed at the beginning of college and didnt go to my classes and it bit me in the ass and after that my mom hated me and made me feel like crap for messing up my dad too it sucks my own parents are against me and even now some of my friends who i thought were my friends its hard to live in this world alone sometimes shiloh dynastys music is in this im crying im not crying that made me feel comfort i was hoping you would play this game hi i love ur video today i kinda got distracted for u but i came back and loved ur video i loved everything u said i cried so much during the entire video and though i could write 50000 words because my mind is going crazy about what i think about this video but too put it simply i loved the game as it shows how struggles arent always seen and every bit of help like just listening can really help someone out and that your words in the end meant a lot to me and im glad youre are now able to personally talk about how of course you love the community and youtube and all but youre a person like everyone else and people have boundaries that should be respected but im also glad that you still opened up a bit about a few things showing that youre not as you said just an entertainer but a person a person with thoughts emotions rough times all of it and how you encouraged others including me to not give up and its not always going to be like it is no matter how much you think its hopeless to think itll get better you really inspire people when you start ranting actu did anyone else hear losing interest by shiloh dynasty people have the thought that if no one sees you do something or accomplish something then it didnt actually happen or it doesnt matter as much we need to shake that mentality is more importiant to experience things for yourself and to enjoy things for yourself looking at your life through a lens is no way to spend your life live your life with no filter and i promise youll find so much more enjoyment omg i played this game like a month ago first run made me sad af this hits so close to home right now 3 thank you jack listen right now your channel growing more then ever this is a massive community and you are talking to us perfectly if you are having a bit of thoughts take a break keep yourself to yourself if you want we love you and its ok its ok do you want to know how to make a game like this very simple make a sad story thats about it its great how jack predicted the uno reverse moment xd everyone has a hole to fill were all in the same boat called life all you can do all anyone can do is to make the best out of the life theyre given follow your heart take care of yourself 1002 if jack choose no everybody criticizes if jack choose yes nobody was that kina playimg in the back this game hit a little too close to home i have a friend that i call may that i have known since third grade so 7 years and she goes through issues such as this she refuses to talk to a professional about it because others have it worse so she believes how she feels isnt important and she doesnt want others to feel guilty pained or ect by her issues and im just trying to be a good friend to help her anyways i just meant to say that this brings out a bit of a fear i have because may my friend is such a sweet heart shes one of the best people you could ever meet and because of my past she has become my everything i fear losing her to herself it was i need to cry but my foundation was 48 i cant believe that its worth it this youtuber made me cry which is kinda rare for me to feel in some youtubers i swear hes a professional therapist well damn needed to hear that this was good that moment when you try to be a good friend to everyone you know then they use and abandon you then after a few weeks they start begging for help with stuff so youre like uhh you were pretty mean but ok then they use you again and abandon you then a few weeks later they come by again like hey i need some help with this thing and your like no then theyre like ill kill everyone you care about if you dont do this so your like leave me alone dood so theyre like loser idiot kill ur self nobody cares about you and then they leave forever but for some reason you miss them total bruh moment o btw if you know anybody like that i dont recommend giving them money after they do all that to you oh my fucking god i saw it on steam sent it to my friend as a joke and i see jack play it there was a girl a few years older than me she had done a speech on something and her reasoning behind it was her best friend had called her really early in the morning but she either didnt answer or she hung up quick the next morning she found out that her best friend had committed suicide always check in on your loved ones and friends you never know what someone is going through never when may said then im stopped by the thought of the pain ill cause others is the reason i never attempted suicide you have been such an inspiration to my daughter thank you for being there for her for showing her that it she isnt alone you and these types of games help uncover the veil that is over mental health again thank you being gay is so hipster i really relate to may in a few different ways i feel like absolute shit all the time and i just feel like nobody is ever there for me its a horrible way to live tbh i hide it from everyone during the day but honestly im just miserable this game is absolutely beautiful and im so glad its raising awareness for people going through depression and other mental health issues your amazing i really appreciate the talk you had at the end thank you my plan was to just grab the keys to the gate throw them back into the yard and run into the streets of south africa hoping that someone would kidnap me when that happend i would piss them off so theid kill me and it would be suicide since my mom was at work and my sister in hostil and our house keeper doing her job i could just silently go outside and run away in an atempt of suicide without anyone ever knowing my plan but i told my friend and my mom found out we didnt get help but it made me feel kind of beter i still feel like this alot but i think of how my mom cried when she found out and i put on a fake smile everyday and pull through 2857 i gently open the door this made me smile so much thanks sean sorry if i wrote your name wrong seans girlfriends name is evelyn emily will remember that jack im so proud of you for how far youve come i know firsthand how hard it is to change the way you live and how painful it can get and how long it takesand i also know how important and powerful it can be im so happy for you it never gets easier and every day is a little earthshattering for a while even days like this years after the crisis period opening up reflecting and synthesizing to the point where you can share your experience with others like this is a really huge step and is so brave thank you for making it through your snowstorm i hope we can all learn together how to walk in the snow jack sweetest angel ill always like you no matter where you are in life i like you for who you are at the core im so glad that youre doing better and thank you for taking the time to speak about this at the end of the game it really hit home thank you i am on antidepressants my depression still comes up but thankfully never to the degree of this i had a severe depression years ago now im sad

try to hurt themselves or think about ending it all this video really connects with me as being the person who sees how much pain the people around me are experiencing the hope ending is truly beautifully created and thought out depression and mental health is a life long thing you dont just go to the doctor and youre cured it takes years of hardship and learning in order to combat such dark thoughts and ideas i want to give an absolute huge thank you to the makers of this game for creating an amazingly true storyline regarding these kinds of topics 3 426 omg its fall out boy and i screamed im fucking crying im not a crier i feel so bad for those parents seeing your whole life and heritage go to shit and become nothing a harry potter fan fiction writer that is sad 2509 thats a good way to see it but if yo dont have money to pay bills a place to live etc its difficult and when your parents dont support you and make you feel you are wrong by doing what you love its tough

influenced existential philosophies hold a stronger more practical grounds than the western thinkers geniuses they r in their own right of course thank you for just being a great factor in the lives of many people the weird thing is i played this before i new it was popular and got all the ending then i saw it on youtube and was like i couldve been famous suicidal stuff gay mac ratdog cute ok 3 minutes in and im already smelling the stench of a retarded 14 years olds drama jack you have the potential to help people and you not only use that potential but also give people that potential to

decided to watch this video and i just wanna thank you for speaking about mental health issues sean its so complicated and bringing any form of light on depression and other mental issues helps so much i think youre very caring its obvious with how you talk about things like this just thank you 3 that ending felt as if he was speaking directly past my face into my mind and heart 3831 i can feel sean whenever i talk about those parts of my life that i dont wanna show makes me quiver and reminisce about it then i start tearing up but still thanks sean youre words really helped almost all of us who have watched this video keep being an inspiration sean thank you for opening up and bridging the gap a little more between viewers and content creators i myself get stuck looking at others lives on social media and think to myself that my life sucks because everyone else is living their best lives when in reality we are all people who hurt have bad times and have great ones so this game was inspired by real lifeif it was the ending you got firstmy condolences go out to the persons family these r my favorite type of videos of jacks which may be a unique opinion sure i love jack when hes screaming and being funny but when he plays these obscure great short games watching them at night is the best ugh why is he so good at reading this and making act like like they are actually talking mays door is a metaphor for her opening up to the player at the beginning of the game her door is closed but as you start talking she starts opening her door i had a friend like that that hugged and and asked if i was okay one day its nice the support but havent heard much from them since then its like they distanced themselves i wonder if it was my fault but love the game graphic amazing art work 3222 wait junji ito tje mangaka junji ito the king of horror manga junji ito where is outer wilds this almost made me cry im usually a very quiet person in this community but this hit me hard sean i know you wont see this but if you need a break take it your mental health is by far more important to us than you acting happy for other people when i went through this therapists didnt help me very much my friends had my back through everything and the appreciation that i have for this channel and them is immense for anyone going through this the main advice that i would give is dont give up on the things you enjoy eliminate toxic people and things out of your life and focus on your pma you are loved and appreciated even if you dont see it once these bad thoughts go away you will realise that reach out to people and make sure theyre truly okay jack all the things you say make me fell i can mostly do anythink and i just went to thanks you for that and if you read this you are a good person thank you jacksepticeye i needed this i love you jack this means so much i i dont even know what to say just just thank you jack thank you hey man me to you youve gotten me through alot of hard times i dont know what id do if god didnt put you here thank you this is why jacksepticeye is the best other youtubers would just use humor and ignore the message of the game but jack actually sits down one on one and talks to us about it sends out virtual hugs to everyone who needs it she promised a bedtime story and my only thought was if she promised to tell a bedtime story tonight she cant commit suicide tonight im not ok damn jack you could be a therapist thank you so much this made me cry in tears of hope 3 this game is amazing as someone who used to be kinda suicidal they captured it so perfectly it was exactly how i was at that time and the plot is great god dammit am i the only one who wants to go up to him and give him a big hug sean you are truly inspiring and know your way with the words i love you so much and i want to tank you very much for everything you do for us its funny how he probably wont see this comment but im pouring my soul into it because he still really means a lot to me so on that note from us all thank you i cried because ive gone through something just like this story thank you jack for being so inspirational to me this comment section is gold it is proof that even if we hear about the toxic youtube community everybody is there for each other even of we dont know each other and thats why i love youtube it brings so much people together and everyone can express show and share whatever they want with the support of others so to anybody reading this i love you and youre also breathing thank you i never realized what ive been going through until i watched this video im now going to find what makes me happy not what people want and expect me to do this hit hard personally i can not thank you enough i really really needed to see this today one of my friends is going through something and im doing my best to make sure shes okay but no one can get in contact with her ive been so so anxious because ive been through this before on both sides and this helped a lot thank you i need to know the name of the jazz music i agree with jacklike a few weeks ago viarecon diedsome most say suicideif you wanna watch his tribute video by operaterdrewski then go to drewskis channel and watch this game makes me wanna be a girl and be lesbian and have a friend like mayid rather be lesbian then gay which i aint the art is beautiful the music is so relaxing omg thank you im working on finding a therapist for myself because i am incapable of finding some chill im working 70 hours a week my insomnia has been flaring up hard core and my old coping mechanisms just arent cutting it anymore im overworking myself and i need to stop that finding someone is a little hard due to living in a rural area but youve inspired me to go ahead with the next step which is calling the three or so potentials i identified earlier this week unfortunately today is a holiday so i cant do it right right now but tomorrow im working a shorter day so ill do it then i love you jacksepticeye thanks for being so nice anyone else the scars on mays arms thank you for playing this game thank you for your discussion at the end 3 one thing i absolutely loved in the game is that she knows shes not an expert and that she dosnet want her friend to depend to much on her when you are in the deepest and darkest places in your mind you really need to talk to an expert friends should be used as a support and the ones who help you smile and forget the bad things but they also have their own mental health to think about loved this video 3 at 800 anyone else thought it said airpods me listening to jacks speech about depression with more passion and understanding than listening to the teachers dude this really hit me hard cause i use to wanna die and had a set date i actually went to a place for help before that date hit i also found a great person who happens to be my lover now please if anyone out there is having struggles with selfesteem or just stuff deep down know that you can find someone who cares and itll be ok if you really need to reach out for help its ok to ask for help some of you have this channel jacksepticeye to lift you up but

for open up to us this game hit me so damn hard since my channel really small and am starting to use my voice in some vids i found this game and made a vid out of it and i was thinking bet jacksepticeye going to play this xd lol this game is amazing lgbtq friendship love memes i can relate and the art style is amazing i hope another game like this comes out it was great seeing you play it and discuss these topics i watched the game play and it made me relate to it and then i started crying but when you started talking about help etc i started to stop crying and think about life and just listening to what your saying helped so im gonna take your advice and thank you so much your amazing keep doing what your doing your amazing at it and you deserve everything you have 3333 i relate to may a lot i started out really smart and i did great in school but i never learnt how to try then suddenly i was in secondary school and people were catching up i had learnt to compare my own worth to my test scores compared to the class average to how much better i was than other people and then i wasnt and i didnt know what to do i still dont know what to do because ive built my entire personality around being smart and now i cant do that my parents never meant for me to end up this way theyve always been supportive but back when i first started getting shitty marks in school my mother wasnt in a good place mentally and she would take it out on me and my marks shes now been diagnosed with depression and paranoia and shes incredibly supportive and is a lot better i project my fear of failing onto her a lot because of whats happened in the past but shes completely understanding and shes helped me more than anything else in reality the only jack this game somewhat struck a cord in me i am very suicidal and nobody seems to see it the only thing that brings me any joy anymore is youtube and ur videos make me smile and laugh and feel so happy thank u for making great videos that make me feel so happy i relate to may in a way ive had someone i cared about talk negatively about what i want to do for a career he said it wouldnt get me a lot of money but i brushed it off and told him that i didnt care for the money and id be happy im thankful that jack discussed that topic a bit when it came up i played this game a few weeks ago and it really hit close for me anyone who feels suicidal or just not feeling welp know youre not alone and please talk to anyone know you are loved and valid hi jack i need it i love your speech in the end 3 i love when you play this type of games 3 soo cute sooo true and soo eyesopening 3 thx 3 honestly thank you i feel this girl i may not cut myself i may not have a bad of life as everyone in this world that has tried

think of how people think of that it scares the shit outta me i love my friends and my family but im not good talking about this stuff to them i cant lift everyones spirits by talking them i cant it makes me feel helpless now im not this or close to it but i do get moments were im just in a im done today im done with the day i just wanna go home and sleep i will try to help anyone but usally th

health it really means a lot thank you so much for doing this thank you sean i love jack so much but i had to stop watching after 39 minutes because it was such a strong topic and it brought up old memories and emotions i still cant quite deal with yet and its just a lit to do with the fact im in a recovering stage ugh my heart hurts i love sen so much but i felt so overwhelmed and anxious bcuz hearing him talk about that stuff made me suddenly feel vulnerable and i wanted to cryyyy sen illlyyyyyy thank you so much for talking about these topics 33333 lol i just played this i love this soo much thank you jacksepticeye i have gone through this kind of stuff and i was going through it untill i took your advice and appreciate you for who you are much love man this is one of the most im a special snowflake videogames ive seen nice speech though thank you for being who you are jacksean i hope the best for you 3700 aww jack when ever youre feeling down we are always here for you thank you so so much things like this really help people who feel like this and i hope you stay happy everyone that does feel like this because your awesome damn that got real deep real quick this is such a great and interesting video i think a lot of people go through life and dont tell anyone about there sadness personally i try to help my friends who are going through tough times its not easy to reach out and if you want to help someone you need to push it and go beyond to help them anyone who is sad out there need to know that there are people who care for you weather it be a therapist or a stranger a close friend or a pet if your going through hell keep going this community is wonderful and not just here everywhere you could go anywhere and people will look after you so if your going through tough times remember that i would be willing to help you others will be willing and your never alone the start is exactly the same i can strongly agree with jack social media isnt everything ive seen a lot of people forgot that around me and away from me this hit really hard for me i usually dont value myself much and thought about those thoughts i have strict asian parents so a lot of times its hard i help a lot of people by being there for them and just helping but in the end they dont really say thank you or any appreciation thats why i dont value myself too i often get stuck in my head and overthink i get overdramatic over things that are stupid to others and special to me and hearing someone say i deserve happiness and give advice to the voice in my head just means so much to me because no one has really said that to me literally crying thank you sean jack can you play the other ones and open to viewerslove this kinds of vids deep the art and colors in this game are great the story is well deep and its interesting thats why i like games like doki doki sean just brings a smile to my face everyday i love you jacksepticeye man this video hit me like i do feel alone in the world and i did used to cut but i told my friends they helped me out but like i feel alone all the time i try and talk to people but i just push them away i used to be so happy and so much more active now now i just sit in bed and distance myself from life go out when im needed everyone thinks im so happy but im not as soon as i said is that spotify sen said what is spotify the game was good to help bring awareness jacks monologue is priceless omg jack you made me cry i love you so much this is my new favorite video by you and you have seriously helped me and just so you know you could take a year off and i would still come back to watch thank you jack i was self harming awhile ago and i have stopped now but i was very depressed and sometimes still am thank you for you being so kind and being so positive manthis game hit me in the feelingsi do have those problemsbut its getting better jackyou are amazing mani hope life gets better sorry for my grammar the sad part is that not everyone has a freind that is like that and jack thanks their is sometimes the voices are loud enough to bury me but your louder voice helps cut through the rest and it gotten better so thanks i was at the point that i had done some stuff that still scare me on how close i have gotten so thank you originally i typed a longer comment but it was way too long i havent cried until you started talking thats when the sadness hit me full force ive been feeling worse than ive ever had lately a month ago when my class had a end of 8th grade party its the only time i truly felt alive ive been feeling pretty dead all i can do is stay in my bed all day and read fanfiction or listen to music which fucked up my earsand that makes me feel even worse i dont find the motivation to do anything else i have scoliosis my doctor told me i should like work out and do yoga but i feel so tired im just sitting here panicking but doing nothing about it i was always alone so in 5th grade when i found this girl im best friends with now i was overjoyed maybe i got too attached because if she doesnt text me i feel like shes bored of me same thing with my other friends i dont feel like i fit in their group theres a whole lot more reasons as to wh normally i can watch these kinds of things without struggling so i went ahead and watched anyway when i realised what her roomate had done my blood went coldmy best friend had just barely avoided succeeding in a suicide attempt last month car crash going 100 mph without a seatbelt on and rolling countless times he escaped with a few bruises and needing 3 staples in his leg all superficial wounds i knew it affected me deeply but i didnt realise just how much once again i am so thankful that hes okay and getting the help he needs im not going to stop watching though with how much its on the news nowadays i cant fall to pieces every time the topic is brought upim in healthcarethis is a thing dealing with health and not only for my patientsi need to be able to handle these topics again for the sake of myself and the people i love i almost ended it when i was 8 years oldim almost 20 now and im glad i didnt take my life back thenbecause while life is hard i love the sky in that picture its so pretty and i love the pink color hello person who is reading this i want you to know that you are beautiful no matter what people you know love you and will always be there for you when youre having a tough time so if you feel like youre at your lowest then know that the only way to go is up im literally crying number 3 your ex number 2 your mom number 1 duolingo bro even if u became a full time fortnite player i wud still watch ur stuff shiloh is playing in the background watched your video til the end and three words escaped my mouth thank you jack sean did anyone notice the bloody scissors on the title screen hey sean i know im a little late to the party but i still feel the need to give you something back of this compassion and understanding you just shared with us i watch your channel for quite a while now and though i hardly ever comment or interact your content does mean something to me please dont be sorry for disconnecting i personally really enjoy seeing you happier and more you than like 2 years ago one video of you being self confident and happy with who you are is to me way more valuable than twenty videos where youre trying to give us the jacksepticeye we expect even if you dont really feel like it i learned so much just through you sharing your experiences and giving me a feeling of not being alone with my daily struggles please keep up that great development youre really making a good change for a lot of us to those who actually read this sorry for my english and i hope youre doing great 3 i really care about you as a youtuber and a person im super glad that you are becoming happier as a person i have major depressive disorder and two forms of anxiety i feel like this game really speaks to me this game shows signs that are not that noticeable im trying to feel better any body else see the scars on mays arms i hate how much this hit me on a personal leveland how much i get may and her thoughts without the slap top of the morning doesnt make any sense guys i just wanted to say that sean is right we all have problems and even my self have been in a dark period i believe that the problem is caused by social media and we are all afraid about what we should say to people we are worried about what they will think of us of our personality maybe our partner or sexual prefrences and many other things that may push us down no matter if its school or work or whatever you gotta stay strong stop worrying about other people and what they will think of you be yourself and try to find people that will accept you for who you are and dont be with people who make you miserable if you are going through a tough time talk dont close yourself in cause youll end up selfdestructing there is always someone who is gonna be there for you fight for yourself cause theres always something in life that is woth living for 3 damn this game is so original dear sean i just want to say how touching and deep your story was near and at the end as i was listening i found myself tearing up and smiling when someone else says these things they have such a big impact and people dont realize it thank you for taking half an hour out of your day to motivate and singlehandedly inspire millions of people including myself ive always watched your videos with a beaming smile on my face and this video alone fueled me to keep working your words are so genuine and absolutely amazing youre a big person with an even bigger heart and thank you for using this platform to spread a message such as this everyone deserves to hear this once in a while even the most happy people thank you ive been more disconnected from you lately by that i mean i havent watched or interacted as much but youre still a favourite youtuber of mine same goes for the community you could take as much time off as you need and still care about us and if some people dont understand they arent worth the time they get from you to be real with you about five months ago i was in my darkest place im still in a dark place but im a lot happier then i used to be and i feel like i owe some of that to you ive only watched you since 2017 when you were going through a rough period but you inspired me and made me happy when nothing else could i have found hobbiespeople who can do that now but i just want to say a big thankyou for helping me in that dark time i hope youre having a good daynight sen stay true to yourself and dont worry about those people who are not worth your time i might not relate as much as im 14 yrs but im so proud of how far youve came with your mental floss like a boss keep it up i think this is how you spell sausage in gaeilge ispinn a few weeks ago a friend from primary school committed suicide i had not spoken to them for 5 years so it was such a shock to me that it ruined my focus for 2 whole weeks as someone who is depressed and has had suicidal thoughts pop into my head myself i was really affected by the news and even though i was distraught and crying for them deep down in a way i sympathized with my gone friend i dont know what it was that brought my friend to do it but he obviously had a reason to want to escape and leave so much that he killed himself i know how scary it is when the thought to end it all seriously comes into your head for the first time after the funeral of my friend i am dealing with the news about him better while in the shock i did my cosplay more to get out of my own head for a bit that kinda helped me deal for a small bit please get help suicide means that you can not get better no one can help you when your gone let people help you please i can relate to this game so much it kinda hurts thanks 133 welp im a hipster can someone tell me whats the beat thats playing in the background i didnt know a game could make me cry this much i really dont want any youtuber to feel like having to give everything to the community i cant imagine how hard it is to seperate job and private life in this industry so its even more important here on youtube i want my favorite youtube people to be happy and most importantly healthy even if it means that this person has to take a break from youtube forever i want those people who give out so much love and effort to the community and to me to be loved and happy too and dont feel obliged to anybody you give so much and this is the least i or we can give back right love to everyone this video really gave me the feels i hope you are all okay out there a few years ago i struggled hard and thankfully its gotten better but i still get my moments and i really considered ending it all but instead i threw my life into watching youtube and dragging myself through the day it seemed like i felt everything or nothing and it was torture i felt alone and abandoned but it was people like you who helped me get through it all thank you sean i just wanna hug you for that speech at the end it motivated a lotthank you for what you do and i wish the best for you and your girlfriend i cried my eyes out and then wrote a long thank you note to my friend for being there for me always and hopefully for many more years sean youre such a kind person i love u even more jack you really touched my heart even though ive never been in such dark times like that all i do every day is just sit on my computer and draw with videos in the background headphones on my ears inside i cant stand to draw in in silence but my world also feels too loud with the videos in the background im too scared to go on walks sit outside and take in nature and try to eat healthier because its too out of character for me for the person that eleven year old me has made im thirteen right now what you said has made me realise that i should change and not waste my childhood by keeping headphones on my ears its not healthy for me physically and mentally i mean my phone has made me shortsighted from looking at it too much i think i have problems hearing from having headphones in my ears for too long i zone out too much i have way too much trouble concentrating and unless im specifically paying attention to something i block out everything else subcon thank you for talking about these topics thank you jack for talking about it this is a very important subject and the more we talk about it the bigger chances that it would help somebody who needs it and of course thank you angela he for making such deep and beautiful games you are fantastic this really touched on a personal level and i found myself relating with may and ive realized a lot of stuff i really appreciate your video and the heartfelt talk that you gave yes i agree 100 i am that person whos always there for people not trying to flex and its hard cuz people say oh yeah nuggets got that and nugget will make me feel better etc also who else cried when jack made his speech i did because he really touched my heart and i am going through this and to everybody whos going through this situation you dont need a whole bunch of friends or popularity all you really need is a good friend who will listen to you no matter what dont listen to the voices in your head that tell you to cut or scrape people care about you they really do people will miss you if you end it all people care about you oh my god i played this game before i realized jack did what do i do that the people had this day can you tell me at 3729 to 3737 i cut myself plainly that i want to stop but also dont i want to tell friends but i fear loved ones will find out or friends will distance them self from me i just wanted to say this some where so why not here and i have asked if i could see a therapist but we dont have the money so sorry for complaining to whoever sees this ppp two words thank you person you cant save everyone me im gonna try person its not gonna work me i dont care im still gonna do it person just give up it wont help me it doesnt matter i still want to help i am 10 but i have always felt in some way depressed and watching you always makes me fell a little better in my pathetic life and my dog dying made me even more depressed in a lot of peoples lives they have never really been happy but you can always find happiness in the people you love one more thing though always suspect that a person is depressed if they act really

me though the hard time i appreciate you so much thank you thank you thank you for this video i actually needed this right now and you help day to day hehei relate to this last year my then best friend came into my bathroom while i was cutting myselfandit wasnt a pretty scene she helped me through my depression and now she is my girlfriend even nowthere are times where i fall back on the sharp blade i usei regret it so much now butwhen i would cut the pain would go away before i began cutting i was the emotionless kid because i had no way to express myself i felt that no one would care if i disappeared forever and then one daymy sister saw my armshe began crying and hugging me saying im sorry im sorry im sorry god im so sorry and apparently she had attempted suicidebecause she couldnt stop the thoughts in her head even now i feel that im pointless and honestly the only reason holding me back is the people that i would effect if i died sometimesi still look out from a roof thinkinglooking at a sharp bladethinking of the blood ive spilled dont do it you i literally just played this i cried for hours it sucks i have experienced this and it brought back a lot its an amazing game its heartbreaking and eye opening thank you jack this video really helped me thank you for getting down to earth with everyone it made me feel a lot better about life and going on im not crying my allergies are just acting up i know sean will never see this but if by chance he does thank you for being you thank you for having these open talks with us somehow you manage to reach out and hug and make those laugh who need it most in my life i havent many that understand depression or even try to and somehow you do as well as this wonderful community that has gathered because of you thank you for letting us into your life the way you have we appreciate it keep being you ps please go back to house flipper i still watch them at least once a week when i need to have honey im trash yelled into my ears trigger warning i love making people laugh and helping others but as a consequence it really drains me im the same as may in the way that i dont want to burden others with my feelings or make them think im doing it for attention i used to self harm in middle school but then my sister saw my cuts i begged her not to tell my parents people saw my cuts but never made sure i was okay im probably about 5 years clean but every once in a while even more frequent recently ive wanted to do it even earlier tonight i wanted to ive also been suicidal but never told people ive never been much of a danger to myself to the extent where i plan it out but i think what would people do if i did or where would i go after its scary and more daunting than anything this summer has been the worst for my mental health bc i feel like i have no friends and no one cares not even my family i feel like im not going anywhere and that i will be living with my parents for the rest of my life i don this video is legendary honestly sean reached deep in my heart the game made me think how cruel the world can be and you people can be going through all these thinks yet they hide all that emotion and act fake even though is hurting so much in side and hey need help thx for this video sean thank you hmmthis is very deep and meaningfuli cant explain why or howbut i do understand itnice vid this video and your channel in general has helped me more than you can ever know anytime im feeling down and dont know what to do youre videos are always here to make me smile and they never fail me youre such a kind hearted person and i want to thank you for what you do this game opened my eyes a bit to what im feeling and you did as well just thank you ive had dark moments and ive had them a lot recently but watching this i feel less alone thank you i dont know what else to say but thank you the last ten minutes nearly made me cry because it was so relatable i really appreciate shawn addressing this because it is a real part of life every body goes through it and when people sweep it under the rug it makes it so hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel but the light is there no matter how small or far it is there just go one step at a time sean i dont know if you will ever see this but i just want you to know how much you and your videos mean to me recently my sisters health has been deteriorating and bringing me to think she may need her transplant soon she has a genetic disorder called fanconi animia if you want to look it up im her donner and im also going to college in a few weeks and im scared i wont be able to be there for her even with all of that though i watch your videos and they make me smile and forget at least for a little bit that life can suck sometimes sorry if this sounded a bit ranty maybe it was but i just needed you to know how much light and happiness can come from your videos i hope you do see this but i know its unlikely if you do though and idk if this is considered plugging or not fanconi animia research fund has helped my family and many others so much with giving hope for a future for kids like my sister if you are able i would love it if you could do a charity l people change and youre a person i always knew you would grow at some point people need to accept that i think a lot of people do but still thanks for sharing sean your words mean a lot i had my headphones at max volume and top of the mornin so now my ears are bleeding honestly i prefer videos like this where he opens up and gives advice stuff like that because it makes me feel like theres hope and actual good in this world and i know this comment will get lost because my comments always do but i just wanted to say that whoever reads this keep up the great work shes the one who made theres this girl right wow i really didnt expect that talk at the end im genuinely in tears because recently has been a struggle for me i also agree with what you said about social media and how just going outside and getting physical is so much beneficial to my mental health than staring at a screen all day this really helped a lot and it was a huge breath of fresh air to hear all of this you have no clue how much i needed this and probably many others as well thank you for helping and spreading the positivity around sean im really fucking sad thanks for creating this space where i can be really fucking sad and just sit with it without judging it appreciate u forever xo pokimane thumbnail man i need a friend like that girl in my life this hit me a little hard because i feel that way sometimes especially because my parents are splitting up and im getting really depressed my dad is kicking me and my mom out of the house and were having a lot of trouble finding somewhere there is always so much on my mind and i just feel like i need someone to be their for me cause my dad doesnt really care he calls me lazy and we can never have a full conversation without him arguing with me i have tried getting someone to help but they havent helped i wish i could talk to someone who cares im starting to lose faith in everything 447 no that would be life is strange oh geez this video hit hard as i suffer from chronic depression which i am taking stuff for but in the past ive almost killed myself it doesnt help im drinking and getting philosophical as you really dont know what others are going through and any little thing you do can greatly impact yours or another persons life the smallest gesture that means nothing to you can mean the world to someone else and a moment of kindness can save a life i would also like to say if anyone ever feels alone or like they need to vent or talk to someone i am here please talk to someone this hit me hard very close to home i needed to hear this thank you jack i was having a bad night and honestly this just helped so much it made me feel a lot better i hope you are okay and doing well makeup is basically clown makeup try being real kthx i love sean hes just a great person omg i know i was just lmao a few minutes ago about 929 but damn sean im not wearing a waterproof mascara today yes this game hits home so much and tho im located in the ph id give you a hug too anyone else hear shiloh singing in the background also these types of videos every once in a while are my favorite i know for a fact no matter who you are you get to this dark place at least once in your life just know that this world is more beautiful than you know there are places youll go and that are waiting for you but you cant see them if you leave us youre loved i get where youre coming from as you age you change and so does life you want to continue growing and changing becoming a better happier youhowever it may come for your viewers it means reeling back the part of yourself that has been cast out into the worldwide taking yourself seriously and making all those little things preciousbecause they fucking are never doubt it you mentioned living through your viewers well they were also living through you but as youve come to realize there needs to be a line you need to live your life and they need to live theirs maybe they wont understand it now but i hope in time they will please dont let it get you down and always strive for your own health and happiness i started fucking crying when may was talking with our mc i really wish i had a friends like that the ted talk we needed 929 lmao i think almost every lads out there who uses make up been through this like me on my graduation or when i broke up with my guy lol im pretty sure its pronounced hee since thats my last name too great video jack god i love this game i too had recently finished and played this game it was a great game to play at 2am it was a good game with amazing visuals and displays a harsh but real reality each ending of the story is an accurate representation of what someone can go through in life possibly saving someone or losing someone the game takes about an hour to another and a half to get all the achievements and finish the story the soundtrack of the game is really good as well in my opinion the middle option of the spotify and the title screen song is good theres a characters who seems to be relatable by being gaybi have interests in popular aesthetic things having harsh parents who want their children to be something they want asian parents who want their child to be a doctoretc the artistdeveloper of this game has a youtube channel and also have several games please support them on steam youtube and all their other social medias theres also dlc of the game sean if u dont wanna make a vid for a day or 2 dont worry or even a week its fine jack just relax sean everything youve done means something to people youve helped people through suicide u are one of the best people on the earth some of what u said i dont understand but you are a good person and youve done all you can for our happiness sean i just want to say i really appreciated all that you said in this video 3 its the most true hope ive ever felt whoopsie a bit triggered halfway through ill come back preach sean preach we love you man he plays a game ive played for once i felt that even though you dont do anything you always feel tired you just want to lay in bed i really felt that that you feel youre a heavy burden to everything around you but im hoping all of us will be better soon we are family thank you sean bom there goes realty i dont know if youll see this but i really wanna thank you for making this video i started crying immediately as you talked about your own struggles since it reminded me of my own and how ive had the idea of ending my own life i always preach to my best friend that its ok to talk to others but rarely follow that advice because like may i dont want to burden others but watching this video made me tell her about those dark thoughts and how i was really happy id had her friendship as the light in my dark tunnel keeping me from ending it all so early thank you so much youve really helped me in so many ways both from this video and so many laughs to keep me thinking more positively thank you hey jack i wish i could tell you this in person but knowing i probably wont get this chance and you might never read this i want to thank you for saving my life a couple years ago i was in the worst place id ever been in in my entire life and i just wanted to stop it all and then you uploaded the first episode of the last guardian and it made me laugh for the first time in so long and i decided to wait until you finished the game to do anything but in that time of enjoying that i also decided to get help so thank you such a small thing made everything change and i really wish you could see this so whatever youre going through youll always mean the world to me and so many others have a wonderful day to anyone who reads this i have no idea if youll see this and i wish i didnt have to say this publically but thank you this hit too close and recent to home i just want to thank everyone who helped me through it if you are going through this hear me you are not alone reach to someone that its special to you and talk to them about it if they really love you theyll understand and help you if you say i dont have anyone vent somewhere on the internet because people goingthat went through this kind of things are good listeners and know what to tell you to do love yall i watched until the end its sad because this is kind of my story because bullys bully me and i dont have any friends i mean i do have friends but they are not real friends they all so bully me his words almost made me cry angela made a game called theres this girl and it was a short game and i cried after playing it angela is amazing her art style and realism is so refreshing so may is the main character that was in the last game sean talked about i think im happy youre now living for you sean as it should be youre tons happier for it may it long continue 1704 what jack would say instead of to be honest tbh be honest thanks jack i actually kinda needed this as i think of these kind of things every now and again it does suck that we all live in this big bombastic world but what can we really do about it and when you said i dont deserve to be happy because i fuck everything up all the time it really got to me because i say that to myself often but now i actually look at it differently but anyways man this was longer than i expected i just wanted to say thanks again for everything i needed that validation i need people to tell me that im doing good because i have no confidence of myself man these are one of the things that hit hard the most in this video these whole 5120 seconds were so important and so goddamn genuine especially the talk during the end i needed that one of the reasons this hit hard is because i think im going through that exact rollercoaster of emotions myself im always tired i have very little energy for even the things that i think i want to do hell just like may i have no idea what i even like doing in life you may think a stupid arrogant young teenager like me shouldnt feel that as you can tell me ahh you still have life ahead of you and yada yad yada but i do still feel this emotions of hopelessness im confused and lost and im pretty much a disappointment to my family and friends and despite me completely distancing myself from all sorts of forms of social media i still feel lonely and i still feel the need 500 heres these people finding a date very easily when im here asking girls and they run away screaming fuck this hit home so hard i suffer with chronic depression and even though i take 2 antidepressants i still have the odd days or weeks i have such a hard time talking about it because i have heard far too much from both family and friends about how there are so many people out there who have it worse than me or comparing my pain with theirs saying mine are irrelevant because they are going through worse and i feel like no matter what i say no one realizes im dead serious my doctor teresa is one of the people who turned my life around she gives me a big hug when i come in the office and she always seems like she enjoys seeing me she helped me find a combination of medications to help not only my depression and anxiety but other heath problems i didnt even know i had when you talked about doctors and how even though theyre paid to take care of us they can really be there for you and it really touched me i feel like that was the point i started ugly crying you give me so i dont know if you read these replies or not but as you were talking at the end i looked back on your content and the way youve changed over the years and i think right now you look so much more settled in your own skin now so since you were saying how people complaining that you arent giving yourself over like you used to i want you to know that im happy youre taking your time because everyone deserves that and as a person who does think of your videos as hanging out with a friend when im lonely im proud of you jack you may never see this but i hope you know that your courage to talk about your pain in your past and stress it helps people feel not alone a round of applause for the realness of this video not masked with vague motivational quotes that dont help anyone just real stuff that people can actually relate to and grow from copyrighted song ahhhhhhhhh and too much meme i dont remember a single day in my life where i truly wanted to die and i hear about all this suicidal stuff and have had friends with these thoughts and i of course help them even if they didnt ask but it makes me wonder how can i understand what a suicidal person would be feeling or what they need if i am and have never been like that i found an answer to one of my questions recently i asked why am i not suicidal and they answer is i simply cant leave this world until i find out why i am here to begin with i hope this helps whoever may need it depression and anxiety is a b from everything they put me though i had to almost die to help my friend and get girls and grow up and learn i have to lose to get more and im only 12 now and i can stand to see people cry is just takes me by surprise when i relive the die i found out my bff killed his self so im might look happy but im broken in the inside and life is not always candy and pie or like rain just coming down there is some things you learn about when you cry you soon well fell joy come out of it and god will let you see the sunrise againtake a peace jean any one notice that losing intrest is played in the backround muffled thank you for this video jack i am at a point where im doing a job that i really dont like and im just constantly tired even if i have time to do what i love its just been really hard to find it enjoyable because im struggling to make it my career its hard to tap into the music industry but thank you for this its helped me look at music the way i used to it became another job that im barely getting paid for and i know i should see it as i did before something that gives me so much joy and i can share this gift with others and even help them with it too thank you for opening up jack you are an amazing person i hope you find your peace someday soon we need more games like this its honestly amazing all these things are fantastic now i may not know everything about these topics or even be able to comprehend it but one thing i do know is if you try you can succeed if you need help try and ask for it if it isnt as easy as asking try like sean said and have some time to yourself you usually always find your own ways of relaxation and when you do it feels great i myself have never felt depressed but i know i have definitely not always felt great whether it was about myself or my mood was just swinging but i found my way to of just letting my mind set is through photography you can be taking all the time you need for the perfect shot while it also gives you the time to reflect on yourself which is sometimes all people need please anyone that needs help ask for it also as i said i think its fantastic that jack is also taking time for sean he has his barriers because he now doesnt need reassurance to know hes good enough he has fun he laug this hit me quite hard jack your videos help people enjoy life and make us smile i have had a year of self harm and suicidal thoughts and watching your videos have helped me personally forget all the shit going on i have been on antidepressants and ive seen multiple therapist and im still battling im glad you spoke openly and expressed your part of what you think thank you jack thank you thank you i needed that okay im six minutes in and i feel liie this is gonna be a sad game i can feel it in my bones i had a therapist for a year but he got offered a job as a therapist for a prison i miss him that was last november i havent had a therapist since then i really need one im not strong enough to admit that to my family or myself usually i sometimes hint it towards my friends but not because its their responsibility plus im not being blunt i dont blame them i wish i had another good therapist im scared to try to find one and fail ive heard so many horror stories about this states therapists from people at school i dont know what to do i someone who has tried to take my life and cut myself and feel all alone all the time can say to everyone who is happy and is not being in a dark place being depressed is shit its like feeling that no one cares about you and no one wants to see or bee with you so you just cry you cry and cry and cry and it wont stop it happens all the time any time every day and its shit ot hurts all the time but i got someone to talk to after 16 years i aiffer and suffer and cry every day but no one cares but to annyone reading this thank you for taking your time sorry for misspellings i am norwegian and my suicidal thoughts came in the way of my english lessons this game touched me deeply and its beautifully made and the developer should be proud beautiful artwork touching and personalized storytelling and jack being jack opening up and being a amazing man who is not afraid to be honest depression isnt easy and can be a hard journey but it gets better thank you jack for your story and your honesty its why i started following you and still do to this day we love you jack and to those who are struggling and feel alone you are not alone and you can get better with the help of your family and friends well said whenever youre troubled make

and the growth youve made is so exciting im really happy for you im really proud of how good your doing now this whole video is so important to me thank you for playing this and also the talk at the end youre so incredible and i owe a lot of laughs and distractions from those kind of thoughts to you missed messages wish you never left me im effortless please put me to rest i drink i smoke im stressed just leave me to myself i neednt get your help this shit is my own hell you ask if i am well i lie and say im swell you wonder of my thoughts but lips of mine wont part youre calling out my name i didnt hear a thing im wandering my heart so lost and torn apart i criedhis words were just so soft spoken and comforting and even though he wasnt actually there talking directly to me i still felt like he was there helping me with my emotions because i relate in a few ways and i finally felt safe to cry and i felt that there were people there that really understand what goes on in other life i love these types of videos plus the art style is so good heyyy its mee but i write poetry not fanfics p 110 right who else had a tear i almost watch this till i realized that i want to play it for myself first 3925 put that on replay that hit me the hardest because everything happens to me and ive been stuck with anxiety since i was in 1st grade amd i only realized that a few days ago when i thought about it im 20 and yes i remember my young days and ivr been in depression once a 3 years ago because i didnt know in which direction to go anymore i lost someone close to me a father figure to me when i was 13 and at that time i was still a kid i was not appreaciative of my relatives because i had in mind thst they will always be with me and they will always be safe and healthy but when that relative died everyones world started colliding even to this day i feel his absence and i started tearing right now just thinking about it because i never got to talk to him about life and he didnt get to see me grow in height to see how i become what type of person ive become and noe that im thousands of kms away from home between strangers ended up in ireland its ver when finally you have played a game before him 252 we bare bears meme also at 501 we bare bears also also at 959 i was chanting kisskisskiss in my head holy crap the game made me cry haha the cutting thing reminded me of when i help my girlfriend when she struggles with it just wow this game is powerful i needed to see this today thank you i think in our day in age someone knows someone who has gone though this or will at one point in life please someone will miss you the pain you are going through is nothing compared to the amazing future you can have you can just keep going its easier said than done but i urge you too please xxx i really need to talk to someone if anyone sees this sean you are just a wonderful person ive always looked up to you you have helped me and so many others like me through so much anyone who has been with your channel for a while and who has come to love you will always love you for who you are yes you have made changes but everyone goes through that i am so glad you found yourself and worked through your dark moments you be you and enjoy your life i will always be here to support you and i know i am not the only one stay true to you as long as you are happy i am happy this game is stunning to look at and hits so close to home for so many it handled sensitive topics very well im going to give angela all of my love and support as for sens speechjesus when he said that dark thoughts about ending it all have even come to his mind i thought my world was going to come crashing down he means so much to me and to a lot of people family or otherwise imagining him going through with something like that is heartwrenching but im also so very thankful that he never seriously considered it and is still here and every word of advice and comfort he gave is so helpful and so eyeopening he gives me a light of hope when im in the darkness of despair well fuck now im crying some of the people in the comments are talking about missing the signs and getting close to or actually losing people for all those people im sorry to hear it but jeez feels so selfish to say this but i have to pls dont hate me im glad im not one of those people i saw them what is the song at 500 hell fuckin yeah sean sometimes your thoughts become static you end up feeling trapped inside your own mind or sometimes even outside you cant quite understand what youre thinking but at the same time you do it seems as though its an unknown language only you can understand and its hard to get through but it can happen its hard finding the light in the darkness but that light is still there you are that light you have the potentional to open up those curtains and let in that sunlight youve longed for ive been in that tough spot ive written countless suicide notes ive planned my own ending and its scary its terrifying to not know what awaits you on the other side but you know whats on this side youre surrounded by people who deeply care for you yes sometimes they miss the signs sometimes theyre too blind to realize that youre not okay but theyre willing to help you matter to so many people you have a story that can influence countless people sometim when you hear and recognize the lo fi music in the background happy chair noises im just gonna outright say it sean is one of the reasons i can still watch videos or even breath from making my stomach hurt from laughing so hard when i was going through this i want to say thank you i have really bad anxiety and depression ive been going through it for 3 years now every time i watch one of your videos it always makes me smile i know you have probably heard this so many times but you have saved me from ending my life it breaks my heart when you talk about depression but i love that you are one of the few gamers that talk about that kind of stuff its amazing how much joy one person can spread through a 30 minute video thank you 3 god isnt a woman btw usually i as a person would normally skip out of the message you said after the game but instead i decided to listen for you and now i feel really motivated to live life and be inspired again thanks jack around 530 it sounds like shiloh dynasty high key loved the talk at the end allwas keep changing jack we love the mini sids of you hey your channel aint dying jackaboy it aint never gonna die you are the gaelic gladiator in the intro i didnt hear him say the name of the developer at first and got a little too excited tbh i was watching belle delphine and you uploaded this video thank you seeing this game and hearing sean talk about it it really does hit home but it also shows hope theres always a better way you just need to hang on im glad i seen this this was motivating tbh i feel like me and jack have a lot in common hell yeah jack love yourself before us we might come and go but youyoure with yourself forever everyone deserves a happy life thank you for this game it helps a lot me hears disclaimer and knows not to watch video

ur channel and has always trys to stay positive and try to start a gaming channel but i been going through bad depression the past 2 years and im still going through it i told my parents awhile back

thank u jack this was reallyjustwow thank you for the motivational talk honestly the last few seconds of what sean said youre doing great keep believing in yourself is what i really need to hear rn thank you sean remember everyone you are not alone please know that someone out there cares for you and your wellbeing you probably wont believe me but im gonna tell you anyway in 2017 i was going through some ruff times i had depression which will turn into suicidal thoughts and so on and so four it started when i went to high school it was my first year my friends was getting bullied and so was i because of my sexuality and my dyslexia it wasnt fun at all and home wasnt safe i live with my brother and my mom i dont live with my dad for reasons my brother has really bad anger issues to the point that he will actually hurt someone it really sucks as the stress of school and home piled up i started to cut myself everyday after school cut at home cut in 2018 i snapped i felt so empty like i had joy i didnt feel pain one day my mom and my brother had a big fight and all i wanted to do was die i felt so hopeless that night as things settle down i was up in my room the rope to my dressing gown in my hands the rest was a blur to me what ever your going through y ill never be able to thank you enough for saving my life san without you and videos like this and youre words and being able to look forward to waking up and watching u and being able to laugh for the first time in monthsi may not be here i remember laughing at you and it literally hurting my stomach bc it had been so long since i genuinely was happy you made me happy you gave me back my joy i could express it all day without finding the right words heck sean i love ya buddy i really really hope i spelled ya name right dang man i feel you man some times i feel the whole world is against you or want you brocken so i feel you man truelly you touch me so keep it up im truely touched keep ot up respect and btw i like your content couse make my day literally i always crunk a video of you channel even if it was several years ago video so thanks buddy and post it like boss they always say yeehaw but never haw yee damn jack you made me cry thank you for all you said you have helped a lot of people and you have helped me thank you so much for doing everything you do thank you you really do help speak the truth this game you played was really relatable so relatable that it did make me cry because seeing theres someone like you whos caring speaks out to people like you did at the end of the video i really did appreciate that how you noticed that about people i find it very hard to deal with things not showing it ive been on many adventures overs hills but sometimes i really do like hearing he fact that even someone as yourself who has this popularity fame see through past the ordinary life people think is so great i thank you once more for you what you do continue to not only play games live the dream you already have but to continue giving great advice being open to everyone as much as i wish others were sylence122 are you serious id rather not say uff kay guess ill get myself some help then and you should do too sean i totally support you i want only the best for you but i noticed you saying that you have to keep some things back for yourself i know you probably have a lot more indepth thoughts on it than you communicated but i would like to tell you what i believe which is this if you give your all to the right thing the right person then you will be sustained by that we are meant to give of ourselves completely because that is love i know you arent catholic anymore but i still look to jesus ultimate gift of self as the greatest demonstration of love he did not hold anything back and i aim not to either thats not to say i wont ever take time off xd i guess what im trying to say is that you can give everything and still have everything you need not trying to tell you to be more active in the community do as you think best i dunno if youll see this but i had to try and say it anyway id love to talk to you about all this someday it seems like it wo this fucking hit me thanks im going to be completely honest i cried for the first time in a long time im really happy i watched this vid your words really help me thank you sean thank you for saying this and opening up it means so much to hear someone big talk about mental health in a positive light to hear you talk about your own experiences and not be afraid thank you for always being a positive light my soul weeps for everyone in this situation i have no words but i wish i could help truly help and make a difference i wish i could help everyone understand the undiminishable worth of a person every person is worth so much and i wish i could help people see that jack thank you thank you for making this video and adressing these subjects thank you for being so kind and accepting with the diversity of people in this world thank you for supportinf lgbtq and thank you for being honest with us viewers ive thought about it too many times to count honestly life school the future people relationships either nothing works out or nothing works out without going through it the hardest possible way it gets tiring sometimes sometimes medicine isnt a cure all sometimes its just pure willpower sometimes i run on empty but i still have gotten this far somehow im faced with college and i know there will still be a lot of those moments but heres hoping at 3119 you can see the scars on mays arm for the second run did anyone else thing she went back in the room to put the knife away since she goes in the bathroom to cut herself please take time for yourself the world will wait ok good you dont have green hair but jack you cannot let felix bully you sure he has more subs than you but that is only because he started youtube before you you are much better than him you are a nice person felix is not i will be with you for all the time to come i dont even watch felixs videos the only reason why i had subscribed to him was to try to go against tseries you cannot let felix do this to you on youtube he is an all powerful god in real life he is just an average person you me and all of your subscribers together can overpower him well unless if he does the same thing then we should just pretend that we are not protesting against him everyone has ups and downs you can be rich and famous or poor and common but we are all human we all have our stressers and problems just because you have it better than someone else doesnt mean you cant still have issues if it bothers you it is real enough when we step back and see the bigger picture i am sure we can all see others in a worse position then we are but that doesnt mean we cant still get upset or stressed out i appreciate you sean with or without your content you are a good person that i personally respect and love sometimes the people who seem the happiest suffer the most thank you thank you so much for saying these things and playing these games for speaking up and reaching out through your videos you do so much good you have no idea ive been in a really dark place again for the past few months and i clicked on this video im crying again but its not a completely sad cry this time it feels as though youre speaking directly to me and i dont feel so alone anymore i feel a bit better whether youre being serious or funny your videos are comforting i find solace in your kind words or a distraction and fun in your lets plays i

that youre a great person with a great personality and to those who still have suicidal thought please alwaysknow that i and many others care about you honestly i can relate to some degree with what happens in this game and with what you said as well this year i started getting over emotional not that i wasnt partially before this and i started to overthink everything usually not as far as death but i tend to tell myself i am less than maybe i am i dont know and stuff that didnt make me budge before now pushes me down almost everytime i dont try to talk to new people because im afraid i dont try new things because im afraid heck even if i do any of these later i feel even more afraid i have been even told that i smile less than before or that i started getting aggresive or disconnected i dont know what i want to do and that terrifies me really uff i dont know if anyone will even read this and i dont know if i would really care if someone sees this i just felt like sending this out in the world if you ignore it sure if you hate it sure if you understand it sure sorry to kill the mood down here but id like to bring attention to an amazing yet sad and deep detail 3130 if you look at mays arm there is scars there respect and love i always have this feeling everyday every moment in my life when i felt giving up my world is like a car running in the same track over and over again waiting for it to run out of gas and die my mind always give me these task wake up school taekwondo assignments sleep repeat until i realize that i shouldnt be doing this ishould go have some fun and live a happy life but it was impossible for me until i noticed my self changing appearance every single day when im in the school im just a silent smart person until when i will meet up with my friend im a very loud funny person then i talk to my self why are you like this why cant you be your self until i heard a reply from my mind do you want your friends to not like you anymore do u want your best friend will hate you because your not in your real self you showed the fake you and they fell for it theres no going back now you need to be like that everyday that realization hurt me and this is the first time i ever cried so hard in a long time i dun know why i just related so much it kinda allows me to release my emotions and stuff thank you so much for your gameplay and the speech at the end much love i want to see this so badly but i get triggered very fast even when i just read suicide or self harm so byyyeeee its ok jack we understand you will still be the best i barely noticed shilohs music in the back lol thank you sen for everything im glad that people like you exist thank you so much youre a great person i just watched this on my pc and i started crying and sean i know

opening up to us i hope that others see this video as something to be guided by for those that feel lost in the world everyone deserves to be heard im just over half an hour through but i dont think i can watch anymore right now phenomenal game and messages as well jack well done for being who you are and being who you want to be instead of letting others mould who you would be and to the others who kept complaining about changes now you guys understand that bringing back old sean would bring pain and fatigue for him that honestly is very selfish of us demanding him to be who we want him to be also changes are necessary in life infact we all change for the better or worse i currently struggle with anxiety and depression i have 2 best friends that mean the world to me and im super close with my mom yet i struggle to talk to someone today instead of taking to someone i cried in my room alone i have this fear that they will judge me or think differently about me i hope that i can eventually talk to them though this video is truly amazing and i appreciate it big respect for everyone i left at 3857 cause i was gonna cry and i didnt wanna go though that but thank you for playing this game and inspiring me or some word thats similar to that just stay safe jacktime heals everything just keep going were atthe start was the wapish i played this just the other day thank you jack for the words of encouragement im a fresh graduate student who still trying to look for a job and apparently i didnt get back any responds from the companies i applied and it just make me super sad because a lot of my friends are already workingi know this might be small matter to some people but knowing myself who is a slow learner and just cant do anything rightits kinda sad but as jack say just go for it and dont think about the what is the could be just go for it it turns out fine avi kaplan who hurt the gelic gladiator who did this to him find the dead are alive 1000000 dollars jack

havent killed myself that the pain i would cause is what stops me this videoreallyhits close to home there is a period of my life where i was just at my lowestin middle school i started to cut because i did not know how to cope with it i was too scared to share my problems with others because i felt like i would bother them if i constantly just complain about my life i would write my feelings and thoughts on a google doc because i had no one else to share it with the bottled up feelings were too much and my cutting became an addiction i wish i wouldve stopped i justcouldnt handle it im a pessimistic person i do not love myself i can not tell myself that i love myself because i know that i am lying to myself i do not believe my friends when they call me cute because i know i am not and every time i look in the mirror i start to break because i know that i can never be as pretty as the girls in my school till this day i do not like compliments about my appearance but in the beginning

thanks for everything sean i went into a state of depression last year when my grandpa died and my friend we werent super close at the time just texted me out of the blue and said hey you can talk to me anytime and even just her reaching out made me feel so much better and it helped me get through it ssssshhhhhits okdont cry were here everything is ok ssshhhh dont cry ive been watching your videos since you were a young boy in a cabin in the woods my friend who helped me out of committing suicide showed me your channel and it made her happy so she thought it would make me happy too and boy was she right thank you for pouring so much of your love and kindness into this community i seriously appreciate everything youve done for us 3 thank you im honestly really glad that youve been taking time for yourself to put up those boundaries and really care for yourself as a person it means a lot to me and you seem much more content in recent videos and less strained its a breath of fresh wind in all the chaos and highenergy constant buzz of the online world thank you for taking time for you to be you and not worry so much about what others think thank you i really love this it feels so much more genuine like you dont have to strain yourself for your audience and an image that people want it really is detrimental to your health and im glad you can be you and not have to share the parts you want to keep for yourself man this is why your my fav youtuber last 4 years i really like her art style she made a game in the app store called live portrait maker its a really fun game in my opinion when he shook at 3833 my heart broke me oh okay suicidal stuff i should relate me halfway through the vid when i see may in the bathroom crying are we just suicidal kids telling other suicidal kids suicide is not the way or what no matter what happens i will stay with you jack every step of the way i love youtubers like san he doesnt make inappropriate jokes on topics like this some channels i used to watch always laughed and joked about things like suicide and self harm i dont know if thats how they try to hide the fact for themselves that there is evil in this world but its no need to make jokes much love for you and all the similar channels jacksepticeye sean i would like to say thank you for all you do i have been in a dark place lately and your videos have really helped me we should never be afraid to grow as a person we will always change and there is nothing wrong with that you are truly a great person as is everyone in this world but thank you so much sean for bringing some light in this darkened world his talk at the end of the video really helped listening to it the look in his eyes when he starts talking about mental health theres just so much emotion and hes not just bullshitting everyone its really nice and yeah he deserves all the love and support ages 9 and 15 were the hardest 2 years in my life so far but i pushed through and here i am at 17 nothing is perfect still but its a lot better than when i didnt have doctors to help me or medicine to help my brain function properly or my funny lovable little dog trust me things will go up and down and backwards and forwards but the little things will pull you through in ways to that are unthinkable it never gets any better thank you so much for reviewing this game it inspired me to text my brother who i havent seen in a while i really love him i just never tell him and i feel like the rest of my family never tells him they love him either im going to fix that now man this is powerful i love when sean just talks it makes everything and people online feel more real and human i feel like shiloh dynasty is in the background singing idk this game is beautiful jack should be a motivational speaker hes good ive never met jack in real life but i have real love for him hes such a good man this will not be seen but im a 12 year old and every single day i want to commit suicide everyday i spend hours just sitting and telling myself that no one cares and that i would be better off dead and i started cutting myself and just couldnt stop the message at the end really helped me out i tried committing suicide in 5th grade and twice in 6th grade but later on in 6th you stopped me with your videos so i wanted to thank you i love that everyone feels so safe in jacks comment section and is able to share their stories in such a supportive and safe space his channel and his viewers are so healing i think jack just saved a bunch of lives every word has an independent meaning but when put together with the right words it can mean everything to everyone shit did make me cry at the end thank you sean for your honesty your transparency your pma thank you for being you and becoming the best sean you can be love you brother respect man truly brave and great to open up about this was a fan of yours but now i respect you even more thank you for this wish only the best to your own self and your career shit made me want to cry thank you jack ive been crying day in and day out and i have been depressed for 3 years im constantly getting bullied by kids in my grade in and after school but you helped me to stop cutting and feel happy i cant express how great full i am for you just being you thank you from the bottom of my heart theres not many nice people anymore thats why its so hard most kids arent nice because being mean means being popular thank you 435 love that fall out boy is in the background of the tumblr post dude you need to play butterfly soup next if you havent already its such a great game kinda similar to this this is the content i didnt know i needed im only 11 but i have had incredibly dark thoughts my grandmother and dog my best friend in the entire world both passed away this year i thought everything was over i thought about it and people really care about me and i should never even think about it and thanks jack for making me a lot me happier than i was im only 20 minutes in and im bailing i overdosed february from ptsd depression and no one knew how i felt even though id been open with my feelings people only thought it was like threats when i told them i was suicidal im still in therapy and still go through slot but this video made me feel the other side i have to say i have lived through this also my brother also attempted overdose when i was 11 sorry ignore this rant sean the motivational speaker may medo u want to die may no but actually yes meme all jokes aside but its really sad that people haft to go through this i myself have but not too bad because i surrounded myself with people who care please dont do anything to hurt urself pleaseand i hope you know that somebody cares for you and if ur sure nobody does well i care for you have a good day and if u decide to read this and reply about yourself go ahead im here for u the suicide hotline is 18002738255 at least in ohio man jack makes me wanna cry jack gives the most inspirational speeches ever and i know of no other youtuber that will just sit here for 15 minutes and just want to talk about how life is a good thing and just cherish it this is why i love jack this vedio hit me hard moved out on my own for the first time and have major depression and anxiety and jack is right about one little thing can make you tip ive loved artdrawing basically all my life but in like the last year or a little more i think ive fallen out of love with it it feels terrible seeing myself become bored of what ive always loved but not feeling the motivation to change that and ive also noticed that bit by bit everyday feels like the same day repeating i crawl out of bed get dressed go to work and somethimes there isnt anything to do come home take a nap and maybe play a game eat dinner shower then repeat im agrivated over next to nothing almost constantly and half the time i dont even know why im mad theres seems to be a constant under tone of sadness all the time i dont know if this is directly related but i feel trapped strapped onto a train car on one track and all the other tracks are blocked off im trapped on one track its called expectation go to private college get a major get a major that will get me a job know what youre going to dobe aw sen youre the keanu reeves of the gamer world did anyone else see that when mays text bubble changed colors she also wore short sleeves indicating that she cams to terms with her self harm and was healing and everything she wasnt hiding the scars anymore idk but i just abdbsndndj i can relate to the parent problems my parents yell at me cause i dont put effort into anything anymore im no writer but still relatable i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars i mean more happy wheels also this is my mom labtop it sucks anyway play i more happy wheels cose i like your happy wheels vids i like to see you rage its funny thank you sean i love you so much and if you ever need a day off take one we dont mind i am on the verge of crying after that speech i cant believe how much this has changed me even though i am not suicidal there is so many life lessons that i cant even comprehend or believe that it is so moving ive had an actual situation like this with my ex shes okay now but this shit is scary its always good to see the person behind jack the honest sean also the art style is sweet thank you sean a lot for your words for your work for just being here i love these type videos and it means so much i love your vids and remaber your a boooooooooooooos im crying this video hits home personally for me and for loved ones near me im crying and i wasnt expecting to thank you for getting real and chatting thank you for talking about this hard stuff its good to learn about it and move away from romanticizing suicide to instead working on minimizing it internationally and thats exactly what youre doing here thank you i dont want to just say fuck all the guys that say youmare irrelavent but if u need a brake like sean said you should hundred percent take it you cnnot be and will never be hundred percent battery all the time there is times when you need to sit down and relax so you could be your full self again and relaxing doesnt have to be like sitting under the stars or enjoying the sun in a beautiful day no it can also be something you just love and just relax and also i know its more difficult said than done but help is always there for you even if you dont feel it present its ther suiside is never the answer this game x jack everyone needed that stay alive stay alive for me i wish some times i could just clean my whole head and not having thousands of ideas and thoughts in my head ive gone through really tough times with you and you dont even know it i just think its crazy that ive laughed with you and cried with you but you dont even know my name or what i really look like like some people have comfort food or some people take their anger and sadness out on other people i have just sat down and watched your videos you helped through my parents divorce my grandfathers passing and so much more than you even know i would just like to say thank you for everything man the beginning hit me hard someone i knew killed himself a couple months ago it was so uncalled for no warning at all i saw him the night before he did it he was at our house drinking and having a good time even told my boyfriend to send his project to him when he finished it on monday we got the call it was just he no longer exists hes gone that freaks me the fuck out if i think too hard about it i cry i just cant believe there was nothing to warn us no note no nothing no final words mention of the future sorry i just had to get my thoughts out death is fucking terrifying especially when its unexpected i need to cry but my foundation was 48 2720 hit me hard bc thats how i feel right now in life now that youve gone on this new lane in your journey that we as your audience only get to see from windows of your social media you have become so much more visibly livelier happier and truer at least thats what i personally feel radiating off you i can most definetly tell the difference from then and now and the impacts youve made inspirations youve sparked and the smiles youve made brighter are even more immense so once again thank you my name is angela and i didnt make the game but alsogreen hair lol i needed this video thank you i was about to do some stupid crap ik its a bit cliche but there is way more to life than you know it and at times there might be struggles or bad things going through your mind but you have to ignore them cause believe it or not this world is not better without you and if youre thinking it putting a period on your book then dont cause your important in more ways then you realize editkeep a uno reverse card on your at all times hi thank you for this video soo im 23 years old and ive been depressed for almost 10 years i was taking antidepressants for a few years and i still am nothing helped i went through self harm and suicide attempts in the past even tho i have a lovely boyfriend that supports me i cant enjoy life at all im having suicidal thoughts almost everyday im constantly so miserable stressed out and suicidal for the last few months i keep thinking about suicide even more the only reason why i didnt do that yet is that it would completely break my boyfriends heart also for a few weeks im wondering if i dont have a bipolar 2 disorder instead of depression because i have many of those symptoms in a few days i will finally see my doctor so i will hopefully find this out im soon starting a job and i hope it will work out so i can maybe go back to therapy and maybe it will somehow save my life cause right now im not living im just existing thank you for sha the perfect game to show your parents every time they dont get teenagers sayori dont do it i had to make a ddlc reference w jack your amazing ive been depressed forever at least thats what i felt and your videos really help me be able to realize that im not the only one going through depression stay strong others and seek help from your friends and family and a therapist if you need too thank you jack earlier my parents and i were talking about me going back to a therapist i went about 2 years ago but we lost our insurance so we couldnt afford for me to go anymore my sister is autistic and has other stuff wrong with her health so we needed to be able to afford speech therapy ot medicines she tends to be top priority it hurts sometimes but i never said anything because i am willing to sacrifice my own health for her luckily we do have insurance now so we can afford a therapist for me now icriedabittomuchwatchingthis wow i didnt know i needed to hear this thank you so much sean thank you so much sean you really mean a lot to me and have inspired me through my childhood to succeed to fight to live im not sure but there was a time when everything felt hopeless tiring i didnt feel good about myself but i went on with my life those thoughts have slowly vanished away after i started working my first job but it wasnt till today after watching your video did i realize the type of pain i was going through to fully heal im planning on contacting some of my friends that i ignored duration those times to meetcatch up thank you jacksepticeye thank you jack and thank you sean thank you for helping me realize and for being my childhood hero i relate to may this hit me hard but i feel like i should tell my story so people know its okay to talk about your feelings and get help if you really need it when i was 7 i started getting raped by my grandfather he told me that if i told anyone that he would kill me and no one would ever miss me it finally ended when i was 13 he told my brother that it was okay to have sex with me he corrupted his mind into that when i was 11 i started self harming and i had this certain self hatred for myself 8th grade i was extremely suicidal and felt like i would never get better so i moved the self harming more towards my wrists and thighs one lonely night i had a fight with my brother he slapped me and said that i was hardly even his sister anymore i felt like that was the end so i had planned that night that i was going to slit my throat and suffer till i died but right before i did it my parents grandparents my friends and my crush who is now my girlfriend they all flashed thr i honestly couldnt stop watching this video since it came outi honestly cried the first time throughi feel the same way may doesaccept i wanted to be an artistmy friend reached out to me in time and actually did the same thing and helped me get betteri love himhes my best friend and i wouldnt trade him for the world im going to see him in a few days and im going to hug him and thank him for what hes done because i know i wouldnt be here writing this right now sean if you ever have those thoughts just look at the number of people who love you millions and billions of people care about you and love you never forget thatnever think about suicide ever and this goes out to everyone watching this video no matter who you are someone loves you you matter thank you so much for playing this i played it before i watched your reaction to it and i wanted to cry i relate to may so much with depression and suicidal thoughts thank you so much sean 3 jack shawn please be my dad something has been telling me to watch this specific video for days now i dont know why but when i finally got the time to myself to do it i hesitantly clicked i had no idea how much i really needed to watch this video and hear the messages you had to say i just want to thank you sean youll never know how much you helped me with this thank you sean you should make a podcast you have missed messages i get it its like may is saying you have missed my hints that im depressed im smart d i am so immensely proud of you and i am so overwhelmingly proud of anyone who has pulled themself out of a dark dark place to find help you cant help anyone else if you dont save yourself first i needed thisi needed this so badly right now thank you heya jack ive been in a deep dark place before i was so sad tired depressed and ive had no interest in anything somedays but thanks to you ive found my way out of it ive heard so much bad and sad stuff in my brain that i started listening to it you helped me though i can open up right here and you will see this when i was in a deep dark hole you shone a light picked me up led me out and put me back in a happy place soafter all of thati have to say one thing thank youso much everyones life is worth saving and youre no exception if you feel suicidal or depressed you can talk to someone you love they will listen its okay to hurt but you shouldnt hurt yourself life may get tough but know that someone out there loves you and in the end everyone elses life is better because youre in it who needs a therapist when you have sen 3 jk if you need help go to a therapist but i have went through a lot and sen has helped me through so much in computer class we did a hero presentation and i did it of him my teacher thought it was funny i was doing a youtuber but when she asked me why is he my hero i wrote 5 slides of why and how he helps so much i cried when he was talking and i cant explain how much he has helped me i love you so much jack hope you see this and see how much you mean to us you are worth it hope you have a good day i tried to jump out my window but the screen was so hard it bounced me back its the reason im alive to this day you should play another game of hers when you get the chance even if u never post it on ur channel but its called he beat her i think same developer the things jack was talking about and this game really hit home for me the start of my senior year of high school was just a start of one of the worst times of my life i was unexplainably upset at the world i started thinking very badly about myself and the way i act and who i am as a person i became more and more upset and it felt like nothing would ever go right or look up for me i was tired and sad all the time and didnt want to do anything what jack said about him thinking why not just end it were the exact things i thought almost on a daily basis but one of my friends saw that i was struggling and waited until i was finally ready to open up i took a long time bc i always thought other people have much bigger problems than me why would i talk about something as stupid as how i feel that friend really helped me by just being there for me and im so thankful font her that im getting a lil better every day itll take a while but ill get there eventually if anyo i just noticed that he didnt even put ads on this video this proves that jack cares more about the community than money inspired by real life evan and junji ito me hmm i wonder what went wrong moved me to tears i know the exact feeling people need to do what makes them happy whether it makes money or not money is nothing but peoples feelings are everything im at the start and im scared especially after ddlc i really needed to hear that today for a long time i was suicidal and i know this sounds cliche but you really did help me get out of it your happy loud smiling swearing self made me feel that maybe it does get better and that maybe one day i could also be a happy loud smiling and even swearing self but please remember to take a break for yourself you may have helped me a lot but you have to remember to help yourself i felt so happy after this and watching sean talk about his deep emotions reminded me of the dark times i had for so long your so inspirational and give beautiful life lessons and help so much people stay awesome and amazing oh crap ive played this before i love how jack literally talks some deep shit by himself at a camera no cap thats amazing sean thank you for being you thank you i cry alot its so sad thank you this is the first time ive ever felt compelled to look at the comments let alone contribute this whole video got to me and the monologue at the end was really appreciated ive been struggling with depression for 2 decades and simply sharing personal experiences is a huge boost today was one of the days i needed it 146 is me in math thank you a lot of people go through this and you helped so many people thank you thank you jack for saying what most people wanna say but wont or cant say really thank you thank you for this seriously and i want to say to everyone if you are going though something always take time to seek help but also be there for each other go out side do something and one more thing put down the phone and enjoy life we only have one life lets live it okay do i hear shilo dynasty in the background i love them i hope that whoever feels like that i promise that u are cared about and someone does love u and i will always talk acesspam if u ever need a friend please talk to me u will always have a friend here if you think the world is bigger to you then just think that you are strong mighty the species that bloody rules the earth would you ever let something as small as depression beat you no remember who you are and what made out of you are strong you can beat and whenever you feel beaten down then just stay somewhere quit alone in the woods and see all the green because it makes a bloody difference ask somebody who has gone through that before just be strong and always remember a line that encourages you to keep moving forward and push hard against life and its challenges and of course seek help hey jack dont know if youll even see this but thank you for always being a voice i can turn to when things go bad i always know where to turn when i need a voice that is nothing but comforting since i started watching back when you did a game of trials with pewds and cinnamontoastken so thank you from everything that is in me the internet is a beautiful place there is at least someone you can talk to whether its online or offline you can express your feelings the internet isnt just for fun or work it can help you by giving you attention no one is alone in this world go find someone to talk to connect with them ive watched you since the start and youve helped me so much when ive been down this video helped me think about who i am as a person myself and how i can fix it to make myself happier and it means the world to me thank you so much hay all we need you get jack to play this drumbeats vr help me to let him know about this game i hope i have a friend like that one day even tho im not suicical im so glad that youre happier now and taking time for yourself relevance doesnt matter as long as you can still make enough to live on and are enjoying what youre doing its kinda weird for me to be saying this but im proud of you do what makes you happy and ignore the people who tell you you cant also the part where you mention having to distance yourself reminds me of the part in that fangame the boss where you sean is separate from jack the youtuber go at your own pace man dont force yourself to make videos if you dont feel like it 2207 is a mood also shiloh 3 also junji itos horror shit is awesome i almost cried through out this your hitting my heart with this sean and the game creater thank you for this game its beautiful man this whole video has been so amazing the game was rly good i loved the art related so much with the characters then got a free therapy session that i didnt know i needed after the game thank you man you rly help a lot of people when you take time to talk so sincerely about hard stuff like this im a fairly new subscriber to your channel jacksean i love all your videos but most of all i love this community its so amazing to see the level of support compassion and love people have for one another reading the comments and peoples replies is so heartwarming you have created something truly amazing here i have dealt with chronic depression and anxiety in the past and still do sometimes and it is such a hard thing to go through especially as it is the invisible illness what has helped me is to block out all the hate grab onto the things around you that makes you happy and just keep moving forward there is always light at the end of the tunnel even though it doesnt always feel like it there is also always someone to talk to thank you so much for playing thiss gameeee i loved is since the day i found it on steam so glad you played it i can relate to may a lot more than i should this was so touching i love you sean and i suport you in all the decisions that can make you feel better about yourself when it walked in on her cutting her self his reaction was wow and when i seen that i criedsome times i think of what may was doing to do it to me but hes so nice momwhy u crying me whatttt nooo im not crying while my face is really wet thank you i needed to hear this also im glad that you opened up i know stuff like this has the potential to trigger me but seans little talks and stuff make it better wish i had a friend like her irlbut here i am not having anyone and struggling with the same shit when he says i know it might seem like i dont care and im here like what how i am a phone addict i need to stop clearly im not doing that right now i have things to do and yet i dont have any energy or enthusiasm for the things that need to be done i rely too much on animes and youtube i call them escapes because they are but what i really need is an escape from anime and youtube i need to go look at trees and move around but im too tired all the time im not going to say that im going to try better i know that even if i say that it wont happen most things i see are shapes sitting in a room across me i dont know how to end this comment so baii god jack can you be my new therapist the helped me so much jack if you ever feel like you have to take a break from youtube but you dont want to make us mad dont worry were going to still watch your videos even if your gone for a month we will always enjoy your videos and the person you are no matter how long you stop uploading words cannot describe the immense relief i felt after watching this video so to put it simply thank you omg game by angela he i thought the art style looked familiar to sean i love you as a creator i love your honesty to anyone that reads this its ok to hurt sometimes you feel alone in your pain and i would never want to diminish your hurt but i promise you it will be ok i promise you that i and so many others understand the beauty of existence is feeling hurt alone and scared it is also feeling loved and wanted and brave you are loved if you dont feel it then listen to me i love you if you need anyone to talk to to listen to you i will happily lend an ear dont go through it alone that voice crack when it was silent and he said ah that hit me jack we dont care what youre doing as long as youre happy were here for you thank you for doing videos like this earlier this year i attempted to kill myself but two of my closest friends showed up to my house and stopped me and sat with me until i was in a better place after that i went back into therapy and ive been doing a lot better but i still go through really bad depressive episodes seeing and hearing these talks from you is really helpful though so thank you jack youre incredible did angela do any other games like this her art style is amazing i know this video is about mental health and all but i just have to mention the uno reverse no joke whenever someone says something to me im like no you or uno reverse card and then my friend is like double uno reverse card and im like rainbow uni reverse card and now no you and uno reverse is just my thing so yeah just had to mention that also to anyone reading if you are experiencing feelings like may you really need to try and find help trust me i did and it helps just remember your never alone thank you ur commentary to this game made me realise that i need to do something more my gf had been down and i would shrug it off as nothing but this had made me realise that its not just as simple i needed to do something and thank god its not too late so i want to just thank you and the person who made this game cos u have made a big difference to make me realise what my dumb ass was doing wrong and what i can do to help thank u jack may during the 2nd playthrough was the most relatable to me and it hit me deeply the love of writing the parent who doesnt support though not to the extent of anger from either side the golden child falling behind because of lack of effort the tiredness the want to give up the not knowing what you love it hurt a lot but it also opened my heart a bit because i didnt want to end up so deep into my mind to be truly in mays place so thank you angela for creating such a beautiful game and sharing a personal experience and thank you sean for relating yourself to us and giving us a piece of you and your journey that gives us inspiration to try to live i love all of you please stay to see the beauty of the world and all of its simple joys i dont have a fancy comment or anything but i just wanna say this means a lot to me this really reminds me of my close friends we always talk about stuff like this when we hangout and have that same lowkey chill kind of vibe most of the time at least most motivational speech ever isnt there a continuation to sally face ily my friends dont want to get involved in my life university is around the corner and i have no interest and i have no idea what to study forim a pain in everyones life and i feel like i cant handle any close member of my familys deathim a useless mess and no ones helping me and recently ive been more suicidal than ever and the only thing keeping me away from it is

it sounds like losing intrest by sihol or however you spell his name a genuine thanks for never shying away from games that spread awareness and help people as well as for the mini talks it means a lot we love you jack andyou made me really emotional i went through this situation with my ex gf thank you sean im in a fog rn and i needed to see this you should play butterfly soup its a really funny game thats on itchio i went through this i got out of it but dude this made me cry his emotional speech like 30 minutes in jack this is probably gonna be hella cliche tbh but i dont know a lot about you but from what youve shown youre amazing and if you lose all of your subs you wont lose me cuz your hella relatable bro youre great to be honest i didnt want to watch this but i did it anyways and you are right this hit close to home in may i had a moment where i had suicidal and self harming thoughts and this was right before i graduated college and that was when i knew i needed help so found a friend to help and now i am slowly getting back to who i use to be and why i wanted to go to college and do what i wanted and i have to keep telling myself that i am worth it and that i am awesome and talented and to keep my positive mind so thank you for playing this game and thank you for all you have done and will be doing you are awesome there is always a light at the end of the tunnel tomorrow is another day you will be alright soon it may take days weeks or even years but it will happen no matter how long it takes you just have to be patient i fucking needed this clicked the video not reading the details now im crying thank you i needed to hear this i just realized that this video is mostly jackaboy talking about pma stuff than a gameplay appreciate it tho ooooohhh a lady friend yaaaassss seeeeaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnn i dont no why people dislike him he is so nice and open this game reminds me of when my dads girlfriend shot herself she was like another mother to mei loved herand suicide and depression is a huge topic in my familythanks to everyone who stopped me from taking my life videos like this are so important this games message is so important so many people myself included thinks these things and feels like no one can relate or even cares you dont want to bother another person and thats why videos like this are so important because when people like sean share stuff like this it helps others that might not have much exposure to these things people can relate and finally understand that its normal and that things get better i hope anyone that feels this takes something from this video and i know so many people say this but really if anyone needs to talk to someone who understands please feel free to message me and thank you sean for covering a topic like this and opening up about your own experience i feel like i have to say it now i was depressed i was selfharming sometimes i still am but for anyone going through dark times it gets better it might look hopeless but it really isnt if you think youre just a pain in the ass of everyone around you try helping others it may sound clich but thats what helped me ive met really good people who want to help others because of volunteering it does boost your confidence when you can see the work behind you when you see that the things you did actually work help others please dont kill yourself good luck sean you seem to be going through a lot and we are here for you just like you are here for us all the time you are relevant helpful to your community and a good person x 3 hey sen this video was really really good and emotional and deep i loved it every single part of it i am happy that you made this video because a lot of people deal with this type of thing myself included and i hope everyone can get the messages here talk to a friend suicide is never the answer although i cant really believe that myself sadly dont apologize for taking time for yourself i completely understand i was at the other side of the coin where i wanted validation and attention i wanted to get noticed by the people i looked up to and it seems so silly now so remember that you are loved sen and everyone reading this i know im rambling but i wanted to get things off my chest im not doing great and there are days where i fall into the dark again but for the first time in a long time i feel hope just like in the game i have had bad experience with professionals before but now i found something i think works better and i got diagnosed with autism anyways no one will read this haha but if u do it gets better our generation has a hard time but well get through it together never stop jack sean create any content and we will love it if you feel that content is what you enjoy making then it is the only content worth making honestly the videos where jack takes 10 minutes to have deep talks whether its about real life important topics or the game he plays are my favorite and i totally didnt cry because of this game and his talk no way every time jacks voice cracks i nearly burst into tears lost a friend early this year and its so devastating not just to me but seeing how it has left others feeling so hopeless too even if someone seems fine and dandy reach out always check in with peeps even if its just to talk about nothing thanks for everything you are my hero and you really made my life soo often a little better or showed me that there is something to fight for just thank you for your help time and effort you are perfect on your own way and just you everyone is perfect on their own way never give up jacksepticeye youre ten years to the day younger than i am so thank you youngerbirthdaybrother for sharing as much as you do youve helped a lot of people make it through difficulty and im grateful for the light in the darkness shine on you crazy diamond sending virtual hug to all of you d holy shit my dadds pat and pete hajvteawq im not surprised im the only one freaking out about this i dont think youtubers actually understand how much they impact other peoples lives when ever i get suical or wanna die i come and watch seans channel it helps he honestly had helped me through so much and he doesnt even know i wish sean knew how much he helps because he deserve to know that hes a hero 2858 that went from 1 to 100 pretty fucking fast why does this make me cry more than when jack played the walking dead idk so beautifully put jack look this is coming from an oldie im 36 year old with 2 kids my eldest is 14 and watches you and my sister has watched you a whilei first saw a video a few years back but that loud shouty jack was too much for me personally i came back 6 months ago and im hooked so dont worry that youve changed as we get older we changed and evolve everybody does life changes us ive been through anxiety myself a good few years back and got help the best thing i did was say i need help keep doing what you do best and the right people will keep on watching x much love becky you are a gem jack we love you 3955 when you said that even the professionals will care that is so true my mom is an lcsw a clinical social workertherapistcounselor and she cares deeply on a personal level about all her patients if you are seeing someone in a therapy environment dont forget they are people too and hearing your troubles getting to know your struggles they do empathize make sure that they give you an emergency line if they dont do it without prompting then ask trust me they have no problem helping you even when theyre off the clock because more than anyone they want to see you be better and succeed you should play gang beasts if you havent already or try a sonic game the artwork is beautiful if you have tried antidepressants and think they dont work talk to your doc and ask to try something else i tried two types before finding the one that actually helped finding the right doc is also really important one that listens to you and you can trust im also very lucky that i found friends that understand and helped me and my family was understanding that i needed time dont give up things will get better 3 omg that hope ending as someone who suffers through bipolar depression and suicidal thoughts i bawled thank you for playing this when you were talking about your experience in 2017 it really hit home but in a helpful way i work as an artist and ive had very similar thoughts when it comes to this is my hobby i got to work on what i loved to do but i dont enjoy it anymore so you just get an existencial crisis cause if the one thing that make you happy starts making you feel miserable its the worst and if you are forced to keep doing it because its not your hobby but also your work its even worse because if you stop you have nothing left but if you keep going it just makes you sadder and sadder i know im just venting and this comment is going to get lost into the comment section but it actually helped to see that you were going through thoughts that are so similar to the ones i have now and you got over it so thank you 3 such a great game and even better after your heart to heart with us please never end your life if you think nobody gets you people do maybe not even someone you know but at least think of people in this comment section sharing experiences if you need to talk talk to your family and if you cant talk to them talk to a friend not them talk to a therapist and if you cant do that fuck talk to someone dont live in your head you may not be fully understood because nobody fully understands someone but someone will understand you believe me i feel misunderstood as hell and trust me im not even close to happy heres reasons for that i have had so many things in my past i was pysichally abused by my old stepdad emotiorally and mentally abused by him verbally abused by him and that was just after i was in a foster home for 9 months because he and my mom had a drug thing happening i never met my dad he killed himself when i was 8 months old because i was born so im the reason my older brother doesnt have a dad and then at t never thought id cry from a youtube video its so odd to relate to something on a literal personal level i really resonate with feeling like every day is the exact same mostly because theres weeks and even been months where i cant leave my house just because it feels impossible to get up and exist in general i know i need to see a psychologist because i can feel myself slipping away but since i turned 18 three years ago and lost insurance i just cant afford any help i love you sean i dont need to say anything else just wanted to say that you are the most honest and genuine person on this platform and its really inspiring you arent alone either shawn and whatever you are going through right now we understand and its okay to feel that way everyone has good and bad days but what matters is that we power through them and look on the bright side this made me so emotional because i went to very bad times i know many people think im lying and its okay nobody can trust somebody online you dont even know anyone but even he got emotional while he was speaking by his own words cried so much at this because i was thinking of killing myself but i was so scared to do it and what would the people that care about me feel to anyone that read this thank you and hope you are not going to hard times and just try your best never give up and just talk to a friend that you really really trust that wont say this to anybody i have one friend that went through what i did i tried to help him but he was grounded we couldnt talk and at school anyone can hear us i felt so bad for him he also gets bullied and i cant do anything about it he doesnt want to tell the teacher or his parents because he is scared his parents hit him everytime he gets grades that you can still pass but its not that good everytime he goes through tou all my friends play modern online fps games all the time dont know if i can relate to them jacks such great advice during games like this the kind of advice you cant find anywhere else this is good i like this a lot good job jack you need to play this more cause im pretty sure there is more to the game like having a relationship with your roommate okay i got into a wreck yesterday not even 24 hours ago i caused it and i cant stop thinking of the look on the little girls face in the back seat who looked a little younger than 10 i cant look into the mirror without thinking about the accident that i couldve prevented no one got hurt thank goodness but it was my first wreck and it really messed with me so ill get to the point already thank you for posting videos on youtube for all these years before and after the green hair whether its a therapeutic video or just something to make the audience laugh you are highly appreciated and i just want to thank you sen thank you im glad i didnt click away i need to believe in myself so many things have been showing and telling me that lately because i keep feeling like im not making any headway in my life and theres so much i wanted to accomplish by now but just taking things day by day like you said is how ive gotten over hurdles before and thats what im going to try to do again also thank you for sharing your story im getting into your channel and i like how you can set limits for yourself and show us that it is possible to make it out of those negative feelings thank you jack this helped me more than you will know i know you will never see this but this video helped me in a great way i appreciate all the advice you gave in this and i will use it to attempt great things even just for myself thank you and i love you all my love to you buddy i have bipolar disorder and i hate to think that you feel the way i feel you dont deserve that this means alot i have barely used my phone in 5 12 months goth gf is my girlfriend to a tee and its freaky tbh it is so refreshing to hear an up there youtuber talk about this a lot of the time people think that because youre a celebrity or that youre well known you cant feel bad i really needed to hear this as well so i appreciate this a lot that noise he made at 3827 after talking about his dark time broke my heart im so so glad hes found a much happier place in his life and i hope he knows how many people he brings happiness to just by being true to himself big hugs all around sean if you ever see this thank you your message at the end was not a rant and was not nothing it struck something in me and is actually better than what any therapist has told me personally everything you said was true thank you you are appreciated 3 i relate way too much with may it scares me i love how real you are now a year and a half ago i had to make the toughest decision i had the choice to either end my life or take control and leave the abusive environment i was in i was leaning towards ending everything because i didnt see how leaving would be an option my mother was extremely abusive and she made it so that i could only depend on her she cut everyone out of my life and she made me feel like i was to stupid to be able to make it on my own as hard as it was i took that step and decided to leave she screamed and beat me but in the end i walked out her front door i got in contact with my family and slowly but surely im doing everything she made me think i couldnt do a few days ago i was spending time with my family and for the first time i was happy i didnt end it all because there is light at the end of the tunnel and things do get better dafuq i played this just 4 days ago love this video your advice as well i never knew how my 16 year old daughter was feeling until one day things got out of hand but she did admit she needed some mental health help i tried to be there for her but i knew she needed more then i could give her anyway we did find a therapist that she really clicks with and she is doing better people are never a lone you may feel that way but your not there are always people who are willing to help you so just hang in there and try to let them help you i never knew the way my 16 year old was feeling and it breaks my heart that i did not realize it sooner but i am thankful that she came to me i also do believe that everyone needs to take breaks and work on themselves and take time just for them i am a mother of 4 girls and it is so hard for me to take time for myself bc sometimes i think that i dont need too but in reality i need to take sometime for me so i have been trying to do that i am also trying to take time to work on mysel while i myself have never felt depressed i have a friend who i believe is this game meant a lot to me because there are several scenarios where i am in the shoes of the main girl in this game and may is my friend i always am afraid that im not handling the situation correctly but this game showed me some of the right things to do and say and that i am doing well as a friend in her time of need and as for your talk at the end jack ill probably send that to her im sure she would appreciate it and help her youre happy were happy we know you care 3 sean youre not cheesy or clich youre here youre real im so happy and so proud that youre in a better place of course you need your space and your time and thats exactly perfect you do exactly what you need to feel good and you do exactly what you want take time for yourself please please just be you and do what you need for your own well being because in the end you matter not the videos or the games you matter thank you for giving us this part of yourself but seriously we want you to be happy do whatever you need we love you and we support you endlessly here is a free friend for anyone who feels alone scared or sad never give up and make every day as lovely as you can love cinna bonnie i cried thru most of this video cus it was so relatable but ive gotten thru those type of days n even tho i still feel like that some times i find comfort in knowing that i got thru it so anyone who feels this way dont worry ur not alone can you have another 90 minutes in denver i was busy that day i started crying half way through the video because all of this hit home for me ive been trying to be like that girl that was there for amy in the game for everyone and giving myself away because deep down i want and need someone to do that for me but no one does not saying its there fault like i can understand that they have there own lifes but i wish someone would take the time to really be there and know what to say which ik is a hard thing to do but just simple things you know and ive been depressed and having all thoughs thoughts amy and you were having but more extreme like amys and ive been trying to get help from a professional but its not working and ive just been wanting to give upthis channel has always been like an escape for me so thank you for that and this video i felt like i was really talking to you i even paused the video and started talking to my screen just getting emotions out that ive been needing to talk about ik that probably sounds dumb but i real shiloh losing interest 1030 haha i love that song i know this may be late but i needed this thank you sean hey dude your videos make me want to carry on walking along my path i love you so fucking much thank you for being this kind and beautiful person everyone needs to scroll down to laura sneddens comment and like it so sean can see it i just want to talk to someone i had a girlfriend but she died after she died i lost my mind i am alone im not suicidal but im depressed i have hard time forgiving myself i gave up youtube after she died i was so excited to see this yes ive played this game its worth it i can relate to may about the fact that every day is the same and it is just rinse and repeat i just got your messages every morning i wake up to the sweet sweet sound of my phone that has been ringing hi last year i was hospitalized for 2 months for being suicidal and having depression my parents showed up and accused me of making up things because they did not see anything suspicious in my behaviour i did go to hospital with my boyfriend who made me go to the doctor i just left letter for parents because they wouldnt let me go yeah they didnt see anything because i was suffering from depression since i was like 15 i am 24 now and was never social i was more like the silent bullied type of nerd with little to no friends in the hospital i was called spoiled brat and never taken seriously they thought i made all up i think i was on pills which made me locked in my head screaming but my body could not show it i was physically not be able to cry or show emotions so after like week out from the hospital i stopped taking those pills now i am a disappointment for my whole family because i wasnt able to finish college because of my depression and anxiety i dont tal im always alone people dont talk to me this cheers me up i got into a lot of depression because am gender dysphoric and want t be a male but my family is an antilgbtq household so ive been through a lot of suicide attempts and selfharm but reading the comments and listening to what jack says when it comes to such stuff if just heart warming youve made a pansexual trans boy with identity problems smile so good in fact jack spends 20 minutes talking about it thankyou sen for inspiring me to get better i was afraid to ask for help and i didnt which made it harder btw so dont do that eventually i opened up to strangers then friends and then finally my mum i did used to self harm but i quit and i used to constantly hate myself and i got so numb that i felt comfortable with just hating myself but one day i was looking through videos of me when i was little and i felt so guilty for hating myself and i decided it was time to try if i didnt try i wouldnt be that person ever again youre my hero and im not gonna say you made me better because it took a hell of a lot of work but you inspired me to start and you motivated me so from the bottom of my heart thankyou and even now that im better youre still my inspiration i love talking to people and helping them and i learn from you and its not always gratifying but then when people come back and message me in a year to thank me i feel so amazing for it and for anyone re i love when jack goes on tangents and speaks his mind i love when jack goes on tangents and speaks his mind so nice to see jack have another talking session and about a serious subject i did feel suicidal i felt like all my efforts to e normal were failing all my time i spent looking in the mirror wishing to change things when i didnt have the power to my heart couldnt get any lower but it did and my world crumbled but now i am back on my feet and my soul is lifted up now i am little more happier and smarter to not repress my emotions and every day i devote my time to make others smile to keep them out of the zone the void the darkness that i was in thank you for playing this game sean i love you its not like your going to read this but thank you because of games like these i loved the fact that ive met people online to make friends with its so important and different also one feels a bit better to open up tosomeone who doesnt know you at all jack there is a lot off endings i think you should do all off them one is really really sad i started going to a therapist and i clicked with her so well i love her she great and i moved and i am honestly so sad because i feel like i lose my best friend and yeah thats sounds stupid but she was really like my best friend thank you jack omg please give yourself a big hug or have someone give you a big hug just a message to everybody that i thought would be nice if youre ever feeling like you cant overcome an obstacle in life just remember my favorite jacksepticeye series undertale even when you fail even if you fall down its not over as long as you keep charging forward with determination its never the end keep on fighting for that happy ending i know that one day well all get to see it i started watching thinking id be okay but at 3006 when she said why are you sad it really hit me and now im crying and i think i should stop watching this now im mtf and closeted and im pansexual and i found a friend on amino thats going through mtf just like me we are both closeted in fucking narnia is what we said ps youre also a great narrator sean if people cant appreciate who you are they shouldnt be watching your channel if theyre going to spread hateful lies they shouldnt be here i think youre awesome despite the fact that you had your rough patch in life you still continue to care for your community even if youre not as engaged with us which is fine life is short and you deserve to live your best life 3 i feel bad

ima say it anyway jackwhats your favorite meme menia im pretty young but ive self harmed and i tried to talk about it but no one took me seriously because they thought i was too young to be

your chest when you talked about going out and trying your absolute hardest because everyone deserves to be happy regardless if you fuck up all the time hit me real hard my dude i sort of fall into that category sometimes where i just get real low because i constantly fuck things up but i still try my best thanks for the motivation thats why i watch your channel when the world crashes around me your videos inspire me to just say fuck it im trying anyways and even if i fail i still gave it my all and now that my little emotion spew is over time to return to uploading cringe videos p the end hope okay this ending is touching this is why you should never ignore your real friends and always check up on them because you care deeply for them dont ditch them and hang out with someone else if your other friend misses you who knows whats going on with your friend so its always good to be there for them and help them if your living a happy life then that friend should be happy and you can hang or talk with your friend online later you can buy eleliner palette for 50 or you can purchase all the components necessary to build a bionic arm sorry im a bit special the end missed there are people that truly miss you there may be something going on with their life but you wanted to go hang with other people so its always good to hold on to your true friends that person might be thinking that person is going to hang out with someone other than me i feel like im nothing to that person she may be thinking that so she gets sad and upset yes a person should feel happy for you but in this scenario that friend may be thinking otherwise if you enter a conversation like that friend and you assume its their last goodbye be there for that friend and tell that other person that you might hang out tomorrow so tdrl cherish your friends you have and not look for new ones there can be people with 1000 friends but only 3 friends that will always be there for you and love and care so deeply for you is it fucked to say that game where keeping me from killing my self thank you for being you sean youre really helping many people keep being healthy and keep being you dear jack i know you will never ever read this but i will talk its stupid and i know the things i have passed are not really important sometimes i also felt sad and miserable i felt like i lived the same day everyday and that i was worthless my parents seemed distant i have divorced parents and had panic attacks because of thinking my stepfather was a pedophile and having thoughts of being raped by him due to traumas one day i got my bed sheet and tried to kill myself by asphyxiation i didnt have a rope i had many thoughts of self harm but i never had the courage for my parents always tried to tell me i was special and my life matters i had existential crisis last year could call it the worst year ever everyday i just wanted to sleep and never wake up i felt afraid of my school and people every sad song would make me feel depressed and this year everyday i wake up tired of doing the same thing over and over sometimes i think i dont deserve my family and th i wanted to die after my parents broke up and it just killed me inside i just couldnt be happy anymore and was planning to just i dont know cut myself but i couldnt thinking how my mom would react to her only son being dead but i realized jacks positive mental attitude and i tried it and it worked i looked at the bright side of things and it worked i was sort of a may in that situation i didnt want to die knowing that the people that i loved would also be dead inside like i was so thanks thank you so much you make me feel like a person you show me there is more to life then being sad or careing what other people think about you i dont feel worseless after i watch one of your vids now i see the happy and good parts of life thank you jacksepticeye you make my life a hell lot better thank you for all you do i dont get the forgive ending can somebody explain what happens not how to do it but what happens in the story thanks x this game is fucking amazingly done like thats really how it can be and how simple it can be for one person to make a difference in the life of someone depressed can we have jack talk to us everyday like this its inspiring also i really want to know the song list for this game its good i can relate to may in so many ways but i hope anyone else out there who does to keep living their life to the fullest did i really just see a non ironic trigger warning on a game well im going back to the ps2 era this industry has gone too far this is so important i used to think the same way as may especially the part about always saying youre okay even if youre not and not wanting to be a burden and i still do sometimes but i do my best to work through it its sad how much i and many others can relate to this but know that there are people who care it doesnt have to be friends or family even people in your classes and workplace just people who know you in general even if you dont talk much i speak from experience when i say that your life affect a lot more people than you think people who arent even your friends reach out to the people around you because it can always get better i know it did for me and it can definitely get better for you too shaun was playing this at a much slower pace than what i play this game at btw jacksepticeyes real name is shaun if you didnt know jacksepticeye youre an amazing person i love you and im so glad you exist whenever im upset i watch your videos and im immediately happy youre one of the main reasons im still alive i cant even begin to describe how much i love your videos theres so much negativity online and drama on youtube and its easy to feel like theres hope anymore but i watch your videos and feel like theres hope i can tell you care about the community and i love it im so glad you dont let popularity get to your head like some other youtubers do you deserve every last bit of support youve got and will get im glad you still take care of yourself instead of completely dedicating everything to youtube please continue to take of yourself and enjoy your life and personally i feel like you have always cared for the community and never havent youre a great person sean and im so glad people like you exist sean mays door is open i wonder where she is shaving add gives legs lips saun holy fuck you know it really makes me sad every time i notice that there are other ppl that fell the way i do and this whole vid rlly hit home like i barely cry at all but man this is some quite hard stuff and i feel like way too few ppl talk about this thanx jack saun for staying here to ease my pain every day a little bit and helping me getting more positive again love you bud two things that really caught my eye were at the end it said it was inspired by junji ito who is a popular horror manga artist and behind the gay pride flag is the trans flag junji ito shows horror not in physical creatures because that gives you a sense of being able to kill this tangible thing what makes his stories so scary is that the horror comes from ideas my favorite story is about how a concept the concept of spirals infects a town leading to things like obsession grotesque shaping of the human body and even death it feels hopeless to me now because theres no way to defeat a concept its always just going to be there and the only solution seems to be running second the trans pride flag being trans myself i saw it and went oh dear god i think i know where this is going because trans suicide rates are alarmingly high i myself was suicidal for a while and now im concerned about both the fictional characters of the game and the real life creator and i sean you help me millions millions its become really hard for me to open up lately but right now made me realise loads you are so important and im so grateful for you youve grown beautifully and what i usually say to console myself with dreams that i cant really achieve is even if from my side of the world i cant see snowflakes dance in the moonlight it doesnt take away from their miraculous beauty you are absolutely perfect for all that youve become thank you so so much i really needed your little message today sean thank you i know what to watch when im low and sad

you were you are and you will always be my favourite no matter what others say so much of this hit home so much of what you said hit home ive always hated myself but i ask anyone around me and they just love me im always burning myself out for other people and it leaves me empty as well its moments like these where you talk like this that reminds me im really not alone and that i deserve to value myself the way my peers believe i do i so rarely like someones video i liked this video i just ran 2500 miles away from everything ive ever known to try and reach a new life and ive been weirdly numb this whole week in my new surroundings you made me cry you made me feel something again hope you helped me be hopeful with your words here today thank you sean i know my voice may be lost in the sea of people but thank you thats all i can say theres was a point in life when it thought about it like if i where just to give in to my suicidal thoughts i wouldnt be here and try to live my life and your videos always help me cause u look so happy and like your having fun so thank you cause your videos helped me hi im sorry but i just wanted to say something because i dont know what to do and i need advice ive often looked at my razor and bad thoughts go through my head and i know im being stupid and probably wanting attention im sorry i have a great life with great friends so i know there is something wrong with me im sorry im gonna go now i love playing this game but it is so sad sean thank you we have all been there and youre right it will always get better and ive been waiting your channel for years and you have changed but its always felt that were at the same stage its kinda stupid but thanks for the years of content that is enjoyed every second thats very deep and depressing topic jack but guys remember that were all in this together man we all stuck in this world where the system of life and death is undeniable theres always good and bad things thats we need to like picking ourselves and other people up and other people should do the same as well so that we might be able to achieve some happiness or relieving some stress maybe just a little but i think its worth lot even if its just a little 3 is it bad i thought it said mystic messenger thanks for opening up sean it helps us know were not alone there is hope when someone can be even a little bit open to millions of people and expressing themselves in a way they enjoy its really special and i love when youtubers trust their communities enough to talk about personal experiences sometimes sen is so inspiring and at the end of the day hes just like any of his fans hes a normal person that has experiences and isnt always happy he cares about the community so much and makes really fun videos i like watching as he changes yes he is different than he was 3 years ago but it isnt a bad thing i have been watching this channel for around 4 years i think and ive never gotten bored this channel is so amazing and entertaining and inspiring and i love it anyway i have no clue what im talking about its 235 am and my brain isnt functioning properly thank you sean jack i wish my best friend could have heard this from you because what happened at the beginning of the game is what happened to her but thank you for saying this it helped me a lot i want to go out there sean fuck this hit home hard 3 much love jack jack uno reverse game uno reverse jack oo deji needs to hear your message dramas aside i wish him all the best jesse now im crying cuz i felt like the girl this makes me think of my friend i know shes not ok but i dont know how to help her yesterday i spam her with advices and making sure she knows that im here even if it is on messages but i dont know if it is enough to help her i feel like a want to do more and it makes me mad because i cant i dont have money and im so far away i dont even have a car or a job it sucks bc only time is the key but im scared what if its too late i dont want her to go lack of hope because of the lack of money is a factor though yo yo my fellow epic gamers just wanted to say youre all epic even if you play fortnite i love yall and remember youre amazing death sucks yeah etikas death has been fucking me up lately when i first watched his last video i really hoped to whatever god there is that hell turn up ok or at least something or someone or he delayed it i knew it was wishful thinking but i just hate to imagine the other consequences never give up dont listen to the voices in your head people do care about you there is always something to strive for people care about you people want to help you people want to see you succeed never give up do what you enjoy just remember that committing suicide isnt the answer seek help seek a better brighter future if you keep moving forward youll find that there is something for you youre strong you can be strong life is beautiful no matter how hard it is when you are pushed down constantly just get back up the most important thing is you your life your family your friends your experiences your memories youll grow as a person and achieve if you keep moving forward its so important to value yourself and make time for yourself realizing whats important and doing those things will make you happier it doesnt matter if ypur talented or not it doesnt matter if you have a lot friends or a few close ones its not about money or k that junji ito mention though hes got great mangas i need to cry but my foundation was 48 it said mean either honestly watching your videos makes me feel a bit better about life i still suffer with stuff like this and just recently i made my own attempt because i couldnt handle it i didnt succeed obviously and the psychiatrist i saw encouraged me to do more things that i like both positive and negative videos help me feel a little more connected to reality and that im not alone i hope i can get better when you wanna feel yeehaw but its yeenaw for you that is the missed message ive waited to see i never felt sadness towards this game cause there are some parts where the characters spoken words are quite hilarious for example no you uno reverse thank you sean for opening up as a person struggling its nice to hear kind words once in awhile ive made it a habit since i moved to go outside at twilight each night without my phone and just watch the fireflies light up the world i spend all day doing chores and listening to youtube and music and reading webtoons and stories and its just nice to let the world outside my little home stop and bear witness to the little bugaboos shoot off like sparks all around me only jack can talk and talk for 20 minutes and still have their viewers watch all of it just before i searched jacksepticeye and clicked on this vid i was listening to runaway train by soul asylum i do have to say games like this help make things feel more real as someone whos extremely depressed it gets so hard to get out of that rut and it hurts so much when your friends dont say just the right thing but seeing lets plays and seeing peoples reactions to stuff like that it kinda helps to see more that hey people cant read your mind and dont know how to help all the time so dont blame them for not being perfect support at the time one of my friends passed away about 2 months ago it hurts so much still we were in a tight group of friends it hurts seeing how everyone reacts to getting the news at the same time it hurts seeing the denial and talking to the parents and seeing memes and posts and games that they might like and knowing you can never share it with that person it hurts seeing their dad post nearly every day about how much hes struggling without his baby it hurts seeing their mom try so hard to do everything in her power to do things that her child w sean before jack god i wish there was a love button cant say how much it means to know that even someone like sen struggles with issues like this too it really helps make you feel like youre not alone you know me i am a sensitive person sean this video also sean u better not watch it then bucko me this sign cant stop me because i cant read its hard watching this as someone who has been stuck in this rut for so many years its hard to do the things you love when youre not sure what they are and even when you do know it can be so daunting because you feel like youre not good enough at it to succeed its a hard situation to be in i just wanted to thank sean for talking about this so openly every time you do it pushes me a little bit further along my path of recovery im not there just yet but hearing you talk about it on the platform you have to the millions of people who watch you it makes me feel a little more brave about taking that step too it gives me that little bit more confidence to talk more openly about my suffering and my mental health issues thank you sean thank you for sharing with us and thank you for withholding things from us you deserve that privacy and we should all respect that you havent just changed youve really grown and i think thats fantastic you are such a quality content creator and you help so many people thank you for videos like this i want to be that friend to someone thank you for being here you have really helped me through some stuff love you jack youre a better therapist then ive ever had jacksepticeye gives zero fucks about copyrighted music because he seems to be the only youtuber who understands that no music ruins the whole game also im almost certain that the music was cavetown sean we love you and support you and yeah why is baked pronounced baked but naked isnt pronounced naked jack talks about how he feels the commentary opens out gives a bit of life support for everyone a n d becomes my youtube therapist once again me and possibly everyone carefully hes a hero sean your family are here for you your friends are here and i know u need to keep some life personal so im not gonna say were here for you in the sense of come talk to us were hear to listen this made me cry for yall who need this here is a heart 3 may speaks my mind fitting in dealing with life and relationships is really though and because of that its hard to keep up the mask its hard to keep up the play only that people like you yea well sometimes life sucks but like sean said theres a way even tough i dont see it at the moment there people who care and still by my side so yeah this video made me tear up tbh thanks for this man i didnt know how much i needed it im glad youre using your influence for something important this is kinda happening to me now but i cant find a friend who would understand felt like i needed to get this out i have many depressed friends its hard to care about myself when i always need to help them and if i dont then it all goes to hell im helping them in a way that even i can admit it under all circumstances is not healthy when i heard shiloh dynesty i jumped damn jack you kinda went on a rant but it was an important one i also really love your vids keep up the food work is the soundtrack of the game on spotify not an al looool for example school exams were all in the same game just different levels going through the same hell just different devils its a dark quote but it makes me feel a bit better in my dark times youre allowed to keep a piece of yourself self discretion is not bad feelings are never pointless no matter how small they may be feelings always matter this one hits home way too hard i always love when jack speaks seriously while i know this comment will be lost amongst the sea of everyone else i just feel as if i need to thank you jack i have a watched your videos for years and everytime you take a minute or so just to remind people that they are not alone in this world and they can reach out to people who cares for them is absolutely amazing it has helped me so much to get through some of my own dark times and reach out for help from someone but it has also helped me to be able to help other people who are going through hard times so jack i really thank you so much you are amazing and hope those dark days never get to you anymore you have so many people who care about you and not just about what you do as a career you are amazing thank you so so so much jack and goodluck for the future ooooh the artstylleeee only if i could man only if i could i like that he smiles when he says evelyn i feel like such a fuckin asshole right now and i am an ass for many reasons and no matter how i say what im about to say its going to sound even worse like a year or 2 ago i was on jacks channel watching his videos all the time and when he kinda changed from my prospective i just kinda backed away from the channel also when i watched him before i was like oh theirs no way jack could ever get depressed or anything keep in mind i was in 5th gradeish and when sean said all of this in the video i kinda broke down and now i see how blind i was before and even now jack if you see this please dont be angry or get sad for the piece of worthless shit that i am i just want you to be happy i needed to hear that thank you i love you so much sean youre such a great guy and you have such a big heart and i can tell you are helping so many people and i hope you know that 100 me being such a small youtuber i really really relate to that message at the end i try to stream every single day and so many people get used to that and feeding off of my energy so much that even when i miss one day due to me being in a really depressing mood everyone begins to pressure me to stream days when i dont wanna talk on the phone get out of bed eat or anything what makes things worse is it feels like im letting down my viewers by not streaming which adds to the depressing feeling sometimes its for days i dont know where i was going with this but i completely understand sean i want you to know that even though you wont see this comment we all love you as a lot more than an entertainer and i love you and your content so much just know that every day you are loved by so many people you give me something to look forward to i see more than a youtuber i see an amazing person with a great personality jack your a really good guy and you mean alot to alot of people take the time you need i will always love your content and im happy you have opened up cause this community that you have made will always support you we are here for you so just be yourself and take your time i just copied these numbers from another comment just in case some people miss that comment just remember even if they are professionals theyre still there for you dont stay quiet speak up if youre silent for too long your feelings will become denser and denser and turn into a black hole that you just cant escape try to find a good way out of the hole even if you have to do it yourself because there might not always be a person there get the fuck out of that hole argentina 5402234930430 australia 131114 austria 017133374 belgium 106 bosnia herzegovina 080 05 03 05 botswana 3911270

hong kong 852 2382 0000 hungary 116123 india 8888817666 ireland 4408 i just love it when jack opens up the new sally face is out right once you said if i can make at least one person say thank you for making me smile it is worth it so thank you for making me smile on this cloudy day those with the brightest smiles often hide the deepest pain so much of mays story resonated with me so much ive worked with alot of big celebs in the past and i cant remember one of them who didnt see a therapist some had them on the road with them and they have basically all come to the point where they have realized if you give everything you are to your fans and the public you lose your own sense of who you are i can imagine that it would be the same but to an even bigger extreme with youtubers since theres no real filter between them and the fanspublic yeah sometimes its hard to deal with your own problems when you know theres others that have it way harder it makes it so easy to blame and guilt yourself into not feeling what you need to feel and at the same time being a popular figure or not it makes it easy and almost desirable to hide parts of yourself away and sometimes that just opens up a hole that you cant get out of so anyone who feels like this find someone to talk to about it open up dont worry about what theyre dealing with or whats going on in their life because chances are that what youre going through has more potential to tumble into something greater you have to know when to tell someone before it tumbles into another suicide in the news i would be so down for a jacksepticeye podcast i could listen to just you talking all day thats why youre my favorite youtuber you seem real and also you like soad which makes me a bit biased keep doing what you feel is best for you im struggling myself not knowing where im going in life had to quit highschool because of mental illness and now im stuck videos like this help a lot all your videos do tbh i watch them all me pokes jack hugs jack i just thought you might need a hug aww i love you so so much sen im so glad youre doing better these days and taking more time for yourself and things that make you happy that not everybody needs to know about all the time im really proud of how much youve grown as a person and im ever so thankful for you and thank you so much for that beautiful message at the end we all need to find our way back to ourselves listening to jacksepticeye opening up fills you with determination i would read those harry potter fanfics sorry just didnt like the sad atmosphere im having but seriously harry potter fanfics like f you still read them gosh im bad at being optimistic but i tried im not crying youre crying uno reverse card unrelated but i just wanna ask why does jack has half as many views as felix even though he has 45x less subs jacksubs 22 mil pewdssubs 96 mil jackviews 11 billion pewdsviews 21 billion proof that jack is more relevant than poods did i just hear shilohhbut it kinda helped me get better so thnx okay i just started the video and read the comment section i dont like what im getting into this seems so common for people to say and i feel like im just being a whiney bitch about this but i can sympathize with a lot of this even just as a 14 year old i dont think this all was strictly due to social media but a lot to do with technology i have spent my entire life around it and messing with different realities and stuff your reality can feel bent and you can genuinely feel like you dont exist its such weird shit last year i debated it a decent amount but kept going i didntand still havent spoken to anyone of it because i know how much it can hurt i know for a fact my family and friends love me but i cant hurt them with that burden of letting them know i feel like i know it isnt realistic but i dunno but yeah with thisi think that i have actually been depressed and am not just looking for attention and i dont know why i have to clarify that last year even in school i would be super irritable and a general dick to my friends i had started to notice that m good job of taking care of your mental health sean theres one criticism i will give this video and thats the statement that you should do what you love no matter what that is simply not an option for the majority of people you have to make money to survive fuck capitalism amiright and if the thing you love doing doesnt pay rent then you simply cannot devote your time and energy to it its a very privileged point of view to have that you should just do what makes you happy and youll be ok being able to do what you love is a privilege given to very few people and usually people who are privileged in the first place games like this make me happy i really appreciate your commentary jacksepticeye churchill anyone a lot of us really needed to hear this today i know i did thank you this video genuinely made me reflect on myself for a good moment the game was one for being so aesthetically pleasing but your comments after the last ending really had me thank you for sharing this video and the game most relating game everthis was so fkn good and really nice comments on all this shit love your videos thank you for what you do who said you dont care about the community anymore im gonna beat their ass i think you care even more now you take care about yourself and your health more you teach us to care about ourselves happy jack happy community you support us so much you do so much for charity youre always there for us and theres a time for us to be there for you to thank you for everything you did and you still do we love you jack and we believe in you always remember that if a person needs more sleep to function that person is sad like if this is u sean you are happier with your hair brown green hair made you miserable you dont have to dye it green yes all that money was raised but those fans who want you to do it shouldnt pressure you you do you fuck the people who demanded it i like how jack open ups its just relieving how you can relate and understand and also find a way for yourself thank you i was really suicidal but then i saw your vids you made me better then i went to a therapist and now im better thank you jack 530 that looks like bete noir from glitchtale i loved the old jack but you are the same person with feelings so i support you jack and i love the new you jacks chinese every like is love for how hard he tries v thank you so much man your talk touched my stone heart ya know i dont usually like videos but your talk brought

who committed suicide back in 2017 my life trully went to shit when that happened everyday i think of her everyday i wish i couldve helped her more sometimes i want to do it myself but as may said in the game doing that might bring other people around me a lot of pain i try to stay positive but something will remind me of my friend earlier or past experiences this video your speech meant a lot to me thank you sen for this i look up to you btw if you ever feel sad or depressed remember there are a lot of people who care about you out there i care and love you even though i dont know you i care and love you goodbye this comment section is so beautiful everyone is inspiring others or saying kind things to others helping others to feel better im not crying you are if you want to talk to anyone

and give it a try im not asking for a follow just leaving my instagram account here so that you can count on me when youre sad a dm and ill be virtually by your side cryinginnihongo me feels emotion i think this is my mental states final hurah before it shuts down this game is just a master piece idk why but when you finish it i dont feel any satysfaction i wish it could be a path in the game where you dont have to ignore goth gf and also help your friend after all everybody is worth it right there are 69 genders chromosomes has left the chat when sean started talking at 32 mins i started crying and because how he was saying that people hide it when they are down and how 2017 was the worst year of his life this year has been the worst for me so far and it just keeps going down hill and when he said that like we point him on not as an entertainer but as someone we kinda know i felt that i put him on if im having a rough day which is pretty much everyday but like i just put him on in the background if im doing school work and he always makes me smile and i never smile but sean makes me smile he pushes me to the brink where i am made to smile even on my worst days ill put him on even if i dont look at the screen and just lay there and cry just hearing him laugh helps me to have hope helps me to feel better so what i guess im trying to say is thankyou sean for everything for keeping me alive i would even have to say and these talks that you have with all of us feels like your actually talking right to me a you are the most amazing person jack you have conquered so many things and have inspired the true meaning of what to do in life you may not get this but just know that i care thank you poor jack has windows but has to navigate through a mac so many of the things you said touched so close to home i even started crying part way through the video lol its really helped motivate me to try and be just better and about reflecting back on me last year uh yea about that heh heh last year i was so much happier not saying i still am im just not as happy as i was this year ive developed such worse anxiety on days my last year self would have spend outside hanging out with friends i spend cooped up inside because im too scared of human interaction and i have gotten better on that now i try and look people in the eyes back when they talk to me and im starting to hangout with friends more often but its still not what it was this year ive also been on the verge of killing myself cutting and been in multiple incredibly depressive states the worse time that i was depressed and just really wanted to die was and i know it seems like such a stupid reason because an ex girlfriend had gotten someone right now i am going through this but my only friend that helps me and she showed me this video sen can you take a break i think that you need it you have been make entertainment for the people that watch you and i dont think that they will not care as long as you

who you want to be and inspiring us to be who we want to be man i really hope you get the message in these comments your struggles are not trivial its okay to want and need space we do care about you as a person because youtube is personal in a way movies and tv are not but those of us who are really your fans and really care will always understand that your a real person on the other end of this screen and that we should respect that part of the youtuber and audience relationship you have a responsibility not to abuse the position youve been given and we have a responsibility not to abuse what part of you we are given kinda like any relationship between people theirs gotta be boundarys screw anyone who cant understand that anyway lol this will get lost in a sea of comments that knowing

used to self harm nobody asked me if i was okay and when anyone saw my arms or thighs or stomach they would disassociate and call me awful slurs which only made me want to hurt myself worse i met my boyfriend who noticed i wore long sleeves every single day and eventually he saw what i was doing and he didnt leave like i was so terrified he would he sat me down and kissed every single scar and told me it was all going to be okay and talked to me kind of like this girl talked with may he went through my room with my permission and took all of the things i could self harm with and he stayed the night every single night so i wouldnt be alone a year later im doing so much better the point of me saying this to anyone reading this it gets better suicide doesnt take away the possibility of life getting worse it takes away the possibility of it getting better i know nobody is probably going to see this but i would like to say that we all have been through some dark times and i hate to admit it but i cried for most of this video so i can feel all the emotions i have been through some really hard times and am still going through them but i just really want to say i know things will get better for all the people who feel this way and i really wish i could just personally walk up to the people who need it and just hug them and say that everything is going to be just fine because

dont have to go on but hearing him talk and go on was so therapeutic i wish he never stopped talking jack thank you for existing talking to yourself may sound a bit weird but it has actually helped me when dark thoughts came i felt like the work was against me and that i was worthless but then i asked myself is that true though and then i remembered all of the positive things that have happened in my life that outnumber by a milestone all of the negatives and whoever you are someone out there cares about you and will help you get through it thank you jack just thank you dear sen thank you for this video but truly thank you for the message that you gave everyone at the end thank you so much for opening up and being yourself and expressing what its like to go through these tough times just like everyone does ive been there myself and continue to go through the same feelings in my life i have now climbed through the harder bits of my emotions and im trying to find my true passion in life as we speak i felt like every word and everything you express that you feel i have felt myself i want you to know that your channel is always and will forever be relevant in my life i have been dealing with depression heavily for the past few weeks and i feel like watching this video was perfect timing i know you must be under a lot of pressure of deadlines creating ideas and keeping your audience happy i understand that youre a human being and i think thats what ive loved about your channel for so many years since the days of watching you after im not even halfway through the video and i want to cry this is really hard to watch and at the same time its so painfully beautiful that its hard to look away life is hard there is no denying that living is a very difficult thing and sometimes it can get so overwhelming that you just dont know what to do and thats ok its ok to have rough days its ok to feel sad but when you do have those days you need to reach out to be people around you who care about you it might be hard to see but there are people out there who love you and would miss you so much if you werent here you are not insignificant you are not worthless the world would not be a better place without you in it the people in your life would not be better if you remove yourself from theirs reach out there will always be people who want to help you thank you sean for sharing a piece of yourself with us today 2017 was a rough one for me as well and youtube became a way for me to escape lets plays helped me get back a piece of myself that was gone thank you for being a part of that and for reminding us that we arent alone best wishes for your mental health and happiness who else cried while watching jack talk 3 thank you so much sean and yes you are the same sean just a little bit wiser having a history with what the second character went through suicidal thoughts and attempts it was inspiring especially today since i had a huge panic attack but with your help and the help of my best friend i got through keep it up friend thank you jack really needed that sean makes for a really good lesbo joycon boyz forever rest in peace etika i love your videos and who you are as person and this has helped me more then i thought it would thank you i really needed this video today thanks to this community and jack for being the wonderful people you guys are i appreciate you all jacks ted talk i dont know if you will ever see this sean but i have to put it out their i have felt that for a while but just like you i am a very positive happy bouncy boy but everything you have said is true you cant let people control over you and you cant let your thoughts control you but like you i have had those dark thoughts but sadly i dont like he help it also terrifies me so thats why i prefer going hunting and fishing and other outside stuff that helps me and also watching you of course so like i wanted to say is if you see this i appreciate it and thank you and if anyone ever needs help for this stuff please dont be me and get help please i dont know why but when he looked into the camera and said youre doing great keep believing in yourself it just really got to me i legitimately started crying does anyone actually use tumblr anymore how the hell did i go from the walking dead to jacksepticeye i got kinda teary while watching this i dont know why 2237 i can relate to this so much so about what you said jacksepticeye about not always knowing when someone is sad this is a poem i wrote based on real life experience tenth poem 61119 part 1 tears stream down her face bruises littering her body yet the ones that remain are the bruises of the heart she wants to go back to him change him love him yet he has broken her too many times with crying eyes she searches for an escape from her torment from her lover from her life she finds the answer with a friend the friend helped the best he could and the woman asked how he was so happy all the time and said that it seemed like he had no troubles at all giving a sad half smile he said we all have shadows even the ones that cast the most light the light just blinds out the shadows just because you cant see the shadows in the middle of the night does not mean they are not there it is simply hidden part 2 the friend woke up every morning laden with the grief of his grandfather worried a i love doing writing its amazing and makes me really feel happy but my parents always say i could never get a job if i did im really glad im still doing what im doing im now a successful writer with lots of nice books remember to always do what you love it can get you a nice job even if is doesnt seem like a good idea i had to gk through a similar experience with my friend but i couldnt be there for her since i moved i was devastated when i heard that she was gone but i use that hard time in my life to keep going on and making everyone who even talks to me always has a shoulder to cry on or to listen to them i use her as my motivation to protect everyone even those who are rude or mean to me from doing something that could change anyones world i wish no one has to go through the same thing i did but its hard to when we dont try to make the effort to try to reach out to those who are sad or dealing with hard things in life i am sorry this is so long but what i want to say is please just keep on going and reach out to others for anything that is bothering you or just find any help you may need stay strong and always know you are loved thanks so much for this video this made me feel better jack theres 2 more endings thank you jack you genuinely helped my quite a bit with this video thank you very much i love your chanel and ill never stop watching until you stop doing this im at my girlfreinds house and she tried to kill herself while i was there in her closet i played this game myself and it made me think of my own bad place i know everyone says it and im a stranger on the internet but you are worth it life is worth it i know it seems horrible and impossible to handle in the moment but theres always hope for the future never take the final step reach out for help asking for help doesnt make you weak or bothersome it makes you strong there are always people out there that care and if somehow someone runs across this and needs to talk im here how can people think he doesnt care about the community he spend like 20 to 30 minutes of this video just talking about how important it is to take care of yourself and if you can reply because i think its the closest way ill say thank you in person i watched this thinking itll be a fun game to watch before bed i didnt expect to break down in tears and take in everything sean said it really hit hard like very hard and just hearing him say all of this was so empowering im in a really dark place in the closet suffering horrible dysphoria and contemplating some things i shouldnt do yet hearing this was like a wake up call that maybe just maybe im actually not alone jack when you want to sniff rip etika one of the most influentual content creators ive ever watched i loved that dude he was so funny joycon boyz 4 life jack septic eye always makes my day so much brighter even when i think it cant get any brighter that day hes always there to make it even brighter do what you want to make you happy not what others want you to to make them happy about your successes hey jacki wanted to say how much how youve helped me through stuff and things that i couldnt tell people or tell themseeing this helped me feel the way i felt when i first saw your channel i feel that you have helped me achieve what ive loved and do still i actually do smithing i feel sometimes that ive helped no one in any way but youve changed that for me thank you sean that suicide gave me flashbacks to ddlc i wont let myself say anything to anyone i feel like i cant im a 6 male 16 yeard old im always trying to hype the mood around people im conferrable around so i feel like im just supposed to just walk it off ive been threw certain things to the point where i dont even feel like anyone will stay around long enough feel like i cant trust or care enough to tell anyony anything cause they wont be around long enough even my best friend has left i have bitch resting face very antisocial and nervous about everything i do i dont know what i want to do in life i think its truly cruel to be born in this world even putting this in the comments where no one will see it im hesitant to post why do i keep watching shit that fucks me up sen last year when you took a break ill admit i was disappointed for a second but then i was immensely happy i was so glad you were taking time for yourself id thought many times over the years of watching you since 2016 that you had to be tired and why didnt you take a break every day when i checked my feed and saw you hadnt posted i was glad you hadnt and i smiled over the thought of you doing something for yourself that day and being genuinely happy and that thought motivated me to do things for my happiness while you were gone like you were you will never be irrelevant or forgotten to me ive been hooked ever since my friend introduced me to you at a sleepover i didnt know why but little 14 12 year old me kept getting drawn back to the youtuber who could get me to smile with a loud intro and constant swears i cant go a day without watching a video even if its an old one that ive seen a hundred times ive watched you grow and evolve just as i have and im been rccomending this non stop so glad u played it now 3 lol i also love to send we bare bears to complete strangers this is gonna sound like im hating so dont get triggered i understand mental health is a serious issue so why do people fake it half of the people who commented say they have suicidal thoughts and nowadays people are faking that stuff just for attention i have had a fucked up life but im not gonna lie just to get noticed and to fit in or whatever now have a good day if you are having suicidal thoughts call 18002738255 or call me 5862987432 if you are scared to call them you know what sean youre a cool dude i needed this thank you i know im double commenting but i just wanted to say to jack that for some reason your words have really just like hit me and finally sunk in ive had so many people telling me all the stuff you said towards the end of your video but just having it come from you and it sounding so personal it really made a difference to me i dont even know if youll see this or if youll see my first comment but truly thank you cool im rcying anyone remember stampylonghead 3 thank you for your supportive thoughts sir sean huh i saw this game on steam yesterday but thought it was just another game guess im wrong somebody please help me wtf this game is making me get the feels i feel like each word thats said each songit makes me sad it was so heart warming when he was talking to may i played this on my own and it really touched mebecause gonna rant you can read it or not i used to have a friend who was really depressed and im really nice so i tried to help him in any shape or form but after a while i started to feel his depression and felt pressured because every time he would threaten himself i couldnt do anything about it since i was young and he was 10 years older than me it was a weird friendship i had with him and hes a grown man whos living like a teenager i eventually broke off our friendship and now my friends are in the same boat im in but they can handle depressing stuff way better than i could i left mainly because of my depression i think about myself now and then everyone says im the most positive person in their life and thats great but i always hit a wall in my life and it brings me down im going to college soon and ill be alone for the first time in my life alone meaning ill be away from family and frie thank you so much jack for being you i know what its like to feel insignificant and wanting it to end listening to what you said just made me cry but in a good way so thank you youre a beautiful soul im not crying youre crying the video is 999 thousand views 345 already hidden msg putting on a face to hide away the pain from others 4027 fucking eye sweat ive been thinking about a lot of heavy stuff lately about which parent i want to live with i cant choose between my mental healthbeing with my dad or my possible futuremy mom i had a breakdown a couple days ago for seemingly no reason i couldnt stop crying and hugging my dad i want to tell him everything without sounding like a blubbering mess its so hard though every time anything about what i want to talk about gets brought up even a little bit im brought to sobs and whimpers it gets a little easier every time though i hope i can power through it and let all of my thoughts and feelings out for a long while so i can clear my head and make a decision thank you to anyone who reads this all the way through and takes it seriously lol is this music from the game or robin jack what you had to say had me in tears just because of how much i relate to it my parents thought i was a really positive person everyone really did and until i cite myself they didnt really believe i was sad really deep down until i had a breakdown they didnt believe me and it sucks so thank you so much i appreciate you for being a light in my life and reminding me that im not alone when i watch jack play these very heart felt games that end with an amazing chat i feel like im taking to a big brother or a best friend robin prob being while editing this its okay we all cried were all here for each other but take a break and hang out with friends and family please i miss jack without a beard and green hair i guess its just me but i do miss the guy who would bring up my spirits now jack feels relatable and more empathetic both of them help me out i miss the other but i never knew i needed this one old videos are always there though one of my best friends at the time had depression i saw his meds and used it as a tool to get attension by cutting himself and then bragging about it afterwards it came to a state where it began to shock me and influence my mental health i had no choice but to distant myself from him if you have a friend like this distant yourselfconfront them without being hurtful dont let their problems take over your life and if they do end up killing themselves remember that it was not your fault they had is misserable life and tried to drag yours into it it will hurt but it will hurt more than when you put yourself through someone elss pain some people dont like hugs and thats perfectly ok never hurts to ask though my answers always gonna be yes as i am writing this this video has 999k views i just want to say congrats to view 1mil im really not trying to bother anyone but this was me at one point then my relationship was broken then i got back to my old self which is almost like may but a bit different but im trying to be better jack i know you wont see this post but all i want is to talk and be friends with you because you just helped me at 1110 at night and i hope you will help me i want to do what you do to help people i love you because you are here for me and you dont know my name i

sean it doesnt matter if you dont upload a shit ton of vids like you used to if theyre not yours at heart its not worth it as naive and selfish as i was hearing you comfort people all the time i never thought you would be the one who would need a safer distance with the craziness of the world im glad you went on a journey with this and seem to have found some answers i guess it would be stupid to tell you stop giving more than you can to our community because its not easy to measure up or fix as my favorite youtuber we should just ask you to be happy doing what you do youre a sincere caring guy and the perfect amount of cuckoo that has me watching without calling security dont ever feel guilty about letting us down with the numbers those hating you for it know nothing about hard work and

storm means youre fighting through a difficultly it usually happens when you tried to solve a problem when your options are exhausted or when youre facing emotional or mental struggles snow reflects emotional isolation with someone close in your life the game developers really did their research awesome also i found this in a dream interpretation book i own just before you read all of what im about to say its just somthing i need to get rid of so here we go i have never been in a good relationship with anyone but recently i found someone thats just so lovely that i feel different then i always been she is depressed and it hurts me in the worst ways that i cant even describe it with words its just all feelings the worst thing is that she does cut herself and i want to help but just cant and that is the worst feeling ever but it did get better because of me but everybody else just hurts her and ive gotten so close to her self as a person that she is just a part of my life she is there for me and im here for her but i have crush on her and i dont know what to do with that because i dont want to say it and lose her anyway thanks for reading this is not a cry for help its just self relief and thanks for reading and sorry for bad grammer english is not my language no matter what jack well be here for you even when you just want to talk about anything or nothing well be here to live without is cease to live fyodor dostoevsky i guess thank you i needed this i gently open the door mental health facilities at schools sometimes can be pretty awful just this year i got the confidence up to go talk to someone professional at my college about it because i was feeling depressed and was far away from my family they only met with me twice talking to me the first time and giving me a blood test the second time i never heard from them since then and it really seemed to me the person i was talking to just wanted me out of the room if one place doesnt work for you please try to contact a different place because this isnt a rare situation so im ten years old dont get the wrong idea i have wonderful family and friends but its just me im way ahead of my age sometimes i feel like people talk behind me think im perfect i just try i try so hard i scream at people that make me angry i cry i suck at piano i cut myself recently from my stupid friends im depressed and i tried to kill myself on multiple occasions when i was 78 but i have people who care people who are with me i have a best friend that i adore but if people think im perfect just follow my patterns look at my teeth all crooked and ugly disgusting that doesnt mean my voice is trash just hear my chirps and people see i dont have therapy and help yet but i just vent and throwbreak things art helps me i just try fuck yes ive played this game before and its fecking beautiful so happy you played this im sure this message will vanish into the ether but thank you powerful episode as someone who reads lots of books the lack of time to read books really hit me also to anyone who sees this i recommend reading ursula vernont k kingfisher because they have amazing books this is happening to me but i dont have that friend to help me go through it so i do some stuff like gaming that give that little push and also jack helped me a lot if it wasnt for him i wouldnt be hear and this video also gave a push thanks sean like so jack can see 3250 for the beginning the personality of this girl reminds me of my exfucken kills me holy shit the one thing that i like about jack is that he funny bit mostly he sometimes gets real and reaches out to people who have a bad day and cheers them up so thank jack for being kind and always cheering me and everyone who is in a badsad mood im constantly depressed when i got into college i had no friends no one left from high school didnt know anyone new i had so much time to reflect on my past and everything ive been through and all that made my depression worsen i denied i was depressed then my siblings left home school got harder the boy i liked already had a girl everything was just hurting i cried a lot i cried alone then a friend i had met talked to me and i opened up to him more than i ever had opened to anyone over the following five years i have told him things ive never told anyone else he became my rock he made me change the way i viewed the world and myself i went from hating myself to loving myself admitting that i have good points he saved my life weve been together now for three years i still get depressed i still have days where i dont want to do anything it takes a lot of effort to do what i want to do but i am in a much better place now because someone cared someo jack you make me happy i am suicidal and you touched my heart i thank you for rethinking my life and who i will hurt you made me cry because you are so important to so many people and me because what you said touched so many hearts and helped so many people in so many ways tomorrow all ill do is just look at the trees and think of being happy in life and me enjoying life i thank you for what you said you are such a great person and thats hard to find bc life is shit people are shit and you are different and that makes me and a billion people who are not at their best times rn happy i cant thank you enough ps ive been subscribed to you since before you died your hair green and you are amazing for who you are and you probably wont see it but i hope you do keep up the good work love ya i literally just found your channel in the last two days and you have made such a huge difference thank you i mean it your honest and sincere and funny and when it comes down to it you and your videos hit home wither you reviewing a game or talking about real life i think that you are amazing and i know this might sound weird but im really happy that you have made time for you to just be you everyone needs their own space and privacy at times and that includes youtubers anyway i just wanted to let you know that even though i just found your channel youve made a real difference i literally cried bc i feel like this and have to not worry about me and how i feel and worry about this special person in my life and ive been there for her more then anyone and still she sometimes feel like she cant talk to me and its hard worrying about someone else when you have to make sure youre ok and it gets to a point where im numb and i dont open up to people and even now i feel like no one gonna read this but its hard you have to make sure youre and also make sure the person you love is ok and i value life more and im only 15 but i overdose and still i wish i wouldve just died when that happened and it sucks bc a lot of thing got to me this past year i just dont know what to do and its hard bc she does cut herself and tells me she loves me and that shes sorry for everything its just she blames herself for everything and i dont like seeing her cry but when i do i always comfort her and just hold her and tell her how amazing she is and how much i love this was really helpful because im 18 about to be an auntie i have adhd and im self diagnosed depressed since i was 15 ive been lying to my adhd doctor about being depressed because a family member was in the room or i was in denial so hearing this from san is very helpful for me to reach out a little thank you omg i hear shiloh in the music sometimes you just need to take time to be yourself we always go out our way to please everyone and forget to make our self happy we are the ones who make us happy dont let anyone define your worth know to yourself we are all unique humans and as long as we do what we love and focus on our own happiness and being then its worth while always have faith in yourself never let anyone pull you down cause in this day and age there are people that dont want you to succeed but dont let them get into you head focus on being you and be the best you that you can be nothing lasts forever for todays troubles are tomorrows experiences and we grow and evolve from mistakes in life and things do get better no matter the situation is all about perspective have a good outlook and know that anything is possible the only person not allowing you to chase your dreams is you dont hold yourself back and know your own value and you can do anything ok sohow is it your fault ur roomie kills themselves u have to uproot your life and social life to help a roommate and miss out on a potential relationship but if you skip your life and date and cater to your roommate they livethats pretty damn selfish and i say this as someone whos been suicidal for 20 years and still am its not on you to try to save someone else especially if they exhibit no signs unless you press them on it and they dont seek out help call me evil or a bitch but its true what are you supposed to be a mind reader and put your life on hold so you can help someone else not only that now the roommate is stuck thinking its their fault and blame themselves for it for life you can help them occasionally but the fact of the matter is your actions wont change someones depression therapy and medication will help im not saying dont be a good friend or ignore someone whos depressed but at the same time it isnt right to just ignore your own l ahh watching this video brought up so many emotions i felt it deep inside me when each one of the characters spoke i really know the feeling of being desperate feeling lonely and lost at the same time when i saw someone sad or depressed i just couldnt let them feel that its a hard condition so many people feeling down everyday i wish i could hug each and everyone to make them feel a little better thank you so much for bringing this out so many times as you have done youre my favorite person because you get so close to us you reach out to help you make a difference around the world you are amazing you helped me throughout my lowest point and everyday i think about the things you show like pma charities and these kind of videos about mental healthcare thank you it really means a lot thank u seani love uu have helped me through hard times he didnt high five in the beginning the art style in this game is absolutely gorgeous i feel like having everything doesnt make anything easy im supposed to be happy ive got a family and a home not everyone has that but for some reason i just feel empty no drive to do anything with my life my moms a day drinker and cant commit to anything my dads a workaholic and never has time for me and my brother i mean i get along alright with him but hes just too good for me i feel like i cant talk to him cause id just be bothering him my brother has always been the star of this dysfunctional family of mine and takes all the attention for himself so i dont get that much attention at home and to top it all of i dont really have any friends and the only decent one i have lives far far away and just wants to kill herself i dont know what id do without her so to get attention i sometimes exaggerate a lot a lot a lot the only thing that makes me feel accepted is being pitied and the happiness when it finally does come goes shortly after if someone needs someone to talk to ill try my absolute best to talk to you about things ugh i felt everything may was saying tears came and came fast i was in a horrible place not too long ago and have finally finally come to a place i can love myself and my surroundings i can get out of bed early and be productive which doesnt sound like much but with depression the little things sometimes mean everything it gets better not perfect sometimes not even amazing but better you got this were always here for you jack i know you need you time but know that if u need to pull a random person to the side to vent im here for u deep breaths and one day at the time also very nice message at the end man this vid hit real different when i watchplay games i always see that world through the main characters eyes but i couldnt help but see myself as may ive had these conversations ive had these thoughts ive done things shes done even things as simple as leaving my door closed i used to be super open but as i began to shut down i stopped talking and i spent entire days in my room without any human contact the feeling of not living up to what your parents want they want some ceo or amazing athlete but thats not what i can give them im obsessed with pursuing my passion for theatre and its exhausting this game has managed to create an immensely relatable character and i love it 3346 jack looks like hes crying im just now watching but that doesnt mean i dont get to say that you are all worth it you are all beautiful people and you are loved it breaks my heart to know that so many people are suffering each day from the demons in their head i know how hard it can be to try and deal with life everyday you just need to take it day by day and reach out to someone for help if anyone is in the need to talk im always here seriously i respond very quickly like super speedy you dont even know like so fast lol but yeah dont be afraid to reach out to anybody anybody okay i love you mwah okay so i watched it very powerful and emotional stuff i myself live with anxiety some days itll be absolutely okay and then the next it wont be i wake up and i feel it weighing on my chest my stomach my head to where i feel like i need to get up and do something or else i wont succeed in my life feeling like i have to do something right then and there but you just need to re oh trust me i have recording issues all the time to where i actually broke my computer in anger and then i just gave up for weeks then months then two years later and i come back and out of no where i have to move im going homeless again and my dad is shitting on me from another state i move with him i let youtube go again for another year i work just add miserable and i come back and then i lose my job i got depressed i gave up on everything even eating for 3 weeks then i we moved again rinse and fucking repeat and here i am again except something is different i didnt come back because i am starting to understand that i needed time trying to do something you love becomes a chore when all you want to do is die i mean i planned on coming back and but once i got fired as literal wage slave puppet being a yes man busting add everyday and again we must move except now im not depressed upset oh beyond but im not depressed because i want to do what i love and when the ending to this video it is very much needed for the world if jack didnt have a face cam then the game would have so many good wallpapers ya know there is so many things i want to say but im just gonna say this instead thank you sen thank you so much this hole video hit so close to home at the end i felt like he was speaking to my soul wow im sobbing i have some depression which sucks because im constantly sad and ive thought about cutting and worse which i would rather not get into i dont really talk about it because i dont want to bother anyonebut seanjack you are the reason i m not more depressed thank you haha can relate to this so much watching this at 1 am was a very surreal experience but i enjoyed it have a nice day i relate to may so much she is very much like me i never harmed myself but i considered it i love to write and just feel like everyday is just boring and daunting i want time to quickly happen and fast forward so i can be happy your videos honestly help me so much you make me laugh and also speak about relatable topics that i really appreciate i love how when jack plays these games he plays the game for like thirty minutes and spends 20 mins giving us advice about about life my heart ouch its crazy how i feel i have a closer bond between sean and me then my friends or personal life idk i guess im just a weird person but honestly this made me think a lot and appreciate sean even more than i already do so thanks sean for being a great role model and just inspiring us to do better and be a better person i honestly will remember this gameplayvideo forever well try too bc you never know but yeaaa dang when i had these problems i wished i had a bro like that im glad i got to this video exactly what i needed to hear thanks so much for the message jack 3 i thought this was going to be a sad breaking news vid before i clicked on it dear jack i relate to may so much when you saw her in the mirror and her face was messed up i knew i knew because i remember looking into the mirror and knowing who it was but at the same time i didnt it was me and it wasnt i wasnt suicidal i selfharmed and wanted to run away i was tired everyday was the same the weekends i just slept so i wouldnt have to deal with life some things made me happy but that happiness never really lasted but there was the light in the darkness my pets and you you and a few other youtubers made me laugh so hard that i would cry from it and i wasnt crying from sadness anymore i wasnt alone anymore i felt like i could escape and finally be happy again in the past few months i reverted back to this mentality after i failed college sure my family life was better but i felt like i couldnt talk for the crippling fear of the possible shame i would face then i would watch you and i would feel okay for awhile you and o if any one needs to talk and you have the houseparty app hit me up my name is lil frenchfry i know silly name im here for anyone even tho im a stranger if you need to talk or open up im lgbt and a 13 year old female thx bro i needed that sean thank you man u are an amazing person if any one says u arent dont listen to them man one last thank u sean u r amazing wheres the green hair sean thank you man for all that u do and u making this video im a 11 12 year old kid and im going through this and for all of u who feel like no one cares about ur all alone youre are not sure im a 11 year old kid and i know im not the best one to say this but i did and im glad i did anyone who is suicidal or depressed dont commit suicide ok friends and family will care dont do it ive been in situations like this on both sides of the story and it has almost killed me but videos like this have helped me thank you sean i needed to hear this my goal in life is really bad and before you ask or say its not bad my goal in life is legit to do nothing him talking about how he has issues brought something up in my mind that i havent thought about in a while and it really makes me hate myself in some way i used to go on google plus when i was in high school haha i know no one used that but i did and when i was there i would talk to people just to talk just to see how they were feeling and just to talk them out of the things that they might do i did it because that is what made me happy that is what sometimes made the difference in their lives to help them keep going and i did that for a really long time but unfortunately at some point i became depressed as well and i cant stop thinking about this because in doing so by walking away from the people that i used to help and used to comfort every single day on my chromebook at school i lost someone that was very dear to me i lost someone that was my best friend and i would talk to every day to make him happy but since i let go i forgot about him pull i remember wanting a lot of the youtubers i follow to go back to their old selves until i watched their old videos and found that i myself had outgrown them distance matters totally agree and your channels not dying of course now i dont know your analytics but having close to 1million viewers per video thats hecking great and so what if there were more than that in the past your reach is still so great and youve taken care of yourself firstwhich is what is most important in your life thanks for sticking around jacksean what you do keeps many people grounded thanks jack for this video both the game itself and you just talking through that stuff at the end ive been kind of going through a rough patch but this helped me through some of those thoughts keep doing you if you can love you man i wish i was a girl ngl edit wow i really felt the golden child part except there was nothing i found happiness in as a kid like she did with writing except late night minecraft at least i was blissfully ignorant of my problems as a kid 3212 get those tears out jack i meant 3300 and this is why i love sean thank you sean yes the first time ive gotten a game and played it before a popular youtuber thank you im glad i sat through what you said afterwords it helps us this video really hits home i want to get therapy because im having trouble with family and motivation people dont take me seriously because im too young to be depressed im 11 btw and when i used to get therapy she said i may have a minor anorexia problem but when i was about to go into a specialist about it my mom ran out of money and i have to quit going when im old enough im going to go work to help my mom and dads financial situation i use drawing to let out my words and feelings without people looking down at me as an attention seeker just know that im there for you and i love you i know thats cliche and i usually hate seeing messages and comments like this but i dont want people to go through what i am seek help get help when you can please for all of us you have the most beautiful eyes thank you for the talk at the end i needed that everyone watching this if you are struggling with depression whatever you do whatever you want to accomplish if you have doubts about where you will get in life and if you will even get anywhere just know that you can accomplish anything the picture alone is powerful 1322 the bloody scissors and how the main character isnt looking at her and how her face is missing missed messages is such a poetic sad metaphor you should literally start a podcast im not gonna lie i like those wordy run offs about actual issues thats you or others have damn jack you the realest jack thank you for always caring about your fans people me i am so happy i find you when i needed you you helped me i felt so fucked up at the time right now this is what i needed i am going through quite a tough time right now and i hide it a lot so thank you sean for being such a inspirational person thank you you jack have been like a big brother to me always caring and just very caring and loving towards me i feel like i have depression but i know i dont im just very sad sometimes you always helped me through my tough times though my friends always say oh whats wrong and i say nothing when everything is going on i dont like what i look like but jack you have helped me like myself thank you sean 3 people have committed suicide at my school during my time there its a horrible thing even though i didnt know any of them i cried even when i had no connections to them the first they brought in therapy dogs we didnt have any classes and just got the chance to talk to each other the second there were therapy dogs for the people that wanted them and they set up a room for people to go the rest of the day went on as normal the third barely anyone paid attention other than the people that the person knew it goes to show that we are used to it it isnt considered as big of a tragedy as it actually is everyone matters every single person ive had those thoughts too im sure most if not everyone has but as jack said there is always a way out the three people at my school had friends to talk to and family right there be like jack and reach out if you have those thoughts even if it isnt serious it can become serious really quick love yourself for whoe hey sen i dont know if you will read this but could you please tell me some way for me to send you a letter i have some things that i wanted to say to you privately and i dont want to span your empresarial email box if anyone else in the comments also know one way to get in contact with jack i would appreciate the help in case youre wondering the letter is a thank you letter for everything jack has done for me and i dont want to make it public im dealing with this feeling with my friends so yeah im kinda ok is it bad that i know every song in this game because ive listened to countless videos saying that the songs will cure my depression and anxiety study girl has been there for us man im gonna be honest man sometimes i think about suicide then i think about all my friends family and my gf who would miss me and sometimes i feel kinda depressed this game is a reminder about why i try to keep reaching out to others even though its hard sometimes and takes energy you never know when someone just needs a friend who can listen if it helps someone its all worth it that first ending is too real thank you for being who you are 2017 was the worst year for me i went through so many family issues and trauma i cut myself a lot and plotted out how i would kill myself and was very close to doing it then i met someone perfect for me who i was able to open up to they were my help my friend slowly turning into something more weve been together now for 2 years and ive never been happier please dont be scared or ashamed to open up to a friend a family member a trusted person there is always someone out there who loves you and wants to help you im gonna be honest man ive been playing video games for like 5 years with the basically actually going outside only when i had football practice and football games or other things and ive recently been going outside and hanging out with my friends talking about how we missed the times we were always outside man growing up sucks i felt this but i dont speak when it came to the rant i felt it ive been through this and i have felt this way awhile and these videos are good and your like a personal therapist i dont i have to pay for cause im broke when sen starting talking i thought i wasnt going to cry but 7 minutes later i started having the memories of everything that has happened in the past and this year i realized that im not who the other people bullies said i was and this game reminds me of my past kind of i feel like if just this one guy funds out how i really feel about him and he told me that he will never love like me and if he said that i felt i wouldnt be able to go on i would just surrender but when i think about all of that it feels like it would happen even if i didnt tell him i cant believe im commenting this to people someone i dont even truly know i should stop before i tell everyone you everything jesus my life sucks as it is i dont need my video games making feel like shit too this video has also hit hard in some spots for me when im super upset i will talk to my closest friends and watch the videos of my fav youtubers to cheer myself up you guys always been able to make me smile and laugh when im feeling down all the funniness and hardcore rage for me atleast is enough to keep the dark thoughts away and i always appreciate the videos you guys are able to put up for us thank you sean i want you to know that you werent running on a tangent i really needed to hear this youve been my favorite youtuber for years and this is part of the reason why thank you again youre honestly like my hero envisions you in a green septic eye cape flying in the wind behind you haha youre the best

newgrounds 2006 holy heck this hit home so hard when i was struggling in college with depression and it got to the point where i felt the need to reach out i told my advisor about the feelings i was feeling the dark thoughts and everything i didnt try to go to the campus therapist or other resources because i was foolish and didnt think i warranted their attention what i got for reaching out was being pulled aside by two campus police officers and sat down where i essentially was grilled youre not going to do anything stupid right and more or less told that my private college didnt want a student suicide to reflect badly on their reputation it felt like bad copworse cop and made me completely shut down i ended up leaving that school but not before i told the schools student run chapter of to write love on her arms about how very poorly the situation was handled i dont know if anything came of it i really hope it did i needed to hear that talk today thank you mr sean woah when did jack become a warlock no hate looks cool lol thank you jack props to jack for being the realest man on youtube as a person who has finally gotten out of that rut and depression i cant tell you how much i appreciate this game i have been both may and the friend whos there to help there were times that i truly missed huge red flags from my friends and they have missed huge ones when i was very low too this game goes through different outcomes and i love the way they talked to each other in jacks second attempt it was very healthy and a muchneeded conversation that hug saves lives and ive both experienced it and seen it with others sometimes the absolute best thing you can do is just be there for them you dont have to say anything just hug it saves lives my friend she cuts herself and thinks about dying and u playing this made me think that i can help her thank u jack for be a great person this game and the thumbnail looks like a big fbi open up oh jeez i just realized on the title screen theyre sitting on a puddle of blood with siscors on the side i have a friend that yost to cut herself she sadly died thanks sean i did sean already not do this one i just want to say that everyone here is an amazing person all of you guys are wonderful with many stories to tell everyone here at least have been through stuff in their life no matter how big or small and im sorry you had to go through such things but just know that despite anything someone out there loves and cares about you family friends heck even you next door neighbor someone would miss you i may not know anyone here nor do i think ill be able to meet you i probably wont get to shake your hand or hug you or kiss you but just know i love you man may and i have the same problem it feels like every day when my mom and i argue about what im gonna do in the future i love writing and singing but my mom tells me that i wont get anywhere she was trying to force me into nursing health being the only subject that i failed in school and she still is i keep telling her that if i have a problem doing it or that i dont enjoy it then i cant do it because i would feel trapped in doing something that im unpassionate and mentally unable to do how many other people have this problem thank you jack i really needed this jack youre parents arent like mays right you sounded really sad when you corrected your video game instead of game mistake when you were reading around 23 minutescome to think of it have they ever been on the channel im really concerned now i dont know if ive even had depression but i think i did the middle of this school year i was so sad because life was so repetitive and i was tired for no reason i stopped watching sean and it ready screwed with me but i started watching him again when i moved 3 months ago and im glad i did i felt like no one wanted to be in my life i knew it wasnt true but i really felt my mind that it was it messed with my mind so much that it became so consistent that i felt so tired exhaustingly tired once i slept 17 hours a day and i was still tired yes i know about over sleeping it used to take 2 and a half hours to get tired sleep wise it still takes me about 2 hours to sleep but i think im happy maybe hopefully did you see the trans flag jacksepticeye im glad that you are able to inform people that depression is actually a problem that anyone can have and that there not looking for attention because people need to know that there is always a brighter side ahead of them even if its something small there has been so many times where depression hit me but i just hid it and ignored it but all im trying to say is thank you for bringing something serious out into the open to inform everyone that even depression can hit the most happiest of people hugs tight thank you for sharing with us jack i love you just the way you are and i hope you love yourself just as much it is perfectly okay to ramble this hit really close to home for me and jack you have helped me through so much not even words can say how much i just want to say thank you wow seans message at the end there seriously hit home im constantly bombarded by the feeling that everyone else my age are all doing these wonderful things and getting so far and here i am accomplishing absolutely nothing and going nowhere with my life at the surface level obviously i know that this isnt the case but my stupid brain just dwells on those kind of thoughts and feelings and jesus is it draining i guess its just nice to hear that others feel the same sort of thing that sense of being in a rut as everyone else flies on past you im going to attempt to keep my thoughts in my own lane as sean puts it i really like that concept quit comparing myself to others and just focus on personal growth i have been so thankful that i found this channel this community each and every day for the past 34 years sean has brought happiness and peace to my mind and soul on so many occasions and i can never thank him enough for that this is another one of thos soundtrack needs to be on spotify what happened to the online girl in the second run through did she commit suicide too god if thats true thats the one thing i hate about life you cannot save everyone sean you are a beautiful human being everyone changes its part of life and no matter what you do make sure you are happy sean we are all so proud of how much you have grown you have value and thank you for all the talks i kinda relate to them and they do boost my morale by the way if you do need to take another break you take that break we love you and thank you for making your hilarious and meaningful videos also if anybody else completely reads this comment remember everyone has a lot of value including yourself your just a fucking awesome person and grateful for the little things and just a good guy and thats the main reason i watch your videos the first conversation she has with may on the bed hella relatable i dont think about it seriously though thank you for this video sean wow make a song already btw 3 shit happens jack im so so glad that you are here regardless of what others think its hard to be thought of as constantly positive sometimes i love you and your videos getting pushed over the edge relying on technology and the internet and even regular interactions fucking suck sometimes i hate people like jaystation if you saw the vid and i am super duper grateful that youre still here im gonna stop crying while i type this but if you ever feel down i would be honored to talk with you thanks for the videos that i could not live without may is so me my favorite meme is the spongebob one with patrick i like these down to earth talks because this just makes me happy thanks sean this will get lost in the comments but i felt the need to say this i relate heavily to the story in this game i met a girl who was in mays position and was ripping at the seams she was falling apart and falling into bad habits and dark thoughts and i tried my hardest to be like the main character in this story i supported her through everything and she began healing a few years later i myself became very depressed and stared to have dark thoughts and she was right there for me in return every step of the way we became very close and now we are both in such better places in our lives she is my absolute best friend and i wouldnt trade anything for her i pulled her out of her dark place and she held my hand through mine 6 years later and not a day has gone by where i havent talked to her we speak every day whether it be through text or something else we both have grown up into strong adults ive fallen head over heels in love with her since day one she just doesn no you reverso carde that wasnt funny priceless advise for free i needed this thank you thats sweet jack im happy your not depressed anymore thank you so much not only are you one of the most positive influencers in the youtube gaming community youre also very open and real with your fans a lot of times nowadays because of the way social media is affecting our society it makes it hard for fans to separate the creator from their person and they almost forget that they are people but when you talk about these kinds of things it helps at least me to remember that fact and you are a wonderful public speaker and thank you so much for all that you do nothing can fix you but you wow you are very relatable regardless of background i know why ive subscribed to you 3247 that whole rant made me actually sob sean i want you to know that you can complain about anything and we will think that its important at least i will everything that you say is important i will say that i see you both as an entertainer and a person everybody mattersif you need to let some stuff off of your chest just know that were here for you im not saying that you have to im just saying that you have us you have changed a lotbut in the greatest way possible i noticed that in past videos like when you had green hair you looked more sad then now you look healthier mentally and physically im not saying that you didnt look mentally and physically healthy back then but you have looked way happier since you have youre wonderful girlfriend and that you are taking more breaks thank you for being a happier person and for being so inspiring thank you jack i know that youll probably never see this but i wanted to put this out there sean has helped me through so much in my life and he is the reason i went to counseling and it helped me so much and i always used to feel like sean was just there to make me laugh but more recently with videos like this i realize how much he helped me and i wanted to say thank to sean and this community please do theres this girl by the same developer uwu if i knew what i loved doing id be doing it by now fuck that is the most relatable shit in this entire video for me i can relate to a lot of the things in this video but i care more about helping other people be happy than helping myself be happy making other people happy whether they are close friends or random strangers its the only thing that really brings me happiness its these type of videos that i like to watch but i shouldnt watch them if anyone needs help or just someone to be there to listen im here for anyone nobody has to be alone in this world thank you sean you are an amazing person you have provided me with so much positive energy in the past and now this video the support that you have given me is incredible whenever im in what i jokingly like to call one of my little depressed bitch phases instead of moping around doing nothing and talking to no one i can always feel better after watching your videos i know you probably wont see this but thank you for everything i hope you continue to make great vids thanks thank you sean jack if you need a break from youtube then by all means take one were all here for you and we wont forget you who else remebers the game he talked about his grandma like if u remeber if god was a woman things wouldnt be so bad in this world its just great to see sean all grown up since ive been watching his videos for years and i remember watching the first fnaf it was just great back then and it still is great we are so proud of how much you have gained jacksepticeye we all love you jack thank you for sharing what you have of yourself in general and your own past struggles and breaking that cultural taboo on the topic of mental health its a great encouragement for us all to exercise empathy and compassion for one another to recognize and ask for help when needed if youre struggling and you need to hear this today youre not alone and you are loved please talk about your depression xo by the way what happend to sally face thank you you little speech made my day jack thank you this is why youtube is the best platform honestly it seems like sean is a good friend by his answers in this game this hit me hard it really did i about cried it reminded me of how im dealing with things in life and how others are too i hope that people with depression and self harm all that stuff i hope that they get help the best help i want people how are going throw this so they dont feel like they dont belong here if someone does feel like that you have a purpose in life you matter you really do im saying this is because ive been throw this and im still struggling with it i didnt reach out for help i just kept it to myself i hope that people reach out for help and not wind up being severely depressed like i did but im trying to get better but im still being talked down too but i really do hope that people get really really good help and not wind up how i did sorry if im repeating stuff but im trying to be as honest as i can be right now this actually made me sort of open up thank you jacksepticeye i really love hearing youtubers talking about such real issues like self esteem and feeling the need for validation via social media putting too much into work and burning out things like that are what make your fans really see how much you care about them i want you to take care of yourself your health and wellbeing is more important than our appetite for content take time breathe positive mental attitude and carry on you wonderful gaelic gladiator the beginning convos are literally me and my gf this game definitely has relatable situations especially the saying youre okfine when youre really not and you just dont want to bother anyone or put your burdens on them ive had dark thoughts and ive harmed myself but just listening to my fav music aka bts and watching youtube has helped my friends also help ive been to therapy but it didnt really help however everyone is different just know youre not alone you can do this 3 im glad that you stepped back a little i think i need to do that too i live through the internet and find that im never actually living my own life in the moment and developing myself or just enjoying life 439 fob memes help me breathe thanks game this hit me in a personal and a emotional waythx for the vids you make your 2017 was my 2018 and you opening up about yours gave me the courage to the same because i honestly felt like i didnt have the right to feel the way that i did because there were so many others who had it worse yet i was tired and miserable i found it difficult to validate my feelings because im normally logical and my feelings turbulent and lacking sense but i still felt it so keenly i like how much you have changed because you do seem much happier and everyone needs boundaries its not healthy to burn the candle at both ends cherish those private moments with those closest to you i agree that we dont need to know everything honestly sen i am so thankful for you and all you do someone handed you that snow shovel and once you used it instead of putting it in the shed you constantly loan it out to people like me so we can also dig ourselves out you are so genuine and i wouldnt want to see you b any other way unless it was onwards and upwards thank you so much for your words of encouragement i really needed them now i want a jack real talk livestream in some point jacks one of the most honest youtubers out there me personally i tried to commint suicide a bunch of times i mean i bunch of times i hanged my self the rope broke tried to hang myselfr again the wood that i tied the rope too broke so i said to myself i was on my knees i said god give me sign why wont you just end me now i few hours later i found a video on my recommended page and it led me to a video jack made i forgot what it was called then after watching it i was crying so this is the sign you give me thank you after that i tried to build myself up together again im still building myself even now but im gettin there and im just a highschool student some people might find this annoying im ok with it this got me so hard i related to this game so much and it really made me cry it put into words what i felt and didnt understand thank you jack for putting this out there and sharing your own experiences it helped me a lot i smell a jk rowling man this world is so broken we keep our eyes on the negative and overlooking all positives looking for this satisfying life in ourselves and ignoring the people around us we see people but we just see their outer shell the true person is hidden behind the skin and flesh of our body hiding all this pain and agony till it pushes us off the edge we build walls without noticing but even the ones you think you know best could be completely different inside we never know how someone truly is anymore we could consider helping broken people but one day of hardship could lead them to an early grave its horrifying and heartbreaking living in a society so lost on a emotional and mental level its nothing new but its just growing people need to see there is good if you look past your assumptions and hard judgment of other people anyone can save a life all it takes is a bit of time to consider others and a bit of persistence life isnt short we just forget too quick dont let good for you sean i always will enjoy your videos i cant say i understand what you were going through but ranting is always good i will always listen because i know it helps i dont ever enjoy you because you have a lot of subscribers its because i generally enjoy your content sean has helped me through so many downs in my life this video made me cry a lot thankyou sean we love you typical depressed teenager hugs for anybody sad scrolling through the comments or anybody who wants a hug i focused on university and delayed my travel back home my best friend was alone and in a dark place he left me a voice message and killed himself i knew i had to be at his side yet i allowed society to push me aside from him because you need a title to be someone i lost the only person that truly understood me and stuck to my side since i was 9 for the sake of a stupid title no career is worth it no title will give you back the ones you love focus on your friends make sure youre all okay youll get other chances to success at a test but you will never be able to replace those who go while youre focused solely on it the real ones are the ones who actually remember your birthday like when they say happy bday whatever ye name is its honestly a good feeling i want you to play more of this game is super good thank you also we know you care we care about you and want you to live for yourself and enjoy your life everyone has a light inside them that transcends darkness and although that light can dim at times that light is still brighter than the darkest dark so he broke up with me why are you looking up i want to cry but my foundation was forty eight dollars this helped me a lot thank you sean i watch youtube for laughs and go outside for fun and only use snapchat because my service is off every other social media is a no go yeah i agree my 2018 was the worst i wish that year was skipped it took my actual happy self and threw it out and my fake happy self just replaced it it was the worst i hated it my whole life crumbled it just jumped my life started being horrible i wanted to sleep in but woke up early for no reason i just always was tired never wanted to get up even when i needed i just did i put on my fake smile and got outside i wasnt able to see my friends because i moved and i was one of the only children there but youtube and laying down just cleared my brain like i cant wait to see if this is a series this video was so relatable to me im young and i have had those thoughts especially involving my family but i just think about how awesome the future might be and thats what helps me the art in this game oh my god my eyes are tearing up beautiful oh wow i want to hug may im crying right now this feels so much like some of the situations im in now if you are like this just know you are not a burden in any way trust me im not lying to make you feel better its the truth i love you all stay alive out there even just for me a random youtube commenter thank you everything would become jacksepticeye and there would be no sean mclouglin omg that hit me so hard thank you sean this means alot to me this honestly helped me a lot i was in a really dark place while watching this and now im crying because now i see people actually care so thank you this helped this game helped you helped thank you jack it means the world to me wow just thank you thank you sean i havent got much to say because you worded everything perfectly this game hit me big time i always feel guilty when i dont do something and break down and i feel like im at a cross roads and i think i need to end it im living but not actually really but then i thought of my nan and fianc and couldnt stand to leave them i have these thoughts most days but im fighting i want you to keep fighting too and anyone who reads this too you can get thru this its going to be hard but its going to be so worth it sending love to all my fighters 425 tell me not that dude looked like danny sexbang sometimes i feel like ill never be able to grow up i feel like ill never be able to be happy i feel like the real me is trapped and cant escape its suffocating i cant breathe i feel like crying for seemingly no reason although i do know the reason a loss of hope is a loss of yourself you feel empty and you feel like youve always been like that its not true though i used to never even consider hurting myself i thought it was laughable to assert id ever do such a thing i never thought that the emotional pain would become so great that i had to have a release no matter what it takes its not like that today i cherish that like a golden chalice from colonel sanders floating down from valhalla i dont think about what i want for my birthday anymore sometimes i dont even feel hungry what matters is that i know that i dont care if im happy i dont judge myself when i laugh or smile i can experience things and still have creativity and curiosity im stil i gently open the door 832 omg the main character is ariana grande whenever the day comes when i finally meet you can i hug you maybe for a good 30 seconds unless thats too long then maybe just 10 these types of videos where you just talk to us help me reflect on myself for one reason or another and i just really wanna hug you dont know when but when that time comes can i thanks jack i needed that i have a real bad feeling that the roommate is going to kill herself poor sweetheart please let me be wrong crosses fingers i say my problems to my so considered best friend but all she said was that she didnt want to listen to my problems like she didnt care about me and my problems i always listen to her if she has problems i try to help as much as i can but she didnt do the same for me i stopped talking to her for a while sean i really love listening to you talk and when you go on talking it makes me feel warm inside and want to just curl up in a ball and listen to your voice for hours hey sean thank you song in the back when he talks to may is well not only may but in most part is xxxtenaction losing interest slowed its made by shiloh dynasty someone ln the comments told me lmao 20 minutes in and i relate to may i had the worst experience with mental health professionals resources at school my first therapist sucked as wellnot listening to anything i had to say just typing common maybe on the first session but he continued only talked to downplay what i was saying second therapist was fine for awhile but always seemed a bit too tired to talk to me onto my third one now and i might be put on antidepressants soon depression and anxiety suckwill update with more positive note when im done watching as a writer who also feels like they are going nowhere this hit home there are soooo many other writers but i feel like that is my only skill and the only thing i truly love so when i think i suck at it i fall apart im still learning to put myself together and i will say i am a mega hypocrite as my recurring thoughts dont match what im going to say nextbut please stay live fight because you belong here i appreciate your honesty and i believe everything you have mentioned may have helped people take a look at how much your mental health really matters i love to hear you speak and reflect on your own personal experiences through playing a game like this one its very cool and i think people can relate to this a lot i know i did thanks for being such a positive influence and such an amazing human being in general your amazing and we all appreciate you being here for us your doing a great job jack sean xoxo thank u i dont really know the jack of 2017 since i dont think that i was part of the community then but i definitely prefer current jack because hes a happy jack thank you for being so transparent that is so important you do a great job not i would need to tall you that but i do understand what mean we all have are moments in life that why im saying think you for what you do your the best in my opinion and even thou i kind of hate say you video make day old or new 13 minutes in and im already starting to cry i have only had one year of my life that i was very sad i followed everyones directions acted kind and disciplined but i was caging myself and had no one i trusted enough to talk to my fathers death only made it so much worse it wasnt even his death that really hurt it was that my family didnt care that he was gone i was the only one who seemed to care once i discovered youtubers i love i related to them and they brightened my life inspired me although my friends made me laugh and smile youtubers did the things my family and friends couldnt do sean dont worry about being irrelevant you know everyone who genuinely likes you for you will always come back no matter how long the hiatus now i feel like im talking more about your vids but thats not what i mean im trying to say that you should live your life we dont have to be a part of it if you stopped posting vids all we would want to know is if your ok and besides youll never be forgotten your history is saved for all eternity on youtube be who you want whether thats being a youtuber or a regular person without any internet fame like i said you do you and remember always keep a pma positive mental attitude i think the games title is beautiful like it could be missed as a verb or an adjective i can relate to may heavily writing playing video games and being depressed and lonely thanks man i came here to watch a game but i got more satisfaction from him talking the the game play this is the most useful than my own friends ugh this is beautiful the game and the things that were said after thank you sean im saving this video to my youtube downloads never to be deleted ill come back to this to cry and smile while contemplating at life sean your not jackseptic eye jack is sean i just noticed you have a beard its ok to feel sad sometimes you dont have to constantly try to be an internet celebrity if you need to take a few days off do it if you need a week or two do it if you need a month for god sakes just do it your personal life is yours thats why its called a personal life personally see what i did there i would stay away from all social media apparently youtube isnt considered social media so idk except for reddit because memes you just do you and do whatever makes you happy and dont forget to bang laugh this may seem like a trivial point but i loved that sean took a moment to readjust his seating position for two seconds i loved it so much because it gave me the time for everything that he said to set in and for me to internalize it sometimes when someone is saying something hits and pieces can be lost because im trying to take in all this information but it only takes a second or two to calm and collect yourself jacksepticeye that second play through is so wholesome i almost cried i work full time at a domestic violence shelter and i work part time at a rape crisis center i volunteer on the weekends on a suicide hotline i hope you all understand that their are people that want and care about you please reach out even if its too me a stranger there are resources there are options successful recovery is possible thank you sean for bringing some attention to this topic and for sharing i personally struggle with this stuff and i know how hard it can be ive been so low before that i just didnt want out i just gave up luckily i somehow made it thanks to a few friends it also helps to realize that everone elses opinions dont really matter you should focus on making yourself happy do what you need to for you because you do matter hell im even here for you if you need me life is hard and unforgiving sometimes the saddest people smile the brightest because they dont want anyone else to go through what they did it always makes me happy when people bring awareness to mental health you did great sean you always do recently ive been just laying down on my bed and listening to music box covers and its so nice to do that and just get 10 minutes because sometimes my life just feels so hectic and everyone is always asking me to do this and that and i dont get any time to myself the only other time i get to be alone is when i walk my dog and also listen to music and just stay outside with her for 20 minutes sometimes its just nice to be able to recollect let go and relax i just want to say that professionals truly do help in the past ive really struggled with my mental health but recently i went through something that made the past look minuscule and talking with even a counselor at school helped me immensely im late to the party with this channel but i found it right at that time and it has been able to distract me from it beyond the usual stupid joy because it does feel supportive honor the boundary between a professional and their community and value the messages still here and be glad we have the content we do good luck to everyone is it weird this was like the same way me and my gf met and how we got together by just like fucking sending images like that and then going on calls and shit lmao i really appreciate when sean talks about these things hes honestly helped me a lot when i felt alone and hopeless by making me laugh and getting ny mind off stuff i love when he gets real i can tell it comes from a place of understanding to everyone else struggling out there be strong and dont give up try everything else before giving up that fall out boy meme is everything i have to admit im only watching this now and i did a vlog for yesterday mentioning how i dont really care about the numbers or the fact i dont get money from youtube or twitch i do it cause its fun its an outlet for me from rl issues of i get money wehew bonus but not the reason for it i do it care i enjoy it and 6 months into it i got an amazing comment and that alone made me feel liek i was doing something for people if you know what i mean and also thank you for being there for us sen i watch both your and marks vids when im down and they inspire me to do what i do i dont usually comment but i watched this last night this morning i got a call that one of my good friends went away last night because he was just done with life today i couldnt help but keep thinking about the messages i missed but thank i needed that speech in the end i love you sean i am so happy you got out of that mind set i am sad like you i have to have someone to say im doing a good job or i feel no one knows what i exist but you hlp me thank you when you gotta yee haw but feeling yee naw i cried watching this video because i can relatei sometimes even tried to attempt suicide but having people who you can talk to helps this one hit close to home for me my girlfriend is suicidal and has an unhealthy relationship with their parents theyre unable to get professional help at the moment i believe theyre getting better but every day im just a little scared i might lose them i do the best i can to help and be a supportive girlfriend but im no therapist and ive got my own shit to deal with too its a little stressful but i love them and theyre worth it they make me happier even if they refuse to believe it its terrifying to think that some day i could be just a little too late i know this has nothing to do with the story of the game but that background music is a so good just wanted to thank you for doing videos like these i have battled with depression suicide attempt and cut up my arms and when you do these videos and talk about it is really uplifting to me and i am sure to many others and i just wanted to thank you and i hope you see this thankd again and keep making the good content thanks for sharing this with us i really needed to hear this today as i have had a tough pride weekend and this was just the thing i needed to start the week thanks for being the amazing gaelic gladiator that you are and keep up the good work take time for yourself and enjoy life i have grown more as a person since i found you a few years ago your channel means a lot and although i missed you charity live stream i can say thanks for showing support for me and the rest of the lgbtq community by donating to the trevor project with all of the amazing support ive seen from the community this weekend im actually so moved with joy that im actually trying to hold back tears while writing this i cant put it in to words how much i appreciate you and what you do thanks jack go raibh maith agat even the word hopeless isnt void of hope there is always someone something to be your hope even if you dont know it love yourself respect yourself and be yourself jack finishes motivational speech youtube roblox ad very happy to see the awareness this brings of course the game is grim but thats the importance of it always love your videos edit after getting to the end of your video i wanna let you know that its awesome how open you are you are more than an entertainer youre an amazing person and do great thing for people and the world your charity streams your personality your interaction with the community it all means so much thank you for doing what you do 3 oh sean you are just so breathtaking this is exactly what i needed thanks bud your the best the worst part about going through this is the fact that you feel more alone the more you go into that deep dark hole i still have suicidal thoughts because most of my school life even though i have been i school for 8 years i have been bullied and harassed about my weight and sexuality people call me fat and gay even though im bi and the only supportive people i have are my best friend my girlfriend and my close close family i cry most of the time im at school alone and i have a long drop in my backyard so i think about going further into that dark deep hole i am getting better with the help of my girlfriend but i still have suicidle thought sometimes but for all of you in that dark hole dont go further it may be enticing but i have a friend that went into the deep part of that hole and im sad because i think i might go into that deep part as well but i hopefully wont and watch this comment or my channel because if i changes to a completely black orb well then im no long i actually had a friend who liked to cut and one day she was doing it really deep so i was worried she was going to kill herself so me and another friend called the cops cause i didnt know what to do and i was texting her to tell me whats wrong then she told me that it was my fault that she got anorexia because after that she stopped eating i had told her that i was trying to get her help and it obviously didnt work because you dont want to put the effort into getting better i reminded her that she had people who love and care about her and she took that and stopped being my friend since i helped her sorry this is a paragraph damn im crying this is too real to be on the internet dame thes game dame it hite me in the fills amd the mimrys of the past i at a time was the heler and the cuter but i was given hop by my sweetist sicko and i hellt hre in the rufist times i love thrs game ps jack ware vose is like the most sweet irich creem i wish my friends were open to me like this i always notice some people i know have a problem but they never talk about it or want to the channel a d jse arent dying were evolving growing and making head on new paths 3 jack i am 50 years old and for the last 30 years i spent it worrying about what people thought of me and you know it drove me insane i spent the last 30 years living a life of anxiety and depression now i am studying and teaching myself meditation techniques as well as shamanism shamans are aboriginal healers that use herbs and flowers to help illness and how to become one with nature and i am more calm and i feel that i am part of mother earth and not fighting against her btw at 30 you are still just a pup i spend my life pitting myself its an endless cycle which becomes comfortable weird i know butyeahh why did this video hit to close to me some of the topics got me in the feels this isnt just certain days this is every day i cant go a single day without feeling sad or angry uncontrollably i love how sean calls characters them instead of it when he doesnt know the gender of the character its just a small thing that makes me happy edit i do not give a flying fuck what you think about genders it was just a nice comment i shared if youre trying to be an ass on this nice video then go on somewhere unless that was back round music from jack i can hear a slowed down version of one of shiloh dynastys vine thingys that ending started making my eyes water heh i think i needed to hear that tbh its sad to think that i almost put someone through that i was almost that person on telling the other through a note not to come in jack helped me not feel alone in this world i have gotten better thanks to cutting toxic ppl out and reconnecting w a now very close friend i have nightmares sometimes and im scared of talking about it history class is hard bc of hanging topics i have to leave class bc of it but i dont think of kms anymore and i love life no not 29 its 48 the fact this has almost a million views and less than 1k dislikes is amazing we love you jack i am so grateful to get to watch your growth over the last few years thank you for your maturity and loving kindness to all of us as your community we are so proud of you 3 thank you for talking about this while having a crappy day myself im very glad that i watched this video when i did why tf am i may and why did sean talking at the end make me silently cry why tf am i may and why did sean talking at the end make me silently cry i made the mistake of going into this volume at 100 now i have no ears your vids do so much jackyboi even the shortest of your vids help dont ever let those comments get you my man just keep being you sorry guys my eyes are just sweating wow i never thought about leaving a note like that i always worry thinking about who would find me if i ever did that i was so stressed that everything was getting me anxious or angry and i was on the verge of breaking down over little things and taking a break from social media really helps because i logged off of snap for 2 weeks and i felt so much more refreshed and calm and i felt important i truly enjoyed watching this video recently my mind has been clouded by the world around me and you helped me through that i thank you so much jack gee thanks for making me cry 3 wait i thought everyone felt like may felt but when i started to go to counseling i found out that not everyone felt or thought like may and myself thoughtfelt after finding that out i quite honestly felt worse about myself feeling as if i wasnt normal different this is something i still struggle with i take many different types of antidepressants the past few have only made me feel worse i just recently got a different one but i havent gotten it yet im hoping that it will actually help counseling doesnt really help most of the stuff my counselor makes me do i find pointless like writing things i like about myself grounding techniques these kind of things i dont find help me but thats okay i cant really get out of it since i signed a 1 year contract i have severe anxiety and mild depression i only get treated for the anxiety since i decided not to get treated for depression if i has a choice i wouldve decided to not get treated for either iv awww jack mate dont worry about others im actually actively looking to help any one despite my own small issues im fine tho by the time i have helped someone else i forget all my issues thank you so much so many people see me as happy but ever since my friend committed suicide last thanksgiving i just im not me i try to smile but its forced i want to cry but i feel like i cant i feel so numb but thank you so much san thank you so so much so much lately part of me just wants to join him but i know it will hurt my grandpa we recently lost my grandma and i know he cant bury me too but thank you so much for helping me with this this video followed me all day while i sank deeper and deeper into my head i eventually caved and clicked on the video i am very happy that this video wouldnt leave me alone now hmmm my problems being hills hmm oh well i have a small mountain oh well other people have bigger mountains then me i can wait lets go find some others being left by my 3year boyfriend even if we just celebrated our anniversary last 14th hurt myself last night tried drinking medicines

blocked me on all socmed and thats when i felt depressed i know this could be way off topic about the video i know you guys dont know me but i hope you can pray for me and seeing sens message on the comments it means a lot sorry i feel so alone i dont quite remember who said it but i remember watching a video that said those thoughts that you have are like the seasons or something like that they

who had friends in year 7 despite being a year 11 super friendly then i thought tho if i was to die what effect would i have dying i thought long and hard even if i was depressed if i died through suicide i would drag others down with me i am usually a closed book about this stuff but its 5 past 2 in the morning im full of energy love your self farewell does anyone notice she looks like marzia the one with the pink hair i didnt know how much i needed to hear this until i did please no body yell at me this is a joke my friend told me its relatable to 1914 in the video if someone telks you

for doing what you can for so many people so proud of you jack really hit the feels remember your not alone we all love you and we would be lost without you omg at 1904 my headphones glitched out and it made when jack read i kinda just want to die sound really creepy i always feel like everyday is the same day and i get depressed a lot and have suicidal thoughts there is no other place i could share this without showing my emotions edit a few days ago i genuinely felt like i was gonna suicide i felt scared empty but filled with darkness and depression i really need a friend like that someone i could share my emotions with and someone who could help me with it this vid helped though two months ago my friend killed himself he was always so happy and laughing but i guess some people in this world just didnt couldnt understand him i cried while watching you play this game because it makes me think about what would have happened if i could just go back and talk to him or just say hey maybe that would have done something but idk if anyone reads this i just want to say that you are amazing and perfect in every way if you are gay lesbian trans like my friend was or if you are just really confused you shouldnt feel alone if there are aholes who make you feel alone then you should ether ignore them or stand up to them if its your friends making you feel alone then tell them and if they dont change then get better fing friends if its your family then try your best to make them understand and if they dont then you have to understand that sometimes the family youre born with isnt meant to be your true family sometimes friends are the best fa i watched him play the game and i was fine but as soon as he started talking to the audience addressing us i ended up crying ah priorities this man deserves the world we love you no matter what xoxoxoxoox 3 well thats cute i knew i should have clicked off i feel that jack taking time for himself has improved his content and him as a person but i think thats like when amy said that she felt none of her problems anymore while looking at the sky and i think its because in a world of constant noise and with so much to take in that looking at something simple yet beautiful gives you and your mind a break we all love you bro most chinese prefer their child to be an engineer or doctor just asking any opinion please let me

on those thoughts that were loudest but were monsters why does it say junji itos name in the credits at 3202 he didnt help make this game did he or was he just an inspiration its not clear in the

dont need to give us everything most of us just want you to be happy you will always stay relevant for the right people as long as youre doing what you love 3 such a good game and such a good video i like you jack because youre able to take time for yourself you understand mental illness even if you havent been in the worst case scenario it doesnt matter everyone feels pain differently for anyone reading this it does get better and i know it sounds so fake and overused but thats because its true i suffered from a lot of things in this video and so did my friends and recover wont happen right away but keep fighting i know its so so hard but youll get to a place youre happy with eventually i did and i thought i never would as someone who deals with not only depression but also anxiety that im fine statement is indeed reflex i feel no one wants to hear the truth they want to hear im fine so they can go on with their life i was planing on dying with in the next week but ive decided that im not going to thank you sean thank you i never actually realized how much i needed to hear something like this sean i appreciate you for growing and as you grow i know that we will grow as well because you help us get through the hard times thank you so much i often feel like i can see part of my path that i really want to walk like i really really want to but i keep on standing on the same spot and just cant move like im stuck to the ground my whole body stiff like im not a human but a puppet maybe i want to move forward maybe just babystepsbut i cant maybe its this tiredness i really related to im tired every day i wake up do things i dont want to do go to sleep and repeat it even when i dont do the things i should do i feel bad because i dont to them i really feel like spiralling in this mindset of always feeling bad about stuff feeling angry about a lot of things and especially me i wouldnt say im suicidalwhenever i think about it i kinda become selfish and say that theres so freaking much i want to experience that i couldnt ever cut it short and maybe i actually find that light at the end of the tunnel even though i dont to anything really to go further in there its a f hey jack know thats not your real name but eeeeeeeeeeeh i just wanted to say i have been watching your videos for at least 6 years now the whole reason why i started watching youtube was to get away from life and find little out lets of joy you were the main one i was going through some rough times and now i am finally coming out the other side with the girl of my dreams with me i cried a little at the second ending because it was what she did for me she talks with me all the time we never run out of things to say and if either of us need to we can talk together about this kind of stuff and help each other she is my everything and i just wanted to say thank you for helping me all those years ago to helping me find a way to live through the pain and to a brighter place thank you matt i love when jack plays these types of games because i can feel like im actually talking to someone i havent experienced depression at some high degree but feeling tired about everything and feeling lost because i cant find what i want to do and be happy with it has been a real problem of mine ive always been yearning for affirmation so i know that im doing something right which got to a point that ive been doing everything with 90 of me thinking will they appreciate this and that thank you so much jack youve been such a great part of my life since 2016 you really are the best and well be here for you this really really helped me and i didnt even know i needed it thank you so much me 5 minutes in shit its doki doki literature club all over again i genuinely sent my friends voice messages and paragraphs while crying 3130 uno reverse this is the most inspiring video ever thank you why is half the video just jack talking lol your happiness means more to us than your uploads you are a human with needs and wants we must respect that the fsct youre happier makes me happier i actually prefer this happier persona of you im so glad youre taking your time and living your best life thats what matters most 3 i love you no matter what you do and value your happiness im glad youre okay i watch your videos because no one does not pay attention to me or put my feelings down and watching your videos makes me happy keep doing what you are doing if you liked this you are supporting me and my feelings aww sean you mean a lot more than you know to a lot of people so thankyou i have friends which are in a very bad time and i can find so much common points in your words i dont know how to say it butthanks youre a wonderful man and youre making me so happy keep going in whatever you will do oh and im french so its possible that i made some errors in my message thisis my last message ti my fav yt i love u so muchbbye sean thank you so much for everything you do even the things no one gets to see youve helped me become a better person over the few years ive been watching and its been great thank you jack we bear bears i played this game like a week or two ago and i loved it even though i get a tinsy bit triggered by self harm the main character is actually me though haha jack ive noticed that lately youve been more chill and different than you were years ago and i know im not the only one however you seem so much happier recently and youve been making me happy with just how much more real you seem in your videos do you what you need to do to be happy jack disconnect however much you need to do we love and support you its the least we all can do after all youve done for us i felt really moved by what jack was saying about what he went through in the past recently on my own way way smaller scale social media ive felt very disconnected because id always used my blog as a place to be open and honest when i cant a lot of the time in my real life but then i dated broke up with someone who i followed and who followed me suddenly it was really inappropriate to be honest and open with my small following of people and it did my head in a bit i just ended up feeling like there was no place i could express myself and be understood its taken me a long time to figure out i dont need people to understand my feelings for my feelings to be real and to matter im slowly feeling able to connect with people more again without it being fake or halfhearted while keeping the boundary in my mind of knowing if they dont understand or believe me thats okay because i know what i feel all this time channels like jacks and somehow especially ja i desire to depart and be with christ which is better by far but it is more necessary for you that i remain in the body philippians 12324 wow jack now thats some deep stuff i have thought of things like this before like im not depressed or anything but i have thought of things like what im going to do in life what career will i go into and will i figure things out and have a good life ya to be honest though i think if everyone just holds on and do what they want to do and do what makes them happy i think they will find what they have been looking for in life also your da best jack homosex homosex hamburger sean i admit that ive gotten distant with the channel and just getting caught up with myself but this video today caught me up to reality and reminded me why i like you as a person so much you keep it grounded you allow us to talk about these taboo thoughts and its just therapeutic for me thank you damn i needed this we love you jack for who you are no matter what we will always be here for you if you wish to take a break just take it we will always be here for you we will still be hre when you get back we love you and we appreciate you for who you are thank you for being more then just an entertainer thank you for being a friend amd for talking amd socializing with us like not al lthe youtubers do these days the night before watching this i was honestly contemplating self harm but this video and one of my closest friends helped me even after crying like a 5 year old i feel better one day my thoughts might get the better of me but for now im ok thank you sean 3 sometimes you gotta be there for your friends when they need youi wasnt there for one of my friends just because my phone was deadso thats why i have my phone on her charger all the time now no one probably cares but i feel like im the only real person or im in some sick torturous simulation and i dont know why its weird sometimes i just burst out in sadness every time i think about it and i dont tell any one because i think it sounds selfish for some reason and i guess im just putting this out their so i can know if other people feel like this but if you did read this thanks yo as a fellow irish i wanted to say thanks i always watched you as a child im 15 still a child i know but you have made my day countless of times and i would always watch your vids like ever day you are amazing honestly you probably wont see this but i just wanted to say thanks i have my issues i just dont feel complete but i dont feel like dieing but not alive i work and i go to school i kinda just stay in the background i dont wanna bother anyone ive tried daiting and i just hurt the people who are trying to help it turns out i make them unstable too and thats why i look after them thats why i only have like 4 friends ig but im still here always will be in the shadow im just lost ig idk what to do but life is what it is and ill just hope it gets better or ill die looking god damnit sean youre supposed to be a video game channel not a therapist but jesus dude youre so kind this really struck a chord with me thank you jack ive been a little obsessed because of migraines lately not chronic but still theyre scary for me because of aura and its got to the point lately where ive just wanted to hide myself away with my phone and never do anything in case i did get a migraine it honestly felt like all my plans and all my ideas fell short because of them i am going to a doctor of course to see if i can get something to help but i now think i can honestly go through with my plans anyway i can move to the city get a part time job there and enjoy my hobbies too a lot of elements in this game actually struck with me too wanting to write but for now managing doctor who fan fiction not really knowing what i want out of life its actually refreshing to find a game that got me as well as this did i may not know exactly what i want but i think now im a bit closer to understanding first things first is to quit the poisonous job im in now and i relate to this so much that im considering suicide goodbye world i guess im really lonely i really need to hear this my brain has been so nosie lately and lately its been drowning me i always bottle up all my feelings bec i always feel like no one cares or that i cant burden people with who i am i dont tell anyone how i feel not my mom not my dad not even my counsler i just want to know what true happiness feels again with out all these pills i dont really have a point to this comment i just needed to get it out thank you jack i really needed to hear this this advice that you gave here is really good advice just thank you i will never look at your old videos the same way and will always ask myself if u enjoyed every previous video that u made i knew it was only a matter of time till you played this game i played it a few days ago fell in love with the art style didnt expect what was to come at all as someone who has struggled with thoughts and suicidal tendencies for a long time i personally appreciate creators like you and others playing these games i feel it helps to normalize talking about this stuff so thanks sean thanks sean youre doing great i dont know wats deeper this game or jack some people may disagree with this but i say sadness can sometimes be a good thing since it shows you know what its like to be happy i love you jack you mean the world to me and youre absolutely a wonderful person when you need a break to just look at the sky do it just remember to listen to your own advice ok we care about you too for me i care about you more than i care about myself you make me so happy youre such a positive influence in my life and you keep me motivated to continue animating because i love to even when im not successful doing certain things i count on your videos to make me laugh through my dull unmotivated sadness i just love you so much sean really youre like family to me im going to say one random word that will either get many likes or dislikes spoon im in health and social care rn to later go psychology and this as ive helped people already with problems i kinda can relate to this game i really love the artstyle as well and the kind of lo fi hip hop music is really fitting amazing game played by an amazing guy wondagurl and x bro i criedddddd aw jack dont cry were here for youno matter what happens no matter what your going through you have been a great inspiration for this community and its completely fair that you should want to keep parts of your personal life to yourself your elves are here even for the smallest thing youre someone that has made me laugh and smile on days when its too hard for me to even get outta bed on days when i dont wanna eatdont wanna movedont wanna talki know that i can turn on a jacksepticeye video or gamegrumps video or whatever and just get a laugh and realize that maybeits not so bad i mean there are people like you out there who are so amazing and outgoing and relatable and just so kindyou deserve to feel ok you deserve to have someone who makes you feel likemaybe things will be ok i hope youre ok on those worst daysi hope you know that even though we are not in on everything thats going onwe are still here and we still love every i cried for the last 20 minutes of the video straight i feel like i could identify as main characters the player and may ive been trying to help the people around me as much as possible and have also been struggeling with depression myself for almost half a year now i am in therapy but i still feel terrible quite often and having both views together in one place really tore me apart trying to empathize with people as much as possible asking them about about their sorrows yet at the same time suffering myself without people really noticing at times or trying to help me but only partially succeeding and this video inspired me to just write down a little bit therapist jack here to help your troubles hipster memey gay trans aesthetic look they made me into a video game would be cool to have a jackselticeye movie who is with me i needed to hear the end of this video and i needed to see someone who yes changed but changed for the better because change can be so scary when you cant even find solid ground so its good to be reminded that changing doesnt mean for the worst change just means leaving where you used to be and for some thats exactly what they need thank you for being the push i needed now i just have to take those steps towards a better me i needed this thank you so much 3832 really got to me you can hear in his voice how hard it is to utter those words im no stranger to loss of loved ones giving you the feeling that your whole life is derailed and theres nothing that could possibly fix it but while life may still not feel like the pleasure it once was yet reaching out for help still remains the best thing ive done to this day im so incredibly glad jacksan could bring up the courage too seek for help when needed and if anyone reading this feels like theyre in the same boat may you be granted the strenght to be able to do so aswell dont try sitting it out on your own no one deserves that 3130 hands down best part of the video you are awesome just for being yourself oh man you blow my mind youre the best person ever youve saved more people than you think all these years youve taught so much to us and we cant thank you enough jack the lifesaver

going through these feelings though we may be strangers to each other i am sincere in saying this your life has meaning and though it may seem like no one cares there is always at least one person who does that one person who is willing to listen because in the end you are loved his words at the end feel like a hug that i needed for a long time thank you sean all this goes to show the impact you

watching him and still helps me to this day whenever i need to stop and think he may be loud and wild at times but he reminds me that life will try to put you down and yes life will hurt like a bitch but you need to get up and push it aside and be you that even though i make mistakes and feel like shit that i should be happy and live life cause negativity isnt worth it he may be an entertainer and

nothing aww man you made me cry in the end love you sean great to hear youre in a better mental state now 3 i had saved this video to my watch later list and now that ive watched it i dont regret having it saved im glad i was able to watch this its these types of things that really make me think about my choices and my emotions and i realise that that theres a lot i still need to do to better myself although i may feel super flawed i know i can eventually get to the point where i can be okay and where i will feel okay and for that sean i deeply appreciate you because you help me realise that youre such a beautiful human being and you deserve the best i hope that you can be the best and happiest you because you deserve it jack your the best and this game is the best so you both make

need to take time from everything keep up the good work your great almost took my life yesterday this video saved my life thanks you sean this really hit me man at the beginning i was like oh wow those are my flags and by the end of it i was thinking how much i relate to both of the characters especially may and even sean seans talk at the end really got me it was really inspiring but also made me really emotional at the same time i can relate in how im very bubbly and seem happy most of the time but im also going through a lot in my head and its hard sometimes well a lot of times really there are so many of us who go through so much every day and so little of us believe in or love ourselves but i want all of you to know that i believe in you and i love you guys even if we dont know each other i know you can get through this finding your way to the path of love and belief in yourself is very hard but one day you will get there its a long winding path but its very much worth it i hope you all are as okay as you can be reach out to someone to talk with dont hold it all in everything you said about social media and mental wellbeing i and im sure a lot more people completely understand heck i used to have a youtube channel back in 2014 and i deleted it because i felt so pressured to upload so much so that my hobby was starting to become a chore and years later im trying to get it up and running again but mentally im just not ready in the future ill be more prepared with less things to worry about a bit more spare time so i can do things for myself again bless you and

every word you said i love you this community loves you and you are such a light in this world god has created many things and you my friend have shown people light through this preach speech may the light you share guide those who are in need brother i was thinking today that if you sometimes get stuck in a level and the only way out is to quit the game but now you teached me that theres walk through you sayed before that there will always be someone out there for you and i believed it but i couldnt find anyone and thought it was be but now i realized that it wont be easy and i realized that you are someone that can help me like i have lovely friends and family i love them and they love me but i couldnt talk to anyone of them because no one was understanding me but now your words in this video really helped me understand and i know i dont know you and i know im one in millions and you probably arent even gonna see this but i get so much emotional support from your channel and im posting this because i thought youd be happy to know that youre still helping people all around the world you helped a weird moody teen that gave up on everything so now im just gonna put my phone

favorite youtuber you get me trough tough times like exams or depression thank you wow this video got me to be open more with the people who care about me thank u jacksepticeye it was nice to just stop and listen your talks always fill me with emotion but also weirdly enough releases some of my emotions i feel as your words are better put then i could ever use them or describe feelings with them it feels as if you speak for me sometimes it honestly takes weights off my shoulders when you talk about these things because it helps me realize that i am not the only one that there is always a way out of it and i can do it seeing you who ive looked up to for years now go through something like this takes away the veil and shows that its common spoopy scary door notes are great i think u are better to watch now jack i know that you probably will never read this many people probably wont but thank you for what you said its good to know that people have felt the same thing im feeling now ive been going through somethings recently and my mental state hasnt been doing the best so thank you for everything youve said it really hit home damn my week is full of suicidal things right now its like the internet knows whats going on with me because two weeks ago my 27 year old brother has killed himself in our garden i live with my parents he came back from america to the netherlands because he had some problems as a thirteen year old i just thought that he had some alcohol issues cuz my parents told me so but one day i heard him throwing up in the bathroom and i immediately went downstairs to check on him my brother then said that he was sick mentally sick i froze for a moment because i was shocked he told me the truth and explained that he attempted to kill himself with alcohol and drugs in the states but his wife stopped him from doing that luckily my parents were asking for immediate help at multiple doctors but they said that my brother will get help at the 16th of july which was already too late bro panicked and hyperventilated and my mum tried to calm him down and put him in his bed at t 3805 speach dude am i looking in some kind of mirror that describes my life right now help this is sad and all but its corn time i love you jack thank you always put you first the ones that care about you will understand and be there for you no matter what and we want whats best for you youre so valuable to us thank you for talking to us awww yeah trans flag in the background protag is a trans girl confirmed youre brilliant man thanks for this video especially your talk at the end of it theyre words of positivity and healing well done for real he started tearing up near 3000 i feel you i havent watched youre videos in years to tell you the truth my life has been difficult recently with school and work i just wanted to say that even if you dont read this or know i exist thank you for being yourself it inspires other people to do the same i want to take a moment to say this even though it may get lost in your many messages from these amazing followers thank you thank you for being so open and honest to the world hearing you talk about your own experiences really hit home with me and i relate so much to the tiredness and emptiness being drained so much that you cant even be bothered by things you love i hope you know that your words will effect someone who needs to hear themyou will be helping a tired soul 3 youre amazing and it means so much that youre here being you being honest this game is so emotional the art style is so amazing

better we love you and want you to be healthy and happy and if that means you need to change then you should after all thats what it means to be alive changing and growing who actually watched until the end i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear im not crying i swear i lied im crying i came to watch you play a beautiful game i stayed because your talk was the best thing that could have happened today thank you for pouring your heart out and being so open and honest and yes its true we all feel that way at some points in our lifes but again thank you for reminding us that there is more out there that we are more than a monitor and a keyboard much love to you and everyone reading this this gives my heart mixed emotions the stars are always there but they shine the brightest in the dark i just thought of the vee is calling thing seeing this i wish etika could have played this game before he passed hell i wish he could have just seen this video and jacks speech at the end maybe it would have got him thinking and reconsider ending his life etika really needed to hear these words and unfortunately i dont think anyone told him because they were too busy thinking everything was a joke and clowning him instead of treating him like a human being that desperately needed help but wasnt getting nobody pushed him off the bridge but everyone who laughed at him had a hand in guiding him to it admittedly these games hit too close to home for me and i cant watch but i think its interesting listening to your thoughts on health and i think its important for everyone to acknowledge when they need a break i believe everyone needs to disconnect from social media and reconnect with the world it does a wonder for your mental health im a fan of the jacksepticeye channel as majority of people here are but there needs to be a separation for sean to be who he is and have that privacy in his own life people need to understand how much work goes into having a channel and a successful channel at that and how all consuming it can be lets all look after ourself s a bit more jacksepticeye has matured so much rip childish jackaboy what if the things that i like doing hurts me life nowadays the game suicide is really painful two years ago my aunt and grandma took their lives each one month apart it hurt it still does until then i couldnt comprehend the effect it would have to have that happen to someone it hurts so bad since then ive done my best to help friends through it if i can i cant imagine losing them too jack does his speach or whatever you want to call it me oh shit bruh i feel ya i really do ive always noticed that celebrity like people like you tubers and actors artists and bands they always show a good chunk of their personal life its difficult and scary i want to be a musician and make music so damn good that the world hears about it but its scary to think that its a portion of me out there for the world to listen to its scary that you guys give out so much to us even if its like 5 of the real you some days im kinda of a mess anyway up and down for reasons and no reason at the end of the day there are people in this world who will help anyone and watching you make videos every day both for fun and to be someone who people can see as a form of friend or someone to be there its amazing and exhausting simple things are out in the open for you guys and it stops you from living or being yourself without either judgement or influence and i feel bad for people not just people like you tubers but also artist etc its scary to think you have nothing even it actually took me several years to get the help i needed it wasnt till a few years ago that i actually got help after i tried to starve myself to death i had talked with a friend of mine at the time telling them what was going on and they immediately called 911 i still get depressed from time to time and cry it out but ive been much happier then how i used to be its really hard ive always found it difficult to share my emotions because other peoples feelings mean more to me i feel like my emotions and problems are so miniscule and irrelevant so i hide them and try to help others with theirs and sometimes i break down its really embarrassing and i always apologize profusely for it but then they tell me its okay to feel my feelings and im like what thats new im told that im allowed to cry but its so hard when i know other people are hurting more than me i cant complain or be upset because then ill be a pansy who doesnt know how to deal with a little disappointment and my friend was like you should see a therapist but i cant my problems arent that bad but ill be fine because i always have to be fine i work through it eventually i went on a tangent but it all boils down to the fact that were all in the same boat sen we want to be there to help you as much as you have helped us as how is jack so funny yet supportive and very nice hes like a wise old ninja warrior fuck i love this so much i realle needed to hear some of these words the music is shiloh holy shit its scary how much the roommates situation describes mine ending up with terrible work ethic because you never had to put much effort in knowing that the things you would want to do dont seem to count and wont make any money being depressed and annoying your parents because you waste your time on the internet instead of learning fuck the only difference is im not actively suicidal edit i also agree it does seem way too specific to not be influenced by real life when ever sean talks about this i feel so emotional i like the way you are now i am happy you are taking care of your self trigger warning at the end of march i attempted suicide by overdosing on my antidepressants i was taken to the hospital and thankfully im okay now but it honestly opened my eyes and made me realize how depressed i was and just felt like nothing was going right and just so tired but afterwards now im better obviously i still have depression and some days are better than others but i have things to look forward to im in college now i even started up a youtube channel i am so glad i made it through because it could have ended horribly for me if youre going through incredibly dark times know that you are not alone i know it feels like you have no one and no one cares but i promise you someone does if you need someone to talk to dm me on twitter brittany3245 your life is beautiful and so are you i just realised that may and the protagonist are sitting on blood and beside may are bloody scissors start of video warning triggering moments me oh shit i dont feel comfortable already jacks first ending may is dead me this is why jacks second ending hope me oh shit this game is emotional its realy hitting me i kinda feel better nowno seriously i am feeling kinda like may and i am now feeling a lot better thanks to this game jack playing it the way he plays and does the voices thanks jack and angela i am serious thank you guys for the amazing game and for the videos that changed my life i was watching this on my break and my boss sent me home because this really hit hard in my heart an i started to cry if a game can cross boundaries it will everyone referencing the expensive foundation joke need to understand that this game is serious this isnt something to joke about i understand its tempting and that these jokes exist but theyre not appropriate here so please stop not everythings a joking matter i am the only one that feels like the song in the background is losing interest by shiloh 5000 oof thats me i constantly feel like i mess everything up i constantly blame myself for everything even when my friends try to help me i distance myself from them because i think i have to fix this its my fault i need to fix my own problems and maybe i just need to let others help me or go and actually see a therapist or talk to someone and even though this social media platform is all over the place these are the type of videos that help and seeing these comments make me feel better about who i am thats the reason i subscribed to this channel not for the gaming fun bubbly videos although i still watch some but it was for these videos the life is strange videos that just have a message behind them and those are the type of things that can keep me going along with my friends tnx for making me cry in a train jack ive felt all emotions in this video and say take your free time for yourself i will promise to never unsubscribe for you being out for a little bit what happened to your intro who else yawned when jacked yawned even though im 9 i had depression but i got over it so im happy again these videos you do are so important thank you so much your speech was beautiful jack brought a happy tear to my eye i definitely fall into the i dont deserve to be happy because i screw everything up category hi jack recently i was going through this but like with trust with my mom it got to the point where i couldnt stand speaking to her without crying and about all of this i also had a mental breakdown in class so everybody going through hard shit in life i love you and hope anything and everything is the best for you dear sean you might never read this and that is ok i was too emotional to post after watching yesterday i was a sobbing puddle of goo to be honest i just want to thank you from the bottom of my damaged little heart actually my heart is often too big thank you so much for sharing yourself and many of the games that support mental health awareness it means so much i have lived with severe depression for over 20 years and it is no joke but i am still here i was made aware of you through my brother and in a recent relapse you have kept me company for hours and hours i have felt completely alone and helpless i have only been watching your vids for two months but have binged a good chunk of 5 years of content you have kept me company through some very dark times and i thank you watching you grow and change has been a privilege i feel like i sound so tragic considering i am ten years older at least than most here but i dont care care what others think i just wanted to s man i needed that speech thank you i am sorry that this happen to people i just want to say that i have seen this up close with my brother he has gone trew this i was in hell for those moments and i almost lost him with that i lost my parents seeing them going trew that so also when someone close has gone trew this seek help for yourself because its horrible going trew that so i am so dam great full that my brother came out of it i am just afraid that i will go trew that because it came close its amazing how i havent been on youtube in a while and as soon as i get back he shares this heartfelt and tender message everything i needed to hear omg i cry as fast as i new she was going to do that kind of stuff its so scary honestly everyone wants the best for you jack and if you being your best self means being more disconnected then im absolutely fine with it your mental health and personal life comes first then you can spare time for work im going to turn off all of my twitter notifications now although im not suicidal im probably kinda depressed like may was im tired all the time for no reason and i cant sleep and i cant try to do the stuff i want to do like art and video games step by step it is i just hope that at one point i can look back and see that i progressed its been about a year since my mental health went to shit and i pulled my life together listening to you speak and watching this game brought me right back to those moments and holy shit im grateful for my life right now and this is why i have so much empathy for people because life is hard really really hard but things always change itll be okay regardless jack you have done so much for me and i thank you so much for everything you are still getting me through one of the toughest and hardest things in my life not only being there when i need to calm down and watch a funny video but you are helping me realize that i cant just give up and end it all that there are people that care about me and that i should keep fighting i actually had a friend who ended there life and the only sad part was her dad was the cause of it and i did nothing to help but the few things that sticks with me are that i wasnt able to say my final goodbye and that i knew i couldve prevented that but i was in elementary school and didnt understand so thank you so much sen for everything you do may is precious and must be protected sen i just want to say thank you for talking about this you talking about these things tapped into a side of my mind that i hadnt acknowledged for a while i developed depression when i was about 12 years old i suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts and ideation for about 4 years for those years i was in the dark i recently got over my depression at around the beginning of this year i just turned 16 this january and i never took the time to acknowledge what exactly i went through you tapped into my past trauma and emotions just by talking about this and you made me realise that i need to figure out exactly what i went through and i need to work through the things that happened to me and thats a good thing thank you so much sen you helped me i played this game before jacksepticeye thats the first time that ever happened i love you thank you sean you saved me youre my hero thank you so much please for my sake never change i know that there is a good chance i might not be here today if it wasnt for you you taught me that its okay to move on i just wanna say thank you love when jack plays a game about mental health issues thank you jack 3 can i please have a repeating gif of the last 10 seconds of this video 1850 may said mean eather didnt she mean me neather i dunno for shure im not english belgium sean mays door is open i wonder were she is ad have you

died how did i play these befor you ive recently lost a friend to suicide this is heavy and im struggling with everything rn thanks jack start of the video me is that blood on the homescreen nah its probably just a red floor game may commited sewecide with me it was blood uno reverse she is the potato goddess i really needed those last 20 minutes i thought i could watch this and i did i watched and just began crying once the bathroom scene with her happened i broke down ive struggled with that type of thing and i still am and its so important to show what reality is to show that you arent alone even though its so cliche its reducing the stigma and helping show that the world is hard that youre allowed to struggle this video has me bawling my eyes out this video made me crythis is the best video ever you are never going to guess who is amazing beautiful awesome pure kind and perfect in every way hint read the first two words hey just letting you know that your speech gave me enough motivation to get some stuff done so thanks a bunch man 4204 ive done it before just to calm myself down if you feel like changing im sure only your true fans will follow sometimes all you need to hear is i love you we will continue to love you until the very end you are such an inspiration and just an allaround lovely person and such no one is perfect but you try to send out love and positivity and laughter all the time and thats what makes you a great person and hopefully you feel the love in return ive played this recently its beautiful totally didnt tear up at all during this video not one bit nope the amount the art and the emotions that the game has is really breathtaking im probably a weird fan i only know your first and last name and thats it really who needs more then that sure i would love to meet you sean but not all fans pry things open sometimes somethings need to stay closed love ya jacksepticeye i wonder how many people that watched this are going through what may was going through my god this video this game is sticking with me its so close to what ive had to deal with everything you said towards the end i have more of a desire to live now thank you 3 to anyone who needs it i actually started crying when i saw you hold back you tears ii didnt realize how much i needed that speechholy shit sean this hit me hard thank you sean thank you motivational speaker much the number of dislikes is 699 had to stop in the middle of this because i myself suffer with majordepressivedisorder and i related to this all to much i still dont go to many people for help i do self harm i dont have anyone around to help me i am always emotionally drained it is just a rough time not just for me but for anyone who goes through this there was so much emotion in this and i do love seeing this game because of it though i wish to see more people create games on things such as depression everyone liked that im not crying you are wow i am actually crying influencers like sean talking about the reality of the world and serious topics like this is so important thank you sean for being brave enough to open up and inspire others to do the same thanks sean i needed to hear that today its wonderful to feel like this is coming from a friend in spite of never having and probably never ever meeting you so thanks for being a friend to all of us who need one this is giving me some ddlc vibes this really hit home for methank you so much thank you so much for making this video it really helped me figure out what i need to do i have been watching a lot of your videos recently but this one is the one that really spoke to me thank you so much jacksean it really means a lot to me knowing that you care i really appreciate that you took time to find what makes you happy that is something that i need to work on still so keep being the new you keep being happy and keep being amazing love you man the music in the background fitted you talking so perfectly honestly sean you became a better person in my opinion you now appear as a genuine human rather than appearing so happy and positive in an unnatural spirit of course i enjoyed your videos from back then of course i miss wobbly and sweary sean but now you appear more like a human than someone whos just a perfect figure and lie that some people feel like theyll never achieve i enjoy your change of view on the world found myself agreeing with every word genuinely happy you share less and enjoy more as a person rather than knowing you feel like you have to do it i cried throughout your message because i realized i had to take a break and do some other things sean you inspire me as a person as an entertainer as a creator as an overall human you make me understand that its ok to have your breaking points as long as you get up from them and become a better person thank you for talking about these stuff i really needed that today 3 i watched a gameplay already of this game but its jacksepticeye im so sorry for anyone else that is going through this if you do also go through depretion your an amazing person and no matter what anyone says you are special i think taking time for yourself and setting up boundaries is a very good thing in any other job youd have a time when you go to work and when you get out the rest of the times for yourself its not healthy to just drown oneself into work or anything else im happy that youre learning to take care of yourself i love the message at the end its very nice and motivational thank you for showing this game and your openness and honesty i dont think your job is social media its good that youre separating yourself from strangers to get closer to people you really care for for anyone this social media experiment isnt working i want to see more people delete their facebook and twitter and everything else i dont think you need them to work in media i dont think you meed these unhealthy platforms to find an audience its so much healthier to heavily restrict who has access to you ive learned thats just my small additional thought to this keep being you dude and thanks for doing so you yeah you do me a favor after watching this video turn off your device relax breathe take a break 2759 i love how sean will notice something in the background and wait until the depressing atmosphere has left to bring it up his words about life go well with the beautiful music in the background i have depressed friends and i feel the exact way as he says and to all those who see my comment do bother youre friends because they di care about you and they will help you and from my perspective i enjoy helping my friends with their troubles and i do help them so reach out and connect with them im glad youre better but dont feel guilty for living your own life it is your life after all for everyone who reads this never forget that you are amazing and loved even if you dont feel like it right now please dont give up when you wanna yeehaw but you just cant dude we or at least i know you care and that you always have i prefer you to be happier than you giving yourself entirely to us its your life to live so live it for yourself if you do ever want to talk about anything i will happily listen even though you have no idea who i am your videos help me so so much i will happily repay what you have done for me anytime

morning afternoon thank you for being you this video came to me at the best possible time ive had some not great thoughts lately thank you so much jack im not crying youre crying if anyone feels like they have no one you can always talk to me 3340 did he actually tear up oh sean were all so glad that youre better now i like how time actually passes in the bed scene and that as she felt better and more connected she turned towards you i just fucking love the talks after this type of games that sean doesreally helps a lot aaaah cue panic attack me now vs me when i first started watching this channel are very different people i find myself unable to enjoy seans old videos because he was too loud a younger me loved that shit but im older and calmer now and so is sean i feel hes grown up and some of his fans havent so sean do what you want you deserve happiness oh shoot i played this on kbh games sometimes we should just take some time to get deep with a friend and talk about things that are important and should be shared with someone because if we keep all our feelings inside we can lose ourself we can miss every sign that our friends give us and once we do see them its to late show someone some that you care because if you dont it could end badly and they can do something they could regret yay i finally found someone whos also this also we must protect may i really recommend backbone demo its a really great pixelated detective game this video really made me emotional i have been in mays place in your place there was a time in my life where every day i struggled to go on i was tired that deep exhaustion that you just cant shake that sadness when you have no real reason to be sadthanks for putting this out there if anyone else watching this video has felt this way youre not alone and please dont give up it can get better its sort of frustrating when youre like really depressed and people ask why and when you respond with i dont know they discredit you when youre depressed most of the time you dont know why and it just feels like so much so if you are a friend to a person who you either suspect to be or is openly depressed when they answer i dont know why im sad just know that they really feel bad and really just dont know why jack you have to play a game called metro exodus the scenery in the game is fantastic you can get it for free with a xbox game pass and ive only just started thank you sean watching youtubers be real with you and putting themselves out there is heart warming that theyre trusting you with that part of themselves more vr please 2436 spoken like someone who hasnt lived in poverty i like writing and hate engineering i want to be a teacher but engineers make good money teachers are overworked and underpaid i cant afford to be happy in the respect it sucks but its true 2436 spoken like someone who hasnt lived in poverty i like writing and hate engineering i want to be a teacher but engineers make good money teachers are overworked and underpaid i cant afford to be happy in the respect it sucks but its true 2436 spoken like someone who hasnt lived in poverty i like writing and hate engineering i want to be a teacher but engineers make good money teachers are overworked and underpaid i cant afford to be happy in the respect it sucks but its true once upon a time i found this channel i subscribed for the jokes i stayed for the wonderful soul that runs this channel this video made me fell better thank you when is an eggs day off frieday i wish i could say this to you in person so it will show that im serious but i cant so im just gonna say this we dont only see you as an entertainer we see you as a person with a good heart and also as a person that alot of people can relate to people love you and you and you love them back good day hope you see this damn i got chills bro this game makes my life seem so sad i can relate my darkest moments are probably nothing compared to what others have faced but it still hurt so much videos like these are some of my favorite because you look at the names or pictures of people on every other video in the comments and they are jokes or puns or comments on what you like but on these videos you look at names that you would like are just a meme name and laugh at it but in this comment area those names are the ones telling you that you are worth it and that you matter and you can look past those names and see a person and in the video itself jack didnt mean to talk for so long but he gave me inspiration and hope and so did the game itself reading comments made me so happy and i hope everyone who wanted to read this much and everyone who didnt want to i want them to know that they matter and that i love you and well always be your friend thanks so much

enough to pull off those outfits i have no idea why those 680 people disliked this video sean if you need to let it all out or want to tell us about some stuff thats going on just speak and dont stop we understand that youre not going to tell us everything about your life that can be really tiring and people dont need to know everything about you but the stuff your want to share can just be said this community loves you so much and hearing that your thoughts got to a point were you thought about ending it all broke my heart youre such a positive and beautiful person and please dont think of yourself as someone that can be replaced take time off whenever you need it and we will be here when you come back i think this one dealt with the themes from you left me in a much more coherent and hardhitting way props to the developer for continuing to improve on their work ive been watching his channel for a while now and even though he has changed i continue to watch because his content and him as a person enlighten my day this game hits home for me kinda because i have a friend who is suicidal and i want to help her but i dont know how and i feel like that the both endigs are kinda what is happening to me cause i talked to her and she is better but we havent hanged out a lot cause i focus on other things like in the first ending may is our depression spokesperson a comment lost in the thousands i know but i just wanted to say something quick even if it sounds cliche you are loved no matter what you think you may not know me but im always here to listen for anyone who needs it it doesnt matter who this community is really great for things like this so know we all do really care i honestly though that was belle delphine fucking sobbing by the end of this 3 thank you sean for talking about such a hard topic it means a lot pride week everybody im straight i have to hide i really like these speeches he gives once in a while like life lessons we need to be reminded of every now and then i do get motivated every time thanks sen you are my child hood the human mind is a storm that rarely stops but it only silences when all the heavy stuff drops out of it and in those moments theres a form of beauty in watching the rain jack love you and your channel for these rant type of messages more than anything learning restraint is the best thing to defend yourself most amazing motivational speech ive ever heard i appreciate you and i know many others do as well youll always be the greatest in my eyes and im happy youre growing as a person and taking the time for yourself and knowing your limits i can say with confidence that i will continue to be here and grow with youthis channelthis community 3 3 goddamnit sean out here giving me good life advice when i needed to hear it again this is amazing content wholesome at best i think that we all needed to hear that little bit at the end ive been in mays position before and i was on anti depressants for a long time since i was 15 i had some really dark moments self harm suicide attempts but then eventually i found help and people who cared for me and helped me through it im 24 now and have just come off my anti depressants im struggling a little but i have a great support system and for once i feel hopeful and think things will be okay i hope everyone else whos going through similar things can eventually feel the same thank you you opened my eyes again that i still have problems and what is actually is going on with me ive been feeling weird for weeks now i know my depression never actually went away but i just felt normal for such a long time now that i just could realize that i still have problems and that its getting worse now but i can try to get help now because i know what is wrong thank you you helped me you know what when i was young i almost always felt alone but back then i was happy now when im connected back to the world why do i feel so sad it took me a while to realise that i was depressed because of my other friend who was sucidal and depressed lifes hard and no matter the situation you can power through btw im 11 how the fuck is this game inspired by junji ito i had to stop after the second ending no way i could see any worse ones after that thank you though jack just like your first video of these games it really touches close to my heart dont worry dood a lot of us are glad that youve grown so much mad respect and thanks a lot i like this real sean over the fake jack before 2018 i had a lot of things happen to me and this made me happy i think i really needed to hear this message especially that bit at the end i have been really down in the dumps the last few months because im 30 years old and my life doesnt look anything like the way i had hoped it would by now it seems every attempt i make to get my life rolling in the direction i need it to the cosmos just shits all over it i have been stuck in this well of self pity i admit im trying to get back on the ball though ive started drawing again rediscovering my love of art and trying to take it to new heights ive gotten back in the gym which was doing good for my confidence when i was going regularly and im trying to make peace with my dad bod because those are in apparently heh heh ive even joined a writing group to try to get back to writing for the love of writing i published a book three years ago and its failure had a hand in sending me into an existential crisis on my 29th birthday last year just as well i have had no luck in i needed this so much life has been terrible lately and i really do not want pity i just want to bring to light that this shit happens and its okay because at the end of the day i know how much ill be losing and how many people will be losing if i were too do anything rash like that i believe that as cliche as it sounds the sun will come out tomorrow there will be another day to do bigger and better things even if its something small like getting out of the house and going down to the store little things are what we need to focus on the butterfly that flies by your house the crickets chirping the way your cat purrs little things that keep you grounded and centered idk thats just my thoughts this video was so beautiful and well done and im so glad you opened up a little sean no matter what may be going on well always be here waiting for you so never be afraid to take a break if you need to we love you and well stick with you no matter what if you are feeling sad i will hunt you down and throw a puppy at your face and say here have a present your speechesramblings are always nice to hear jack thank you for them i love the videos they make not only me but other people laugh at times we laugh we cry watching videos that you made people love your videos and it even helps people move toward and go through the day with a smile and whether you recognize it or not you are making peoples day not just mine but for others as well thank you jack the most emotional ive ever felt jack thanks for being for me the art is absolutely gorgeous in this i love how 20 minutes is just sean just talking idk why it felt good and inspiring too sean know those of us who care about you personally never mean to poke into your personal life to the point it hurts you youve been here to support us your videos have gotten me through a lot we want to make sure youre okay you have so much support from us if you want to keep stuff to yourself thats your right just know we care man these videos always make me cry thank you so much for this video i realized about a year ago i had a youtube addiction i felt like i knew the youtubers and i realized i had to step back jacksceptic eye is a persona sean is not and i more than likely never meet the latter but i can join you for your content and be okay with that smile sunshine you are an awesome one and you can handle all that damn wicked world shilohs nice singing in the background is just amazing i have been quite sad for a while now and cant really explain why and i just seem to not know why but my mom always makes it seem as if there has to be a reason she tells me that theres no way and that there is a reason but in reality like i said earlier i dont know why i cant explain why is that normal this game as made it seem so so it has comforted me on how i seemingly feel anyway after watching this video i had sent messages to my friends telling them how much they matter to me and how they can always talk to me that game play is exactly how it is trying to find that one thing that keeps your from leaving that note on the door thank you for sharing depression and these kinds of thoughts are horrible and sometimes it completely feels like their is no light at the end of the tunneli am glad that games like this are around letting people know to look for the missed messages or hidden ones possibly to save a friend sean thank you for all you do to help people your are one hell of an amazing person it never ever feels like you dont care about your channel or your viewers and your fans not one video has it felt anyless than complete love and respect for everyone who watches your content we love you sean really you have always been great at approaching this topic which can be really hard also your private life deserves to be yours always and as far as changing over the years we all do people cant judge a situation theyve never been in and certainly have no right to tell you you cant change we live in a world where people like to pick at things online because they can hide behind a keyboard and they forget they are speaking to real people with real lives on the other side always do what you need to do for yourself to be happy because at the end of the day that is the most important thing im proud to be part of this community being happy all the time and never being sad its unhealthy you all deserve to be content with yourself third listen through and 3832 hits hard the haunting hesitation in his voice thanks sean i wish i could have shown this to a guy i knew in basic 2017 was also my worst year i ended up in hospital due to extreme depression and attempted suicide it was a very very bad year an im so happy with how far ive come with the help of people like you thank you for opening up lots of love i love that these games still exist i love that youtubers play these games they tell people that they still matter youtubers like jack talk about these situations that are really important thank you i felt touched when he said 2017 was miserable my anxiety was awful then and my parents fought every night sometimes i accidentally let stuff out and it sucks because then everybody calls you self centered i feel like people dont take things seriously i go to the therapist but if you really think about itthat person is justa stranger they dont know you you dont know them they dont understand you theyre justthere you know sorry im rambling people probably dont even want to know this sorry just for the sake of it dont give up i know its a dead meme but im proud of this community i swear to god whoever hit that dislike button should go punch themselves in the face and question wtf is wrong with their brain your talks always help me see that my darkest thoughts can fade and i can be a little more happy and positive each daythere will still be sad days but theres always hope and light in the darknessthank you so much for making my bad thoughts fade a little more each day 51 minutes of shiloh dynasty looping im so sorry for your pain hun im glad youre so selfaware about your mental state that youre educated about it having struggled with bipolarity i was terrified to reach out to a psychologist but im so glad i did now im going into my phd degree for clinical psychology and i cannot wait to help people who are struggling themselves its good to take a break from social media take a day or so to yourself and let your mind take a break from all this overwhelminng you and stop the over stimulation im so glad that youre so open about your struggles and im excited to see the adult youve become putting a difference between who you are and your online persona is so critical to your mental health and its something not many youtubers do which is a shame because they lose themselves in the process thank you sen 3 seriously jack 2 words thank you always keep up the good fight life is a battlefield and were the soldiers going against an unpredictable foe eventually we all lose someone friends family those we just met some weve known for years some in worse ways than others we may lose them in a time where we argued with them regretting the last things we said wishing that at the very least we could say one last farewell however they are lost and the past cant be changed for some this haunts them either that or feeling like a failure feeling alone feeling as though youre stuck in the middle of a dark abyss unable to find a way out but if you harness the ability to control youre mind for intelligence and wiseness your strength to carry on and to get work done and your soul in order to reveal yourself from under the cloak that you kept yourself under than you can change the world it doesnt matter if the change is on a small group or if it changes a nation leads two armies to stop their wa this video helped me out cause i struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts and it made me have hope for a better tomorrow thanks jack a lot and i mean it you opened my eyes is so many ways and gave me ways to improve my lifestyle im just so grateful and thanks jack i feel like your the only real youtuber out therelike a boss man i still love ur videos they will never get old to me the scene where she was looking in the mirror with blood running down her arm it might seem weird or slightly inappropriate but i remember a time where i cut myself with baby scissors it might seem impossible but if your stupid and young enough youll find away fyi i did that on accident i was talking to my dad opening and closing the scissors in my hand you can geuss the rest lol its just a video but it became something bigger that i didnt realize i needed desperately until nearly an hour went by thank you for the push sean for years youve been my favorite youtuber ive been through so many times where ive been in an incredibly dark place with myself and your videos always helped me immensely i know im not the only one thank you for opening up about your past and being vulnerable because it shows how much you care from the bottom of my heart and countless others thank you i feel like you should be able to take time off when he wants some people may disagree because they might like to watch his videos but if you dont wanna play he should be able not to play sometimes people need time by themselves so i think that he should be able to have that day were he has that option were he can not do a video if he doesnt feel himself change isnt always bad stop thinking of change as a bad thing because its not dont be scared of change i played this game and make her live like in 25 mins its free go play for some dumb reason when you said self harm and suicide i thought you were going to say self righteous suicide like from chop suey the first ending he got is the entire reason i always leave my phone on and have it with me i have friends that are suicidal and i am the one they come to when things go bad i am always there to help them no matter what time of day puzzle youll never be irrelevant or forgotten youre such a great person and we all love you you can not upload for ten years and ill never forget you or hate you i ugly cried i needed that end speech and didnt even know it time for thoughts to not be seen but i still im going to do it xd sorry if this brings anyone down but this video really hits home for me i mean just two days ago i cut myself 4 times on my arms i suffer from bipolar disorder as well as serious depression im on all kinds of meds and ive even tried overdosing 6 times i feel a lot of pain a lot of the time and my thoughts always run through my mind that im making my parents mad or disappointed i feel like im breaking my family apart because there watching me and i just want to end it so everything can just stop sorry if this was weird but i just thought maybe someone would read this idk i hope youre having an amazing day or night or whenever you see this you are such an amazing person and somewhere someone cares a lot about you wow it wes very of you sean im more than happy you said it and i very happy if you happy hi jack i really loved this video especially the monologue at the end of it can i give you a hug i really enjoy your content i served a mission for two years a year ago and for a while didnt really watch your videos for a while however i rediscovered your videos a while back and i fell in love again you are always able to help me cheer up and get out of a bunked mood thank you for being the amazing person you are and i sincerely hope i get the chance to meet you in person some day 3 when you see a pride flag and it warns you about self harm and suicide well this will suck to hit on what jack said on the social media aspect just coming from my personal experience currently it really hit home because for a while now ive been doing things where i dont need my phone and i dont need to constantly be checking it and as time went by i started checking social media and my phone less and less and before i remembered having to rush i guess like i need to check my phone to keep in the know and make sure i know whats going on until one day i realised that something i heard about a week ago is still present currently and that nothing really changed and that really blew my mind because for some reason it was like i went into this fastpaced attitude of thinking i cant keep up with anything into realising that really dont need to keep up with anything and i hardly use my phone and i love it because i get to do so much things out of looking at social media i hardly go on these anymore not saying that im going to delete them and stuff but i just know i can i needed this thankyou 1 like 1000 prayers for sean and everyone who goes through this this video made me realize that i dont have to be as skinny as everyone else at my school or act like them my weight only shows off a bit more of my personality and what i like to do with my time when i start high school as a freshman this year im going to throw away my mask and be myself rather than the person almost everyone at school knows and has known me for im going to be me kinda glad i watched this instead of playing it myself suicide stuff surprising me wouldnt be great right now thank you you dont know me but you helped me im here for the laughs its keeps it away thank you i can relate i have to be my friend group therapist and i have a lot of problems and my head is fucked up and hear some of my friends problems has made me just dead and my mom is not the best i never see my dad and i know to no one ever will care or see this but yeah sorry love sean so much he always speaks his mind and makes really amazing points that makes me think and relate if anyone wants to talk dm me on instagram alexanderhamsandwich0001 i was deeply depressed for years and almost ended my life but luckily i realized i didnt want that and started pushing to have a better life it was definitely a bumpy road and it still is but i can definitely say i feel happier now and it feels kinda amazing to have a life again i love the art style its inspiring for me i love to draw and do things with new and old colors its crazy because i just got this game and played it my self i cried so hard that first ending is like one of my biggest if not the biggest fear i have not being able to be there for somebody when they need you when you are doing normal everyday stuff only now your phone ie switched off you cant see anybodys calls or messages you only learn when its already too late god i hate that feeling im basically the main character in this story i have alot of friends who are depressed or having a hard time with life so i try to help them cause i dont have any of these types of problems i feel like im a good listener and a very understanding person i take all the hints i find to try and piece together other peoples life puzzles to be able to help them in the best way possible i can relate to this game very much and it gets me emotional thanks for playing it sen what would happen if i just ended it all those words just hit me so hard i started crying im so grateful for you doing your best to be here for us thank you so much for everything sean hopefully u dont have those thoughts anymore but i do still and u have helped me through those since the gta vids u have helped me through my own depression and u have helped me through 4 attempts bc i remember ppl like u help the world no one rly cares about me but u care about the subscribes and i think i speak for all of us we cant lose u bc we love u u make us happy u make me happy and sometimes make me not depressed jack do whatever you want to do thatll make you happy well always care about you because you make us happy and you always have i care about you and what makes you happy is whatll make me the happiest youve got no idea how much you mean to us how much you being happy makes us happy thank you for everything sean most people say they dont know most people say oh no most people say tell someone most people think show no one this day in age it is rare to find someone like this some people say its just for attention while others will just call you a freak the people closest to you can become the most distant ones when someone commits suicide people say poor them but never ask why or what caused it even therapists will judge you and you can immediately tell the difference between someone who honestly wants to help and someone who does it for their image this is why no one tells this is why no one shows this is why no one trusts thank you to all the people that dont just judge others or make it all about them people actually disliked this video really grow up very important topic to cover thanks for covering it i might ignore the sadness and tackle the happiness but one day its gonna catch up to me but if ive been goin good all this time im sure ill be fine you matter dont let anyone tell you otherwise doses anyone else feel like you really wants to give sen a hug right now i genuinely cried at this game and then hearing jack talk ive been in that place where everything feels so lost and broken where ending it all seems so easy please dont stop living the only thing that kept me alive was that it would probably be my little siblings who would find me the thought of my death always being in the back of their minds that i wouldnt get to see them grow up its what got me through my darkest days and i still have dark days i have people who when i was at my darkest asked how i was so happy you never know whats going on and my life now is doing so much better i promise if your in that dark place it gets better there will be a day when you wake up and realize its gonna be ok get the help you need find a community that builds you up dont give in please for me who else cried the whole time im 14 and feel like shit and want help but push people away as she said harry potter fan fiction i was in the process of writing one while listening to it in the background as someone who struggles with depression watching this really hit home with me and made me cry like jack said no one is alone in this and you all have people out there who love and care about you im straight just so everybody knows i played it 2 days after its release i loved it its beautiful i started watching 2018 and actually just the stuff that where more calm compared to the typical screaming and loud personality stuff i loved it and still love it its a great way too relax or concentrate for repetitive tasks 2850 who else got caught pma all the way love you guys whoever you are your not alone in this and someone cares about you this community cares and it may not count for anything but i care i just

stop it get some help welcome to our community sean because you saw tool you are now part of a special musical community im so proud of you for stepping back from the community a little bit wed much rather have you a little less involved and happy than giving everything and miserable we all care for you so much we just want to see you thrive everything i love and everything ive been is in this little mobile thing in my hands in this moment losing intrest shiloh is such a good song always makes me feel super calm and makes me think abt stuff more its like a calming yet sad tune the fact that he always talks to his fans this way rly means a lot ive went through some really rough times myself and one of the people that actually made me feel much better was jacksepticeye thanks for everything love you 3000 i know you probably not gonna se this but the new you is great i have followed you since i was in college and that is a long time ago and it is so great that you are feeling the way you do about your job no one does their job 247 and people that do get stressed out and some even depressed so keep doing what you do people will be here and se what you make because you dont pretend to be something you are not love you dude keep up the good work holy crapmy story is going like maysim the golden child and everything is easy but now im getting lazy and my parents keep telling me now that im going into high schooli mean ive never seriously thought about my death but i have felt really down and thought aboutlikeharming myself but then i think about how scary that is and im too scared to do that fuck the youtube algorithm its almost ironic so many people have depression but it makes you feel so alone this hit much harder than i thought it would my parents always saw me as an angel absolutly perfect i was doing amazing in school strait as had intrest in sports but around middle school it just got so tough i came to a relization that i actually have no friends couldnt even talk to my parents because they were always so hard working i fell into a dark void it felt inescapable until my parents had time and reached out to me dont know why i had to share this just felt like i to damn i wasnt ready for this today who the heck is cutting onions thank you for making this video awe youre such a sweetheart sean thank you for making videos and making everyone happy this will be the video that makes youtube introduce the double like button hey so i like this video and im just going to drop some personal and maybe relatable info there so basically the worst year in my life was 2018 but the thing is thats not the year i hate the most in my life i might have had suicidal thoughts from april to december i might have been depressed for most of the year i dont hate it because this is the year i started growing up really growing up i started noticing things in my relations with others and specially in my relation woth my father i started realizing that maybe hitting toddlers because they shout too much isnt okay that maybe telling a 12 year old girl that she shouldnt eat too much chocolate because shell get fat and be miserable isnt okay that maybe shaming a wife for not having the time to do almost everything in the house isnt okay that not letting kids see their friends or family often and then talking behind their backs isnt okay from april to december of this year i had suicidal thoughts i started crying when you were talking because i feel like thats me thank you so much it was nice to hear what you said about mental health and your own side of it i belive a lot of people strugle with the exact same mindeset i mean so do i so it is nice to hear your not alone 3 1041 am i the only one that tucked my feet in my blanket when this happend this art style holy crap its so beautiful holyyyy 33 last night i went through some things after two years of thinking i was so much better and its really got to me i need help professional or not but ive bothered too many people in the past so thanks sen you talking really helps me realise im not alone i can find these people one day and we can help each other grow people scrolling please never forget who you are if you have no one else to talk to talk to me ill listen i totally agree sean were all so scared of other peoples words and how they will react if we do something that we forget to give ourselves time and space to look after our body and our soul ive seen it so many times were like candles all we want is to show our light and our spark that makes us unique but sometimes people think its dangerous so they put out your happiness to protect themselves and when you dont love yourself and value yourself those words mean so much more than they really do underneath everything else like sean said when you learn to value yourself negative opinions become meaningless because you know in your mind that those things are not true and positive opinions become more meaningful because it shows you that people appreciate selfcare its hard to see how much you are worth when youre always on social media surrounded by ideal people because it makes you feel bad that youre not as pretty as them or youre not as wealthy as them or youre not a i literally wish it was this fuckin easy for me to find another gay girl to smooch what the heck they just met

depression thank you jack much love thank you you helped me realize i need to talk to people and feel bettee i felt so worthless and and im not good at anything and i shouldnt be alive but this made me realize and i talked to a friend and i actually feel better about myself people are stupid if they are upset at you for changing and not being the same you are human we all change that energetic attitude isnt the only good reason to watch your videos the reason to watch your videos is because how much passion you have for it you truly care for your viewers even though most of us are strangers thank you for all the videos you do and how much compassion you put into it to me jacks voice is perfect his voice is perfect for something of this measure of sadness he knows whats happening and has usually been through it and it makes the viewers feel safe and happy inside because this is what a lot of people feel like and its always good to have somewhere there i dont know what it was the game jack at the 12 half of the video or maybe my own thoughts but this video connected with me and actually made me have a self reflection about whats going on right now thanks jack i think everyone needed to see this 3 play zombie tycoon brainhovs revenge day7 im sorry but an apple mac i needed that talk thank you jack and to everyone who reads this i love you and you should love you i almost gave up today i wont do that thank you jack thank you whenever anyone of you feels down just dont forget that keanu reeves called you breathtaking because thats what you are in the first place thanks

amazing person and im so happy and grateful that you are sharing all of this with us i have been a fan since before your happy wheels days and i have enjoyed following your journey and watching you become better and better i know how it feels to be so low and sad and just feel like you have no one watching your videos actually helps me feel like we all have someone who can relate to what some of us have been through all the love for people who want it and need it always here to lend an ear and a shoulder to cry on reason i made it a long time is mainly because im too lazy to care about most social media problems but also because of the realness sean had brought to his content ive seen him change so much since 2014 ive been through ups and downs and i feel like im in the better part of my overall life so far and ive seen sean go through the same showing us at the same time hes human too feel like ive grown with sean im happy to have found his channel he left me why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars jack i watch your videos intermittently so im not as active in your community i wanted to say you are a wonderful person your personality is incredible and i thank you for sharing your own struggles not many would share their struggles so publicly and your message to get help wonderful i just felt like i had to share this im not sure just thank you thank you for sharing i dont care if you talk in circles because a lot of us do i hope youre having a great day this really hit hard damn honestly all the emotions the thoughts the always being tired its really relatable this was a beautiful game and your message at the end was beautiful as well so thank you i swear sen is a secret therapist his words just calm me omg i played this game a few days ago

glad youre so happy and healthy i know youll always explain yourself but you never have to you give us lovely content and that is all you owe us everything beyond that is extra and your business we love you and if youre happy you do what you do youll never hear a complaint out of me this game is cringeworthy 440 is that dan avidan behind the hugging people i went into this knowing i was gonna cry endlessly i genuinely cant tell if hes talking to us or himself at the end there but that just makes it all the more sincere i love you so much sean thank you for this thank you for the things you do thank you for taking time for yourself thank you for realizing you need to take time for yourself thank you for being who you are and continuing to grow into yourself thank you thank you for being here things have been really rough lately i feel like im just whining and a bother but this truly made me feel less alone ive thought about reaching out to a professional but its just not available for me right now thank you jack even if theyre getting paid to help you theyll help you i love that dont forget it please wait what are you doing i need to cry but my foundation was 40 dollars 2710 i swear i could hear shiloh dynasty in the background that moment at 428 when fob makes a guest appearance thank you jack ive needed to hear this so badly lately this is exactly what i needed right now this video cut so deep for me i completely relate to a lot of what may was feeling in a bit of a different way but the core feelings are the same especially with the depression and all of that stuff its wow about the speech jack gave at the end he is right because there is always a way out ive had plenty of encounters when it comes depression and suicide i myself am medical depressed im not trying to say this as a pity im just am trying to help get jacks point across i had a friend kill himself when we were only 9 he had hanged himself in his closet and his mom found him the next morning when she went to wake him up for school earlier this year 3 days after my birthday my mom got me and my sister out of school early and when we got home she told us that our dad had killed himself at the place where my party was gonna be and it was from a self inflicted bullet in the head my dad had told me and one of my brothers because we both suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts and actions most of the time we dont even realize but my dad had told us he was gonna try to help and get us even more help and then he killed himself and it was so confusing but things happen and when you have omg yes i have waited for u to play this jack the background music is shiloh dynasty thank you sean for everything that you do this video really hit home for me too i started watching your videos in 2016 when i was depressed and you cheered me up i have improved so much since then and im glad you have too some parts reminded me of this school year basically i went to chemistrybiology class i thought it will be interesting and i will work on it but that summer before going to school i got interested in history like a lot i tried to focus on chem but teacher was kinda crazy with how lazy everyone were though everyone tried to work hard problem was in teacher that and the fact that i was interested in something else in the same time pushed me away from learning when i tried to work on school i hadnt enough time to work as hard as i needed i couldnt learn only history too as parents pressed on me to learn something else in result whole year there was wasted later i lost my girlfriend no its summer and i am just jumping into opportunities of free time and will maybe wasting some time on social medias but i think this summer is going good good luck to everyone reading this still thanks have a nice day i love these types of videos even if theyre sad theyre refreshing ive always been the person to look at everyone the same way it doesnt matter if you are a youtube star celebrity different race doctor gay trans or just a normal civilian we all bleed red were all the same and i could tell that saun was anxious or nervous about talking about this because his chair was shaking which can be caused by his leg shaking and for me it normally means anxiety or nervousness and it kind of shows that we all dont want to talk about this kind of stuff but we should we all need to come together instead of fighting one another the only way this world can get better is if we make it better i agree with all of this and a lot of people like me down here in the comments this video really stands out to me even if i was late we all need to love each other and not push people in need away we will always be here listen to saun people will listen if you just reach out to them i had a family friend who killed himself because his son killed himself his name was mr beryl and he was a pharmacist i remember when i was little and i got sick he would bring me medicine from the walgreens he worked at its a shame he had to go at least he doesnt have to suffer anymore and he can be with his son holy crapthiswas relatable on a scary level i love you daddysepticeye life is hard at times but you always there to help i cried during the end of this video the first ending that jack had for this game really got to me because my parents used too have a good friend who they were going to ask to be my godfather but he committed suicide before they got too ask and the last person he tried to call before he did it didnt even pick up the phone when he was available and was able to pick up the phone he basically just ignored it side note my parents didnt really know the guy who didnt answer his last call my parents had no clue about it and they wouldve helped him if they had know about it but if anyone reads this please know that suicide is not the only option and keep it off your options list there are therapists to help you may have friends and family that are willing to help just understand there is always hope last year i had the worst suicidal episodes of my life i left school i essentially vanished from my friends i lost any emotional attachment to any living being i ended up in two different hospitals one in october and one in november into december i was experimenting with so many different medications and joined cbt and dbt groups in and out of the hospitals the specific reasons as to why i was suicidal were not common at all and yet they still caused me pain jealousy and envy i tried different forms of traditional medicine such as medication and psychotherapy as well as holistic treatments such as emdr hypnotherapy acupuncture and natural supplements throughout the whole experience many people close friends and family doctors and even complete strangers told me i would be fine and i would do great things but i could not help but feel as they were all simply untrue to this day i am still sometimes passively suicidal although i have never selfharmed im go sean i know you wont see this but i had to say thank you you saved my life today this video hit the nail on the head in a lot of days thank you for going on so many tangents you are an incredible human being jack i havent watched ur vids in years no offense but when i say u i said to my sister omg jack has a beard and brown hair me a trans girl the trans pride flag me agghahshagsg who else cried incredibly hard because it felt like he was talking directly at you i know exactly how that feels i know there was a warning but i still went along and watched it i could relate with the may character ive struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts now im still suffering but im trying my best to be okay me and my mother dont have the best relationship and it actually hurts okay im not gonna go off with my whole life story so touching thanks for posting this i was literally just debating playing this game on steam instead i watched your video i was under severe depression until like last year it probably started around 7th grade iirc i had terrible social anxiety and ofcourse got bullied at my new school for that and for being fat it and a bunch of other shit like academic and parental pressure all just kept snowballing until i was at my absolute lowest i never made any real friends never opened up to any one and just kept to myself and my stupid dark thoughts honestly throughout that time watching funny youtube videos and talking with online friends was the only times i felt genuinely happy in 201516 i started to have suicidal thoughts but pushed them away for the sake of my mom a few online friends also helped me get through this time then idk why but early 2017 it just hit me like a truck that i dont want to live such a sad and pathetic existence surely life can be better than this i want to have fun enjoy laugh all that good shit i then tried to counter all my problems as best that you know my best friend recently stopped talking to me and since i moved to a different state we havent seen each other this hit me hard when i was little i lost my best friend in a car accident and now i in a way have lost my best friend again both when i was going through a really hard time already i dont have many friends and ive started to lose so many recently for some reason so i feel so alone this made me cry so much so get yourself a best friend that can help you in moments like these it will change your life just like it was portrayed in this game i played this last week xd i really appreciate you playing this game this game is the embodiment of how i feel on a daily basis watching it definitely opened my eyes i appreciate your words jack its definitely hard to try and push through each day but i do feel its worth it thank you very much and also i like the jack who likes himself to me you havent changed youve just grown as a person can we get a part two thank you for this video sean ive been going through struggles like this and this made me feel better and the way you said all of the amazing stuff in the end it is just so much help to me and everyone going through this im crying so much right now this feeling sucks 1330 i thought i could handle watching this but i cant im crying i relate to this to much you feel bad criminal even ruining your familys mood with something like this you tell them youre sorry you tell them you love them the look of pain and horror that later fills their features is unforgettable you regret it but you know youll try again you probably wont notice or anything but i just wanted to thank you youve been my inspiration to grow upon myself and grow one my hobbies like and accept the good with the bad i havent had this kinda hope and joy within my world in this world we all need at least one person that gives us hope i relate to the character in the game because i think about suicide everyday but dont take action to it because i think of how everyone else would be affected jack your videos are one of the things that keep me here they let me really smile and laugh instead of putting on a mask to make everyone else feel better i cant thank you enough for all that you do because without realizing it you help someone like me take a step back from the darkness i feel like i hear shiloh in the background i needed this to help push forward i am leaving my job apartment city province to move back in with my family ive been on sick leave since april therapy ended because money ended having to temporarily rehome my cat ive been struggling to clean my apartment all week before they start showing it to future tenants but my end goal is that i am taking time for myself to work on healing and loving myself and life i am taking myself out of an incredibly toxic work environment anyway i just wanted to say i genuinely appreciated this video its helped me refocus today and find direction again in my own snowstorm ive been waiting for people to play this game ive had it since it came out because angela hes games always deal with topics like these in such a beautiful way and i love seeing peoples reactions to some of the game play options we all love you sean keep up the good work and youve helped us all through hard times including myself thank you i played it just last day before watching this and wished jack would play it even tho this is a serious game im still getting sayori vibes this is the reason i love you i may have stopped watching your videos for a while but ive never stopped being grateful for what you have done for me thank you sean it means alot 69k likes perfectly balanced as all things should be im glad i came across this video much of it was very relatable just keep doing what you love glad to hear youve set healthy boundaries for yourself and your online presence subscribed i love the fact the game had the pride flags thank you this is all i can think of saying to express how these talks help me i really enjoyed this video especially your talk jack i can relate to everything you said and it made me realize how precious and valuable my life is and how i should stop comparing myself to others and live as me and also to finally value myself as a person thank you sm jack love you sm i hope to continue seeing you grow the modern world is afraid of silence and the mind being quiet for silence is when the truth is heard and silence is the language of god and the modern world hates the truth and hates god so that is why noise tries to kill silence yet silence always seeps through whether it be you wake up in the middle of the night or are reading a book or looking at the stars or the rising sun silence is like the sun you can hide from it for a bit but it always shines through always i have a friend like may but mom blocked all my social media and now i cant talk to her i hope shes ok your fans are always here for you jack love this video thank god this is on trending honestly the best part about this video is the comment section so much positivity i love yall its kinda an old game but dudeee jack you should really play butterflysoup 936 so he broke up with me why are you looking up

are thank you for this vid jack i know the pain and i will always be here for you and if anyone need me then i will there when i first played this game ive gotten so many chills this game is just wow i have always preferred the more grown up jack the person who can play a game and take it seriously respect how clever the story or style is that is why i subscribed a long time ago i watched other youtubers play the same games and act childish not really seem to care about the game they were playing much prefer to watch someone who seems genuine that someone who seems to act the idiot for views dude i dont care about how irrelevant you are i will always support you and love your videos and support you never give up your interests always support yourself before you try to make a video he presently total his car and the wreck destroyed hes mental state but his gotten better you tell he became pale and before and was so light that i could pick him up and im 13 thank you for this video i help think more about him also my dad is mixed so scared me and family when it happened ever just cry uncontrollably dude i didint realize that my depression was this worse than ever i really needed all those words and you are so right about everything pepole fuck muy brain and it feels so bad im stuck in a dark hole the worst part is that i cant express my self because of my insicurity and i let pepole say so many things to me that i just cant risist no more i let them control me and i just cant im falling very deep sorry were here for you no matter what jackieman thank you for making this video it is really nice to know how much you care about these matters it was heart warming and brought tears to my eyes so thank you for that and jack i am sorry you had to go through feelings like that your videos have cheered me up through some pretty sucky times just thank you for the reassurance it means alot to have you reach out like this i really appreciate you speaking on this im 30 and was a teacher i hated it and it made me depressed every day and i thought about suicide often i thought i was too old to do anything about it but it got to a point where i just said fuck it and now im going back to school for something i love you have to live your life for you and not for the expectations of anyone else you thought life is strangr was tumblr the game look at this i hate motivational speech as its always like just do it and trying to make life look so easy by such shallow solutions but that was actually a good one sen that was very inspiring thank you jack keep being yourself its so unfair to think about it like how come i feel more acceptance from stranger on the internet than my own family i know they love me deep down but i just dont feel it junji ito the famous horror mangaka he was involved with this game i hinestly feel like a worse version of myself from last year idk i just feel like i was doing so much more last year and the other year that this year of my life is supposed to be a big year but just isnt a trigger warning in a video game man this is going to be a blast thanks 2016 leftist ideology is it bad that i cried at the depression part the best video since the refunct one imo whats with all these people lately starting to speak out for others to relate to these things that make us broken these things use to seem like things we dont talk about because we wanted to stay happy im glad that the barriers are being broken down i know friday at camp i cried for hours not knowing why i started doing so we all started sharing thing with the people in from the cabin we had spent all week in im glad the light had faded from the sky because i looked a mess when i looked in the mirror i want to go back i may have been ignored a bit but i was starting to be able to stand up and talk and be heard and not stopping until i was heard there were a couple of rude girls in my cabin i left out signs halfway through the week and the people like me came to me as a safe space im glad that i could do that i just wish i could have started doing it sooner somebody get this man a hug id give him one if i could 3 is it only me but the girl in the thumbnail looks like cypherden im surprised this wasnt a horror game thank you for that speech it helped me thank you 3 this made me cry but also feel awesome on the inside to know that other people know what im going through i find it very difficult to talk about this kind of stuff to other people but your video made me want to open up more to my friends and family i love you even though ive only seen a tiny slice of your life i can see very well that youre an amazing human being so thank you for this speech hug i hope you jack are having an awesome day as well as anyone who might be reading this 3 i know my dad is bipolar and been through so much that last sentince gave me gousebumps thanks jack watching this video was really therapeutic for me in a weird way especially since ive been going through a terrible ending to my sophomore year and his negative emotions allowed me to do some self reflecting thank you sean i really needed that today that thumbnail scared me i cant say that i have depression because i dont butsean has helped me through so many rough patches in life and i dont see him as an entertainer i see sean as my big brother hes been with me for so long and ive grown upwith him so sean thank you for making me feel safe secure and special thank you for making me laugh on days nobody else couldthank you for making me think about my mental health thank you for

the only choice you have you still have time to change what youre bout to do people love youplesasedont go not just the game but this is amazing and during the speech i have to say my eyes watered jack should make a podcast sean we are all here for you and you can record as little or as much as you want and i knmow your true fans will not be disappointed i love how real you are i cried when sean started talking about personal stuff nice to see someone being so honest and relatable thank you jacksepticeye thank you for the 20 minute speach this helps me just to know that some of my favorite youtubers do have some problems and that i am not the only person who feels like i dont want to do anything i really appreciate it as someone who wants to try to make videos to make people smile it helps me and this just makes me want to record and edit and make something outstanding to do something instead of doing nothing and sleeping sorry if someone doesnt like the paragraph of text but i wanted to say as someone thats tried to commit suicide and has now been clean for almost four years thank you for this video youre truly making a difference in peoples lives even if it doesnt feel that way i guarantee you someone watched this and was changed forever i certainly was love you sean suicides so egotistical yet its much the opposite what is etica i gently open the door shiloh dynasty i am not the only one who loved this audio right thank you i appreciate you so much i really needed the boost and i hope your happy and living your best life cause you also deserve it i needed this ive been seriously thinking about these kind of things lately i even have it all planned out im fully set on dying in a few years i have no one to talk to and im as stubborn as they get i dont want anyone to try to change my mind but this you helped a bit youve always made me feel better somehow and im grateful for that thank you for existing jack this game took a left turn real quick thanks for this video i really needed this thank you i appreciate you so much i really needed the boost and i hope your happy and living your best life cause you also deserve it ive been watching you ever since i was 1112 and first starting to notice something in me was off that i wasnt happy i listened to this while cleaning my room to most this would seem normal to me cleaning my room and even cleaning myself is at this point in my life a huge deal it is so difficult to even get up it was so important to hear this because something ive been trying to realize and let settle in my mind is that everybodys life on social media isnt real its just what they want you to see i needed to hear this u are all never ever alone as annoying as i am just talk to me and i will listen i love u all the art in these games is just wondeful tho smh thank you sean i really needed this because its almost to the point that i feel like the character in the game minus the suicidal part just being tired or life and being stuck in a place losing every sight of my goals losing hope but even without thinking about ending myself it still hurts to think about reality the only way of coping is dreaming because lucid dreams help me feel like i am in another world thank you again 828 thats called polyjuice potion my dear in my philosophy class we talked about how the media is a mask people wear it can give them the confidence to express themselves or hide themselves i think its very important to remember everyone is human this community is like a family so to anyone reading this you matter youll be missed times may be rough but eventually itll all work out please dont be afraid to reach out to someone if you need help do whatever makes you truly happy remember drink water take care of yourself and stay safe watching jack play this game got me feeling happy and sad i have gone through this and when jack gave out that little speech it made feel that im not alone and there are other people like me going through the same stuff so i relate a little to this game i think the world opened up to depression more after robin williams he was a happy man who maid the world a little bit better every day and even in death his smile changed the world i have sat listening to you and markaplier thiere so many day and weeks of despair family wars and bullying you guy saved my joy from dieing out so many times my mom thanks you guy every time i smile i know there was a warning but i suffer with depression and the thoughts im usually am okay with games with the situations in them butthis at the door with the notemy brother did the same thing with different thing written on ithe is okay now but it brought back bad memories ive been trying to formulate this comment so many times that ive almost given up on sending it but i just wanted to say that videos like these remind me why youre still such an inspiration to me thank you jack the most reletable game in the world what if person is used to sadness and guilt trips what if parents treated kid bad made kid into outcast in family because he was broken kid made him suffer for any mistake yet didnt care much for good things what if that kid got punished and publicly shamed for bad or good deeds he did what if he was never able to find purpose to live what if he doesnt want to get help and feels his problems are just stupid mani just want to punch that like button morethis some deep shit you need to hear from time to timethanks jack this was such a beautifully made game ive been through something similar think everyone does as you already said loved listening to you speak about it god this made ball my eyes out jesus thanks jack i needed that talk thank you jack sweetheart your community just wants you to feel comfortable when you do your videos and live your life so please be yourself with us if it makes you feel better we will love you and watch your videos no matter what hi sen i know you most likely wont see this but im saying it anyway but this sunday july 7th i turn 20 years old and the day after marks 5 years cutself harm free the reason i am saying this to you is cause i found you when i was self harming and had those dark thoughts of ending it all sen i dont know how and it doesnt matter but sen you along with a friend of yours you both give me my strength and courage back you both gave me hope and i will never be able to thank you both enough because the day i found that friend and you i was at my lowest i was going to end my life at only 15 years old but then i clicked your guys videos starting with job simulator for both of you and i was myself for the first time in months i was laughing and smiling and i felt happy and full of energy i can never thank you two enough cause of the two of you two of my closet real life friends and god i am still here when i thought i was dying at 15 and now 5 years later im turning 2 shiloh dynasty was playing in the background jack thank you for that speech i really love this part of you sean thank you junji ito had a part in this yes 3832 ahhh i fucking felt that one virtual hugs everyone in the middle of the game when her roommate was talking to her the song that was playing was called losing interest and i love that song i love when you go on the talks they are so relatable and they make me feel good inside i want to be more like you jack thank you so much to both jack and the creator of this game i needed this it is my birthday today and yet it just feels exactly like how may spoke that everyday seems the same there are days that when you are just so sad life just doesnt seem worth it its hard sometimes to even find the things you love but sometimes even though times are rough and life gets low its good to just step outside and look at the trees and look at the sky hear the cars go by talk to people dont close yourself off from the world i hope you all have an amazing day and if you are at all feeling low know that even though you may not feel like you are you are cared for and you are the only you that will ever be love yourself and who you are dont compare yourself to someone else focus on being you dont ever think to be as good as someone else be better be the best you that you can be because truthfully you are amazing the way you are if you can like this comment so anyone who watch she also has a trans pride flag d if you need motivation or just something positive read belong if anything is wrong and you feel like you cant get through i believe in you you can get through it if you feel like things cant get better i swear it will maybe not now maybe not next week but it will get better dont take the giant decide because people do care for you although it may not feel like it what is happening in your life is temporary it will get better i believe in you people believe and care for you i love you so much please take care i feel especially bad for teens whose parents dont believe or refuselike mine to believe that they are truly depressed which i find sad my friends are the main cushion of my falling into the pit of depression but even then sometimes it isnt enough and sometimes i feel like im a waste of space my friends always pull me back up and jacks videos are also a great cushion for the fall he always makes me smile and laugh hes a great person and it sucks that we fans feel like we own his private life youre breathtaking no youre breathtaking lads were all breathtaking dont let anything make you think otherwise even yourself you are youre own worst critic but youre also the worst critic nothing you do is enough for yourself but someone out there will envy you i know that someone wishes they were like you or were as good as you as you probably think about others there we go youre all breathtaking the 668 ppl who put a thumb down are the ppl who think suicide is a grasp for attention they think depression is a joke those ppl need to rethink their decisions this hit home so much more on the main characters side it hurts so so so much that feeling of helplessness and selfblame when someone you thought you knew so much about suddenly is just gone even though you had time and time again offered a hand yet you still missed a lot of details depression is no joke and such a very debilitating state of mind like you sen i have not experienced the extreme bottom so far and hopefully never but i have firsthand witnessed the very final repercussion of what it does to a human being it has got to be the most heartbreaking moment i have gone through bottom line is if someone you know feels off and to you seems generally sad more than just offer a helping hand most likely they would brush it off anyway why not ask if you could do something for them in the moment like the main character she asked if she could give a hug in that one sad scene she stayed listened and talked to may and they just existed for a few good hours may thank you jack truly i have been going through a rough couple of weeks of depression i hate it because i have a loving boyfriend and dog living with me friends family and my life has never been better but i still feel like i could be doing more and i constantly compare myself to others at work i always feel like i am not good enough but when you stated to look back on the past few years and see how much you have grown i burst into tears realizing how much more confident i am how i have conquered my anxiety over numerous things how just two years ago i thought i was going to die alone since i had never been in a romantic relationship at the age of 24 it really does get better and i realized how proud i am looking back how proud i am for not going through with my suicidal thoughts back in high school pushing through it seemed so difficult at the time but i am so grateful that i found help and i hope others can do the same end bit was well said yes sean value your self we are here for u aw i just started crying im a super emotional person xd thank you for being such an amazing youtuber and person these are the real ogs of jacksepticeye congrats you are a true fan be an og of mine today if not its ok i love playing games but my dad hats me playing this really helped me alot proud of you thank you sean i needed this you are such a kind and giving person i can see how much you care about everyone and you give so many people hope the videos you do and all the charity livestreams mean so much when i saw that you were doing a livestream to raise money for the trevor project i was so happy considering you arent even part of the community and you care this much means a lot the fact that you even thought to do it in the first place says so much about you but also like you said someone will always help and now i feel bad for watching this video i feel u sean befor in my school no one played whit me when we are going out and play i was also going at the hospital many times i was always thinking about suiciding many times nearly all the days but i got 2 new friend and they are my best friend i hated my life now i love it now i just wanna give you a hug thanx for everything everyone have these moments and i want to thank you for giving that messege to the world that youre never alone youre helping so much people thank you jack 3 i know exactly how you feel jackaboy i love you and so do all your subs you are not ever alone im so glad youre better i first watched cassie gloom play this but then i saw that jack updated this too this game is incredible and i want to thank you for playing such a wonderful game this made me go check all my messages i didnt know that i needed this speech until i heard it thank you so much jakesean for the beautiful words beautiful video so glad for the sharing and the comments jack is such a wholesome boi and this is such a wholesome game and just listen to his message because he says it so well i heavily relate to may thats actually my middle name this hit way too close to home this game was so good and i was very glad to hear your thoughts at the end and know whats been going on its good that youve been valuing your own mental health more i like this new jack you are both inspirational and funny and your words speak to thousands thank you this shits fucked up and scary jack jack are u willing to help me 429 that is a picture of fall out boy jack your not usless your the opposite you make this world a way better place dude i played this game on my laptop recently and then you go and play it too w h a t the thumbnail looks so cuteee jack thank u for every thing you do and never change do things you want to do not what we want you to do love you and i agree with every thing you said kittenbunny3708eariemike that scene when his in front of the door reminds me of sayori was waiting for my high five okay so im not able to watch this video because it will most likely trigger my depression let me explain ever since the start of 2019 ive been more optimistic which helped my depression i havent had a depressive episode in about 89 months now but every now and again i have the words we all die in the end in my head at random times well its not really random because one of my friends who is sadistic at times brings me down and triggered my depression and triggers now the voice in my head i choose not to listen to it but basically me when im not havjng a depressive episode is completely different to me when im depressed etika rip my thoughts are with his family and friends commiting suicide made me realize that it can happen to anyone and im scared that it will happen to me i definitely dont like suicide when im not having a depressive episode and when im having an episode ive tried to seek professional help health texting serivce and failed because i need a phon damn mays past is about as relatable as it gets for me i used to be really good in school but now because i dont put in effort its getting tough and my parents are on me about it 247 so now to destress from their constant yelling i play games and write and then they take those things away from me im not depressed or anything but damn if ive ever seen a relatable character may is it i literally just started playing this game a day before omg fall out boy 431 it is relieving to see someone my age struggling with the exact same issues as i do people think that when one reaches almost 30 years of age they got all figured out but once they open up youll see they struggle just as much as you do if everyone were more open we all could stress less about things and help more each other things get better even living with depression i made small steps every day and now i see the long path i already walked dont give up reach out for help much love for everyone struggling out there this all feels so familiar didnt mean to go so deep today did ya thats life though and we love you for being real his speeches are just as powerful as narutos this helped me a lot today im crying because of the speech god thank you jack i love the game too i cant get over the art style its so beautiful not a funny joke but this is doki doki all over again hey you reading this yeah you youre awesome i love watching games like this watching other games is always fun but these in particular are the kinds of games i like to see play out without my intervention to see how others function in regard to the topics of depressions and suicide im definitely going to buy it though to support the developer look i dont know if youll see this but you have been one of the most funny people ive ever seen and its made me happy so keep the good work up so the suffering gets so much worse thank you and like you said that weights on people the music fits so well im crying nowi want to and am growing with you i hope i never fail to make someones day better and you give me motivation for that and many other things thank you so much nobody will ever know my gratitude for what you have done take all the breaks that you need because knowing that you are ok and having fun in life is better than a video have a great day a series game i think you will like that has this stuff and other real world problems is dsir the real world isnt in social media its around you talk to your neighbors make new friends so its never stopped ik this game is beautiful but i want to know the music you dont know me obviously but believe me that you are a beautiful human being i dont know who said youre disconnected but they are wrong some people just want to say things to try and hurt others you are deep and hilarious and make my familys day i needed this so bad sometimes with mental illness you feel so alone even when you are not however not just this game but what you said helped me today i wanted to end things on saturday and it isnt the first time it probably wont be the last my family helped me get through but this helped me too thank you jacksepticeye keep being youre amazing self in this crazy life we all have that is too short i need help this games describes me at the moment noises are sooooo loud and family make it worse gosh life sucks and the reason we dont realize us because nobody comes out with their emotions i keep typing a way too long paragraph but then deleting it it feels like such a waste of time and it doesnt even matter literally this is gonna get washed away thanks sean we appreciate you thats enough to make someone cry jack guess who did the art and nobody knows so its not stopped is it me or i cried alot im so glad i watched this video i love the speech and i really needed that today ive been going through a lot lately and im feeling morbidly depressed but hearing sean talk about his struggles made me feel so understood for everyone reading this you are valid your feelings are valid and there are many people ready and willing to help always keep trying if you are going through something right now or just need someone to talk to im right here first ending kills herself because you just run off on her inhale craaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwllllllllliiiiiiiiiiiing iiiiiiiiiiiiiiin myyyyy ssskiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin these wooouuuunds they willll not heaaalllllllllll the plushie is dogsheen from the pusheen the cat collection also virtual hugs for sean jack we need a hair tutorial for your pony with that wave in the front you said everyone deserved happiness and to live their best life but what about rapists and murderers do they still deserve to be happy or did they throw that right away when they did what they did so eventually it leads to suicide and self harm may when i was young i was good at everything so my parents didnt push me to try harder now im in a rut and my parents are forcing me to do more i was once very close to this situation thankfully my mother is a loving understanding woman who was there for me and worsen the situation when i contemplated suicide i have still never seen a therapist but its been years since i seriously contemplated suicide so i dont think im in any sort of danger there at least for now but things are always changing and the suffering gets even worse when our brains are drowning in work ok im only 3 minutes into watching this and im already in my feels girl 1 and he cheated on me girl2 why are you looking up girl1 i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars dont pay mind to what others think so many people are made happy by you being you and thats what matters you having fun have a great day sean its the thought that people arent getting any attention so it makes the suffering so so much worse me thank you her no thank you me uno reverse card no u her puts down 2 reverse cards no u has a grin me nani puts down shoked picachu card her snaps me wtf are you doin both you and this game has moved me so much thank you sean for this video i agree dark shit man i hate that people gives up

matter so much some people really needed to hear that didnt know i needed that this comment section is incredibly wholesome d this video was absolutely awesome could you make another video on this game trying to find the other endings like texting goth gf but not going on the date or not answering till the end or maybe theres more beginnings like the dream that hadnt happened before such a cool game such gorgeous art such a gorgeous message i love what it brought out of you these moment are the best now i feel like that the world is not as bad as i see it there are people that cares and loves even if you dont realise it you know i played this game yesterday i decided to sit outside and read instead of being on electronics all day like i normally am and i felt so much more like myself thank you for this video and every video you make jack were all glad to have you to look up to and so grateful that youre still around did anyone else see the scars on mays arms and how she went from wearing long sleeves and trying to hide her arms to wearing short sleeves and not trying to hide her arms can you please play more of outer wilds one cannot just leave people haniging like that thank

called me the other day and cried asking if i was ok cause her dad told her i self harm i feel like a awful sister because she thinks its her fault thank you jack i know this is going to sound like i have no emotion behind this but in reality i do recently ive been dealing with depression and anxiety and im not even sure i actually have both but i used to be so happyso carefree but now i cant even smile anymore ive become so numb to emotion that i dont even know if im human or alive if you read this or when you do i want to know how you dealt with itbecause i cant and its tearing me apart jack

really helped me i know you probably wont see this comment and all but we love you damn this game made me cry too much mental health problems are no joke thank you sean for everything you said it really touched me i felt the same way as may for a year or two in middle school but i can tell everyone now as long as you hold onto everything you do have you can make it through this feeling now that i have held onto my family and friends i have realized i have so much more then i knew i have a family who is coming back together and we have been being so much more loving i have been getting closer to my friends even though i wont see them much because im going to different high schools and now i have never been happier because i have the best boyfriend in the world that cares for me and

blair witch game when it comes out i love it when sean starts to talk about his own experiences to relate to us like i dont know it gives a better bond if thats makes sense i just wanna say thanks sean you dont know it but your videos always put a smile on my face and it makes me feel a whole lot better what happened to the whipcrash i miss that sound oh dear god its my sisters birthday oo watching your videos was and is one of the things that always makes me feel better you did a great job at explaining stuff thanks jacksepticeye this really hit home for me because for the last 5 months ive felt depressed and disconnected from every one and 2 months ago i started opening up to my friends and family and all of them have been really supportive and understanding opening up and talking can make a world of difference i still feel depressed a little but no where near how i felt before and im looking at the positive for my future and im also happy with how youve changed and value yourself more because the one person who it means the most in valuing you is yourself sorry for the long winded comment but your talk just really resonated with me and wanted to get it out there and i hope you see this sean how i reach out if i dont have anyone to speak aww jackie boy im so sorry you went through that too im so very thankful that you were able to push through and keep on keeping on we all love you so so much and would be devastated if you were gone we are family all of us subbies are your family we love you dearly thank you for sharing that moment of your life im sure youve helped millions with your story i am one of them i am in a very dark place right now but hearing how you persevered helps a lot thank you in case you were curious the other game made by angela he was called you left me dont worry we love you all we will always be there for you when you guys and even you sean need it these games are very relateable to me wow just something about your speech at the end really got to me jack and everything you said is so completely true ive been fighting depression for a really long time and ive recently been able to finally start pulling my life together ive kinda been able to do it on my own because ive just had the encouragement from my boyfriend that ive never gotten from anyone else before he did nothing else but encourage me and tell me i was doing a great job and was getting so far and last year if i told myself id be where i am right now i would have just laughed i had pretty much given up on everything last year my grades dipped my relationships were rocky my world was crumbling down around me and i did think about just leaving this cruel world but i left my ex who was kinda the source of a lot of my problems i got some really toxic people out of my life and i finally felt free and not like there was a weight on my shoulders my boyfriend now helps me makes me feel like i ur eyes is like a blooming flower but when they bloom even more it makes us say awwww and when there is a lot of water poured on ur eyes u start to wither away but you try your best to entertain others even in difficult times ps dont forget we all are there for you that speech this hits real hard for me you were right angela he as in the gender he boy man he in your speech at parts i feel the same things you were talking about i feel that even if i do get help from a profesional im going to go in go out and i will just feel the same that helped so thank you when the video is 50 minutes long and the gameplay is only 30 minutes long but this was nice came for the game stayed for the speech the music was real jack you are one of the most humble and down to earth people that i know of and your journey through difficult times inspired me to work through my own problems and take time to reflect on what was important to me you shouldnt feel bad for taking a step back you dont live on the internet none of us do we live in a world of sunshine and darkness flowers and thorns water and fire it is real and demanding and beautiful we need to experience it even the parts of it that scare us the best part is that we also dont have to do it alone whether it is your guardian or friend or a stranger in the same queue as you or even an animal or pet who let you touch them there is always someone or something that will help you though it all you have to do is step back and look thank you jack for being the example pma ok my random little speech is done sorry about the long read losing instrest shoiloh dynasty is it weird that my name is evan and im sad just like the game im not asking for anything i just thought it was cool me everyday i just want to die but then im stopped by the thought of the pain illcause others alone overlooked and ignored closest friends never noticing never asking strangers going about their day never hearing the cry of pain no one listens to what i have to say i am unwanted unneeded unnecessary unimportant unnoticed with the knot in hand a forest stretching for miles before me if i use a tree there nobody will be around to see or even care the world goes on without me unknowing unaware they dont even know i exist the light fades now shrouding me concealing me eyes which never saw me the snap and no life around to hear fading into darkness the light goes out all movement stops all sounds cease the world goes on without me unmoved uncaring i love how sean pulls the mic close for the narration you should play the arcana its a visual novel like ddlc but it has a mini game and you can pick who to date after chapter five or something its a great game and i recommend it because the art style is amazing and the plot is great too uwu i know i have to keep myself away from these kinds of videos but i cant i really like seeing other peoples stories to help guide me in the right path to keep me away from doing something that would well you could guess what i mean these videos always help me even when i have knife to skin they always make me stop thank you jack i guess you saved my life jack is whipped for may i know youre not youre old self anymore but i like that youre changing for the better be yourself dont be someone youre not true fans will stay with you no matter what finally sean you should be damn proud of yourself the hardest yet most precious love you can recieve is that from yourself you owe anybody else nothing but yourself everything nice art style jack your amazing and you havent changed in a way that at least i dont see as a bad thing but as a good thing youve grown a lot since when i first saw you and its a great thing and i know you probably wont read this but youve done amazing things and i think youve gotten a lot better at the youtube stuff im sorry for wasting your time but you do good no bad thanks this video means a lot hey jack great vid but when is the next outter wilds games and everything else like these makes me want to have a friend who cares for real and would be there for me when im feeling depressed and down note i havent been watching jacka boy for a while anyway where the hell was the high five i cried watching i myself has gone through a similar experience im eternally thankful to those who pulled me back from the seemingly endless black hole thank you jack your videos are part of the reason why i managed to pull through in those miserable nights things will become better if u talk to friends huh well there is no point of writing this because no one will see it but i dont have a friend yep no onei have some guys that i hang out with them but they dont care about my life my life is so shit that i cant pretend to be ok its showing on my face and body im a 20yo guy and im in university so a lot of ppl around me and btw i didnt say the guys i hang out dont care about me because i felt like it its like whenever u had a shity day it shows on ur face u cant help it and whenever that happen to me and i meet them they get angry and tell me to stop it because it brings the mood down so i just leave and they get angry again because i left them and go this is one of my 100 problems and thats y im antisocial i just hate ppl i fuckin hate them dude change is life if youre not constantly changing jack youre not humanand youre not the jack i know if you dont keep evolvinghappy for you man and yeah my 2017 was shit too i wish i had someone to talk to it is so hard to be alone and misirable i have depression and cant speak out about it because all people close to me think i just want attention and turned their back on me it is sad how noone cares until something bad happens jack you should play the second game of just a normal lost phone i usually skip your videos where you start talking but this really hit home so hard the one time im glad i stopped and listened i wanted to give up so many damn times and here you go and make a video that is so damn relevant in my life thank you jack thank you sean for making this video im trying i will keep trying i cried and now im trying thank you for this sean i needed it if you take a day away from social media youre going to miss fucking nothing i didnt realise how much i needed to hear that this is actual a really relatable game for me just another cool kettle super elegant pretty tomato inside cake entertaining your eyes im feeling like im going through this game right now every day is doing what makes me sad then passing out because i cant fall asleep because of these dark thoughts and all over again this video game and speech that you gave jack gave me

died 1 year ago and my uncle committed suicide a week before he died and i had looked heavily up at both of them now im stuck in a place where there is no sun im just saying you help so many people everywhere i relate deeply to this game because i stopped two of my friends running into the street when a truck ran by many friends helped but i felt like shit after because they were both crying because i had said things like if you jump out there i wont hesitate to jump with you okay sorry for ranting i started watching this last night but i couldnt finish it listening to sean this morning was something i really needed last night was rough for me emotionally and his words really help around what you were talking about at 3700 this is very true i just want to thank you because you are so brave to talk about all this a lot of people who dont have internet attention cant talk about people like you who have influence and talk about topics like this are helping to bring attention to it so

hard i know that seans speech defiantly helped someone out there who was struggling with the world and didnt know how to handle it it wasnt just rambling it was motivational for all people who are struggling with life thanks jack for being you i love angela hes gamesvisual novels not only is her art style lovely but the subjects tend to be mental health and wlw women loving woman experiences often the two intertwined as a lot of it is based on her own experiences as well which is really nice because both of those subjects also apply to me and a lot of other ppl especially w the two subjects together seen as many wlw do also struggle w mental health its nice to see something you can relate to and something that has the ability to put people that may not have the same experiences kinda in your place it feels nice that her stuff can sort of put a concrete visual n stuff to feelings n situations i have a hard time explaining i guess hah this meant something to me it really did what do you do when youve felt this way for the better part of ten years you only get one life budists observe oh god sorry i made a meme out of this i shouldent have but i couldent hold it k thank you sean the speech means alot someone be my friend pls im alone thank you for the speech you gave it meant a lot to me i go a lot through the things you mentioned especially wanting to be a singer and putting out music and seeing nothing big is happening to me and everyone out there is doing so much better than me and all but what matters is that im trying my best to get there one day but im not gonna lie sometimes it gets hard because you wanna give up everything and do absolutely nothing but im trying to take of myself and have faith that everything will be okay one day but seriously thank you for everything not only for what you said but for putting out videos and makes us all have a great time and forget about everything we have going on for a while im gonna support you and your channel for a long time im sure so keep doing what you do best on your own terms im sure everyone will still support and love you regardless i love how he talks for 20 mins xd hey jack this game really helped me realize that im doing my life wrong and i should put more effort in to be what i want to be so thank you 937 yeah sohe broke up with meaha why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars my friend commited suicide a few months ago and ever since then i havent been the same mentally ive had dark thoughts but im fine now its just been getting worse and worse as other friends have told me theyre self harming or feeling suicidal and ive helped them as much as i can but i cant save them i just wish my friend couldve seen that light i want to give you all a message people can help you but only you can save yourself and people do care and they always will im going through this and it hurts and thx this man played a game showing about these issues affecting people all over the world gave a 20 min speech and even left a link to a hotline in the description be like sean sean is a good person congrats on trending gaming dude im not extremely active on your channel so idk if this happens often with ur vids but anyways nice vid too earth is our school life is the test suicide is skipping school so stay in school there is more then heaven and hell after death i know many dont believe maybe you dont but they are real perhaps not what people imagine them to be but they are heaven hell rebirth ghost recycling heaven is real there is no money everyone works together to improve eachothers lives hell is real it is endless suffering rebirth can happen your soul can be absorbed by a newborn after its first breath ghosts are trapped in the astral plane and are usually anchored by unfinished business recycling the void oblivion your soul falls into the core of the planet is melteddown and all traces of its previous lives are erased as well as its sins and virtues not some alligator hippo thing like in egyptian mythos that eats your soul but it works almost the same souls have different magnetic properties planets aka celestials have magnetic fields virtuous sou just returned to this channel wheres the fucking flat cap please sub to me im a new youtuber its benji playz i suffer from severe depression and anxiety myself and it

not believe them no matter whos saying it are you trying to make it work not even necessarily your hardest but are you trying even a little bit yes then there you go and if you arent trying and youre

every move is not that easy props to all the youtubers yall doing amazing this is sad because you never know your bestfriend could kill herhimself its really sad not know whats wrong everything

to home for me im in almost exactly her situation at the moment and i really needed and appreciated your speech more importantly what i really wanted to say was this dont listen to people saying youre irrelevant or that your channel is dying because hello im new i only ever came for a few videos but now im here for good because i love you and your attitude andwell your videos feel like a hug thats the best way i can put it we love you sean never ever stop being incredible where was my high five in the intro i played this the moment it came out it was soo good im not going to lie this crushed me i was having a bad day as it was and this didnt help seeing sen cry and i hate it sean ur not gonna see this but u are fucking amazing you are a man to look up too the way u talk about this sort of stuff helps tremendously this is why you are my favourite from one irish man to another is bre liom t dearthir hey we are so thankful for how kind and caring you are you have helped so much for so many people including me you really care and are a real person and you can tell how you care and are real by what you do for people all the charity live streams and more and all the long talks at the end of these types of videos and of course the way you talk to people when they meet you please keep being you we all love you the way you are and no matter what always will the way you were before would be hard so hard but that was the guy when i got in a fight and was slightly sad or angry then id laugh now your the person who i go to when i feel like dying and then i can laugh and then i can sleep soundly your amazing no matter what and your still so amazing and active that it amazes me please no matter what be you pma the ending message after the game gave me feels dude youre really saving my depression thanks one of my favourite songs is in this game it makes me cry because of the history me and this song has its weird its called losing interest by shiloh dynasty and itssvd youve been there for me sean way more than ive actually realized so thank you i dont understand how talking to someone would help me i need this music track its so chill and beautiful wattpad exists may let me in let me iiiiiin loved this video and what you said at the end this is good word my dude i wish i had someone like the girl in this game 3 harry potter fanfiction everyone who has seen wattpad aaah shit here we go again thank you so much for talking about it this video is the whole fcking reason is why i watch jacky boi cus hes always supportivemotivational i remember playing this game and it was amazing its great to see you playing it hey jack when im felling down you help me back up and you do so much for your community hell your motivation helped me have the strength to get back with my girlfriend and you have been such an inspiration to me and my friends and you do cry reverse card its called a gun to the head ya know i saw the title and thought he was going to read missed messges i understand that you shouldnt just do yt or any other hobby for money you have to enjoy it but when i make videos and no one watches them people judge me and tell me that what im doing is never gonna amount to anything i never said it was gonna amount to anything which then makes something that i do for fun just depressing to them if what youre doing doesnt make money or doesnt make you famous then youre worthless im not gonna call out these peoples names but theyre usually the people really close to me imagine having a hobby and people constantly judging what you do with it its the absolute worse feeling ever but jacks speech inspired me to keep on going thanks sean its not always about the money i know a lot of people might hate this comment but this is why i try to not ever hate on famous people no matter how cringy they are like jojo siwa or jacob sartorious we all made fun of them so much bc they were cringy teenagers but we dont know whats going on in their lives and getting so much hate as a teenager would i dont know about yall at least affect me thanks for coming to my tedtalk im really proud of you sean dang thus video probably sums up why i look up to jack he works so hard for something that makes people happy and gives them a friend or even just a distraction in life even though he mostly entertains us through his content he still makes us realize that he is also a human and makes us realize that even if he works hard for us and gives so much for other people he can still realize that even if he does all this things for others he still takes care of himself and his state and because of all of the things he does all the things he showed us it made a good and wholesome community dang i really love this hooman we all witnessed how he improved and how he treats hinself nowadays iwe see the happiest version of jack so far and me personally i am proud of him he deserves so much you said that you changed and people react kinda negatively to it but seriously just lately i thought he changed so much he seems better now and changed for the good good that you started valueing yourself more now much much love looking at moving trees tree grows legs and runs away me wellthats interesting chracter enjoying writing poetry and the quiet life jack that is the most hipster thing i have ever heard this legit made me tear up several times such a powerful message this this as someone who has always admired you and your hard work sean i know ow it feels maybe its a 90s baby thing but we all seem to work way too hard hoping to be able to make it without ever knowing was it is were taught our value is tied up in the opinions of the masses and its so bullshit real people real relationships and activities that are actually fulfilling thats what actually brings the best life ive wanted all my life to write fulltime 36 hours a week and work on writing business stuff and i just wanted to say that seeing you do your art helps me know that i can do mine and thats ok just this whole video right to my heart and im just crying sean you probably wont see this but youre great that speech was amazing i never actually went through dark times but many of my friends do i want to help them with all my heart but i dont know how scared that with one move i fuck it up and then people can say you cant fuck things up but i think i really made bad choices they always tell me how bad it is and how much i am making it worse i told them i would never forget them i showed them that they can lean on me but somehow it just doesnt work it doesnt help and i make it worse does someone know how to handle with depressed friends wow that sounded wrong xd how i can help them because they deserve the world they have made me happy and how i am today i want to give them what they gave me sen you are an immensely amazing motivational speaker you freestyled that off the top of your head i have not heard a speech as good as that in years i dealt with a bit of depression and just watching youre positivity pulled me up on my feet and said stay here jeremiah youre safe you have changed my life and i will never forget what you did for me so i say from the absolute bottom of my heart thank you so much so like there are 4 endings no pressure tho is no one gonna talk about the fob picture he should have a part 2 me sees video meh one hour later me sees video again than sees the name jacksepticeye impossible this happened to a satisfactory video happiness is just another mask it takes a true master to see behind it and see what truth looks like whenever that is being said happy or upset people hid them self in fear of judgment fear of rejection fear is a powerful emotion one few can resist but those who can are the real heroes of our lives old jack meets green hair jack what happened green hair jack meets pony tail jack what the fuck happened pony tail jack laugh holy shit this is the first time that i heard about etika i was just watching him a month ago and now hes dead rip bro and also luv you jack you always help me in my darkest times love from the philippines dude your hair is not green yet thank you jacksepticeye because whenever i wake up i think about that i can just end it all for me then and there and that nobody would even care about me but because of new people i meet everyday i dont want to make them sadmad and i want to see more nicegood people everyday and hopefully people help me to do it on my own and i day i can hopefully see the hole world so thank you so much jacksepticeye for being one of the people to help me motivational speaker much xd ps good but long xd comment incoming xd gee this game hit me way way home it brought me to tears cause i kinda saw myself being may i know how it is to feel worthless a lot of times how my life isnt worth it how lost i was in life a year ago and more this was my mindset everyday every time you wake up you just feel empty like your life means nothing i was nothing i was not special i dont matter i didnt know what i wanted to do i was so lost to the point that everyday i kept debating with myself if i should end it all there take my life and end my suffering i didnt see my life going anywhere so why keep living but that was a year ago right now i know what i want to do and i know where to go the people that ive met throughout last year really helped me to know where i want to go im so very thankful and glad that they came cause if they came a little later i wouldnt be here writing this i ai hey jack when are you dying your hair green come on u have to very wholesome thanks for the thoughts keep being yourself dude at times we can all think that nobody cares but reach out to somebody it might surprise you just the way sean speaks it eases me i feel like there are also people who go through this kind of stuff and i can relate from when people forgot my birthday for the past 4 years in august sean and thanks for always caring for us your community and that speech made me feel like there is more to life than what we think love you guys tho all of you been a subscriber of jacksepticeye since 2015 and i love his videos please support my brothers channel play with xander thank you all for the support sorry sean in 2017 i was a depressed third grader who nobody really looked at as a person in 2018 i felt the exact same but i was getting a bit better by making a few new friends in 2019 some of those friends are already moving away from my life and im not the kid in my class who really knows whats going on people dont usually tell me things because im not really looked at like an important person right now i hope my next few years in life will get better thank you sean i really needed to hear this today everything you said about us should go for you too im glad youre happier you deserve it the things you said is what i needed to hear and what everyone needs to hear im not very good with words but just thank you for everything you mean a lot to so many people and we all appreciate you 3 when sen is talking at the end about how he likes to create an environment so that viewers feel like we know him better and feel like were there with a person instead of watching an entertainer in a video hes describing exactly how i felt about his videos for the past four or five years every time my parents are like why do you like his videos so much i tried to explain this to them and they never understand until i showed them one of his videos they saw the way he acts in them and i think they got it i just want you to know sen thats the environment youre trying to create its working thats also why i always call him sen and not jack because jack is an entertainer but i dont ever want to lose sight of the person behind him i dont ever want to just think of him as an entertainer so i call him by his real name it makes me feel more like im talking about a person and less like im talking about a character we here for ya we got memes to cure depression now that i watched the hole video the thing is you are still you you are bubbly energetic sweary excitedbut the only difference is youre happier and thats what we all care about hey jack i really enjoyed this video what huh im not crying so inspirational that was the best speech ive ever listened to in a long time your the best when i

i wasnt accepted but my boyfriend helped me and he never regretted it me and him are no longer together but were still friends i know the point of your talk was to help us rather than talk about yourself but i really hope you know that you could skip a day of uploading or whatever you need i get that youd lose however many views that video what have gotten and thus the money but wed still be here after you upload more consistently more than any other youtuber ive watched you even used to upload 2 videos a day for such a long time i hope you understand how appreciated and loved you are and not just the crazy bastard that yells on our screen a lot heh talking to people about things its cowardly to me to me it is a sign of failure a weakness if anyone would like to talk to me about this just ask because i dont see being open as being helpfull i have tried antidepressants it backfired i just became more suicidal i was worse than before i dont i dont understand why people are so happy all the time i am not suicidal now but as sean said what would happen if you did kill yourself what would happen would you pass on and be better or be trapped in your sorrow forever to be eternally cursed to burn in your own sins and mistakes happiness is a reaction not a emotion a emotion is a addiction a addiction is a weakness a weakness is a part of your life that you cant fix that is how i see things again if you want to talk to me go ahead it wont go anywhere in life not to me and certainly not for you because you could do anything else take a brake to relax spend time to your own not able to finish the one chief hope everyone gets the message behind it though jack starts game then sees pride flag me are you fu whatever just let them be true fans know this owwwwww pink lightning when i heard may say youre a good friend and i just wanted to let you know since life is so short i was like oh shit shes going to die because thats exactly what i would say if i was planning on killing myself and i didnt realise it until i saw someone say it i played this there will be some days where i feel like i can get nothing done and i thought there was nothing good i could do for the world but i never express that and i just keep the moments where im sad locked in but the moments when im happy out i am so glad that i have started to make animations because it literally burns away at the sad feelings and i have so much fun doing it and love having a good outcome after working on an really long scene and i feel like if i never started making animations i would not be here today this video was really deep d brought to tears by both the game and seans words its crazy feeling really emotional and even more inspired by seanthis is why he is a massive role model in my life 3 3305 till the end is where i like to call it therapy with jack he can teach you a good life lesson watch this dont just go after the game just wanted to say it gets better i was depressed cut myself

feelings of old not all days are good and not all days bad you have to push through thenegative actsof the world the world is not the same without you the creators the community everyone makes a differencewhat happens when you die iknowthat theones that love you will miss you keanu reeves have agreat day everyone thanks sean i relieve that i watch this mmm i had this thought and it happen since long ago i dont want to be anything i dont have any motivation to be something or i just do what i can do until two years ago it wasnt bother me at all because i dont want to be anything so there was nothing can disappoint me people say im really looks like a chill person cause i never get stress if something bad happen but since two years ago this feeling just doesnt go away i dont know what it is but it doesnt feel good at all im questioning if this is really what i want i feel so tired im affraid of tomorrow like i have to do this again im so tired it feels like a cycle that i dont like everytime i wake up i just think when will the day end so i can sleep sleep will be my runaway place one day even sleep couldnt make me feel better i felt like i want to end all of this hope seems so far away i dont think theres future to me now im better i don does anyone else think that the date was kind of cheesy i mean they were basically just exchanging omg ur the cutests and no yous you are amazing sen and whoever is reading no reason to doubt yourself i could see the tears in his eyes xxxxx well yesterday i lost my best friend no they didnt die we just collectively decided that it would be best for us both to never see each other again and now im just really sad cuz i really dont have anyone to talk to and i miss them so much sean youll probably never see this but ive been watching since happy wheels days and will always watch your videos and me as one person will always support you i mean ive thought about this type of stuff like would anyone miss me since i was 6 still occasionally do but i sit down and watch your videos and enjoy seeing your content and just shut down my personal thoughts and watch and forget it for today but i just wanna say im glad your in a better mental place and support you no matter what sean has the best speeches ever everything is true thank you sean its kind of funny how someone ive never met can go through what i do im always tired lately and easily aggravated and i hate it because it ruins how i act and i feel like i must keep a mask on who i am what i like and that kills me i also feel like i cant understand anything anymore because nothing seems to connect i want to get into art and do animation but my parents would never support it so i picked something i dont know if i want to try and do anymore it seems interesting but i just dont have the motivation for it where my art work my stories make me excited my writing sure theyre loosely based in fanfiction you could move a name there and no one would know the difference and thats what i love about the stories i have written but i cant bury myself into my writing and i want to because they go through so many things and the characters would be loved because i know what people like to see in a sense i feel like i cant be myself all the time im ok but am i the only one who relates to me at 2725 really hard i was gonna download this on steam because i didnt think it was worth it time to see if it actually was you can tell everything you say in this video comes straight from the heart thank you for taking the time to discuss this im sure it means a lot to so many people your a good man sean why was 2017 his worst year hello sen i just wanted to thank you for the talk at the end of the video i dont know how to explain this but you just talking made me feel better and i just wanted you to know that i appreciate it lots i have a friend who has gone through some serious shit i want to be psychologist so i talk to them i do my best to help them even though we can only text they and everyone i meet say im so happy i can only smile and im just so bubbly i tried to harm myself i tried to kill myself ive thought about hanging myself i thought i was a mistake to my parents things changed and i was a bit better later on i discovered i was pansexual and transgender i knew i wouldnt be accepted by my friends and parents they accepted me but my parents dont know keep going please take it from a fellow irish man no one here in ireland can speak as motivationaly as u can this helped me a lot thank you so much the art in this game is phenomenal i really enjoyed this video please play more games like this or longer games but dont feel the need to overwork yourself take more time to produce this sort of content please so he broke up with me why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was forty eight dollars we love you jack see you change and grow is one of the nice things about following a creator for a long time i cried from that speech its okay to cry its okay to feel sad its okay to get help when you need it its okay to talk about your thoughts and feelings its okay to open up you are not alone you are loved i would rather you pull away and save your mental health than keep burning yourself out to the point that you cant do this anymore youre so inspirational and amazing thank you so much for making people feel better and for all the advice cos everything youre saying is the truth at my school last year we lost someone and it hit me really hard i was beating myself up about it because i saw him the last day he was at school and he seemed unusually quiet i might have been able to help him but i just thought he was tired since it was the first class of the day so if someone around you seems quiet or sad or tired check in with them dont let them be sad be their friend because now i wish i had gotten more time with him inb4 jack gets copystriked for including her singing happy birthday to you i love when sean is himself in these types of serious videos he always comes off as good genuine person by blooming a conversation and telling us of his own experiences i also love that he always puts a link in the description for anyone who needs help or to let them start getting help somewhere keep up the good work dude thanks for helping us to keep fighting c thank you for the chat at the end sean thank you for sharing with us but most importantly thank you for taking care of yourself turn off your brain so thats why people suicide i love what you said at the end of the video thank you sean you are

privateif you need a long breakif you need to do anythingits ok with me i dont want to be a burden to you oh im sharing this thank you sean jacksepticeye then gets copyright striked for featuring the happy birthday song bullyputs someone into a locker jack you deserve happiness this helped me out a lot am i the only one that thought that the thumbnail looked like it was life is strange jacksepticeye jack i just want to say that ive been reading the comments and there are so many people who were touched inspired and moved by this video so many people talking about their experiences so many people sharing love and encouragment and so many people taking healthy steps and sharing success stories this kind of thing is important i cannot tell you how many comments i read where people said how much they love this kind of content and how they appreciate when you get serious and real seriously its a lot we dont talk about mental health enough in this society there were people sharing programs and writing poetry in the comments i just wanted to reiterate these videos are important and they are a balm for many thank you for all that you do in making this community what it is why is this reminds me of my life 2153 this game is so good tbh its kinda my life but in 2019 i changed so much i aint depressed anymore after 3 years im happy i even got a bride haha this game hits your deepest spots in life sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself is to tell someone else i prefer this you than the old one am i retarded i subscribed a a very long time ago and i just realized u have blue eyes this happened to me my girlfriend her name is maya and she helped me notice that im bisexual and i actually love her so much its hard and when it got to the funeral part i cried bc it was the same thing for me on what sean said her and i were such good friends and my bff us three were the bestest of friends and a week after school started a day after my friends birthday on the 4th of february 2019 she killed herself she hung herself and i kept thinking that its not true shes still here theyre lying but im truly hurt and i just cant stand it i was so in love with her that its hard to find anyone else in life to date not just girls anyone and im so lonely i have heaps of friends but i never have that level of happiness that i had with her i even had just like a week or 2 ago i thought for the first actual time that i wanted to kill myself but i really dont want to im sorry i told you this but i needed to let this out thank you for listening sorry for taking up you but theres this thing with reaching out to friends and family and saying all of those thing about trying to work out the problems that you get better at sounding convincing or going through minimal amounts of motions to seep alright and they you become your problems you become a person who talks about getting better but never actually does and you feel even worse and more powerless inside that youve felt before and you cant talk about it because everybody expects you to pick up the pace and get yourself together but you just become more closed and alone till you dont matter anymore to anyone and then you can hopefully just go unnoticed when i saw the dog at 237 i only think of yeontan she sent a fall out boy meme jack dont ever go back you are so great as how you are 3 love how you gave that speach just off the top of your head what are the songs in the background called it was 48 now that in the game they are talking about what they dream of i noticed i feel like i havent dreamed in years completely forgot dreams even exist this video and game makes me wish there was more than one like button this game is soooo amazing can we take a second to appreciate the trans flag in the beginning roses are red violets are blue sean is inspirational and you should learn him and be that too game suicide warning me ahaha i wanna do that d meh tbh there are too many miserable people in this world and we could miss some i have known people who committed suicide too but its just what life is like these days im so sorry saun its going to be ok i care about you everyone cares about you and you know you have to push through it i couldnt even watch most of this because its soo sad but so true and its really sad tht people go through this this hit me in the feels so hard im watching this again because i both enjoyed and felt it relatable thank you for this at 620 i know the songgggg k but that conversation gave me eye herpes agh damn this reminded me of etika again so sad to see him leave this way in the words of keanu what happens when you die i know the ones that love us will miss us seans skill in voice acting is unconventionally talented compared to other gaming youtubers as soon as i saw the note on the door tears so many tears jack speaking chinese is a mood this is giving me doki doki literature club vibes hahai missed that game edit 1wow someone actually liked my comment thanks3 edit 2i got 20 likes and a message i love you guys this is my first time having more than just 3 likes 3 amen jacksepticeye i feel the same about myself and the youtube channel that i started recently ive been suffering from depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts and self harm sean you have made me smile every time i see a new youtube video i always smile and say what is sean up to today i love you keep posting also im only 13 i am crying i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars thankyou for this i played this on my own before watching and it made me cry hey look at those crooked teeth tears up ha ha ha moans cries i feel you sniffles someone to talk to is perfectespcialy when your feeling depressed i know from personal exerience i feel like if im feeling this way im fine becuse every one thinks this im not one to cut myself becuse i hate when i peirce skin but when i get dark and deppresed i scratch myself with my nails or a plastic knife i had seen counciling for awhile but i felt like i didnt need it like my life was together but even if i did go back i feel it wouldnt do anything im just deepresed and as long i dont act upon these newer suicidal thoughts im normal and ok dont feel sorry for me no need i just feel empty with nothing to do no contributions to life just a kid who has a long past of suicide and is feeling it again i think that counciling or a mental hospital would not work becuse i tried before nothing can help meim alone no where else to turnnothing will work im just a lost cause am this game sucked no wonder its free on steam idk how i felt about this bruh i just played this game wtf 335 when you dont have the horses in the back when he said dont let the emotions control you i instantly felt like a dissapointment even thought he doesnt know me he wouldnt know if i watched the last video or not or if ive been subscribed for years or not but this has helped me realize i am that way once he talked about the noise being there more to hurt you than help i took a breathe and realized the thoughts werent and arent the truth but i still listened thank you so much because its time to put my earplugs in and ignore those thoughts and listen to the love i always listened when i told myself i was never good enough for anything you know even if that is true i need to at least be good enough for myself again thank you so much sen sometimes people like me wont talk to people because we dont want to put our stress on someone else or we think they wont understand so hearing a large influencer understand helps soooooo much love you for that 3 he doesnt know who junji ito is waaaaaaat im speechless except those two words and that and this 4057 thats impossible its so fuckin aesthetic omg i used to talk more about my feelings and sadness around the time i started noticing it more in myself but my friends and family would always tell me how much of a burden i was to them and how i needed to stop because i just made them sad that caused me to push back and hide it which only made it worse when i started watching you i realized i wasnt the only one and youve helped me through so much i know you wont see this but i just want you to know how thankful i am that youre here and you show everyone that their not alone and to never give up you were there for me and so many other people through the bad times and i just wanted to thank you for that pma mother futrucker can you play the penn and teller vr game i feel like im really glad i watched this video i think im going to go outside for a while thank you sean thanks i didnt know how much i needed this thank you for talking about these things i feel like theres some good advice and i will take off more time to look at ducks and quiet my thoughts that is why you take 6 shots of whiskey instead of taking your own life youd barely remember anything about suicide or depression the worst kind of sad is not being able to explain why edit i didnt think so many people would relate to me and its sad knowing so many do i hope it gets better for you all soon if it hasnt already damn the last half got real and hit hard i appreciate you and what you do for the community and for yourself jack im glad youre living your best life thank you for everything 3 3 its ok not to be that energetic all the time as long as you are still you you still think that what you are doing is righteous and does not cause severe harm upon others what you are doing should be what others are also doing a part of them is energetic and a part of them is calm and at peace not every second should be gone to work breaks are part of life and should always be life is indeed difficult but still you should keep on going but on your own pace there would be a time that you will face its greatness and you will be at peace when your still waiting for sean to play dlc 2 and 3 of spiderman ps4 thank you jack just thank you these types of jacks speeches always make me cry like fuckk pride month is over finally wait im straight but im attracted to girls which have dicksfutanari play more kingdom new lands pls this game had me in fucking tears at the second ending i wrote a poem after hearing sens amazing speech forgive me if it doesnt make a lot of sense its currently 5 am in the morning the one who brought me joy in my darkest year was secretly suffering as well hiding behind a bright smile twice a day who wouldve thought that that smile didnt stay silent suffering happens all around the office your home and with kids on the playground not even recording yourself daily will stop those feels from coming around wounded and bleeding though internally you may already be making those marks physical doesnt solve anything permanently rope and bullets wont fix your head the only way through is to talk to someone instead a friend your mom a doctor get help dont let your toxic mind drown you in doubt as isolating as it is to feel like you want to die alone we perish but together we thrive rather then stand divided by our own crumbling minds let us grow with our imperfections and march on preach it jack we all been there and know how it feels to people who reads this jacks right go out try your best and dont give up take all the victorys you can get and strive for more be the best you and dont ever give up strive for the greatness you deserve cause you deserve it be you not who your told to be be honest to yourselves and be you i may not know you but i just gotta say your beautiful and perfect being you and i and im sure lots of others love you to jack if you read this be yourself not who the community tells you to beknow we love you as who you truly are not who we tell you to be people dont give up hope cause we love you 3 remember everyone always talk to someone who can help you if your feeling alone and log onto jacks channel for a good laugh can someone please tell me what that song is at 405

ever think you dont have a purpose your whole channel agrees i have new found respect for you im inspired right now so thank you sean after youtube therapist roses are red violets are blue i love jack and so do you the background music for most of the game was shiloh dynasty just distorted can you play the sinking city those glassy blue eyes are hard to look at when they start tearing up yknow it makes it harder to not choke up to hah song is losing interest by xxxtentation youre amazing the impact those last 20 miniuts have when sean was thanking angela i balled my eyes out this hit hard thanks sean why you gotta make me cry not a bad thing i just think youre a beautiful human being thank you for talking about this and making me feel less alone it makes me emotional to hear someone understand and acknowledge it so much love for you and i think i speak on behalf of your fans too we will allways be here for you sean no matter the circumstances we love you and support you hey i saw this on armor games this video was absolutely amazing sean thank you so much the fact that this game made you think about all of whats happened and made you emotional means that its wellmade and has an excellent writing i really want to support the developer and see more from them and the fact that youve shared this information with us is very very important thank you this video has a great message why do you hit me so deep 20 min of emotional and encouraging speech out of the blue this is why we watch and love you jack thank you mays story kinda hit too personal for me i feel like my life is currently on the part of the story just before it starts welp wish me luck i guess xd the girl in the game immediately find a date me a horny introvert thats bullshit thats not how life works whens the next episode of outer wilds coming this video made me smile cry and have a nice feeling inside btw hope your having a great day this video has too much gay if you have these kinds of thoets ever again just think about this whith your woek you have saved people you save people and if you keep the qualaty you will save people i am one of thoese people who you have saved so thank you thanks jack for you kind words ive been very down for awhile but i never want to burden people with my crap knowing that others have it way worseim still trying to get recover but its very hardlove you and i cried like a baby i am jealous of people who can say something about how they feel sometimes in a random youtube vid cuz i cant what you do does matter youre so genuine it does have an impact far bigger than anyone can imagine people change interests come and go at some point i lost interest in your channel exactly for being loud and bubbly and sweary but you did you and its this sincerity that brought me back to stay what i want more from this channel because yes im asking for things now is for you to be happy for you to feel in tune with yourself be at peace in your life feel whole go out and roam the world like everyday is the best day of your life with all my love its weird to think about idk sometimes i wish i was more like you sean i mean getting help immediately and realizing when to do it when i first came to the conclusion that suicide was an option open to me i kind of shut it out in a way i told myself that i would be fine if it was ignored it and eventually i felt like everything built up and it had been a problem going on for a year then two one day my friends were talking about a boy he had killed himself in 6th grade someone said i could never imagine wanting to kill myself and i remember thinking to myself its not normal to think about killing yourself every day idk felt like i needed to get that off my chest thanks for being you sean and taking care of yourself i love this game its beautiful and i have played it over and over i never expected you to play it jack ahhhhh bad cutting memories are flooding back ahhhhhhhhhhhhh old jack childlike and bubbly new jack adultlike and wise im happy either way my gf used to be really bad and being long distance is sucked they made a bad decision tried to over dose course they didnt tell me after talking and talking we both got better life is something honestly and as long as you have someone that really cares about you whether it be a pet or person youll get through it i believe in you all and also great speech jack 3 fuuuuuuuuck danm i realate too much to may the only thing different is im too scared to die as much as sean has changed ive always loved him and never stopped loving his videos thank you sen i needed to hear that but yeah woah i cant speak right now of the feelings that you said in your rant but i really needed that i love it when you do your rants like that but yeah no matter how much you know someone you will never know everything about them theres always going to be a line between personal and what you can say to other people but im a very open person thats probably why people ignore me which is fine thats what i want but yeah theres somethings i just do not tell i wish i was an open book but no no one can be that open now i may seem like i am nothing like the rest of these comments coz for some reason i just stand out from the norm well i am an aspie its just i dont like being different and i want to be heard but then again no i dont want attention but i want the right kind of attention if that makes sense heh whats the bet im more gonna get it this way well i know it failed coz ive done this sooo many times just knew the backround music is one of shilohs this game is a simulation to what i feel but without the friends part if you want no one to suicide please do not judge people the other problems on earth havent even killed us such as global warming feelings hurt its more harmful than getting killed dont abuse it no highfive sad sen you are the best i really appreciate you im sure we all do you deserve great things this really hit something in me thank you for presenting reality of things like this so many creators are so scared to publish videos that feature things like this we need to share this more and express help for people if your struggling tell someone and get help as someone who was there in that situation who was terribly depressed and self harmed i cant find enough words to describe how important was my best friend to me and how without her support i wouldnt be here where i am i always thought it would never get better that i would always be stuck in that dark place but it did it was slow process full of ups and downs and its still going but its so much better im so much better than i was so for everyone who needs to hear this you can do it you can reach out and i promise there will be someone to reach back and help you can feel better and achieve whatever you want it may not always be easy and you may stumble but in the end you can do it jack i agree with you a lot in the past ive been hurt in relationships and plus i love the new you you be who you want to be jack you should be a therapist and a youtuber like i recently became a youtuber and i do videos for fun not for views and subs i have been trhough a hate loop hated others myself almost everything even the things i loved doing cause i knew i would never be a huge sucsess fortunatly found peace of mind by helping some people that i now can call close friends that drove me out of my nonsense hate binge and you jack are a veryyy kind and awsome dude for doing what you do as you said you are a person and although you dont know me a friend everyone hope you find peace in your lives and keep rocking that pma aw shit here comes the bitch nigga tears etika me watches video me aw shit here comes the bitch nigga tears you know that feeling that you have something in your throat and you are going to cry sorry but i decided that i was killing myself the world is too dark to see something good about it i cant anymore everyone around me hates me so this might actually be a goodbye for me i know my name but my best friend was the one that named it youll always be relevant to the people who support and care about you those who leech off of others suffering should never get to you however hard life may seem you should always look up and you should always stay calm youll be forever in our hearts please dont let any of those attention seekers get to you thank you so much for all you do sean youre doing an amazing job you finally played it i played this game a couple of weeks ago when it first came out and its so

the same so i didnt see one i was in and out of mental hospitals family started to distance themselves from me and i lost a lot of friends but my best friend helped me through all of it my friend was there for me even when i tried to push her away she was there if she wasnt there i probably wouldnt be alive right now this game just reminds me of it so much i just broke down thank you you helped me so much to stay happy bro may is hot af i know i dont need to know everything but this was the talk i needed i am the same age as you and i feel often during the deepest points of my depression i would look to this a thing i loved and compare myself to what i had not succeeded in my 20s you are 100 right and i beg anyone who hasnt watch to the end because knowing that you can not compare yourself to someone else is something everyone should have reinforced i am glad to see you are making content for yourself and i watch this because i enjoy watching you play games i dont need to know your life or have the right to feel i know you as a fan i want you to be happy doing what i come here to get a little joy from i thank you from the bottom of my heart for your honesty and openness you remain a force of good on this platform i want to see continue to grow can you do night in the woods revisited ive contemplated suicide before i usually still do because i just dont care anymore so i can understand you sean thanks for being so real sen stuff like this is why youre one of my fave youtubers and it actually does feel like were hanging out as friends even though its just through a screen and weve never actually met each other im glad youve realized that your mental health is more important than social media and that youre trying to work on yourself ive been trying to do that too your rambling inspired me to keep working on myself thanks again and much love 3 the hope chapter i felt that i resonated with both sides because ive been on both and sometimes still am on both sides i still struggle some days are good some are bad i havent selfharmed for 3 years now and i try my best to always be there for my friends ive been around since youve started almost ive always loved hearing you talk about things like this its just so inspiring you have a true heart and great a passion sen thank you for talking about it sen thanks sean love you toby best of luck bro xxxx youre such an inspiring person sean thank you this video kinda touched home for me as well jack and every thing you were saying at the end hit me too thanks for talking to me im an aspie its not easy to just put down my phone and socialise in the real world and yes social media is a toxic place where everyone will put out their thoughts and feelings out there and im sick of just hearing all the nonsense yes i could just put my phone down but i cant just give up on one obsession and go be a normal human being i have to replace an obsession with another obsession you cant get something from nothing therefore there has to be another with the same value as the other and also my head always has constant noise its never quiet and when i try to just relax its almost impossible even when im sleeping i have dreams pretty much every night coz my brain never seems to just shut up sometimes i cant go to sleep sometimes i can oh and i dont really like being with people but if theres some people that look after me are nearby then yeah im fine with that i dont like being truly alone but then i dont like getting a lot of attention hi jack i love your video keep it up and jack please dont quit youtube can someone help many of my friends cut and i cant help them hi jack i love your video keep it up and jack please dont quit youtube the thumbnail remind me of janice from annabelle thank you for everything sen i know that its you sean who i should me thanking but also thank god i clicked on this video today it was just what i know i needed deeply thank you sean and i hope the period when you were depressed would be only a period from the past i played this myself before jack played the game i really changed me ooh my godd im a huge fan of ito junji and that game was a pure masterpiece thank u for playing it i dont really know what to comment but i want you to know that i will always love you for who you are even if you dont show us everything and im happy for you being you and doing that because that makes you you you would be a bomb ass therapist this is so depresing i am going through social anxiety and depression since i was 9 years old because of those i found it hard to make any friends and i didnt have any until i got to my last years of primary school i went through high school with different friends since my others moved or they didnt like me anymore after high school i got a job as an assistant in a child care centre but that didnt last long because being in a small town if there are a lack of kids compared to the staff then there is a problem i knew it wasnt my fault that i lost that job but because i lost it and while i was working there i didnt really communicate with the other staff and only put my all into my job i left really depressed and burnt out about the world i had really negative thoughts that i was trying to act out on years went by while i was in this depressing state and now i am turning 25 with no job no friends no love life all i do is do house chores went through a course and now looking for a jo i probably cried more than 3 times during the whole video lol your words mean so much i am so so glad you talked about these topics thank you so much sen when i first started watching you tube you were and is my favourite youtuber but my dad said you sweare to much now i watch you all the time jack but doing this all the time you can crush your spirit me im spirit was crush 6 years ago a long with my heart soul all i think is that sen should go back to the undertale days my opinion this reminds me of sara is missing did anyone else cry when he bought up etika because i did i like your channel more now youve really changed for the better have a nice day i needed that talk i may not be going through a tougher time as everyone else but i have lacked a sense of meaning at the moment and you helped sean i think i speak for everyone that we all understand sometimes you need a break you lift us all up in spirits but sometimes its not always the easiest thing to do i can say for myself that even in the darkest of times having someone like you who is happy go lucky but also has a sad side is relatable i try to compare myself more to the new jacksepticeye someone who understands what its like to have problems but who can also see what is good in life i dont know about everyone else but i sure as hell are going to stay with you till the end you are a great person and have helped so many and reached out to so many people from charity livestreams to just talks like this you make lives better no matter what people say i already played this before its so good this video made me cry and i barely cry i completely understand because it happens to me and still is as soon as he said that someone cares about you i almost immediately cried because i know this sounds sostupid or cliche but i felt it in my heart and gosh i sound so idiotic but i think this really helped i absolutely love angela and her games and art style this video just appeared in my recommendations i saw angela hes art style and jacksepticeye so i had to click it not knowing what the game was about when i started watching the gameplay it struck a chord in me its like i felt that this game spoke to me from the first ending to the last one when may started talking about whats happening in her life i immediately relate to her because at the same time i am struggling to cope up with everything like everyday feels like a chore to me it started to become tiring to the point that i dont even want to leave the house anymore or do anything at all i rarely comment about these stuffs but i just wanted to point out that i really needed this today i was already tearing up halfway through the video because of how much i can relate to may then you suddenly said angela in a very concern way i heard it so clearly that it made me tear up because its my name even though you are referring to the artist herself i still f thank you for saying what you said at the end of the video im sure that a lot of us needed it we love you a lot sean youre so inspiring and that speech was so moving 3 i dunno why but the two girls remind me of me and mah best franddddddd i know this sounds a little screwed up but it makes me happy when he spills out these negative emotions it really shows how much he relates and cares for his friends and family and most people he doesnt even know so i just want to thank you for sharing these emotions with us 3 and dont stop this video really made me think about my life thank you so much and im glad you can have some time to yourself its important and im glad people like you that i look up to help me get through my depression this video has helped me a ton thank you so much why was 2017 the worst year of my life too tbh i wish i could have someone in my life that would support me like that jack this the first time i ever thought about this me thought about it multiple times oh shit you know sen youre a fucking amazing person and i think i can speak for the majority of the people here that we appreciate you so much thank you for all the content you create all the speeches and talks you have with us all the charities you help raise money for and everything else personally i would have had a lot more lonely boring days not doing anything if i didnt have you to watch no matter my mood you can always make me laugh or pull me back into a better mindset im not saying im depressed im not but we all get sad sometimes so thank you if anyone wants to have a little vent or whatever feel free to reply to this ill listen and im sure others in the community will too i know how hard it is to feel like youve got nobody to talk to about whatever no matter how big or small it may seem to you just know that there are people out there that have got your back including myself d also a simple way of making your day amazing is by doing even one thing differently from your normal daytoday routine it can be something that you havent done for a few years that you remember making you happy before or helping out a stranger you encounter on the street with a problem for instance last saturday i helped a local where i was on holiday reload his trolley with stock that he was delivering to one of the nearby shops but then blew off of it on to the ground his genuine thanks for my efforts made my overall mood soar for the rest of the day i have alot going on and social media is one of the reasons i feel so burnt out and i started getting dark thoughts again and hearing you talk about this really helps me thank you implies getting out of bed making breakfast and going on a walk is a small victory cries in debilitating executive dysfunction yo if youtube doesnt work out for jack he should become a therapist deadass me huh im actually really happy right now my life two seconds later r e v e r s e b t c h when your girlfriendboyfriend cheats on you breaks up bad things keep happening to them then they come back to you to apologize you could not live with your own failure where did that bring you back to me there should be more people like jacksepticeye when i get sad and down i just put on a jacksepticeye video youre an amazing friend its not your fault that shit hurted for real though i cried like a bitch at that part games like this are amazing but suck so much at the same time was anyone else jamming when shiloh dynasty started playing no just me ok then back to the corner we go the past three years have been really tough for me and it often seems as if it really wont get better i try so hard to improve myself but its a real struggle so thanks so much for making this video i can relate to do much and im hoping that i can still turn it around all i have to say is thank you for everything you do jack please put more energy into your intro this intro was energetic but you can do more i still enjoy your content and keep doing what you do who the fuck uses scissors to cut themselves haahhaha thank you jacksepticeye for sharing a lesson thank you so much and the speech made me cry youre such an awesome person you helped me and keep helping me so fucking much i love you something motivational that makes me really hyped me yeah ill fuckin fix my shit get my stuff all in order also me 2 hours later lol imma go sleep and wake up and sleep again ive been feeling like that for the past years in a rut been trying to keep my head up and keep working on games in my spare time but its so hard i keep constantly feel like im just trash i cant program or animate nearly as good as others why am i even trying im no one and no one cares about what im doing somewhere in my heart i still want the games i vision to exist but when i sit down to work on them theres so much noise so much self doubt i cant focus i feel so useless i feel like i lost passion a bit but i know it exists within me its just dimmed by all this noise money and life doesnt make it easier i am hungry i am poor im below necessity poor i dont know how the hell i still have an apartment but i somehow managed by eating once a day or two and cutting off a lot of things from my life i feel trapped theres no escape and no one cares i dont care about a lot of things all i want to do in life is make games but i cant even props to you for speaking out not being afraid to be honest social media is dangerous it actually distances people from each other in any meaningful way rather than building real relationships we get instant gratificationvalidation from these superficial interactions that dopamine release is a perversion of the one were supposed to get from building relationships its addictive we seek it out but now via social media instead of face to face it isnt as easy to get face to face 2 of my siblings my wife and myself have fought through suicidal times at some point thank god we had people beside us make sure youre there for the people around you someone omg this channel is dying channel has 22 million subs bitch what please do a minecraft video with felix jack please play oddworld strangers wrath jack when will you play kindergarten 2 ps i really enjoyed kindergarten i love my friends dearly and a lot of them are going through some rough shit and i want to help them with all of my heart but i cant because im also going through a lot also and im somehow distancing myself from them and them from me because of that last year was the worst year in my life friends that were being fake and saying shit behind my back and even saying things to my face and it hurt but a couple months ago i started feeling okay for the first time in 7 years and i was so excited and happy about it and im still feeling okay and im so happy i rarely watch your videos because you have the loud and screamy voice but this video shows the other side of you and i love it you seemed so real this time and

saying the analogies the mumblingavoidance not knowing anything it felt sooo unreal when i saw sean tear up cuz i didnt know it was possible to see him sad but i felt him when he was talking about his personal experience love you so much sean im sure you know how deeply effective you are on your viewers lives thank you wow your openness and honesty at the end of this is beautiful thank you thank you for caring about others and perhaps more importantly for caring about yourself people clearly look up to you and you take that role with a pride and respect you rarely see in others noone should ever expect perfection from anyone but well always need more jacksepticeyes in this world from someone who is potentially old enough to be your mum and wishes she had even half of your maturity and wisdom yes you went on a tangent but it was an important tangent a tangent that shoyld be listened down to the very last millisecond a tengent that matters a tangent that helped more people than u realise a tangent that helped me keep doing what you do because it makes a difference this goes for everyone whos reading this you are loved keep doing tangents that matter because we care its been 25 videos and still no fnaf jack why do you do this to me i know about the darker themes and i can usually deal with that but this really hit me with those feels you are a treasure thank you for being you i wish i knew you more personally i feel like youre a close friend whos infectious positive personality is what helped me and so many others get through tough times i literally played this before seeing your vid your mind is a bully smack it with a uno reverse card haha lol jacks first girl friend thank you for this sean you really inspired me i needed to hear that end speech sean thank you i am one of those who feels utterly worthless due to my ptsd and bipolar and constantly being put down because of this constantly cheated on and berated you and your community has been such a lifeline with the pma and this is a reason for why i have loved you since your happy wheels days such a beautiful heart and genuine care dont ever lose that light our beautiful irish bean you guide more souls that are lost in the dark than i think that you are aware of love and hugs always where is da green hair tho i was in a state like that and its people like you who helped me and now i feel alright but its more self hate and doubt in myself but thanks sean my best friend invited me to her house and we are 11 her room is on a high floor and she said so many times i wanted to jump but i could never think of leaving you thank you for this i really needed this shes used no you on a compliment this was a really touching video your a really great human being and an inspiration to all who here miss the old jack without his scraggly beard and his new hair i cant seem to watch him anymore man this hit home this was hard to watch i had to force myself to listen im deep down bone tired too i just also wanna say to anyone scrolling past that no matter how you may feel about yourself you are a valuable person you have worth and you are loved by people you know and by people you dont i love you and i hope you have a good day today and that if you ever feel down please remember that its okay to be sad but things will get better its not a straight road and you may have bad periods but the longer you hang on the more youll find that youre so much happier today than you were in the past 3 i played this game two days ago and it was amazing i must say most of not some of these comments are what i would say but i feel like that talk is for everyone in this world to hear and for everyone to know that they are not alone and have a purpose i must say tho the words jack has spoken are so meaningful to those who know and dont did anyone else realize that the main menu has blood underneath the protagonist and amy with scissors lying across the floor i know im late but about one year ago i watched you play you left me and i left a comment saying how i was going on antidepressants and how i was so scared now im here happy off medication because i dont need it anymore and trying out so many new things i know no one really cares about my story but if just one person gets any sliver of hope after reading this then ill be extremely happy but if not then at least i got things off my chest this is super long but i just want to say thank you to sean and to his community for making me smile when nothing else could what he said is all true some people feel down and you just need to tell your friends your problem because ive went through this with one of my friends so tell your friends why and what you want to do 2602 what is he talking about the sentence looks good to me jack thank you my mom and dad died and it hurts me till this day and you make me happy so thank you this video was beautiful literally brought me to tears this game and the message is amazing youre amazing sen we love you thank you for the message at the end jack i really needed that today and appreciate it no matter what others say about your channel right now just remember do what makes you happy people will come and go and those who really appreciate you will always be there you even once said that change is good so just be yourself we love you 3 well this video cured my ptsd my parents do the same shit asian parents man oh shit that deep 2234 what the fuck this is literally my exact life story im so scared right now ive been thinking of doing the same thing may is too but eh i feel like im just writing into a void no one will see this anyway i saw the thumbnail and i went ooh noo does anyone else get doki doki literature club vibes from this 1149 that thumbnail is giving me mixed emotions we love you sean 531 marzia is that you ohhhhhhhh pewds gonna kill you if he finds out that your in someone elses room this game made me cry and his speech made me cry because i can relate to all of this and more please read this jack thank you sean games like these mean so much to me and your inspiration makes my day a little brighter i always try to smile and help and sometimes it becomes to much and games like these always make me feel like just by fighting through everyday and keeping my chin up to help others is worth more than anything but just for you to remember we are always here you and you are never alone we love you for more than just jacksepticeye and for your laughs and we appreciate you i love how half of the video is just sean basically giving us a free therapy session yet i still watched the whole thing i think that shows something i am glad im part of the few people that dont have many social media accounts because i dont want to be constantly updated about complete strangers so you said that you went outside and watched the trees it really made me think that maybe i could always use time to try to clear my head jack thank you for being so open with us that takes and means so much and i hope you know we and the people in your life are there for you you know what i needed that so thanks i hesitated clicking on this video because of how long it was but i do not regret it at all and i think i might do more with my life while im still in my younger years of life so again thank you aw its so relatable ive had a suicidal friend but i and some other riends he had helped him with his issues and i cant relate but i bet its harsh to be a youtuber when somwthing happens in your personal life it really is impossible to be happy everyday and it feelss good to see positive and meaningful people like sean out there in a community like youtube love to everyone stay happy and i hope you have an amazing day week and an incredible year life 3 no i just played a while back im not ready to watch this again hhh where is my friend pedro thanks needed to hear this what you said about needing to complain about a small thing because even such a small thing can destroy my day that hit close to home its nice to know its not just me that feels that thanks you inspired me to talk to my ma and even though shes in denial were getting me some professional help well trying again to get some haha and btw youll never be irrelevant to me youve been a part of my life for so long now like years and years its weird to think but ill never forget you and the laughs and realness youve given me and i still love watching a jacksepticeye video especially the ones with indie video games and long tangents also just played praey to the gods and am obsessed with it already thank you for making happy jacksepticeye san i dont know who the fuck made you feel that you dont care about your community our community or who made you feel that youre irrelevant or your channel is dying but i dont give a fucking damn about that persons were here and we know first hand that you care we wouldnt be here if you didnt whatever you said today made me reflect on myself you have no idea how much i needed this a lot of people in this community would agree with me if i said that this video probably saved someones life today thank you for being you also thank you angela for making such a beautiful game that threw light on such aspects of our society your artwork is very inspirational that bit that really got me is the bit just before the hope ending the scars on her armi looked at my arm i had scars that i did my self and reminded me of my past the bad things that happened to me the sadness that i pushed out but might be scaredthat it will come backif that makes sense i once was in that point wanted to end it all jack sean helped me go thru it he made me happy seeing someone having so much pma that was once in my position the part where you talk about that we only have one life brought me to tearsthank you for talking about this topic me suicide attempt survivor self harm survivor also me continues to watch this video the point of this video is that you only live one life for a very short time so make every second divine jack i love you and your content your like my irish friend a few years back i wasnt in a good place but when i came home from school i would watch you and i would feel better about myself and i started to go back in to a dark place but like before you were there plus a few other thank you anyone else just want to send a virtual hug to sean rn this is such a beautiful game angela hes an amazing artist and their games never fail to start a conversation this all touched a piece of me because im dealing with exactly this sending away my dna cause no medicine works switching counselors because the one i had that was good went to chicago and figured out a way to do it and too afraid to share it with people i know and i dont know if i should push the arrow homosexuality is a sin if anyone needs to talk just dm me on instagram bigmonkeyhugs this video is very touching i can relate to this ive always been there for my friends to help them and cheer them up it comes from the feeling of ive been there before i know the pain and i wanna help but sometimes they wont open up all i can say is dont push them to talk and remember a hug an change someones world so when you have a friend going through hell talk with them and hug them this actually just saved my life i decided to watch this video while in on bathroom floor crying i decided to watch sean my favorite youtuber ever since the begin of me watching youtube videos sean this game this viedo saved me i was thinking of killing my self as i sat on the floor as i watched this video so many things and feelings hit me like a train and as i listened to your speech sean all i could do was cry my mind cleared off all the clouded thoughts all of the horrible things i wanted to think about and i just cried ive been beaten ive been abused ive been physically and mentally destroyed by so many of those who i thought were my family and my friends i felt lost alone and afraid ive always had this thought that nobody loves me or even cared about me i was in this world alone in the dark it got to the point where i didnt even want to exist i wanted to disappear its trueyou do get tired tired of doing everything and anything i gave up i pushed mys omg you played missed messages yes omg ok ill focis on watching the video now im commenting before i watch this wassuch weird timing for me when im dealing with suicide thoughts every day it was beautiful to see someone get support in such a beautiful medium you all deserve love and kindness go find support and help you deserve a future and suddenly i want to put my life back together thanks jack you almost made me cry not even halfway and im almost at crying hey sean you helped me get out of a dark place i was pushing everyone else and i felt evil you helped me be more positive and helped me out insert a quote here thank you sean i love you so much and i really do appreciate you jesus stuff like this really reminds you that were all human in the end oh my god so many emotions ima trans male and gay and all my depression suicidal thoughts anxiety eating disorder self harm my family especially dysphoria and just so much more weighs me down to stop me from doing what i love shiat im so glad uou made this video and especially what you said in the last 20 ish minutes of this video sksks aaah i love you no homo been subscribed since may last year which was the starting point for a very brutal form of anxiety and severe depression with a good dose of losing a lot of people ive cut out so many toxic people and its the loneliest ive ever felt but looking back on the past year i wouldnt change a thing id still date that guy who turned out to be someone id never get far with id still quit my job and stay unemployed living with my parents having literally nothing going for me for 2 months id still go into that mental health clinic terrified and reflecting on my bad experiences with therapists and go through with it it does get better i have been there and ive had my share of hardships and emotional pain just try las week i called a friend crying because i didnt know where i was going in my life the next day i saw community college was open for the second semester and it was close to my job 2hrs away and i went to the open day and im enrolling right now sees trigger warning me alright im out see ya later jack the way may talked about the way she was feeling hit wayyyy to close to home sean are you ok i dont now how you feel but just letting you now that we love you i didnt know you got a new girlfriend im really happy for you my life is utterly meaningless i wish it wasnt i wish i when i played i lost my shit at no u uno reverse xd i feel as though this video is such a good way for people to start understanding depression because not experiencing it makes it so hard to understand and i have dealt with ignorant people while dealing with my personal case thanks san for all you do i myself am heavily depressed according to professionals which i find a bit exaggerated though i do have suicidal tendencies sometimes but i wont act on them because of friends and family of course but also because of you san so thank you for doing what you do and what you love hey if anyone seeing this ever needs someone to talk to im here for yall i will honestly talk to anyone here so please if youre seeing this and ever need to talk feel free to comment here and we can find a way to talk privately thank you so much for this the things you have said in this video really made sense and were really inspiring i dont feel bad to a point that it becomes suicidal but its definetely something i struggle with every day hearing the things you said really mean a lot and i think that counts for a lot of people thank you thank you jack or sean whatever you like being called more this this is why i love you i started crying at some point during the last portion of this video when you were talking i dont watch every single video but youve been a big inspiration to me since i found your undertale lets play in 2016 when i was 12 a

here in ireland youre making a bridge on that border and the past of the north and south glad to see change here the 2nd part is my life but worse i wish it was so that my friend actually found a therapist but in sweden you cant choose therapist its hard to keep someone alive especially if your a 12 year old boy i mean i could really see myself in this game and one difference was that i have your videos to help me through the day so thank you very very much i cant actually thank you enough you give me the joy to keep going to keep helping others and keep just doing what i do its such a big weight on my shoulders to know that someones life is my thing to save and it isnt but if i wouldnt have taken that responsibility put down the hours into it she would have been dead by now so dude

dude i loved this video and i think it was very important for a lot of people me included may writes harry potter fanfiction jack laughs me a jacksepticeye fanfiction writer sweats nervously losing interest is the song playing in the back ground i feel like i can relate slightly to this gamei have delt with depression and self harm and suicidal thoughts before honestly i would have killed myself if not from my friends i feel like games like this are important and is helping shed more light on this subject i just wanna thank you shawn for the work you do having noise all the time wrecks with your mental psyche thats why i try to exclude myself from social media other than live stream fortnite then you have the problems of not being able to relate with others since you wont be able to keep in touch with them no offense but why did you talk for 20 minutes im not crying your crying this is an amazing video jack if this was anyone else playing this it would be different just because jack just open ups some times and i like jack that way people who say they had days like that or bad days overall just havent depression is an illness that manifests over time and i believe they never diagnose depression unless it has been atleast a few months the wear and tear of being miserable over prolonged periods plays a big part in how you feel being miserable for a day or a week is much more bearable obviously its not the first or the last time ive seen a youtuber have some kind of speech about it honestly if you havent been depressed and especially to the point of suicidal thoughts you just dont have alot of insight on the topic so why are you giving guidance instead the push should be to search for someone who can help and something alot of people never really considers telling people around people like that what they can do because the people who are depressed often dont have the motivation or drive to improve themselves so it doesnt matter what you say they should do especially when its not shor my girlfriend committed suicide today because of homophobic comments we kisses a couple of times made out once mostly beat friends and she died because her family and friends didnt accept her i was the last person she kissed i feel so guilty jack made me almost want to almost want to cry so happy that there are more games that show what people are dealing with i love ya all and we are never alone this is the true wholesome content we need unlike 5 minute crafts im not trying i am not trying to be rude but if i wanted to hear a speech i would go talk to my dad about this ps not suicidal i wonder what would happen if i faked my death and wondered what who would care and who wouldnt but never thought about doing it his so right youre the best sean allways do the things u love in life can you play satisfactory jack dude i love that youve stepped back and gotten help for the stuff you were gong through and grew and changed i see the improvement and i appreciate how much you care about this community its really obvious and hey even if you didnt improve much we would still love you and support you through it all youre an inspiration to us all to me everything you say about mental health helps me more than you could ever know so just keep doing what you gotta do my dude were here now about the game it was heavy but really sweet and well done and i love that there was pride flags the trans one made me really really happy as an enby wonder if the main character was trans mtf or non binary or maybe even ftm and just presents feminine idk either way i freakin love the representation in video games so proud of you jack we love you keep being the amazing supportive and inspirational person that you are whooooop finally somebody decided to give this game the attention it deserves the song makes this better i would really like to know the song name i feel suicidal why the fuck is one of the options understandable loving all of the adorable and loving messages but did nobody realise the meme at 449 was fall out boy in their save rock and roll music vid thank you jack this really made me cry and your words made me feel better thank you

with you give me a math problem ill snore but give me a computer science problem ill look at if for hours lol thats me thank you jack just thank you it might not sound like much but thank you thought this was lilypichus post i appreciate this video and i cried during it because i dont have depression or suicidal thoughts but i do feel empty sometimes and though i have fun during the day and i laugh and stuff and i am actually enjoying things when night comes i sometimes just feel empty and like nobody really likes me that much and i never hang out with friends or anything and i actually do have friends but i never really text any of them or anything like that and i sometimes have a feeling of tiredness too i also related to may a small bit about being the golden child and i used to be very conscientious about everything and though i am still smart obviously i dont work as hard got thing as i used to and i dont feel like i have to or there is any point to it i just want to be a different person i never really have anything to do during the day i just sit around and eat food i miss when i was a child and i lived with my dad and we had fun times and we made memories but now my life is sort of nice vid choice my question is why the hell did people dislike this video thank you for this video its going to take a lot more time but youre videos this one and others like it they have given me the strength to take baby steps i know that some day your help will allow me to tell my family how im feeling i have to reflect a lot more but youre giving me the strength thank you sending huggles to anyone who needs it right now no questions asked i usually dont comment on videos but i fully agree with everything he says especially from an educational environment such as school or uni it is crazy how we destroy ourselves for no good reason but you need to learn to love yourself and no that is not selfish for people who need someone to talk to im available me wakes up mom you

they dont understand theyre in the past you can obviously understand that you have grown you arent a different person youre a better person and we dont need every detail of your life to know that sure id love to know all about you but who are we to take what you need away from you just so we can feel satisfied never stop growing and being yourself you are so important i feel like youre one of my best friends and you dont need to talk to us everyday for me to continue thinking of you as a best friend you are so smart and so understanding dont let anyone tell you that you arent as good as you used to be because they just havent grown up yet they need to take time to grow and they dont want to believe that even i will admit that i havent been watching you as much as i want but it isnt your fault im just young i need to grow up and reconnect with myself jack should start a charity for people who suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts dude this gave me chills when she said she was

ramble on about this for ages to express how many people care about you and will miss you but anyways i love all you beautiful people bye i played this game a few weeks ago and despite being depressing and me crying multiple times while playing its such a beautiful game i think i was just a bit too happy when i saw this uwu not gonna lie ive been a fan of angela for a year now and shes inspired me alot im happy shes coming out with new stuff aww when he said he stared at trees it really touched me cause i always do tend to just distance myself and look at the world around me and stare at treesit really helps me stop my brain from going a billion miles per hour and worry about things that im not even involved in i was excited to see that jack played another one of angelas sorry if its spelt wrong games shes truly an artist and the music she chooses is just beautiful 1954 so i used to have suicidal thoughts and the one thing that stopped me was the pain i would cause others and it made my thoughts worse everytime i thougt about suicide i just started crying i wanted to stop living so badly it started with just the thoughts and then i started hurting myself i even made that rope thingy to hang myself my mother found out about what i was doing and thinking she took me to a person that helped me to make me stop wanting to suicide she saved my life i cried during most of the gameplay cuz may hit so close to home honestly watching that last part of the game and hearing him talk made me choke on my tears remembering my past and the things ive been through here comes therapy with jacksepticeye sean this was a lovely game and your words at the end about not being ashamed to be in your own lane and taking your baby steps that helped me alot ive been struggling alot with that comparing myself to other people and just feeling like im never going to do better for myself but you said its okay if the steps are small and i thought about that like yeah i have taken really small steps but theyre steps regardless so thank you so so much for that where was jacks high five those last few words really spoke to me thank you for being so great sean im at a very young age where things are changing quickly its like the world is moving faster than i i always set goals for myself because i feel like i have nothing that matters to anyone and seeing you play this game made myself compare to may if i where to be gone one day would anyone really care im a nobody no one likes me i always fuck shit up i make no one feel better but seeing this video made me really think that i should live life who i want to live it i never knew if i really did have a problem but this video was something i needed like a boost i feel like i should never get this chance of living life i always think of what others think of me i never knew what my problem was but today i learned a bit more about myself i shouldnt let the little things get to me i need to live life to its fullest potential thank you for helping me this is so true for me okay i just want to say something keep in mind this is just for me to get it off my chest im not asking for pity im almost 14 now when this happened i was just about to turn 13 i was going through something really awful i didnt feel sad but i didnt feel happy i didnt feel anything i was tired i didnt want to see my family i didnt want go to school i started not to eat not to a point where i was starving myself but to when i would not eat breakfast and rarely ate lunch my mom didnt even notice this made it worse i then started to talk to her about it not everything the truth was night after night i though suicidal thought but i couldnt tell that to my mom so she said she would help me but not as urgent as it should have been at school i started distancing my self from my friends i learned how to take a blade out of a pencil sharpener to this day i still havent cut myself i was waiting for one day so i could harm myself then yaknow i wasnt t omg seeing your eyes red made me si sad but in a good way if that makes sense may is the girl vision of me its scary how simile we are if youtube doesnt work out for you become a motivational speaker or even just a therapist edit omg thanks for all the likes i havent watched your videos in forever jack feels good to be back thank you sean so much i really need this last couple years i have felt so helpless no motivation suicidal thoughts lately it stopped because off my gf going through such a similar situation but thank you so much keep on fighting i am socially awkward too so i cant really talk to people about my nor their problems i usually just break down in to reality and lay there for like 15 minutes without contact because of stress and pressures basically my soul is broken without hope and without strength but love yall who are trying to help just like i do really thank you it means a lot you are makin peoples days guys music is losing instrest by xxxtentacion and shiloh when may told us about her parents i could relate to her so much thats what im going through right now economic math is not medicine to everyone else going

maybe play happy wheels its coming back this is to real for me because i have a friend that is depressed and well you dont really notice it because of the antidep pills once i saw him sitting in a corner looking forward not wanting to talk to anyone and i was just thinking ill stick with you however you move forward just be yourself and do what makes you happy thats whats most important i appreciate you so much i love watching your videos and i want whats best for you thank you for addressing topics like these it doesnt sound like complaining to me at all your concerns and feelings are valid too and talking about it is important as you said i hope things are going well for you in your life and continue to sorry jack gloom beat you to this game you played it better thanks i played this game before you i have a friend like that like may i had fallen for them to and i just hope that things dont go sideways when i am trying to help to the best of my ability i have also felt those thoughts and i felt how my family would fell because i lost someone to suicide and i thought what will the other people who know me fell if i went away forever till the can meet me thank you for playing this game it had been interesting to know that there are more like me and my friends your fan justyse ps please come to the big island of hawaii man i love jack and his vids like these its the little problems that seem like the biggest problem thats what some people just dont understand i started crying while he talked after mays ending he opened up and it made me feel like im not alone i

lifted off of me talking does so much and it can do so much for anyone willing to talk you dont even need to talk do what you please just never turn to self harm and suicide you have so much potential with whatever you pursue just as long as it would make you happy just dont ever harm yourself you have so many people who love you and are willing to listen no matter how long you wait and no matter if you feel if its a useless matter so many people are willing to help you that last bit really hit me live life in your own lane wow thanks for yet another uplifting experience jack thank you for playing this is my favorite game and ive been waiting for someone to play it 3 ya know i used to be in a crap state and i hid it because i thought i couldnt talk about and still never talked about it all that much but my friends knew one thing i had no idea about what my future would be like i didnt know what job i wanted to have where i wanted to live my preferred gender even then one day a friend pointed out how good i am at stories and how i should try and write a book at this point i had already been writing a story that i plan to publish one day and that friend got me thinking now im so much happier just with the knowledge that i can make something of myself and for the first time my parents are supporting my decisions im working harder to not suck as much and as hard as it can be im glad that im doing it jack thats an awesome video you made this game hit hard for me as well i had suicidal thoughts still do but your words hit home more then you will ever know im sure your sick and tired of hearing this but you saved my life many times i have chronic migraines and when i first got one all i wanted to do was die the pain was so bad i was only able to feel the suffering and pain the outside world wasnt there at the time i gave up physically but not mentally and the most i could do was start to push people away the last thing that was saving me was me asking myself what the four year old would think of me if i did it it made me disappointed in myself for putting the younger me though that but it helped me get over somethings that have disappointed me and now im able to go out and be me hey sen thanks for the talk and im glad i found you on youtube thank you you are great the games music is depressing as hell sean play last day of june its a beautiful story game and its free on the epic store right now i think this game alone hit hard on two fronts and then seans monologue at the end ooofff anybody out there that is thinking about suicide it may not seem like it now or when you are in your darkest thoughts but things can get better take it from somebody who has lost friends and loved ones from suicide and has had a failed attempt themselves suicide is not a solution to problems it is just the start of more problems for other people there is almost nobody on this planet whose death especially an avoidable one would not hurt somebody in some way dark thoughts might make you unable to see it but family and friends truly care about you if you are in this situation reach out for help it is out there if you dont want to talk to someone you know to try to get help because your ashamed or something you can always reach out to the suicide prevention hotline it is free and they will actually try to help and is available 24 hours a day 18002738255 jack

going online stopped everything id just lay in bed in the dark letting days go by not even leaving my room for school or food eventually i got a note slipped under my door alerted by a knock it was from one of my friends i remember exactly what it said i havent seen you in 2 months its been lonely none of us can ever think of anything to do together were lost without you i hope youre okay that

thou ngl that was really wholesome 20142015 jack comedian 01 of power used 20182019 jack comedian memes 50 power i wanna thank you for what you said in the video and in this comment im still fighting my demons but it helped me a lot to remind myself what is important in selfcare and why i shouldnt be so stressed all the time im 26 shy and introvert person from poor country and not so long ago i thought that im too old for being like that like may in the game i cried for no reason and 3 months ago i left my job because of being just unhappy tired thinking of pointless monotone life and i started to hate my closed friends for their productive and happy lifestyles so i compared myself to them a lot and hey i still sometimes do but today i really wanna slowly change my way of thinking find my happiness seek for professional help and start working even just a little jobs just to be alive again because im not alone im glad you made this video thank you again and sorry for being so personal with it but i rarely have a chance i bet i did some grammar errors i after jack had his little speech at around 800 i started to listen to the background music and found my favorite shiloh singing in faraway land dude 20 mins speech and you thought of that on the fly youre awesome thank you sean in the end your words really helped me alot that speech at the endmade me realise alot of stuff just now and i just wanna sayyou are a great man you just keep being yourself and ill gladly support you go to the gym a hour a day you weak mortal ahah but i mean i have been here from 2013 and

things changes and he change and just saying when he played that dragons cancer thats was amazing i like the point where the girl supports may but isnt responsible for her wellbeing trying to cure someone without professional help is damaging for everyone thank you massive epidemic may was going to die but she found a cure i got that immediately i think the epidemic she was talking about was depression but then it was cured by her roommate super embarrassed to admit it but the speech at the end broke me i cried that hit me so hard thank you sean ive always did art when i was depressed

hope your vibes the way u express yourself and your positivity will guide me to achieve the best ty sean for being u u r breathtaking i always love the gaelic gladiator dude youre the best your videos are the best always be the best you can be your self sean i have been watching you for many years now probably since my first year of high school im in college now but i have never worked up the nerve to comment and you probably wont see this but i gotta say it your videos have helped me through very unfortunate times not unlike the events in that you discussed in this video i always thought while watching you that maybe i could learn to smile and be happy like you are but i instead learned something much more valuable sean i know this is easier said then done but those who are saying that this channelnis going down hill are wrong they are just afraid of change but dont change for them or the world or me change for you everyone always focuses on dont change you are perfect the way you are but never talk about the good change that needs to happen to everyone it is a result of learning what works and what doesnt and i think this video finally helped me see that you are valuable you are free to change its always worrying when the things that are giving characters existential crises are the same for me and im just there like ahhhhhh stop it meee hello person scrolling down the comments hope your having a nice day smile you made me smile and happy and warm inside thank you 126 omg i just got a flashback of sean playing undertale broham there is a new tool album out in august im pumped couldnt get through the video the first time have chills watching it the second time 4 words that this reminds me of a normal lost phone a good part of it is shiloh dynasty love the classic music in the background i noticed that one of shiloh dynastys songs were playing in the background on the game you are literally sat here for 30 mins tryna think of what to say still got nothing thank you so much pleas tell me there will be a pt2 junji ito woah i thought he only makes horror mangas i feel like our little guy got a little sad while talking about this but he kept going because he knew he could be of help by saying this he kept going and that is a prove that he still cares so much about us about the community guys lets appreciate this little angel and lets give him all the love that he deserves we love you buddy sean dont cry if you cry i cry rip etika we all lost him to suicide this was a great video it really touched me great work jack we love you jack this community appreciates you sean this helped me thanks a lot sean just know that we r always here for u no matter what i had suicidal thoughts and still do but i have friends who help me through it and so do u i didnt subscribe to u just for the gameplay but because i love ur channel and u always make me smile no matter what thank u for the speech it helped me so much love ya bro i will never forget this game its beautiful hi i know probably no one will see this or care but earlier this year in 6th grade ik you also prob dont care about my age i was thinking about taking my own life no matter where i was i would think when im in college or i have my home ill die there once people wont be able to see me thats when ill go as soon as i get out of my parents house and i was in a really bad state of mind and i one day i must have appeared really sad because i was walking to music class and my music teacher noticed me she saw my pain and cared about me she helped me and took me to the social worker im upset that i may not get to see her again because im going to middle school but my point of my story here as a tiny child giving advice cause im soo qualified is even in those dark times when you feel like no one cares about you there are people who care about you because you are worthy of life and you absolutely matter in this world you just sometimes need to find that help even if it i y do i confide my self in may so much its scary how similar i am to her deathly scary i could watch sean talk about mental health all day long jesus i forgot this was a game video after his 2nd run through of the game my heart jesus i didnt realize how much i needed that talk at the end thanks sen i think you are a great person i love watching your videos and they make my day better i have dealt with alot of shit in my life and you make me feel better about myself whenever i watch you thank you for everything you know sometimes i feel bad about people with depression or people that constantlyoften sad because from my experience i dont get sad often people have died friends lost and i dont get too sadbut when i see someone else depressed i get sad thinking about what there going through and how i cant make them feel betteror when someone is getting bullied and there scared to talk to people and i just cant relate to themthats the only way i feel truly sad is when someone else is sad i cant do anything about it thanks jack for saying everything that you did depression is not easy to deal with and it is a daily struggle i have been beaten down by it for over half my life and there has been more bad moments than good i am glad this game put that out there for everyone to see i have finally gotten to a point in my life where i am realizing that i can change it and make things better youtube has been my outlet for getting out of my own head thanks for making me laugh when i didnt think i could it means so so much keep being you 3 personally telling someone youve changed is like telling them you dont want them to grow and develop as a person and you want them to mentally stagnate at a point that you prefer i love seeing people change over time becoming better becoming worse being human change is life but thats just me thanks so much for making this video i really needed to hear this all this is why i love you as a youtuber you really truly care about everyone around you and it shows even if its not a video where you really tell us whats what thank you so much i really appreciate it ive been binging your videos for a few months now cause of these sort of videos you really are an inpisration for me to strive to find my best self thank you i wish i could articulate how much i appreciate you and the work you do thank you for striving for your best self and being such a wonderful example for all of us edgy teenage shit goes down jack loses his shit god the more i grow up the more this man looks stupid for me favorite quote from this video i recognize some of the music in this game jk rowling started off with nothing but an idea she was depressed and a single mother living in a flat in edinburgh now look where she is despite the shitting things rowling is doing atm she is honestly one of my hero i feel you my g thank you for sharing this with us i personally appropriate it love you may is like me when she talked about why she like her parents my parents now shun me and are ashamed to ever mention or talk about me in public to anyone because of what my passion is and because how they are so obsessed with education and success ive become a child that is no longer part of the family it was last year that ive gave up and quit school at that time i realized i didnt have true friends either no one contacted me the day before i left school my cries for help were ignored its fine to not know what to say or do when you come across someone like me i know its hard to figure out what is the right thing to do just dont ignore it i dont want someones mind to become like mine my mind has become twisted i have hard times to know what is right from wrong anymore like i just take everything in and honestly think its normal without questioning if there was something wrong about it its like how something becomes use to and normal you no longer wont lie i watched this and when you hear the girl who needs help slowly explain what goes through her head and i didnt realize i do the same thing but just never makes a big deal out of it and hearing your speech i realized i should do something about it so thanks for this honestly its helped me a lot im gonna listen to this everyday because this shit is gonna fix me for sure love you so much sean i hope youre fineeeeeee and if you arent you will be for sure youre strong im 14 and this is deep huh no same great taste coca cola with no suger and and a hint of vanilla in the video tried to leave 3 times 1214 years old i have way too many scars to count ive been diagnosed but never given any treatment ive been struggling in and losing what should be the fun years of my life to just sittin and sleeping being a student and doing the same routine for 10 months out of the year not having any mental freedom or control over what i do with my lifetimetalentschooling pushes my mental state to terrible places i completely understand the monotonous feeling the girl is describing not to mention i aspire to be an artist so social media and likes and comments heavily influence my mental wellbeing i also have terrible trust issues and i lack anyone to talk to so getting my feelings out is practically impossible but ive pushed through and lived this far ive had happy moments and moments where i felt amazing when i thought i could never feel anything again i havent learned to love myself or do anything special or how to get out of the boring routine society jack has helped me though so many bad things hes changed my life in so many ways so thank you jack i really cried almost all that video im not okey but i needed this i have friends who cared about me although i feel alone miserable too often and you do too and if you dont you can look for someone and im sure you find someone who will be for you i felt both the game and your talk i get help from a good friend and from my animals one thing i learned is that speaking to someone about your problems big or small always help even when it does not feel like it if you bully sen i will find you and probably nothing thank you shit bro i dont cry much but this sorta hit me in a good way tho during the video nobody me go go lesbians actually needed this i have 1 more month of vacation before school and this just gave me fuel for this last month thank you sean 3 ill be honest i teared up a bit this made me cry it straight up hit home there are times where i find myself in dark places or how this game would phrase it a blizzard but its reminders like these that help me dig myself out of the snow thanks 3 27 am and im watching

to go outside for a little because all i do is sit in my room and play games all day long damn seans speech was so good sean you were sad too but remember that we are here and we wont forget you harry potter fanfiction luvin it its insane how much youve grown and the fact that youre finding a true balance between youtube and self love is amazing ive been watching you for a loooong time and ive always been so proud of you i know you care deeply for everyone in the community and in your personal life and everything you say especially on this video was inspirational to me on a whole new level this spoke to me in a way that made me rethink some stuff and actually take some time for myself thank you and love you im always alone thumbs up to jack for making all games like this entertaining u know if the whole youtube thing goes south sen is that how u spell his name idk can always get a job in psychology i cried literally the whole video dear sean thank you so much for just being you youre such an amazing person i cant thank you enough for all that help youve been giving all these years please keep doing what makes you happy wow i really needed that talk lhjhjhyf also this video highlights some very important signs of when someone is depressedsuicidal withdrawal dismissing things with im fine when theyre clearly not resolving issues people who are planning on committing suicide often try and fix any issues or reach out and tell people they love them or how much they have really appreciated them they might give prized possessions away because they wont need it anymore if you see someone doing this please ask them why ask them why they wanted to tell you ask whats wrong if you ask if theyre okay they can just lie in the game in the first situation the main character said see you later and may replied goodbye this is something that stands out to me people usually would reply with see ya or something that acknowledges that they will see them later but she just said a blunt goodbye if you notice someone is acting off maybe you cant tell what it is but you notice something is up please please ask i think youtube has helped with my depression because when you subscribe to someone like jack it makes you part of the community a family and makes me feel less alone thanks jack 3 i live my life in my dreams everyday since almost everything real is negative like i ghosted everyone i talk but i cant undo it because i dont have a way i have noone to hug in my dreams i help people wanna be a psychologist but in reality i cant do anything for myself i havent been happy but i smile and you help me jack so thank you holy crap this is such a powerful message this game a few years ago i had serious issues with depressionsuicidal thoughts but i was lucky to have someone to help me i want to help someone as well wheres the green hair i remember before when i seriously cared about u still do but i like forgot about everyone else and i was always worried about u like when u said u dont sleep much i got worried or like the 1st video youre happy and energetic and then the next day u say u feelt sad and everything and i got so worried and kept worrying if u where happy or not and felt bad bc i didnt know anything but now ive taken a breath and told myself that it is ok and that everyone just like me can feel sad and sometimes and that i dont need to worry that much cuz ive realized it aint good for me i knew it back then aswell but i couldnt help it im glad that you arent pushing yourself as much as u did before and that youve taken care of your mental health now i remember worrying about that too and i got so happy when u decided to take a break and focus on your mental health and only do one video per day im so proud of u i respect you and

it all was thank you sen i better comment before i get lost in the oceans of comments also jack youre such an important figure because you combine emotional intelligence selfcare and sensitivity with the modern day memey social media generation weve been losing that the ability to understand our emotions and how to deal with them because of social media having a figurehead nowadays who can meme

the mother thingi needed this so much thank you jackreally feeling down a lot lately and i still am i guess but this helped i do simply admire the devs artwork looking at it makes me feel warm and content with myself i mean were looking at very attractive characters after all a real cure for any pent up depression listening to you jack made me think about going outside again for a walk i had not exercised in a few months due to deep rooted depression and kept myself quarantined to minimize the pain doing what i love doing on youtube and twitch to keep myself full of purpose and determination away from a degree i never wanted to do well at recently because of this habit i got too obsessed with social media too i have irregular sleep i stopped exercise and i dont leave my house for months at a time over time it made me feel over cumbered with guilt for showing possibly leech like behavior in front of my family who still take care of me while im unemployed as a student i feel rushed to work but i havent come to terms with it yet at least in the way i want to do it but its warm thi this was a really serious game and i loved it thank you man hello thank you sean for everything and damn my phone for not having the little dot over any letters you do i know im real young and not probably believable but your videos got me to get help to get therapy for panicking and anxiety i was keeping so much stuff to myself that i almost gave up but thank you thank you so much and you reader its okay youre gonna be okay whatever youre going to come and talk with me if needed get help if needed dont be afraid and i love you im bad at hating anyone its easier to hold to yourself than talk i know but trust me once you get help its gonna be okay thanks for reading this makes me want to just sit back and collapse listening to jacks voice i started with myself halfheartedly chuckling thinking man i feel so attacked right now you know memeing it up in my head then i saw a very dark mirror and some of the dialogue was familiar to me because they were things i have thought or said in the past i like to write and i have been told i could do something with it but i dont really like my writing and dont think anyone would be interested sometimes i feel like i remember for other people and i wonder if im just a placeholder sometimes i have felt horribly since middle school and its never stopped only evolved i see crap that goes on in the world and i might say that stuff makes me lose faith in humanity but then the truth is always that its only confirmation of everything ive ever thought the world and myself to be ive gone to university but i have no idea what i want to do yet my reasoning for delaying the idea of grad school figuring out what i really want to do before i waste anyones ti thank you for opening up to us jack this hit really close to home for me thank you so so much jack for your videos thank you for everything you do i cant make a huge speech about my mental health or my own life or how great the video because yknow i just dont wanna lol but uh thank you jack for so much jack when i first saw this video on my recommended fee i didnt think nothing much of it but you got to say it is the most mindfuck of timing that ive ever experienced in my life because i was already going through so much and thinking so many horrible things and i was even thinking of going through with it i actually had the urge to go through its then i was actually planning on going through with it and then i saw this fucking video like what are the goddamn chances so thank you that means a lot and i hope you see this in not till bathroom me not give me sympathy not cuz i wanted you to heart my thing or comments but because i just want to say thank you and you couldnt be more write about what you are saying and thank you for being such a kind understanding and wholesome person 3 3 3 3 conversations like this is why ill always be your fan youre such a good soul sean thank you for being this open with your fan base and taking the time to just talk about mental health and suicide even somebody whos ten years older than you like me needs to hear this 3 good man and thank you dont worry sean you didnt go off on tangents what you said wash refreshing and im sure many people myself included found comfort in what you said and can relate i didnt realize how much i needed that end tangent until i got to it i had to take off my glasses because i was crying so much at the realization how much this helped because its true i realized how much ive given of myself to others thank you i hope you continue to take care of yourself you are lovely and an amazing person thank you jack if you want to talk about something talk to us we will always be here for you i fucking cried i dont cry normally but i cried and it helped me thank you sean i was going through alot my hole life and never cried but i cried i finally shed a tear yeee us doki doki weabos knew whats going on lol this game is brilliant and so relatable too i used to be like may letting other peoples opinions make me feel useless and horrible but now im like the main character a motivational friend im even going on a date with a girl this week lol so im probably older than most of the people watching im 35 but i can remember having suicidal thoughts since i was around 7 years old i am here to tell you that you can work through it people love you no matter what you think no matter what the people at school might say you are loved somebody somewhere wants you around it might be your teacher it might be the friend you never talk to it might be the cute guy or girl at the other end of the room somebody cares i was you i was you for a long time i am still you i want to die every day but i dont i dont because i am loved i dont because my friends care i dont because it would hurt others more than i hurt i dont because i am worth something be something for yourself for your family for your friends be the change you want to see in the world you can do this we can do this i can do this satisfactory thanks for being and thanks for being you well ive been through this too and it was when i was 7 i know youll probably say kids cant get depression well i did it was mainly because of school but i felt like no one loved me i wanted to die but i fixed myself i started thinking of happy things i have played this before on armor games and as soon as i saw it i was like holy moly this artstile is so beautiful love you sean youre doing great things and we are all here for ya big dog well to be perfectly honest in my humble opinion of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of ones views and by trying to make it objectified and by considering each and every ones valid opinion i honestly believe that i completely forgot what i was going to say can you play unravled 2 i miss yarny 2725 got me doing the same thing i dont like everyday but then i dont know what i like so how do i escape the only thing that gets me out of my own head is if i drown myself out watching youtube lets plays or watching dramas i just watched a concert last saturday and i thought that would make me happy for a little while but then i woke up sunday morning and yet i still feel empty like theres a void there somewhere i dont know how to fill i got strong sayori vibes from that door my heart goes out to people who have suicidal thoughts x jack you have made me cry your like my jesus you always find a way to make me happier i both love and hate the way he says the letter h can you please play skate 3 again i would really enjoy it sean i love you so much and i understand you i was always on the look for validation that i mattered so i changed my self for people and i felt horrible you inspired me to be myself and i want to thank you im now much happier now then ever and i will always be your fan and friend 3 love you sean you made me happy thank you so much i love it 2 jack but i am too lonely but i have manny frends i have no girlfrend i am too lonely but u make me too happy thangks i have been subscribed in 2014 for make me happy thanks jack the speech was so touching whats really stuck with me right now is when sean said how he hopes us the audience grow with him and im like you know what i have grown with him and to be honest i love what sean has grown to become at this point in time it feels so real it feels like hes there for me for us besides that for me and other kids my age to hear that talk is so important no matter how long youve been watching sean that whole talk andor tangent is so important i say hiding away does not help instead go out and share your problem it helps and jacksepticeye can be public speaker this is the height of your contribution to life open honesty no one else can be your honesty thats like me with games its like when i dont play games i feel so alone and depressed like no one is there for me and no one cares about me but when i play games it keeps my mind off it and then sometimes when i play good or something people would be like wow youre so good i wish i could be you id smile so much then my parents or grandparents start yelling at me and i just want to grab the blade and shove it so far in my throat and just feel so relaxed that i dont gotta have feelings like heartbreak suicide fear anxiety you would be a good therapist too damn you are really good at these great speeches well done they also helped a lot so thanks for that part ive contemplated doing things that the roommate mentioned but i really do just need a good long hug the only people ive hugged recently are my mom who i dont trust anymore because i came out to her as pansexual and she didnt accept me or my uncle who has no clue whats going on and good lord if my girlfriend or any of my friends gave me hug i would definitely just break down and cry for hours i just need a hug from someone who i really trust and love sen youve cared for us so much and have cheered others up alot make sure you take care of yourself if you need any breaks then take breaks if i watched a video of yours knowing that making it doesnt make you happy i would be upset i dont enjoy prying into peoples lives but if anything were to happen in the future that makes you sad or depressed then take some time for yourself you probably know all of this or have heard it before id also like to say thank you for all of the amazing content you make and for speaking to us and cheering many of us up jack you might never see this but i love you and ive been watching you for 5 years and your never going to see this but i loved you for a long time and your my hero and i love you man jackaboy were the hair im a very closed off person especially with my thoughts if i ever open up to someone then that means i trust them with my life so far no one has ever managed to maintain that position in my life yes i have had thoughts but only acted on them once in the summer of 2016 i cut my hand with a pocket knife and i still have a scar there but thats as far as ive ever gotten if you ever struggle with the intrusive thoughts like i have talk to someone you trust hell even id be open to hearing you out but dont leave your loved ones behind they dont deserve it and youd be missed even if you dont know it stay safe and stay alive it only gets easier i promise thanks jack i needed to hear this and it hit close to home i have had to many of those days i fucking cried wanna hear something dirty muddy hands sand ashes and debris public toilets and a homeless man things change everything is connected pay attention budahism explained in 7 words damn i felt such a connection with the girl how she acted and what she said and did in general was so odd it was like i was watching another person who was so much like myself this video is so fucking sad thank you sen that means a lot jacksepticeye i just wanted to say i think you said all the stuff you talked about really well and we are also here for you

whoever you are to know that no matter what giving up is never an answeryour life has more value then youll ever know jack i love how you are and when you and many people are gone i will be there to be happy with all of you i promise i dont usually cry during these types of videos but i did cry this time thank you for making this video my girlfriend was in a similar situation and i didnt get to see her for a couple months but you actually made me understand what she was going through with this video and you have helped me a lot and i know you probably wont see this but thank you a lot but we are now not together this hits hard but u being a personyoutube that is almost always so happy when people see u reminded me that i can be stronger and that makes me stronger and thats why i am still herethanks to u thank you jack i really needed to hear this because i fell like i dont hear this enough from the people im surrounded by so thank you so much for this speech i love you so much dont stop being who you are your the best this video was recommended by my cock guess sometimes your cock knows whats good thanks sean this is very meaningful and nice to hear you talk about this stuff and not be afraid to let it out much appreciated you are special you are loved right now im on exchange in mexico and im going home in 12 days but im doing nothing at all laying in my bed the whole day barely eating and just feel lost i think the reason im like this right now is because my mom moved to another country and my grandparrents are moving in november but i just cant move because my school has already accepted me the other reason you might be asking me is why didnt i just move with them instead the school in my hometown has the perfect thing i want to do for my future which i have been searching for for so long anyway back to the topic about my mom and my grandparrents moving its really hard for me to imagine a life without them i grew up without a father so my mom was always stuck with me when i went through the hardest time of my life and im really anxious about living alone because im only 16 im really stressed depressed and anxious right now in my life and i just feel disabled just a human being not feeling home and mean either i think we all thought this was how to say it at some time i really fucking needed this video i played this and it was boring but if looked amazing ive been suicidal since i was 8 and honestly this shit hits home too hard for me to comfortably watch without feeling ashamed of myself in many ways i got to the stage of actually planning it out but was only deterred by a sudden forced move and met one of the only two people in the world who would find enough value in me to call me a friend people dont seem to realize it but sometimes just having someone there when all the screaming in your head feels endless is enough to give you a little more strength to move on i had been alone for so so long my family saw me as this problem that needed to be corrected and i had no one to turn to it was only by sheer fucking dumb luck that kara and alex found me and saved my sorry ass from doing something well cowardly i was running from my feelings of worthlessness of loneliness i was running from my pain and from all of the mistakes that pain caused me to make i still struggle to find reasons or motivations in day to d i feel you jack and i know what you mean and how you feel im a performer as well an actor and i suffer from anxiety depression its good that you can and will talk about these things openly its funny how people think that performers etc people are always happy but how that is many times so very wrong 4935 best part of the video thank you jack you should play more games like this what i really loved about this was when she self harmed there wasnt an option to get angry at her so many people try to make people avoid cutting by threatening them heck when my ex boyfriend told my mom about me cutting she threatened to call the police on me and have me stay in a hospital its understandable because obviously you dont want to see someone you care about hurting themselves but it makes you feel so much worse than you already did if someone was just there to hug me and be there for me i would have been so much happier and i would have felt more loved this game is just really cute and has a great message im sure he just saved many people i actually deleted instagram from my phone because it was consuming me and my mental health has increased because i dont worry about how other people are doing and i dont compare myself anymore i realized how great i could be on my own and how to express myself my struggle with depression got a tinnyyyyyyyy bit easier but it got easier because i deleted it damn this shit deep i almost cried respect i want to play the game before i watch this but omg so happy for a lgbt representation edit i played the game and watched the video thank you angela he for making such and important game and thank you sean for sharing the game and your personal experience with us why did this video make me feel a pit in my stomach go out with me sends picture of shrek yes jesus i love you ive been in the dark tunnel for so long and your my light sean what happened to outer wilds please jack more outer wilds i feel bored and tired everyday but i dont know what to do i am a teen and i have alot friends but only one true friend did anyone else notice that may has a tielike choker around her neck looking like a noose i realized after jack reset the game but its just spine tingling to me hey sean i know you have hundreds of comments on your videos everyday but i hope you see this one ive been going through a lot in my life here lately and today i felt like ending my own life i watch all of your videos to help me laugh so i turned to this video for today for something to laugh at your heart to heart at the end of this video helped i guess save me from doing something that i wouldve regretted in the long run i know suicide isnt always the answer but sometimes it feels like the only answer i know my suffering would end but it would only start more for others i know i should reach out to someone to help me but im afraid to ive had many bad thoughts and my own attempts at ending things for myself but tonight you helped me on this bad day and i just want to say thank you looking at the title screen i see a pair of scissors this was meant to be foreshadowing to amys death which explains the red all over the floor please know that we are all here for you even if you feel like nobody cares or listens ive been there and i know there will be someone who will listen this is heart touching if its not good its not the end dont make it the end ive gone through depression twice i should know the mental scars never heal fully the only reason im here is cause i know the pain i cause by ending it will be worse then the pain i feel deep down thank you you have no idea how much i needed this i saw myself reflected through that game and it scared me what you said i think gave me the motivation to try and find happiness for myself thank you the only constant thing in the world is change whether it be the things around you or you as a person growing up and changing as a person is something normal we grow up our mindsets change our own happiness is more important you cant make others happy if you yourself is not happythose who respect your decisions or grow with you are the ones who truly value you i love this game so happy you decided to play it jack it has such a deep meaning to it i kind of relate to this because ive been wanting to go to an art school for college but my parents say its a waste of time and that art doesnt make money and that put me in a hole sean u know i have stage 2 depression and have attempted suicide numerous times and i kinda feel like may alot of the time but then i think of my kids and watching ur videos and it definetly helps alot thank u so much amen keep encouraging people sean it is touching to see such an influential person talk about a topic as heavy as this my girlfriend used to cut im really happy she stopped its a cool game we also have played it didnt get the best ending though this video ended up hitting alot closer to home than i would ever of thought possible and sadly confirms for me that i have definitely been depressed for a while now which sucks as im already 30 im still not able to properly talk about why because i still dont fully understand why but posting this is a step in the right direction i guess means im admitting theres something wrong right much love to you sean carry on being you sometimes i think about it then im stopped by the pain itll cause others theres no more to say your channel is not irrelevant you help people through there darkest times i thank you for that jack ayden fleming this video made me cry thx you jack a lot you make me happy in bad times thx really hey jackaboy im sure millions of people will be growing with you and helping each other out in this community i can tell that you have changed but changed for the best although i do miss the 2 videos a day the 1 video a day is so much better for you and thats what matters your awesome man dont forget to l a u g h jack we love you i can see that youre shaking its okay we love you so much we do and were so proud of you take more breaks plz we all want you to be happy no one would care if you stop putting out videos for however long you need we will always love you and thanks for the beautiful speech you dont have to share anything with us love you it took me years to admit to myself that i actually needed help i had been going to therapists but instead of talking about my problems i would talk to them like i would a friend that fake way of no im fine hahahah lets talk about interests only because i was terrified of opening up and thinking i could just continue coping with it on my own but there comes to a point where that just isnt enough it took me years and 4 therapists to start opening up and its helped a lot never give up hope even if youre scared hey sean i can relate to you a lot when the world gets to much for me and i want to open up to someone i feel like ill just be too much for someone and i just keep it all in bubbled up so i can relate to you alto and even back in 2017 i can relate with the tiredness and sometimes i get the dark thoughts but i just have a constant battle 247 but i figured that id just focus on the positive things which is still really hard for me but now im the true me william hilton mcguire be positive btw pma i dont know if ill be able to say what i want to say in this but im going to try because i know i probably wont later i dont know if jack will read this but if anyone else who this might help reads this then thats all that matters ive been through a lot with family situations losing close friends and several times i let a relationship grow into something unhealthy it was all hard and im sure there will be plenty of other hard situations for me in the future but i feel like now more than ever im ready for them i have a greater sense of self now than i ever have and plan on continuing to grow it and i just want to tell anyone reading this that i know life is hard i know it doesnt always make sense especially in the moment but someday it wont matter how hard today was someday youll be so happy youll be glad the bad days existed because they shaped you into the person that you have or will become and you wont want to trade it for anything and if this is not enough to cure your depression or what ever you have sean putted a link is his desc edit thank you sean fear doesnt shut you down it wants up tobias eaton divergent dont let fear put you down and make you feel like you arent worth it let it help you grow and become stronger you are worth it and you cant let it kill you its hard i know but it takes time you can do it you can come over the other side from someone who is depressed to someone who needs this advice jacksepticeye changed ever since the first video he created this game is beautifully made and written but it saddens me to see a gay flag instead of a lesbian flag shes a gay woman so a lesbian flag would be more fitting and probably help in avoiding lesbian erasure controversy lesbians are valid as fuck and its super upsetting that many of them dont even know theres a lesbian pride flag because of how little its spread around in comparison to the standard rainbow flag at least if the devs see this i think it would be lovely if they incorporated that i just realize ive been thinking about suicide since i was like 7 of course i didnt really understood death back then but it was a permanent though in my mind the shame of mental illness is so real and so irrational the best chance you have to get well is to allow someone else to save you give the people you love a chance to carry you they will love you for it and youll never regret it ever as a person who has gone through hell and almost fallen out of this world this really got to me thank you sean for sharing this experience and for spreading awareness inspired by junji ito also this made me cry i havent gotten very far in the video yet but reading the comments made me feel way less alone in my emptiness and frustration with myself my life i yeah thanks guys edit damn that was really cathartic at night my brain will not stop it literally tears me down and i cant go to sleep when its quiet the same thing then i found horror narrations it shuts out the noise in my head i watch and listen to youtube when its too quiet in the day its probably not healthy as far as how much time i spend but it helps i also started therapy finally thank you sean we love you maybe when people first found you and you were big loud yelly man they became attached to you because they may have had mental issuesfeeling suicidal now that you have grown some people hate that because you were kinda like their hero to them that doesnt mean you should change you are great san and be who you like man this video hit really close to home but im so happy you did this video this stuff needs to be brought to peoples attention thank you jack love you i just want to hug everyone in the comments right now thank you ive been going through a lot of memories of trauma lately and was feeling like i messed literally everything up but you showed me otherwise i appreciate you so much and you are truly an amazing person wow i came here for something fun from good ol jack and i came out with a bit of an existential crisis and i loved it thank you so much jack ive had so many councillors to the point where i though it was all bullshit now i have a new guy and hes wonderful so if anyone needs to talk to someone do it and dont give up until you find one you click with im happy you are better too sean youre amazing and im really proud of you this game hits me right in the feels especially because i get it and know how this shit feels something that makes you not feel upset or alone thats me with my art its a bit of a mixed bag sometimes singing others songs sometimes writing my own sometimes drawing sometimes working on stories i dont know where id be if i was discouraged against doing the things i love also ive been in a place where i felt like i was alone and ignored and anything i said would just be seen as the negative form of attention seeking instead of a genuine cry for help i left an old platform because of it i wasnt suicidal though there were a couple intrusive thoughts and a lot of non suicide related funeral planning still i got out of it and i never never want to go back its isolating even when you have friends and people around you it can feel like they dont care it can feel like no matter what you do youre not doing enough and it wasnt fair and not knowing what to do is also a heavy hitter here because honestly as much as i love most of my coworkers the last 20min of the video was extremely beautiful and im so happy that you were able to talk to us and communicate with us about what you are feeling ive definitely realized how much dependent i am on social media and how much i cared for what other people thought about me on these platforms your words about this topic were really hard hitting for me and i think it was something i really needed to hear right now people dont care about what im doing right now and i dont have to pour everything into my social media everything you say is so important and i hope that you know that we love you and everything that you are doing for us 3 this video was amazing today was a really shitty day for me and i really needed this thank you so much youre an amazing person and we love you jacksepticeye for 2021 sooooo what i took out of that is that when someone near you commits suicide you could have prevented that and it is your fault xd ive never commented on any youtube videos until today you are the most genuine youtuber ive watched in the past 10 years ive been using this platform everything you said is absolutely right im not gonna repeat what he said but sean is a powerful humanbeing that will never be forgotten everybody needs help and youre not weak when you do it it shows that youre strong enough to come up and say it bless your soul sean imo this is your best and my favorite articulation and comprehension of the mental health topic thank you very much for sharing seeing the tears in his eyes for the entire last half teared up too man no matter what your profession is who how good your life is at the end of the day were all human and we all deal with that darkness inside us and never should you feel like you shouldnt talk about it just because you have a lot of money and youre super popular or because you have nothing and think no one would care anyway youre amazing whoever you are wherever you are whenever you are you are amazing thank you sean ive tried to type something about how much i appreciate you and its all a bunch of rambling anyways i am so grateful for you and for all your hard work there have been lonely and dark times in my life where your videos have kept me company i love your videos and how much you are growing as a person we know you care and it shows ive been watching your videos since i was a teen and ill be here to grow with you pma if your depressed reply bruh sean or jack i just want to say thank you c i totally noticed a change i mean 2017 was a rough year for me too and im not the same man i was then but when i saw the changes it took me a bit to get use to it because i hardcore drifted away from the channel i sort of felt like a jse fandom apostate but times changed and i found other channels i enjoyed and it had nothing whatsoever to do with what you were doing so when i come back to you there are gaps so maybe i can accept the changes a bit easier because i can say well x amount of times gone by since i last checked in on jackaboy but regardless of whether someone was a fan for a while and came back to the changes or was here the entire timepeople arent static monoliths of stone were people people change all the time even if its in small ways it still happens and because channels are made by people they change too do i miss the green hair sure i actually started watching during a period where you didnt have it but i learned to love seeing th thank u sean u made me feel better i love jacks speechs so much it spoke to me so much thanks jack for all the support i really needed to hear this thank you jack my mother took her own life in february i ended up finding her grey body lying on the floor i really feel scared because my coping skill is to not talk about it and to sayjust because i cant see her doesnt mean shes not there i lie awake at night because of the fact that i havent properly mourned her death her spirit wanders not letting me sleep because i just want her to be happy the worst part was i tried we tried we all did those things everyone says but in the end it didnt work sometimes i think about ending it but i dont want to hurt the ones around me like my mother did so im thinking that once i lose my loved ones career plans dont work then ill just end it something i vividly remember was how i saw the cuts on her arm and i knew something was up so i asked her about it she would instantly shut me down and tell me youre always putting me under judgement i tried to apologize as much as i could but she didnt want help i dont wan 432 patrick pete and joe from fall out boy i love you jack 3 thank you for being you every time i talk to my parents or my sister i get angry and annoyed so i understand sense first grade i wanted to write a book because i loved to write and draw i kept reading books to know how to write good and to get ideas i know i wouldnt make money from it and my parents didnt like it especially my dad he said writing wont make you living or something along these lines my mom on the other hand tried to find a way i could learn more about how to write and she took me to classes after i got bullied not because my writing i didnt come to school for a half a year without any warning my parents took me to psychiatric and she wanted me to learn in a closed school i didnt want to so she forced me i was locked there alone after my mom got me out i didnt want to get out of the house im was sacred broken traumatized i had rough few years but i kept writing even when i was in there it was my escape now i learning graphic design and still writin why is this video so cute i had started to cry this reminded me of my own roommate and how sometimes i worry about her the only thing one can really do is be there and help when help is needed and show love thanks sean really i found your channel when you were just a wee lad in a cabin but ive always felt drawn to your content its always been a source of joy your top of the morning lads has always been comforting and when pma came around and the tour i realized what it was that made your personality and your content so great youre genuine no matter what you were going through or how tired you were you always strived to put a smile on someones face thats not easy and yet you persevered youve probably been told a hundred times over that you saved someones life but you really do youve always been a source of comfort but you dont owe us this you really dont the reason we keep coming back is because you know this but still keep coming back you really are such a ray of sunshine in this community thank you for being here with us i just wanna say thank you for being here and not giving up you really helped me with this video as someone who has helped people fight depression listening is an unbelievably powerful weapon dont say anything but listen to everything just be there and it does soooo much more than one would think if someone is dealing with someone who is suicidal here and doesnt know what to do then i hope and pray that i answered your prayers god bless all of you because all of you are worth it started watching at 2 something am now ending at 310 am crying my eyes out because this hits all my heart strings man i love how open u are and show every one that its ok to talk about these thing i luv u seanjack keep doing what ur doing my friends dont like my dark side they dont know how to deal with it and they leave me so i dont see them even if i try to do my best and be positive but i do miss it having someone that hugs me not yell at me for what i do and dont give up on my because i didnt didnt thought it would but this gives me tears its a mirror i avoid and i choose to share this because im not alone and want to support others who feels like me after 20 years with this pain and depression anxiety im still alive sorry about this but hope i can give a spark of hope i wanna give up but i wont pour that darkness into creativity it wont help much but at least you did something

for sharing your journey but also thank you for looking after you we grow evolve mature respond to the world and even what is other worldly but heres what i really want you to know your channel will move thru and alter with you and your audience will grow themselves and grow in numbers your demographic may get really interesting lol i bet you there arent many of me who watch you but im about to share this video around in my own small way and get your message out there with you who knows perhaps many people will i hope so this game was just stunning thank you for choosing it you are crazy good on the daily just know that you truly are changing this world even when you look after yourself first much love to you sean im so grateful for all that you do and what you dont i played a game before jack yayyyy i dont have much to say but this video hit me really hard even though im only 13 and i just dont know what to say i guess just thank you keanu reeves ah my true successor i needed this i come home from school and feel like im slowly dying but when i watch u and i feel i have a little more hope in me with how much we grow with that much we change so its totally normal that youve changed i myself dont see any differences from the energetic sen and this happy sen and i am so so glad that youre happy now the people with depression and stuff need to cover the sadness and all with a happy mask but they are doing more bad than good appealing to that thing and if you are falling again the best thing its to say it to us or to a very special person like your mom girlfriend etc i love to talk a lot so yeah have this little novel how i like to call things that i write you helped so many people that go through this and we the community want to give back to you and i wish we can be there for you but the commentsmessages is the only way we can interact with you it might not be much but still stay strong sean anyone else know who junji ito is sean youre the best as a chinese speaker i speak on the behalf of other chinese speakers that we appreciate your reading this game really hits home in so many levels i love it the art the atmosphere all of it i feel like sen should try being a therapist or start a podcast he has a soothing voice plus i like the irish accent i know that jacksepticeyes a good friend to me and to everyone to whoever feels lonely feel free to reply to this comment and tell me where i can message you so i could talk to you or help you with anything were all in this together gamers 3 wheres the green hair i have had those times where i have been depressed and i have been put on antidepressants but i have gotten through it and it is sad to see that some people cant and do commit suicide i have saved a friend from suicide and he was just 12 and i am not saying i am a hero what i am saying is life is hard life is tough sometimes it gets a little rough and you just gotta get through it no matter how much you think you blew it just know you can get through it although some people may not care everyone will be impacted when you are not there and if you are depressed reading this comment and my corny poetry want to make you vomit i dont know you but i do care me and so many people everywhere if sometimes you stop and stare at could have been just push through it and make sure darkness will never win if you need help get it from friends family or anyone you can because life for many people around you will be harder when you arent in it gorgeous game beautiful messages from the game and sen thank you more astrpneer pleassseee i have been able to deal with crappy people in my life because of you and your radiating happiness thank you when i saw that she cut herself i just looked at my arms and started to cry i think a lot of people feel this way too ive been growing alongside the channel ever since i started watching you in 2015 i never even noticed the change any time you did a big series id watch it because i just loved enjoying it alongside you and nowadays it feels almost as if your more emotional and reserved playthroughs bring me more joy than your old ones would now its funny i hope you always enjoy what youre doing though even if you change in the future in a way i dont connect with well people really do change hu god remember 3 years ago mg opinion the best jack green hair no face hair i miss that jack happy wheels would be a good example god damn it who gave you the permission to be such a precious irish man we love you jack dont listen to the fuckery they tell you your true fans will always let

dont force yourself to make videos when you dont want to anymore even if you are our source of entertainment we dont want you to be miserable you have a personal life and we respect that i really hope those who can relate to this find their happiness since no one should feel that way thank you to the lovely person who made this game and thank you sen for opening up on this topic this is a very important topic and your bravery can and will get people on the track to saving their mental health wow i actually was asking jack to play this and now he does its cool and i loved the video the son of a viking needs his space i may not be a galactic being but space is something that i can give please just let us know when you need space or need someone to talk to you are an amazing person and have pulled so many people from the ashes of fallen dreams but you also spark a fire in their soul that will forever stay lit for you sen thank you i see you as a human and as an equal i went through this a few years ago and i never had anyone that i could lean on or guide me through it i was suicidal though i never realized it since it was kind of subconscious i never like thought oh i wanna kill myself i more of just realized how unhappy i was and believed that nobody would really miss me if i just vanished one day though i dont have social anxiety im not a social person and do get a bit uncomfortable talking to people my age thought older and younger people are fine so i never really had a friend to talk to during that time since i was a freshman in high school there were no younger kids to be found and frankly i was intimidated by the older kids as a baby freshie now 3 years have passed im a senior in high school have a decent amount of friends and recently got a semicolon tattoo on my wrist for suicide prevention im majoring in psychology and one of my career options for the future is to be a psychologist so that i could be that person jack you give people happiness on even the hard days me too millions of people come to youtube just to see your videos i hope you keep doing what you want to do dont let anything bring you down jack u made a really good point to me thank u for being with us and talking to us about being a better person if you ever feal like you dont want to sit and record videos then dont cause if their is a little less uploads then we wont mind cause we will always support you mate thank you sen this hit the feels hard this really hit hard to home some parts were hella triggering but it was worth to watch it until the end im probably gonna download this episode to watch when i feel rlly bad tysm dude this game is kind of like tears for fears song mad world this has got to be the best video u have made im suicidal and ive tried to get help from my school well being teacher and she did nothing because everybody thinks im a goodie too shoes but im not and now if feels like that no one will listen to me if i try to open up even my parents i need help but no one will help because i put on a fake face at school and at home because i dont want people to worry about me today marks 1 year since my pop died and i was really sad at school and no one seemed to notice im not as bad as i was last year it got a bit better but its still pretty bad last year i cut and i even attempted suicide but i pulled through so my boyfriend broke up wit me huh why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars i was in darkness over my gf and i fliped out about everything because everyone made fun of me and i was really depressed and my parents didnt care and they didnt let me get help i asked them and they say im fine and left i said funny things to make people laugh and i was really messed uo when people got me going and i threatend everyone from stabbing to killing i hated everyone and everything i had no enjoyment in my life and no one cared i even tried killing myself in class with my hoodie my face was turning purple and no one noticed untill i pointed it out to my friend and they didnt try to take my hoodie off my neck they told the teacher i got an in school suspention and no one tried to help i tried to kill myself like 5 times and i wanted to die no one cared but i pulled through myself my little emotional speech for yall dont let anyone doubt your validity you are your own person if theres something thats shoving you down theres someone to help you share the load see a pro see a friend and if you dont have access to either find someone who will listen there is someone there for you your life is valuable you are beautiful and valid you probably wont see this but thank you thank you for making me happier i finally went to a therapist thank you for telling me to reach out to someone i might never be 100 happy but im doing a bit a bit better now hopefully youre doing a okay now wish you the best and thank you once again from the bottom of my heart i was raised by my grandparents so when they died a year apart it was really hard and the thought were there thanks to my husband and kids i am here im so proud of you jack you speak the truth not to be rude but where the hell is the green hair ive been subscribed to jack since before his turbo dismount and i have always thought that jack was the best youtuber hes always been and will be the same great person but he will change and thats a good thing cause change is not always bad angela he is quite literally my favorite indie game dev i always tell my friends that they can always talk to me and tell me anything that is on there mind or whatever is bothering them and that they can always trust me cause sometimes people think that if they say something to someone that person is going to tel everyone and their problems will basically be exposed for everyone to judge so they dont speak to anyone in fear that some people are just judging them halfway through the video i was able to just close my eyes and listen and honestlythat was the most relaxing and comforting time ive had in a while thank you and i really appreciate when you do games like these and open up a little ive been watching ur channel for years and ive alwayz saw u as someone who understands the struggle and im very glad that ur making ur way to ur best life and i want you to know that ill alwayz appreciate every word of u speak in videos like these youve helped me through so many struggles in my life since i was 11 and depressed to 16 and getting better sean youre the best keep up the good fight and btw wat u saw tool 339 when you ye haw but then like hell nah i upgraded it xd im sorry ive been in this kind of situation alot of timeeven nowbut after watching this video and listening to u makes my chest much lighter thank you so much for this upload i have a story and i wish everyone could take a moment to read it please peer support what does that mean it is a program started by the california highway patrol chp meant to help officers cope with the stresses of their job and to ultimately curb the suicide epidemic that had been plaguing the agency at the programs inception my father being a retired sergeant has talked a few times on his experiences with the program and i am going to share a few words of peer support wisdom if you see anybody and i mean anybody who you think might be struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts dont hesitate its going to feel awkward before you act and its going to feel awkward after you act go up to this person get personal and ask them are you considering suicide and if the answer is not an immediate no then they are indeed struggling let them know that you are ready and willing to help them be there for them friends may i call you all that i feel l top of the morning to ya broo the high frequencies of your voice are a bit too loud in this video i loved this video because everyone kinda got to talk about their problems and got nothing but positivity in response im glad you got to talk about this an im glad u did because it allowed for everyone to kinda relate and for me it helped hearing that other people go through this just the same and that other people have those days that just suck where you dont want to do anything at all or talk to anyone so i guess what im saying is that this helped me and im sure it helped a lot of other people too so thanks for opening up btw loved the game and hope you play more games like this great videos as always sen nothing is trivial if something is bothering you make a video maybe a mini series jacks thoughts like an update video of your life and your family and friends idk just an idea btw you look nice today thank you really good video thanks man most of the music is shiloh shiloh dynasty and this made me feel better about some things thank you 3 3249 where the main part of the video starts love all the we bare bears pics she uses i am a very suicidal person i think about killing myself almost everyday i cut myself not a lot but every few weeks or so the only thing that is stopping me is how it would affect my family i dont want to have my parents feel like it would be their fault i dont know what to do i feel like my mental state it getting worse and i have no one to talk to i dont know what to do i had gone through some shit that no one my age should go through i had no one to help me so now i reach out i make sure no one else through what i had to i will just out of random reach out to someone and ask them to be my friend cause you never know what someone is going through and they might be suicidal but you asking them to be your friend could save them it could help them more than theyll ever admit as someone who has attempted suicide on multiple occasions i know how hard it is to reach out to people for help i know what it means to have nothing and i know how much three words can help wanna be friends these three words can help more than you can imagine and like i said before i didnt have anyone there who did this for me which is exactly why i do it so if you see this comment and honestly you probably wont try to reach out to someone make sure theyre okay cause you never know what theyre going through jackwhat are you talking about manif you have problems and you keep them to your self its not goodcause if you tell whats really happening inside it makes you relieve to your selfand if you want someone to talk to dont hesitate to let it all out jackwhat are you talking about manif you have problems and you keep them to your self its not goodcause if you tell whats really happening inside it makes you relieve to your selfand if you want someone to talk to dont hesitate to let it all out ive been lonely all day even though i was surrounded by people this really helped thank you so so much i started crying because i just really needed to hear this today seriously thank you for being the you that you are im honored to grow as a person with you and this channel thank you so much holy fuck i finished this like 6 hours ago o ive already played this game an got all the endings but i didnt notice her face in the bathroom mirrorwow i really loved this video great job sean bringing this on also really helps me with the tough times i really and truly needed this video thank you so much sen there are no amount of words to even come close to telling you just how much i appreciate you and your videos just thank you i was about to play this game yoooo thats crazy oh my god its michael jackson angela he he shiloh dynasty is the singer for the aesthetic songs btw thank you for playing this game it helps me alot thru my depressions i thought id be fine watching this but this brings back to mnay memories ive tried to kill myself and ive had a friend do it please always talk to someone you arent alone this was kind of touching i kind of feel i dunno inspired yep that works youve changed my perspective on life and i thank you to the bottom of my heart hard to find friends like that im no female but i do appreciate a good hug everyone faceplants in life and it hurts but we need to get up take a moment to recover and push on until you fall over again and repeat then comes the warped reality when you are the saddest trust issues thinking we understand the motives behind actions and hating people for things they didnt do not loving them for what they do its hard and then when you actually realize whats truly happening you think its too late to turn back but its never too late this comment is in no way better than all the other ones so like those instead it doesnt really matter but the message is important ive been sad for a long time and then had to get up by myself and open my mind which hurts i was there for people close to me and even random people i talked to on the internet i never felt like it was a waste of time you are valid your thoughts are valid and you are a person that deserves to be happy everybody deserves to be happy and everyone is valid thoughts are always moving and thats ok its good to vent your feelings because it really helps your mind loosen up so just take time in your life to do something you love like going on a walk listening to your favorite music making art or just doing nothing all of those things are good for you and the mind so just know you are important life is so crazy sometimes i want to cry and sometimes im absolutely overjoyed a lot of the time its your positivity that reminds me that life is damn worth it cause no matter what well all end up alright great job being the wonderful person you are sean and thank you for the pma you give to your viewers people grow and keep growing were not robot keeping the old self wont move anything because human nature is about learning and growing does anyone else get scared if this stuff i mean that in no disrespectful way but this just scares me cause of how real this can be sen thank you so much im 13 and ive been going through some stuff and your words are so helpful you are one of the small amount of people that makes me happy i know you still care take enough time for you time okay happy you is happy us weve never met but weve known each other this long enjoy your life this me hit me way too hard i can relate to this whole situation in my life rn like a lot of ppl can and this was rly helpful for me thank you i dont know how 550 could even dislike this video thank you sean its very inspiring sean im glad you got to open up your mind to us im not kidding this video made me cry thank you for saying all these things and im glad you got to help yourself by saying this i hope that youre doing amazing for the 551 people who disliked wtf i feel like this has been one of the most truthful things that you have said jack ive been there and its not a good place to be and thats why asking how someones day has been is such an important thing because simple things can make a huge difference in other peoples lives i dont think a lot of people think about it that just doing simple things like showing a person that you care for them can make a huge impact on someone if anyone reads this and feels this way just try to look forward it can be hard but know you matter to the world no matter how little you think of yourself you can make great improvements in the world you dont have to be elon musk to make a difference its as simple as making someone smile from a joke or making someone laugh a difference doest have to be groundbreaking to be significant simple things can be just as important thank you sean im glad that i started watching you when i was young to be able to watch how far youve come in these l my aunty sucy soosy found she has cancer and only has 3 months left i cried hard during most of this video oml but thank you for the amazing speech sean it helped me and others a lot always remember that we love and appreciate you for everything you have done for us and for yourself my name is angela and im an aspiring artist so this really caught my attention i love the message of this video and thank you for playing this game she said uno reverse thank you for playing this game jack we love you jack and this awesome community here on your channel thank you i mean it thank you very much thank you i needed this while this is extremely sweet and it shows to keep

push myself and she always says that i want these things to be here for me so i have the opportunities but i dont care about them i dont see myself carrying about them even when i am having good days thank you so much for making this video you dont know how much this helped methank you honestly this video helped so much i am among the many people that are young and think the world is falling apart on then thank you sean for being the guy that you are and growing in to who you are it doesnt matter that you arent who you once were because its what you are going to be in the future that matters more than the past thanks to you i feel like i have the energy to live life the best i can thank you so much oh god this game ahh shiii i have played it its so sad tt plz play rainbow six siege so i

really helped me realize that i am not the only one that has this endless area of tiredness and to help me realize what i have been doing with my life and realizing on how i can actually talk to someone i was feeling like i was going to to lose myself when i was deciding to watch this video i was feeling really down but at the end of this i was smiling and i completely lost my unwillingness to live this is the first time i have came out about this and talking about this has really helped me thanks jack for opening yourself up to us like this it has really helped me realize more about my life this has taught me to live for myself and for others and to make others happy while im not you giving you story and experience and telling us about it really has helped me understand more about life thanks so much generally anyone else cry or at least wish they could hug sean seeing he teared up at one point sen no matter how many of ypur videos i watch per day you always seem to make me laugh weather your screaming or not you always have a way to make someone smile ages young or old dirty jokes or kid friendly ones every inspirational speach you give just proves to me that your not an anchor to hold us back nor a sail to take us there but a guiding light whos love shows us the way this game can teach so many people how to be better at suicide awareness and this hits me hard so relatable and this video needs to be seen by all i can fuck up literally anything yet i still have no suicidal thoughts i dont understand why others do though how and why if people truly are going through tough times i say you should get closer to god i dont know if itll help others but it helped some people i know the new you is great sean im glad you care about yourself more dont cry because its over smile because it happened jack i feel like this every day and i come to youtube and watch ur vids and feel like the world just stops and gets better has anyone else realised jacksepticeyes channel name is all lowercase been feeling like this lately and seeing this video was like a relief glad to see and read in the comments that im not alone helps me still put up the fight to stay alive this hit deep over the past 5 years i have tried my best to help some of my friends who deal with depression the emotional impact of trying to help especially recently with my best friend is insane i fell into a bout of depression myself last october and it was far darker than i imagined i understood a lot about depression but one cant understand it to its fullest extent until theyve experienced it luckily im a lot better now thanks mostly to a change of mindset a change of heart and changing habits and my best friend is doing much better than before this is because of personal relationships reach out to people they can be the best way to bring you back to the light me reading a hp fanfic while listening to this yes may your now my child best video i have ever watched i feel like i can share all my feelings with sen this is some dokidokilevel type shit going on here and like sean said in the description and in a comment he posted and pinned dont hurt yourself tell somebody if you are going to and feel like you might have to just go to all of the bad thoughts and bad people and scream fuck off if you say andor feel that you might have to do something bad to yourself think through what youre gonna do 1020 more times and make sure this is the right thing to do you might have relationship issues with your parents but just go to someone else like a really close friend or boyfriendgirlfriend someone who considers you apart of their family i had bad thoughts and managed to tell them they should fuck off if someone like me can then so can you dont feel like youre apart of a family of one you are apart of a great big family made up of you closest friends from school and work people love you an amount of people love you a large amount that consider you all they h i want hug now thank you sen from the bottom of my heart this video hit close to home for me on both sides of the spectrum personal thoughts and also a friend who killed himself talking really does help yes it hurts but it helps so thank you for your honesty and sincerity thank you sen for sharing this we appreciate it very much i followed you recently and god i wish i could did it earlier your videos helped me a lot thank you for all this love but keep some for yourself and i really understand you i hope you read this my god this game slap me on the face i juste start to get out this kind of thinking and this destructive behavior it not easy but it manageable in time but man i feel like crap some time this artstyle is so adorable and the whole concept is something i can relate to hard having suicidal friends in the past and having so much fear with the concept i love this game and i love the ability that you can feel open enough to play games like this and give fans your truthful opinion sean youve helped me through hard times in the past and i hope you know that this video and all your others could save many lives from things like suicide self harm etc despite knowing few people will even read this comment to its entirety i feel its important for me to speak about thoughts of suicide after hearing seans own story i had been going through a lot of trouble for a long time every thing i did felt worthless i felt like i didnt measure up to any of my peers i would speak to my parents and only feel like a disappointment to them i felt that i had no control over my own life every day felt long and full of things that i hated i put on a stoic face for any external observer as school is a cramped social environment where i felt i couldnt be myself to anyone and i clung to that mask i hid my personal emotions from others and it didnt feel wrong i thought this is great no one else has to suffer my feelings of worthlessness ive had my ups and downs as everyone does in their life but at my lowest point i found my self considering suicide not as a serious option but it was leading up to that i would keep thinking jack i feel you but there are some people that just dont know what to do with there life and commit suicide and dat is sad there family are sad friends are sad but try to get help dont end it like dat you u have one life make it count how do you even get all theese subscribers this is a wholesome game btw i always buy my self data for 70 pesos load like if u can realate i played this before you and it was a good game man i couldve used this video a few months ago luckily i still healed from what i was and how i felt what jack said after the gameplay that whole speech was motivational helpful and was worth the whole time listening to thank you you really helped me ive been though hard times and this really helped me thank you this seems right out the gate with the chill music and work and the scissors it seems like its baised on the video about what happened to the study girl look it up on yt and sean hopefully spelling that right dont feel bad about pulling back a bit and saving your health and always give yourself some downtime if you need a break do it and dont listen to people that tell you demeaning things people that say those typed of things like your channel is dying youre not the same or you changed so much do not have your best interest in mind and are only thinking of themselves you are all that matters and you have to take care of you doing what you love shouldnt burn you out and make you sad if you need to ignore the comments strong supporters will understand this was better than any sunday sermon the way your committed to give us amazing videos for us even though you may struggle with such things we wont hold you back from doing things you want to do in real life we know that you also have things to do in your life you may suffer from things that we have suffered through as well but we are with you in everything you do no matter what we dont only value you just like you we also have stuff to do and have other goals so if you take time off from youtube we dont mind oh no jack septiceye turned into a man bun queer dumb fuck now he looked much better and acted better when he had short green hair now he looks lazy and doesnt car anymore pussy ass sean you dont owe your entirety to everybody to anybody we came to you on this channel and chose to stay with you because we care about you and that means we want you happy we want you comfortable if you dont want to share something dont if you do do because youre human not a robot that updates status every hour and endlessly works with no rest we all bleed red we all get tired we all struggle and just because millions of people know your name does not change who you are or what your needs are we love you man i have thought about multiple times jack all i wanna say is thank you this video really helped me with some personal issues in my life currently and with a lot of stuff going on with myself and i just want to say thank you thank you for being the person you are today and being able to talk about things like this even tho they happened to you awhile ago it truly means a lot i hope you never stop doing the things you love and the things that make you happy because you deserve to be just as happy as everyone else does we love you so much push on jack you mean more to people than you think there are always people that will get you down but keep moving forward your videos touch so my people everyday its ok if you wanna take a break we all support you omg he played it i discovered this game like a week ago and i absolutely loved it its so cool to see this game on the channel thank you so much for this video sen i actually needed something like this a lot right now videos like this mean so so much to me youre my favorite youtuber i regret abandoning your channel the past few years im so glad to be back brooooo the game playing the song from shiloh dynasty d hey guys so i have a question let me start by saying that i am okay but ive dealt with depression a lot in my past weather it be myself or others i want to know advice for people scared and embarrassed about telling others or finding help with their depression i know its very embarrassingwhen it shouldnt be for a lot of people but what should that person hear at that moment to help may is like me but i dont have any friends to hug or talk about it sometimes you just have keep burring it deep inside you then let it out one day when youre alone or sleep it off there arent any good doctors down here and insurance doesnt cover adults or at least me jack if you ever ever need to take a break do it people shouldnt care and if the do fuck them i really needed this today thank you sean i would love to hear the soundtrack of this game the music really soothes me and i find it very calming if anyone knows the link or a artist that has music similar to this can you please let me know it would be very appreciated actually the only person who cared is gone now soo they say be happy but they never say how this video really hit home big time for me the longest time i was kinda like may i was depressed and didnt really know or know what to do my parents would yell at me every day and i didnt really have anyone but i had one person approach me and they pretty much stopped me from doing anything stupid but now this person isnt in my life because they got mad at me because i wouldnt share what was going on with me and then after that i kinda have been solo and bottled things up or lived in the darkness of the thoughts this is one of my favorite videos that youve ever made sean am i the only one who cried during this video probably because i wish i had someone like that during seans amazing sentimental talk does anyone know what the music was that he used in the background i love it but it was very faint thanks for everything sean wow just wow i dont think ive ever related to a game ive been battling depression for almost 2 years a lot of it had to do with losing a bunch of friends finding out that im bisexual and my constant gender dysphoria i feel like im nonbinary i completely understood how may felt i almost tried self harm and had suicidal thoughts damn i just wish i had someone like the main character in the game nobody seems to give a shit how i feel this game does a great job of expressing how depression feels it hit home hard thank you for showing me this game sean is it me or are you crying at the end of the second ending what my therapist always says is just because your problem is small in comparison to others doesnt mean your feelings are invalid you are allowed to feel upset over whatever is causing your grief or anger never compare your problems because you need to look out for you not others and if people beat you down for complaining over something small remind them that you are allowed to have emotions and to be upset i was suicidal 247 for 3 years i had over 200 cuts all over my body every day because of the pain and the hurt and i am proud to say its been a full year without those kinds of feelings and i am on the mend i held hope for when people said that it gets better even though my brain always said its been so long though it doesnt seem like it you have to keep pushing always reach out and never minimize your feelings because you think they are less than what should be accepted never stop fighting never stop having hope and always reach out i think its a great commentary because most people never see it coming someone once said its not that they didnt exhibit symptoms its that no one noticed or cared enough to read the signs we all need to be more in tune with those around us our disconnect causes a lot of misconceptions thank you so much for sharing everything you did at the end of this video ive been seeing a lot of huge long paragraphs in the comments below talking about the issues touched on in this game as well as the issues the people writing the comments have had in their life now to keep it at least a little bit more short despite the fact that me writing all of this text above the actual message im trying to convey making the message less short lol to maybe at least sum up most of what these paragraphs have said i just wanna say thank you sean you are a wonderful entertainer and have touched so many hearts continue doing what you do best i remember when i started watching jack when i was like 13 and now im almost 18 and ive outgrown his channel but videos like these were why i loved watching him different from the rest i had to text my friend who has been going through a hard time after this and tell her that im always going to be there and listen to her and im so glad shes in my life and i love her i lost a very dear friend of mine to suicide last year and i felt like if i had just reached out more then i could have helped guys seriously if you have a friend who has even minor depression or has been sad lately talk to them you dont know how much they needed to see a message from you thank you so much sean im glad i watched this im so glad i found you thank you this is so sweet i love thisthe best thing about this is that you can tell this is real this is from jack he wouldnt just read this from a script like some other people do it feels better because this is reality what he speaks this is from his reality all of our realities thanks for the ending part jack i always appreciate the real talk im not in any way affected by depression or the dark thoughts from the game and i feel blessed to be but i do completely understand comparing you yourself to well yourself vs comparing yourself to others in terms of progress status and material things ive come to the conclusion that social media is too much of a catalyst in promoting all those unhealthy emotions and associations so i strictly limit how much im on if at all i hope others can do the same in there own way aww im so glad to hear you say all that so glad you are taking much better care of yourself i understand those kind of feelings too and i also got help and reached out to friends and family keep being awesome and that pma in you heart love how genuine you are its a really hard subject but we need to talk about it life is rough its messy no matter who you are its nice to see you still talking about this kind of stuff sen i feel like you really spoke to me not just one youtuber to an audience but literally one to one giving advice to someone who genuinely needed it im currently trying to get over a huge part of my life thats been hurting me for months what you said in those last 20 minutes really had a lasting effect opened my eyes a lot of the things that you said really hit home for me in my heart you spoke to me and i am so grateful that you became comfortable enough to speak about your troubles that youve been having like the boundaries between jack and sen social media reflecting from 2017 i bet it was hard to bring it all up but i believe it was necessary in a good way you helped me by giving me guidance and advice that i didnt know i needed so from one person to another i just want to sincerely thank you i really appreciated everything you said and i know im only one out of the millions of people in this community but im 100 positive that your words hav i do want to help ppl but only if they need it and my support like my mom my boyfriend and my friends im a great listener sarah schauer 945 shes trying to make it on youtube and shes really relatable honestly i needed your message so much im nearly 25 and ive hit a ruti feel like everyone around me is doing great things and knows what they want to do and i stuck and have no idea just you saying take it step by step and thats great was just what i needed to hear thankyou sen so its about 2am where im at and alot lately i have been losing sleep because im just so overwhelmed with stress that i simply cant relax anymore but the thing is is that im not stressing about myself but for the ones i love while knowingly having problems of my own that im pushing aside and at this point have been on the side for a while now im starting to feel like i dont matter anymore and that i constantly have to make other people happy even if that means taking time away from things i love doing i dont paint or draw anymore i dont sleep one day im not eating the next im over eating i dont listen to my favorite

kill myself but couldnt find anything or didnt want the anyone to waste there time im still sad this actually triggers a lot of my fears good doctors are hard to come by i know from personal experience in that department mays experience sadly is true for enough asian kids 1st gen parents pushes hard and generally have an extremely tough time with anything else but yelling at their kids if you dont have the skin to stand up to your parents you shut down mentally which is why this game kind of hits me in areas that is pretty disturbing its pretty accurate sadly really glad i watched this video every now and then we need a video like this thx sean srry for mis spelling thx a lot actually got all endings on laptop goes to youtube sees this oh no time to watch a couple of years ago i was in a mood didnt want to wake up didnt want to work all i wanted was to play games this made my mood worse it emptied my mind made me think the worst and my angry moments with games became all i could feel that feeling soon led to emptiness over time i wanted to space myself out more and more but no one would give me the chance i spent 12 my day time awake in school surrounded by others and the rest at home where my sister and i stay because of my lack of being alone i couldnt do what i wanted to do not suicidal stuff but just thinking being surrounded by others made my life feel twice as miserable as it currently was my thoughts darkened i hid my true feelings and began to feel only sadness the only reason i wouldntcouldnt do the worst is because of my fear of doing it so i walked the earth waiting feeling miserable every day the end of school came and summer was on its way i knew much of how great things would be after thanks sean im not talking to jacksepticeye im talking to you what you said really inspired me keep up the good work i aspire to be a singer one day and lately ive had so much doubt thinking itll never happen and i have no hope i really appreciate how you explained everything about the darkest times of life and how to improve them i was harshly bullied for two years started when i was twelve and i almost did some very stupid things videos like this give me the hope i need to live my life in happiness and light videos like yours spread love and positivity to others i hope to be like you in that regard someday with love and appreciation olivia million for the first time of my life a youtube video made me cry i have being intimidate since elementary school and a lot of time i though about ending my life but watching your videos made me feel better because of your positivity and your laugh you will probably not see this message but if you see it id would like to thank you for making me think at something else than bad things even if its just the time of one video thank you sen this hit deep right to the heart and helped me thanks sen we love you sen thank you for sharing to everyone here reading though the comments you matter people love you keep going okay you honestly dont know how much you mean to this world you are so much more than just a youtube gamer i cried in so much its crazy we love you sean i am thirteen about two years into thinking of the thing that starts with s and ends with ide im planning on doing it at age fifteen i could see the tears in his eyes masterhamster will remember that im approaching a year after the last time i was the most depressed i have ever been and was suffering with harm and ideations kind of fitting that this video came out to compliment it im better now and this game and you telling your truth helped with some healing from that pain the comfort of seeing others knowing the same feelings and thoughts and how it can really mess with your head helps in innumerable ways keep living for you sean take time to put your life first and be good to yourself i saw your show when you toured through nashville and i was really put off at how a crowd had formed and tried to demand something of you that you had no real control of i cant imagine what that kind of pressure did to you when you were tired no doubt from the tour and struggling with what you talked about in this video keep performing that selfcare and i promise to do the same for myself i love you jack thank you for coming through the hard times and being such an inspiration for so many of us everything you said in this video really hit home and im thankful for it i dont always know how to face the daytoday struggle but being able to hear from someone even my favorite youtuber that its going to be okay means so very very much i hope that you continue to enjoy the new you that youve discovered these last few years ill keep working to discover who i am and who i can become based on your example thank you again for being you i shed tears right at the end when he looked me straight in the eye and told meyou doing greatjust believe in yourself thank you so much for being you never stop taking care of yourself and or your mental health and im that goes for anybody i love you for you thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings about mental health and self care its true that todays normal is so noisy and tiring im guilty of being so dependent and addicted to social media i need to retrain myself to take breaks for my brain away from the noise and unfiltered negativity online i think everyone should give and get more hugs more often every little kind gesture could turn someones dark day a little bit brighter i shed tears right at the end when he looked me straight in the eye and told meyou doing greatjust believe in yourself thank you so much for being you never stop taking care of yourself and or your mental health and im that goes for anybody i love you for you fuck man im just 13 minutes in to this video and am already almost crying when my dad died a few years ago i thought about doing this myself i used to cut myself sometimes and i had traumas from my dad he was an alcoholic its times like this when something as simple as a youtuber can motivate you to keep living and go on that im really happy that i didnt do it i got trauma therapy and now im living on a living group for people with autism sounds all real bad i know but people like sean make me wanna go on and dont give up this all happened a few years ago im 16 now for the people that read this if youre struggling with life in any way i hope it will all get better because you deserve it damn im 14 and that was deep ive always loved you and your chanel but this moth you became a massive inspiration to me and i really thank you for all youve done these years im sorry i missed stream a whole bunch of stuff happened and i wanted to donate but i will just donate a different way i have so much to say but i never bother to say it you could ask anyone i know and theyll all tell you im the positive one thatll lend an ear or give you the most sincere hug wether youre a stranger or not but the thing is its been far too long since ive had a hug or ive had someone to talk to i dont normally say anything like this to anyone let alone random people in the comments section on a youtube video but honestly at the end of the day my only constant is the paradox of trying to make myself happy its impossible if anyone out there feel like talking about anything at all reach out to me i know what its like to feel worthless and to feel like a complete loser just spinning their wheels yet never gaining the traction to take off its hard to sound sincere in text form but im being 10000000000 honest when i say i care im human sean is human we are all human we are in this together and we are all just trying to make the best of this life we have on this ball of dirt i hv same problem as may i was a golden child good at everything while i was little but now everything has fallin apart i love drawing but my mom said it useless and cant make money c i think this always hppened to a child w asian parents you helped me with my thoughts thank you for helping me know im not alone yes hi this video made me cry i relate a lot to may lots of times i was so close to doing what she did but eventually i got help and found the right medication i still have times of deep depression but now i know that ill be okay i just need to push forward life is worth living and one day ill be able to breathe im using this video to hide from a really loud thunderstorm the lightning looks like its right outside my window its scary and the thunder is rumbling the walls thank you for helping me hide pray for me im getting scared ps i have a really emotional poem i wrote should i share it no clap at the start i believe some people see past the fact that these youtubers are r e a l people they arent just androids set to release videos continuously and mindlessly they go through changes they need space they need breaks theyre just like us and its unfortunate that because of the way we constantly pelt them about views or upload times or their relevancy they end up breaking so thank you sean for being there for us even when youve been struggling yourself when times got rough for me and others youve always been an outlet and you should know that youre doing great as well and youve pulled us out of the darkness thank you for the people that are interested in this game there are 2 more endings if you can i highly suggest buying the game and playing it for yourself oh my gosh jackie im so happy you opened up to us and i can only speak for myself but i understand wanting to live in the moment not having to record every bit its understandable and people should respect it the only time when i want to know everything is when youre hurting when you feel so lost because thats what youve done for me i understand being scared i understand not wanting to voice your emotions because you dont think youll get to a point but honestly the point doesnt matter you need to vent just let the thoughts that have been in your head out do it the people that really honestly care will listen we will support you we love you so so much i love you so much and when i finally see you at pax you are getting the biggest hug from me and i will tell you then what im telling you now im crying ack im sorry this hit many people so deep thank you jack for all spending time talking about serious issues that some people might just brush off but this helped everyone who saw this a lot and me this made me cry when i cry it means that its helpful thank you so much i could never ever ever hate you and idk how someone could happy you could talk it out and talk about it life really sucks but people like you make life worth living even if your channel goes down witch it wont people will still love your videos and there will always be that one person that says man this guy was the best positive comments only please i love your channel and all the videos youve been posting for the last few years looking back on everything that youve done and how much youve changed the last few years im so so so proud of you thank you for this video and for playing such a meaningful game 3 crying so much rn this video reminds me of why im proud to have someone like jack to look up to no matter what you do jack your sincerity and honesty will always shine through the game was amazing but that heart to heart at the end really hit me ive been going through the thick of it for a while now im in that place where i feel like my life is aimless and i have no idea what i want to do with myself and im always so damn tired bone deep tired i am slowly getting to the point where i feel like maybe i can be okay i know it will be a long journey but people like you and videos like this help a lot so thank you for the talk and thank you for all you do so im looking at the comment section and see people sharing they stories and i thought ill share mine its not a big of a deal or anything you can just move on but i tought ill write it down so in february ive realized that ive lost all my friends my classmates are assholes i started thinking that even my family doesnt really give a shit about me and my last friend just told me that the only reason she was talking to me because im alone the other day i got blocked off from all her social media sites so i was pretty lonely from day to day the sadness became anger the anger became hate and the one i hated was me but i texted one of my old friend to wish her a happy birthday we started chatting about each others life of course i didnt tell her about my kind of depressed toughts or anything like that then the next day when i woke up ive seen her massages in my notification center and i was more happier than ever before so we became close friends jack i am sensitive to these subjects but you make it better i cried at 3202 this really hit home because we all been through all of this and if you went through a lot i have been there too and if you had a rough childhood a lot of people have been in your shoes and whatever you do dont heart your self and if you think about all find some to talk to and if you sell stuck lifes to short try to have happy memories not sad memories im not saying oh been sad is bad no im just saying that ive been there and i thought how will affect others my love one but one more time if youre thinking about it talk to someone and trust me a lot of people have im there and so have i my cousin told me that he thinks about killing himself everyday because he doesnt feel joy anymore and i wanted to help him so much but i couldnt think of anything to say everything that i did say was probably useless and didnt help him im worried about him this uno reversed my depression and anxiety jack always be yourself dont let the community completely shape who you are dont feel like youre letting us down by changing who you are well still love you however you are im only 12 and i started to tear up i watched like 2 minutes of this then i was like nope this is gonna be saddd ackk i cant deal with that thank you for the message man sen you dont have to be that person that everyone wants you to be you can be yourself and ill be more happy i am not one of those people who wants the green hair back so i if you like your normal hair more than green hair you should just keep your normal hair dad of the year everyone i have chronic depression i am getting some help your videos always help me so keep doing what you do 1113 i think we all know whats going on i didnt watch further till now but i am well shit

just sadness getting bored of how is everything doing something i dont like afraid of doing what i love because i cant live doing that thanks sean now i can see some things thank you for talking about this topic even if its sensitive i tried to end it all in early january and survived and let me say ive never been happier to be alive to have gotten help so please if you are having those kind of thoughts talk to someone it helps stay alive love how he almost quoted sarah schauers vine lol februarymarch of 2019 was the first time i truly felt like i wanted to die my shyness and sometimes socialanxiety got really bad that school year until it was the worst ever and it still kinda is everyday i would go into my geometry class and 80 of the time i would have thoughts about killing myself because a few people in it drove my shyness crazy which caused my friend relationships to damper and theirs to strengthen with others its so hard sometimes but towards the end of school my passion for tennis started back up and my social awareness did get better which i was so grateful for right now its okay but in conclusion there is going to be people out there or close to you that cares and i love how this game shows that prayers to you jack i hope you never have to ask that suicidal question or feel that way again hey jack ik this is my first comment but i want you to know that you mean a lot to mewhen im feeling down i just watch your happy wheels vidsin soo happy that i found you i hope we can meet in person wow i so glad i watched this video the stuff here is things that everyone

brightens my day everyone sadness sadness and more sadness suicide self harm me mabeeeeeeeelllllll sticker 3745 im sorry im wayyy to optimistic for my on health that one sticker brought me so much joy hi everyone im 13 as i grow up and go through puberty and start to become somewhat of a young adult i appreciate people giving me advice and the time of day to just help me out im realizing that its ok to not be happy all the time or not know what to do or how to handle something the more adults i talk to the more i find out that they themselves also have no clue whats happening i know everyone says this these days but the past 5 years have put me in a sort of depressed state with the loss of both of my mothers parents and a fallen dog of 2 years from epilepsy combined with heartbreak after heartbreak and low self esteem its been hard for me but now that im moving houses i feel like im finally getting the reset i need so to anyone reading this just know that no matter how long it takes things will always be better just take it day by day dont ever think the world is better without you because everyone is unique and irreplaceable peace and love to all spread the love this game is absolutely beautiful not only the art and music but that story growing up my best friend was suicidal this is the most accurate ive ever seen those conversations bless angela and bless you sen you are amazing and help so many people daily goddamnit sean im sitting in my bed crying at what you had to say and i just want to thank you for being a little bit of light in this dark world you will forever be loved by your fans didnt the creator of this also make vee is calling me starting wathcing the video yay this is gonna be so fun me at the end of the video where all these tears come from but seriously sen thank you for being who you are youre an amazing person after that first ending i wanted to cry cause my best friend used to harm herself and she tried it one time and she had a rough day today so after the first one i called her and asked how she was doing and we had a good long conversation and it was real nice and i stayed otp til she fell asleep cause ik how much she likes company after bad days idk what id do without her shes the best person in my life the amount of power it took to keep his tears away your so wholesome she pulled a sayori most people dont associate fun with harry potter fanfiction but this this does put a smile on my face who the frick are the 550 people that disliked this oh cool another video description blatant ctrlc warning this game deals with some very heavy topics pinned comment some shit about being positive this is how you lose my trust tool is one of my favorite bands which songs do you like right now i like eulogy anyways i really appreciate everything you said in this video i dont mind changes to the channel as long as you are happy and taking care of yourself at 1052 ish when you clicked the door the ihop commercial perfectly came in yeahthis is very heavybut this made my dayi almost cried if you ever think about committing suicide try to think about the impact you might have or have already had your pet will miss you your friends will miss you your family will miss you try to think about the thing that is most important to you that beat is hard btw the song in the background inthe beginning and some parts of the game is called losing interest thank you jack i am having some dark thoughts but you helped me see that i need to seek help thank you from the bottom of my heart anybody realize that the sound track is saying i keep scaring her away with my emotions its hard to hear but just listen closely ok honestly i need someone 2 talk 2 i feel suicidal and i am depressed but i havent told anyone so i cant ask parents 4 anti depression pill and i tried once but the hill i climb is hard and the reward is these videos and i dont anyone 2 know but i feel like i can say here that last sentence just made me break down thank you sen i didnt realise how much i needed to hear that make sure that you remember your own advice too its very easy to give advice sometimes and even easier to forget your own no matter how useful you know it is you are amazing kind funny generous and you just have that personality that is warm welcoming please dont ever forget how important and amazing you are this shit is exactly what people need to hear this spreads more awareness than you know you put things into words that some people cant as in feeling burnt out and not feeling like doing the things you love because lack of mental appreciation and caring for yourself sometimes put yourself first and focus on what you need thank you jack for everything even though you dont know it youve helped me a lot i hope youre doing well thank you i love how the vibe of the game goes perfectly with the shiloh dynasty reverb in the background look jack sean we all know youre just human dont push yourself to only be an entertainer and think you have to make content for us when youre in a bad place youre a friend to us and we want you to be doing well in all ways before you make us laugh i speak for everyone in your community when i say that we love you and support you through all things if you need to take a break well understand we care about you and we always will through thick and thin were here for you we love you sean where is the green hair sometimes i feel really bad about myself worthless and tired of myself about my career and i forget about this is okey its okey to feel bad and

things to make me feel better when my mind continued to be negative it still does but ive found ways to cope with it everyone goes through depression differently and having someone like you to tell us about how you went through it or to help talk to us make life easier this is why i wish i was friends with you because you are a down to earth and caring guy you mentioned about taking small victories and steps to help with depression or being miserable or sad and i for one have taken a huge step i was in a job that was taking a huge toll on my mental health for 7 years i finally said i had enough

really close friends to suicide and now i treat everyone like my best friend and it gets overwhelming and my friends can see that but honestly its totally worth it ive played this game before and honestly im also am a big fan of the art style and story its amazing you can find gameplay on my channel too if you want to check that out this shit hit hard like for me this is so damn relateable it isnt even funny like im only 12 ok im gonna be honest about that this hits so hard the cutting that random person saving you from that very infinite seeming void of darkness your trapped in seeing no future ahead im very thankful that this person saved me that was lovely thank you for being so open and heartfelt 3217 notice in the box one of the names is junji ito as in the artist of several korean short horror mangas i needed your talk at the end of the video with my personal issues along with family problems life has been hell for me even when i was little it was hell but your speech towards the end really helped me in ways you dont know thank you for believing in me even though you dont know me and i appreciate you for being here and not just some random guy who doesnt care about his viewers thank you sean for being here for all of us i myself have never been suicidal but multiple times ive found myself trying to help other girls who are going through depression and i found it hard to help them without them becoming too dependent on me i have never felt anything so terrible than when i had to deny someone who thought i was the only person in the world who cared about them can you play broforce its cool as much as i hate all these sad comments saying oh pity me i relate but i will say i have thick deep pink scars near everywhere its gotten to the point that if i sit in the sun i can feel them as if they were open wounds again they are so sensitive on the 5th pf this month i tried to kill myself and swallowed a whole bottle of random meds i collected and i woke up two hours later vomiting them all up all sorts of colors coming out suicide attempts always felt like a reset button but this one wasnt i was so weak and in pain when i woke up ta i couldnt sleep and couldnt move i slithered down the hall to the bathroom and just sat in the water for 4 hours feeling too weak and shaky to move my lips blue my mom came in to find me covered in vomit sitting in a bathtub of icy water with a bottle of pills still in my hoodie pocket i went to the hospital my mom dropped me off a block away out of shame and i walked in wearing a towel and underwear shame is the o noooo jackk dont cryyy we all love youu soo soo much thank for everything you put out it really makes my day seeing your goofy self and remember its always ok to be sad and we all are always here for you this video it hit me hard im stuck in a bad place right now nothing is wrong in my life either i have friends im having great opportunities my parents treat me good im very lucky but im still stuck i have tourettes ocd and anxiety lately ive been really tired though and it really has crossed my mind what if i ended everything i think i have depression i dont want to make a big deal out of it because i feel stupid for complaining about my life when i have such a great life im confused and lost but i think i should open up this video pushed me to want to talk about how depressed i have been thank you sen this channel this community is my safe place maybe ill be able to push past this i know jack is loud but did anyone else think that this video was really loud top of the mornin to ya laddies were back jack i am so sorry thank u this slapped me i am so sad and i am in a rut you kinda made me feel better ly the only permanent thing in the world is change heraclitus i think jack is a transformer confirmed he turned in to dr phil in the last bit of the video not exactly sure but using context clues i think this girl is gay so thats gay oh jack you are so beautiful we all think that we love you and most of these people can relate to you and this game it really hurt my heart when your eyes were literally on the verge of tears im not depressed and im not suicidal but i really really hope you are okay and that everyone here is okay you are not irrelevant and we all care about you i love you sen wow we got deep on the doing what makes you happy jack i am glad you found the thing you enjoy to do anyone know what the song was that was played around the first 10mins of the game sean youre such an amazing person and such a source of inspiration for me i absolutely love you your pma talks have helped me so much and i cant thank you enough i will always have 90 mins for you please keep talking about mental health please keep spreading pma i really could not watch this i feel like it is about depression i mean for me it was probably just a puberty thing that lasted months i was pretty close to cutting myself but i powered through and doing much better anyone who goes through depression dont give up there are people who love you and that is something i promise i realize and i am only 12 and what i dealt with was only a fraction with what some of you are dealing with talk to people because my dad helped me deal with it i have gotten better fight it and youll be better giving up will only spread the sadness oof jack you reminded me of etika again shit if only etika had a friend that could support him like this sean im currently depressed myself not a day goes by that i dont consider just ending it all but then someone like you comes along and gives me hope life is a long and hard thing but if you push through the bad youll see the good without the bad nothing good can happen and nothing bad means the good is evermore unrecognized so if you or anyone else reading this comment is suicidal or depressed or just generally lonely please look for the good after the bad seek help talk to someone if it works comment here ill try and talk to you cause i and everyone else here knows youre a great person and someone loves you i just wanted to get this off my chest so thank you for being a beautiful human being thank you welli dont think your irrelevant

me to just keep pushing a little more thank you so much for videos like these i like you with the real smile on your face there was a very haunting moment as i watched this video this game when i realized i mirror may in so many ways from the family issues to the dark thoughts to the bad habits to the constant feeling of being tired even when all she needed was a hug i realized how much i need someone there for me how much i have needed someone there for me and then i thought about how much people like sean have helped me work through these things while i cant get a physical hug a silent show of comfort ive always had someone there my story may be insignificant to others but people like sean ha e helped me realize that im not insignificant i am not better yet i have a lot of work to do and videos like these remind me that its okay i dont need to be better yet it takes time to get better i will be okay and i always have someone there whether it be sean or someone else who have proven that they care about my existence even if they dont know me personally to an this shit hits home real hard ive not cut before but this video has me in tears cuz of how similar things are yeah im okay always coming out of my mouth sometimes its real but most the time it isnt and sean you describe everything very well at the end keep making videos dawg you keep me happy not your videos but

hits home too hard oof i remember a game from 2015 like annie something idk but this video reminds me of it sean im sure you have the channel with some of the most loyal subscribers if you took a week off every month or so i surely wouldnt mind i myself love a good youtube binge session but how else do tv shows sell per episode they make quality content with predefined release dates and receive higher ratings if you took your time on every upload and dedicated a mental health day or week im sure your audience would love you that much more it has being you d hug just hug the game sen the whole video the timing of this video was so good considering what im going through and the thoughts going through my mind right now thank you so much 785 people missed the like button i think it should be sad and scary how many people can emphasize with may i personally had the same story only part was that even death hated me enough to not accept me xd weres the whip 439 is me in a nutshell never forget that when you say laugh it sounds like a crow can you be my therapist is it just me or did you instantly this k there was a gay and transgender flag and was surprised it didnt get brought upbut dmab i can relate because im ducking ass at being an adult compared to other people but with me i understand my limits and fuck jack thank you for the hitting home speach very very very relatable thank you these are powerful words that are important to share if you were happy everyday of your life youd be a tv show host veronica sawyer i feel like this type of a video i can say something that i had said before i am an author so if you dont want to hear stuff about writing pass by if youre willing to listen please keep reading this comment life is like a story life is like how i write them first person nobody knows what will happen life isnt perfect but sometimes all we need is a first draft to understand what we needed to do and why the easiest way out is always the most bothering usually just destroying the world characters everything it has always been infuriating to find that happening we all are a bunch of strings dangling together all of different lengths it takes a long time to neatly tuck in each loose strand into a beautiful decoration the younger we go the less beautiful the decorative piece others can carry to remember you which means they wont keep it for long the longer a life you lead the more elaborate your story becomes you shouldnt just cut out fate you may lose all 3257 when he said all that it rly helped me and kinda gave me some hope that things will get better so thank you sean oof that writing bit got to me its tough doing what you love when so many people put down its potentiality to make money also wow what a fantastic game i do deal with a certain amount of depression and i relate to the monotony im so thankful for what i have though honestly god is the biggest reason i can keep my head above water and i have such great people in my life not everyone has that and i just hope and pray that people find the light that i know is there i dont mean to sound preachy i do really appreciate you sen youre a really wonderful person and i think the world is a better place having you in it i was just sharing a bit of my story with you guys i love you all and please please please just know that you are not alone there are so many people out there who feel just like you do you are unique but in some ways your struggles are not they are unique in that they are yours but they arent in that there are a lot of people who struggle with 2452 what jack said just struck mei do it cause it makes me happy i critize some things ive done in the past alot and it just hit me now as to why i did those things and why i kept on doing it because for the majority of it it made me happy i too am trans and gay i needed this so much ive been going through so much and sometimes everything just seems like a blur i was back in school in like mid year and i was in a place that i had never hoped to be in and i didnt know what to do with myself i had a friend walk with me and he said he was there for me but i didnt know him all that well so it just felt empty everything just felt empty and surreal i wanted to cry and shout and tell everyone that i felt like a monster that didnt deserve to be loved because of what i had done but i just kept it all in cause i thought if i let it all out i would have no more love no more encouragement i let my past haunt me and get in the way of me thinking about the future and i hated it i hated myself for it my mom eventually found out and said she was there for me i appreciated it but it still didnt feel likeenough i started counseling with a woman named kasey and just talking about things that im shy about and little things that hur i am so glad you have touched on this becasue i know exactly what you are talking about there was a point to where i just stopped everything for 3 months got kicked out of school for not showing up anymore everyone had this built up anger for me not doing anything but then i met this one person and they just cared for me hit me up asking if i was ok and genuinely cared for me and with that happening i finally got out of the hole i dug for myself and im starting school again in this coming up year and im happy im ok and i can say that and mean it now thanks for singlehandedly making everyone think people will say top of the morning to ya when they land in ireland haha 12001320 i had goosebumps and i started to get very cold oo so sad too when he said you deserve happiness i swear i cried so hard edit thx for the likes haha thanks a lot sen i really needed to hear that take care of yourself just like i need to take care of myself have a great rest of your day ive always suffered with anxiety and depression as far back as i can remember but in 2018 i was in a horrible relationship which i did not even realize was horrible until months after it ended the relationship took a bad turn and ended and i fell even deeper into my depression i had started self harming again after having stopped a year or two prior i was seriously considering suicide to the point of planning and writing the note my family would read when they found me i would cry night after night for hours to distract myself from the pain i began watching youtube more specifically your channel i have been a fan of yours for a long while prior to this but i absolutely love your humor and at this time you were the only thing that made me smile i was engrossed with the concept of pma even though my mindset wasnt positive in the slightest i began watching you every night and falling asleep to your videos which i still do to this day i cannot sleep without a video of you im so proud of you sen ive been watching your videos for years and i see how far youve come youve helped a lot of people through the years and youre just such an amazing person all i can really say is thank you for this video i saw this game and wanted to play it but knew i didnt have the strength so your words of encouragement and being able to see you play this means a lot this hit home thank you sen my birthday was today and the game sang happy birthday coincidence the song jack picked lowkey sounds like an older xxxtentacion sadder song i could watch this all day long so relateble we love you sean honestly we love you i love you i know you dont need to hear it but you mean a lot and this game makes me want to draw the inner version of myself i want to be but am to scared to be youll always matter and thank you because i had to fold an origami butterfly to not cry at the end of this video but it motivates me to continue with my depression fixing because we cant all be the same person forever i totally get it i heard tumblr the videogame and just had to click off you dont know how much i needed this video today thank you damn when sean makes a 50 minute video and more of it is dedicated to a heart to heart talk its impossible not to love him games come and go but its segments like these that i love the most ive been going through some really hard times lately and listening to this helps me reflect a bit and feel better inside if this was all his channel was and no more games i would still watch every one of them i love that shiloh is playing in the background the part when may shared her experience with her parents really hit hard her experience was like exactly the same as mine since i love literature arts and have no interest in becoming a doctor or lawyer in primary years all i got was straight as but when middle school started ive started kinda falling behind and my as dropped to bs and cs its kinda scary how similar her story was haha and my parents are chinese so its like exactly the same i dont know if anyone will read this so i really dont know why im writing it but if you do thank you i dont understand why people are disliking this video this is life real issues people go through thank you for being real sen its somewhat nice to know your not alone in feeling this way we all need to love ourselves and others a little more every single person matters in this crazy world you touch more people than you think you matter thank you sean thank you so much thank you no mattre how old you are if youre sad drink some hot chocolate and put on some russel howards good news jesus fuck may telling about her life growing up made me tear up because its exactly like mine i just want to give that poor girl the biggest hug i love you jack i hope youre safe and happy prosperous in life i love just listening to him talk about this sort of stuff and the speech at the end of the video made me feel so much better about myself and my life and i just feel like if i tell anyone about how i feel theyll treat me differently or wont believe me cause im too young or im just too scared to talk but im trying to get better at communicating even though its hard and that speech really helped me thanks sean i hate tumblr me listening through every thing jack said and how his life is hard and giving us something to listen to to he happy makes my day go by easier thank you sen so very much and also at 4755 when jack said im talking to much his camera was saying yes he was sorry had to put that in but thank you so much for the fun videos and all the excitement you put out in them they make my day go by a little easier thank you jack thank you for this truly heartfelt and personal video its so good and honest and just thank you all we need to do is listen to you and just stay calm and listen and im pretty sure you helped us all so we should help you back not even a high five and not enaugh energy i think sean just woke up im so scared to talk with others the best version of you is the one that grows with everyone keep going on san the community is here for you we get it do you youve given us enough we dont need all of you needed this today thank you jack hey jack in this video there were a lot of connections to my depression but i fight my demons with all my strength that i get from watching you and a lot of other content creators that i enjoy my demons inside were at the worst when i was in 8th grade that was the year i found your channel and after i found your channel and a lot of others you and the other content creators gave me the power to suppress my demons anyone remember emily is away no awwww last night i had a dream where literally everyone i cared about suddenly hated me for no reason and it was eerily realistic so i thought it wasnt a dream even after i woke up in my dream my crush was the last person i talked to and then they told me i was the main reason that they were gonna do what they were about to do and then they killed themselves and it looked so real i was so scared imagine watching ur crush kill themselves and say that ur the reason why imagine thinking its real imagine seeing it in graphic detail then imagine waking up and having to spend hours directly after seeing that with 5 year olds and imagine thinking that it wasnt a dream in the first place oh and the whole time you have no internet so theres no way to confirm that it didnt happen then imagine finally getting in contact with your crush only to find out theyve tried to kill themselves numerous times before then they tell you not to worry about them thats how my day went 2121 the epidemic is people being suicidal and the cure its happiness or just having someone to talk to i used to have major depression and even attempted to kill my self a couple times but the whole pma movement really pushed me to get help and now my depression is not as bad so thank you sean and now i am able to help my girlfriend when she is on the verge of suicide thanks to me still being alive sean thank you for being you even though i have feelings and thoughts like this every day i always put the feelings of others before myself no matter how bad it gets i dont see myself as anything important but i always feel like i have to let the people i know that theyre important to even more people no matter how bad it seems dont let it consume you dont let it be you you mean so much more than what the voices and noises in your head say you are important you are relevant you are loved i really relate to may i just wish i had a friend i could lean on omg my gay ass saw a pretty girl in the thumbnail and stopped functioning until i snapped out and finally clicked i have a friend who suffers from depression and anxiety dont worry shes been getting a lot better and may even looks like her its uncanny thank you sean since i found your channel youve been an inspiration i really appreciate your devotion to mental health awareness and making the world better in general episode 147 of why did youtube recommend this to me episode 1 of things youtube did right i love you even more now then back then btw u the thing that turn me offfeel something off was at 600 cause i been there before and i just saying this cause you need to pay attetiom to them when it like that just dont said bye or has a good day but plz do what jack did here asking them what wrong why now cause you never know what may going and that might help them in someway so plz when somebody acting like that dont ignore them but pay more attention to them cause you dont know what is happening to them and dont know when they may gone so plz dont ignore them dont do what i did plz wow sen thank you so much for those words ive felt like there is something wrong with me all of those words you said about your thoughts were literally the words i just told to my mother 4 hours ago i needed to hear that you are helping so many people thank you for creating such a supportive and loving community that i can feel safe in please dont feel obligated to share your life with us and put 100 of your life into this channel you arent here to entertain us 247 you are perfect now because you are happy you have grown so much and i am so sorry that people are trying to tell you that they miss the old you and that your channel is dying if someone says they are a fan but tries to make you change or says they dont like you as much now they arent a true fan a fan will support you no matter what growth isnt bad you are so amazing even on my worst days i always have your videos to cheer me up i cant help but laugh along with you until my eyes tear up and my sto thank you for this video this is exactly what i needed those bad thoughts that i thought i had finally gotten rid of crept back in this week and i cant relate in words how much this video meant to me thank you for giving me the courage to reach out to the people that love me you have such a beautiful heart i wish this was a series were you could date may and sorry for all the people that feel that way because iv been someones reason that they didnt commit suicide or ran away is it bad that the pride flags were the first thing i noticed in this game xd didnt know how much i needed this video until i watched it i will always be so thankful that you upload videos like this ive been a fan of your videos since 2014 and this kind of thing is why if this video didnt help anyone else just know that it definitely helped me a lot im glad you take time for yourself now and dont give everything of yourself to youtube you seem so much happier and free since everything that happened to you in 2017 youve definitely grown and have become such a stronger and better person 2018 and most of this year have been my version of your 2017 and i hope that i come away from it with as much progress as you have the shrk and shiloh dynasty music in the background was perfect i realized that the in the title screen you can see the scissors she cut herself with and it looks like they are in a pool of blood hugs for sen everybody gather around hugs for sen sen some people use their friends some use family but when i cry its because of those people sometimes and i cant go to them i cant run to them for support and one day things almost happened so i went to my room and i watched you and for the first time in almost a damn week i laughed for a real reason not a fake laugh thank you for saving me and so many others sen i couldnt say that enough to get the point across ps sen you dont have to listen to me but youre and have been my favorite youtuber and over all person for almost 5 years his intro noooooo their was no slap their was no scream in top of the morning to u laddies u know what i mean i think youre doing pretty good sen ive been watching jacksepticeye for years now and im glad you changed the way you did because now you seem a lot more authentic either way your videos will always make me smile why would people dislike this 939 i was thinking the exact same jack ive thought dark thoughts too and what would if i went through with me i thoughts and i instantly think of my parents and how much they would break down since they met death at such a young age and then i get angry for thinking of the easy cowardly way out cause i have one goal in life and before i could ever give up on anything i have to do that 1 thing so when i see play or watch games like these i get dizzy and silent wanting to help so thanks jacksepticeye sen i relate to this game hard and mt sis harder me and her went through this and i still kind of am i love this sen so much probably more than past sen sen youre so much more relatable and real today i use to go to you to forget about my depression and anxiety but i now i go to you to help me push through my depression and anxiety and fight through it you give me hope that i can do this and people do care i love you today sen change as much as you need as long as its for the better jack thank you so much you have motivated me so much ily and i really hope that people realize that ur channel is still great never put yourself down you forgot to read your messages i love you so much youve given me so much happiness and inspiration im so happy your still on this platform and giving everyone inspiration whats the point in life we all die at some point in 100 years no one will remember you unless youre some pop star celebrity in the end nothing matters life ends we end everything comes to an end whether its happy or not do you remember childhood everything was so simple and easy yet you always hated it at the time when you couldnt wait to be an adult and have no more math homework do you remember trying to impress other people if you arent good enough whats the point what if people dont like you what if you are different what if theres no point at one point we all have to say goodbye to happiness to joy to friends to family to beloved pets or animals or anything say goodbye to all hope when depression takes over everything is numb why cant i feel anything why dont you love me whats wrong with me why do you like me why am i different why am i the same to everyone else why dont i have friends why do people wish death on me why is life do more wack it games plz tw my depression made me not shower brush my teeth made me plan my suicide note when i was saying the pledge of allegiance at school i was in therapy for two years i take an antidepressant now i graduated from therapy and im better im an activist for mental health now going around and sharing my story im not good 100 of the time but now i know how to deal with my depression episodes when i have them things get better i am living breathing proof yes mental illness is ugly and scary but youre not you have depression but it is not you im proud of what youve done and what youll continue to do common man when is next outer wilds video damn this video brings back sucidal thoughts man in 2018 i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and i suffer with it everyday i self harm on and off a lot too later that same year i wasnt diagnosed with these but i feel like im bipolar and have borderline personality disorder i also have terrible relationships with food i have tried to end it all multiple times your videos have helped me so fucking much these past 3 years thats how long ive been subscribed for and i cant thank you enough gonna sound like every person ever but i know you wont see this jack but for someone who does please stay strong and if you ever need to talk to someone thats very much okay i had a therapist and it was great but sadly i havent talked to her in almost a year cause money issues point is please stay strong and get help if you need it thank you for reading this was just amazing the writing is absolutely phenomenal its so real and makes you think about how and who you talk to jack if you ever change i will follow even if you only upload once a week i will follow to you shawn hi sean just wanted to say i love you have a great day what kind of weak ass intro was that i have ptsd and depression this video and your words help its amazing you say all this because bit gives me a little more hope and im getting help i have a youtube channel and i was at a position where i didnt have the resources or creativity to make any better videos but the conversation at the end of this makes me want to post more for the handful of people who will see it i didnt upload in months and i wouldnt have if i didnt see this and i feel relieved now i usually draw happiness by complimenting people on reddit who do things like make a cool drawing or build a cool castle in minecraft but its hard to do that if i feel like no body wants what i have for the world but only my shared happiness this rant showed me that with what i have i can truly open up with my hobbies and projects i complete i cant give to this earth if nobody wants to see my gift but now im gonna try hard to show it thanks sean the first thing he pointed out was the pride flags i didnt come here to hear the truth ive felt like committing sucide a few times bc of the way my life was my parents and stuff but its better now and the 3rd i tried to overdose my self it always felt terrible i couldnt focused i was all over the place at night but then i fell down on my bed covered up i woke up the next morning like every time i try i fail is this a sign that i should just stop and try to make things better and then a few days later when another dumbass argument happens between me and my mom i put my foot down and said everything i felt like i was 12 and 13 at that time last i tried suicide was when i was 13 in march 2018 and then few days later in april that argument and then after that i went to my therapists who i no longer go to bc im better i take my meds but they still think bc i get mad oh im gonna tell the doctor this and that as a threat but they never understand and listen to me bc thier the adult in the kid im 14 now and yeah but life gets better and then theirs days were its like my l oh no jacks gonna get hit by copyright those meme images are from we bare bears great show the hardest part is knowing all of this and still not being able to escape i only just turned 18 but ive had more than my fair share of psychological pain hey jack you have to watch attack on titan season 3 part 2 the final season is coming next year season 4 a while ago i just watched dylan the hacker for some reason but one of his recent vid said jacksepticeye is mean u really helped me after my mom past last year 3 days after the 4 of july i started to go into a dark place and you and

me feel not so alone shiloh background music thank you jack i feel like may but dont worry im not going to do anything bad thank you for being so careful and nice your the best i feel like i should be crying but then after this video i look at my inbox on wattpad and someone told me how much the enjoy the style of my stories i feel great ive never been suicidal but i have been deeply depressed so depressed that i wasnt doing anything not showering not eating not talking i was laying in bed and that was it i felt like i was never going to be a productive member of society and i still sometimes feel like that some of the things you said in this video really touched me because it felt like you were talking to me directly i dont regularly watch this channel but sometimes i come across a video i decide to watch im really glad that this was one of them thank you sean i want to thank you for being an amazing human being and for being open with the world this game and the situations in it really hit home for me as well those thoughts are with me every day and some days are harder to fight them back than others keep being you flashes back to when he played a game like this about someone making videos and bein trapped with he had green hair tears in eyes god damn it sen oh god fuck you jack now im over here crying and shit right now im living a little better than i was a year or two ago its not much but its better and i ooped so fucking hard once you got in your feelings i love you if i ever see you imma hug you its gay its tumbler the video game ive thought about it too been there the people that know why i thought that think its preposterous but it was very real thoughts to everyone going through this thank you jack this really helped me overcome some of my worries in life i was diagnosed with epilepsy when i was born and i recently had a seizure after 10 years of not having any it was scary and has been causing my anxiety and depression to spike up after watching this video and listening to you talk i feel like i can keep moving forward with a positive attitude i know you probably wont see this but thank you anyway thank you jack you touched on a very important subject today i relate to this on a whole level a while ago i did attempti was just in a very dark spot and im still struggling to get back into the way of things now i have very good and close friends that are helping me to get back plus jack and many other youtubers they help a lot tooso thanks rileyfdp fde dont be stressed hey dude just wanted to say i love your vids and they helped me through some hard times just wanted u to know u helped me through some ending it all thoughts and i love u pls reply i am sad and dont have a lot of friends thank you sean for what you said at the end of the video well jack im literally always trying to hide myself from behind a confident facade that just isnt me and well i have no one to open up to and that really hurts me im the kind person who would tell you not to do selfharm and then turn around and then do i struggled with the indecision of whether or not to do it and then selfharmed for about 1 year but i didnt want to hurt those around me so instead i just carved up my shoulder and legs and i topped finally but i ant take this mean and nasty place we call and i cant decide whether or not its better for to embrace the end or deny the beginning so my life is so far been garbage since 6th when i learned that im bisexual andi have no one to love but all others out there remember ur great 2342 hahahahaha literally right before i was reading hp fanfics and a little while ago my family was watching a hp marathon when jack was talking about things you want to do i get views but not subs how do i get them i love the video liked the video and the rant was great i enjoy your talks and i love hearing more about you sean i hope everything is going good with you and your gf stay awesome we know your life and growth as a person is more important than having a fulllength video every day and all that stuff i hope you get to grow as a person this year and drop off all this unhealthy thinking live pma sorry for my grammar no it is my first language i just happen to suck at it xd whoever reads this you can do it all you have to do is believe in yourself and you can accomplish anything with love and support from those who care so much about you youre loved and valid have a lovely day me looks at video video has 50 minutes has disclaimer in description me time for some awesome wholesome content from sen that makes this channel awesome this video was so touching both in the video game aspect but the part when sean was taking at the end imma go cry and then check up on all of my friends because i love them im gonna be honest for once im going through the hardest time of my life because i have so many people depending on me but i have noone that i can depend on and 2 years ago you produced so much but none of it was as genuine as your content now because now you might not tell us everything but your more real with us your more of yourself which i fucking amazing because now everyone has an easier time relating to you and feeling like the relationship with you and the community is in the best possible spot because of it i would never have been able to get through what im going through without you because i dont allow myself to feel anything almost ever and that would have eventually ran dry and i would have had to face all of it at once but when i watch your videos like these when you sit down and talk to us about real shit i let myself get some of my pain out by being able to realize that everyone goes through this and i truly wish the best for you because you deserve it and i dont know why but my heart melted and my eyes brought tears and i feel greatful too so weird thank you w i have a friend who back in 2015 was going through something like may she had reached out to me about something going on and just broke down in tears i knew those tears were from other things as well it turns out she was going to end her life after our phone call so i knew i had to keep her on the phone the next day she had called me again in the school bathroom and she broke down again i had reached out to the schools guidance councilor to reach out for her bc i knew it was a cry for help she now has the help she needs an amazing therapist and a type of therapy that has her taking care of horses and training them her life has done a full change and she has been so thankful i never want to take credit for it bc i dont think that is my position for it if you see a friend struggling please just be there for them their choices are not youre fault just show them you care and tell them everyone who else cares for them be there for them i really love these types of games when jack actually open and talk like this i had many dark and suicidal thoughts throughout my teens and early twenties thinking i wasnt good enough and the like strangely enough it took the worst and most difficult period of my life when my mum died for me to come to terms with how insignificant my worries actually were in comparison thats not to say they didnt matter of course but looking back now after coming through something so tragic with actual real impact i definitely dont let things weigh me down and have power over me the way they used to sometimes a big low point can show you how strong you really are so many people seem like theyre doing so much more than you but there not that really hit hard with me not going to say who but a certain group of girls made me feel like im nothing compared to them because i dont have the fame or success that they have i used to think about how they would never know i exist no matter what i do no matter how hard i worked i felt like i was nothing because of it and always would be im still working on coming to terms with the fact that success in certain areas doesnt always mean happiness but to hear someone like jack say those words makes me relieved to know that even celebrities and online personalities feel the same way as me sometimes i apologize for going on a long tangent i usually barely even comment on videos in general and it had also been a while since i had even watched a video from jack but those words really stuck with me so just wanted to leave this here even if no one else sees it itll be a good reminder thank you so much sean i really needed this video right now life has been hard and it just lost a pet i love videos where you open up about your feelings and try to inspire us and be there for us i really appreciate everything that you do love you i hide to easily for myself in my more depressed moments i need someone who can understand me and jack you have got me through life and if i hadnt had you i wouldnt be here id be dead id thought about killing myself awhile and your videos help me and thank you your my hero man ill be here for ya but im kinda falling apart for myself i never have had a good day truely that im happy then i see this stuff and it helps to know that im not alone in the fight of depression thank you for helping me i love you jack and my name is jonathon dale allen a 1314 year old boy that is dealing with depression you helped me through my worst moments thank you i love you

his usual self screaming jumping off his chair and everything it was normally until it suddenly wasnt watching these kinds of vids as a person who is depressed reminds me of what my end goal is i know how it feels to be consistantly sad anyone i swear if you have anyone to talk to go for it im lucky to have a friend from highschool who still keeps up with me and i can go to her when im feeling the blunt of life 2800 whyd you have to point that out now it looks like its talking instead of may and im only focused on it where is the green hair personally i like sean now a lot more then old him hes helped me and other people soo much more not to say i didnt like old sean i loved him but hes wiser and cooler now thanks soo much sean from the bottom of my heart and the communities heart thank you hey jack it may not seem like everyone always connects to you in the ways that you want that feeling of balancing a professional friendship with your audience isnt something everyone can relate to wanting to befriend us all yet maintain that level of privacy is a serious juggle but do remember that you do have people who care about you and i may not know your story but i do take your struggles seriously being happy for others being jacksepticeye all the time really takes away from sean being in that sad clown state makes it much harder to let people in but were here for you at least in solidarity you do want seems right to you and if the other fans cant respect that then they should not be a part of the wonderful community that you made im super proud of you and keep doing what you want what to do because when your happy were happy at the end it looks like hes reading a script jeez it serial how much i related to this game i loved jacks 20 minute talk it helped a lot with the stuff im going through rn so thank you jack and i love you and your channel 3 oh seanwe love you whoever you become i love you even more now since youre more yourself you are a great duuude yesterday my cousin who was 17 died from a car accident that happened a week ago it was the hardest because we thought he was fine and it wasnt bad but it was this has been the hardest week of my life seeing it all at the hospital just seeing him lay there and not being able to do anything seeing my family crying and not being able to tell them its ok because you know its never going to be the same i have felt so alone in my life and this game really helped me realize that bad things happen but people get through them its just hard knowing i will never see him again i saw him the day before the accident and he was fine how can one thing change your life i just dont understand he was such a good guy he didnt deserve it but we all get through it and im not saying this because i want symphony but because i just need to get this out because otherwise i dont think i can get through it i love this community and if you have any advice please give me some because its bre my mom puts me down every way she can she dosnt like my friends the games i play my girlfriend and for a while i just got used to being lonely for the lack of friends i had but now im starting to realize being with my friends and my girlfriend that life is more than being the perfect man that my mom wants and that i can be my own person and not have to deal with the constant humiliation that she puts me through on a day to day basis with my family bud thank you love you take time for you first take time for evelyn family and friends second your channel last the true jse supports will always be here for you jack

words thanks d pls read jse l lovers a ass u you g gamer and h is for happy and what do you get when you put them all together laugahah sean i want to personally thank you from the deepest and most wholeheartedly part of my heart i am going through a long dark road of my life in high school i dont feel liked from anyone one example is girls and as a boy compared to all the other bigger much stronger dudes to me a scrawny 120lb almost a sophomore in late august when us schools usually start and i even feel like my own best friends dont even like the person i am because the person i branded myself at school is just the offensive funny memey kid that takes on these insults like fag and virgin which ive been used to but lately has put me a bit under hell i even think about killing myself because im just nothing compared to these chads basically who are just always athletic and way bigger than me and even academically no matter how pretty good the grades are i feel like i have no future because i dont even think im good at anything im almost 16 and dont know how to drive on a regular street yet becaus im the famous nom nom clears throat wheres the green hair this video was awesome and the talk was helpful and you can take a break any time you want to thank you for all you have done for the many people of your channel thank you for everything be yourself and i will support you on this channel i love you sean i really do thank you for getting me through this life again i love you great job jacksepticeye preach omg i wanna give you a hug whenever im feeling down i always watch your videos and that makes me happy im crying and cant stop we love you and nothing will change that thank you for everything you have done i know how you feel anybody else notice the we bare bears reference meme may sometimes i just wanna kill myself mea typical gen z me too may finger guns thanks for the vids all these years thank you so much sen i needed this video so much i really really did ive been having a rough time lately and i never comment on videos but i just wanted to say thank you youre awesome for some reason this art style reminds me of that dragoncancer which makes it more sadgod damn the feels i could watch sen talk from his heart for hours keep doing what your doing cuz your influencing so many tbh you should take up motivational speaking haha any way love what your doing sen jackyou dont know how much i cried watching thisi recently had just tried to commit suicide and i needed some help and comfrot and someone to tell me its gonna be okay so thank you i really needed this so much i wish i could get hugged and told its ok sometimes do what makes you feel good and happy my dude we love you jack its ok to get things off your chest the community that you have created we are hear to listen jack a boy keep up the great work and everything you do is great and if you ever need to you can take a break if people cant understand that and tell you off then dont give them any time keep up the great work and follow your heart 3248 very motivational please if you are going through these tough tough times please open up to some one in your family or close friend and tell them what is wrong btw love the game very helpful to people with depression and helps people know that people care alot of this touches home for me and how i feel day to day it is always hard to talk with someone and express how you feel when sometimes you dont know how to explain yourself and your feeling to someone i try and reach out but get scared and dont want to burden others people should see this video as a university or college class for free as well this has been both motivational and inspiring thank you sean this video helps and i greatly appreciate it youre great and i mean that more than you might think sorry that i couldnt emphasize more on it i just really appreciate it and i feel like thats enough said d when i was 11 i tried to kill myself i wasnt sad or depressed i was a ridiculously happy child and i loved everything about my life the thing is i got the idea in my head that everyone i cared about would be happier without me i was nearly a statistic it could have been avoided by one single person telling me that i was worth something to them so here i am to tell you that youre worth something youre amazing youre beautiful you can be whatever or whoever you want to be you can do it i believe in you and i love all of you even if i havent met you before but that last part just sounds a tad fake to see that chair tremble and shake i felt so close to you thank you for sharing hug you should never feel like you cant talk about this just do it and people who dont care or cant listen everytime will click away or not watch it at all but those who do want to listen and need this representation will have someone they already cared about to relate to and we can all work through our problems i started taking antidepressants and luckily for me the first type helped me because i would indeed have sunk deeper if they didnt work i graduated this year succeeded in finding my future plan and i just found my own self in this journey so please do talk and consider all options to help yourself this is not only for jackieboy but for everybody feeling like this you aint alone and when you feel like that try to go to online sources and talk to a random ass stranger youll be amazed at how much thatll help you can do it and you will and i love you even though ive looked up to jack for years hes helped me though hard points in my life hes like a friend for me but at the same time hes totally right like as transparent as someone can be you dont know them in person id like to tbh id really like to get to know sen as a person he seems lovely and we need more people like him in the world thank you jack you always know what to say to make people laugh and make people think i under sand this is a very serious topic but not even half the video is the game and 34pf it is the best jack advice u are going to get on this sort of stuff thanks jack i do feel like that but i know i have people who care for me so thank u jack jack i dont know what made me sad i gave say a average life with few to no flaw but theres that cloud of depression and sadness in my mind i found a fight agents it a battle through music or more specifically drumming thank you as well if you ever see this comment please dont skip over it when i say thank you im speaking directly to you thank you my best friend is going through depression anxiety and is suicidal i also have all of them quite frequently i have anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts only we know about each others problems she has attempted suicide when i was 10 and she was 13 now i am 14 and slowly recovering she is now loving life and all it has to offer my family thinks i fake my anxiety attacks for attention only my dad knows that every so often i cut myself but he tries to help i have made it a whole month without cutting myself and i am so proud of myself i hope to not be self conscious by the time im in high school sorry for this rant i noticed a lot of we bare bears memes they sent back and back ive been there and i love how you show mental health importance on the channel it means alot to me and i hope it helps other ive been watching you for almost 3 years now i love watching you just as much if not more than i did back then ive greatly enjoyed watching you grow and change into the person you are today ive loved seeing you become happier with each passing year it fills me with happiness knowing the ones i look up to are doing so well the change from your content schedule and social media posts has never bothered me because i understood i know how easy it is to burn you out and im so glad youre taking more time for yourself ill always be a fan no matter the changes because in the end youre still the same old jacksepticeye that i enjoy watching when im alone in the world i cant stand that sound he made at 38 31 it made my break jack can you play the cube escape games by rusty lake holy shit you scared me with your intro it has been too long this game really hit close to home for me we just lost my cousins wife to suicide on wednesday its a really great game and i hope that if anyone out there is feeling this way please get help you have no idea how it effects the people around you if anyone ever needs to talk i am always here i know that doesnt mean much because you dont know me but sometimes its easier to talk to someone you dont know then it is to talk to family i just want people to know they are not alone you can look me up on facebook under the same name on here i am very glad that jack has learned to do him not us for once i beat jack to playing a game thx u jack for this video i feel a lot better about myself now i also love this game 1110 im so glad i watched this video sean is super down to earth and

this and telling people they deserve happiness thank you this really help me out with my day i was done nothing productive and now i feel like i can do anything thank you jack i almost didnt watch this video not because of the content but because i had been looking at this game and thought i wanted to play through it at some pointand seeing that this video was so long i thought it might ruin the game for me now this video is one of my favorite videos easily top 10 for this year no spoilers everyone should watch it all the way through not just part of it oh and if you dont like lgbt content realize that this video game is about a whole lot more sens motivational speeches make me feel whole again and give me a glimpse of hope even though i dont suffer from depression and stuff

just liking every comment on this video because everything is so touching and i cant stop thank you sean jacksepticeye community everyone this video this game is so freaking important i cant put into words how real this game was for me this video was for me everything may went through everything sean talked about throughout the video it has been so real for me remember life isnt like this game its great that we got to see the best ending but remember you dont get that chance in life if this was real mays gone if you know someone who struggles with this who faces this tiredness and emptiness and depression and suicidal thoughts help them if you see signs ask them if you dont think theyre okay say they seem like they need someone and be there god please just be there they only live once you only live once dont let what happened to may happen as easily or at all some people cant be saved but there is no reason not to try if you really care sean we can see you care because you take a video like this one that talks about somethin jack you probably have no idea how many lives you have saved by being you and being a sort of home for people thanks for everything happy pride everyone wait no highfive back to 2013 are we you cured my depression 1 or 2 years ago thank you so much for that sen in my eyes your channel will never die i have watched you for years and i will keep watching for the years to come jack i bought some of the pride merch and i cant wait to get it as a long time fan of both etika and yourself this video just felt really good to watch dont really know how to put that into words but yeah thanks 3244 the sicciors are in the right bottom corner and there on her blood spends half an hour playing the game spends 20 min talking about real life btw no hard feeling love the speech love the content keep up the amazing work oh god this one hit me hardi didnt even get half way through i couldnt finish it so even though i previously struggled with suicidal thoughts and actions in the past and still suffer depression and anxiety ive been able to watch many things with a suicide trigger warning i say this because this video was too much for me for the first time in my life i found a video too hard to finish due to how real it is so please if youre like me and thought you could tough this out like you probably have in the past and you came to the comments before watching heed my advice not even kidding i just had to pause and text a friend to not do something rash because of all the thoughts that flooded my head and now im here warning you be careful watching this video i know this game sad if u be alone or depressed or bullied dont be cuz who know u might be chill the fall out boy at 431 tho when i look into the sky i feel calm and random thoughts enter my brain who else feels the same way hello jack it look like it going to be great game this touched me a lot of my life i started sobbing when he got to the part saying it can get better im playing doom while watching this same vibes tbh this hits so deep and close to home today thank you for all that you do and to anyone facing anything like this please know youre not alone you are important and special and so much stronger than any obstacle you might face realize that suicide is a long term answer for a short term problem all my love and support is with you if no one else has said it to you today you are strong important and amazing love yourself and know that you are loved in return she lowkey looks like you god this but home for me and im sure for alot of other people too but man some of those thoughts get into my mind set then they get pushed out by my anxiety like no one will remember me if i go everyone will feel happy that im gone then anxiety steps in if you do it everyone will think that you did it for attention if you speak out about it youll be wasting everyones time dont be that person and ill stop and just cry and ill just feel tired then videos like this will pop up and those thoughts will come back like warning this video or game contains suicidal thoughts and self harm please do not watch if this may trigger you and ill ignore those then everything will just flood again and ill drown on the thoughts and sometimes actions and ill feel power less and my friends and family will notice that im not as bubbly and ill pass it off as pms i know that alot of people out there are going through things that no one shoul jack if i could tell you one thing it would be that youre my best friend ive been watching your videos since 2014 when i was in 6th grade now in that im midway through high school and friends have come and gone there is one person that has always been there you have never left my side for almost 5 years now and i want you to know that you are the best friend i couldve ever asked for when i hear you talk about 2017 i just want to be able to hug you and tell you that its alright the same way you have metaphorically done for me the past couple of years long story short is that you are my best friend and i wish that i could repay you for the long hours you spend to be there for me every single day i love you jack jack this video couldnt have possibly come at a better time for me this was exactly what i needed to hear right now so thank you thank you so much i love it when jack makes long uncut and calm videos this is why we fucking love you thanks youre amazing sean we love you and only want the best for such a wonderful human being if i ever meet you i would be torn between giving you your space and telling you what an amazing human being you are sen should start making podcasts this is one of the major issues i have with myself i dont reach out or open up im always afraid im just a burden when i have problems i just sleep more do less of what i love and bottle my emotions i use art as my main outlet for my emotions but its never enough but no matter what im always up for helping someone thats down it helps me to help others and if thats all i can do im okay with it also sen we love you for who you are even when you change or do different things were still gonna be here for ya as long as this is what you love to do keep it up 5 years ago i got sick or well chronic illness i likely had my whole life all decided to shit on me at once and ive been sick and disabled ever since im in excruciating 9101010 pain every second of the past 5 years the first two years were awful not only was i adjusting to this sudden constant pain i wasnt believed that i was experiencing it at all my mom who has the same problems and is also disabled came around after a few months my dad still hasnt really and is honestly pretty emotionally abusive about my inabilities to exist and function the way he wants that first year i was 15 and had just started junior year of high school i didnt make it to a full week that entire first semester lets just say my parents were not happy second semester i was pulled out of school and transferred to online school after fighting a school who illegally refused to take me i finally found a school that would at the same time my parents forced me to quit competitive cheerle shit man you got me crying at midnight sean my hearts aching may is super relatable to me especially the golden child part sometimes i dont feel like i can do things the way i could as a kid so effortlessly so the minute it gets hard i crumble my parents dont really get that and think im just not trying anymore maybe im not trying maybe i cant try anymore i just keep walking into a wall with everything i just miss being the person who flew through everything now ive got my whole life ahead of me but im frozen in time life is fucked man people i think jack needs a hug shawn you are something else my friend something else we love you sean even when it seems that we arent truly there for you your always going to have someone to reach out for dont ever forget that sen you are an amazing person and one of the few people who can speak straight through the flesh and bone to reach a persons mind and heart thank you for being here for us and being there for yourself the best part of this video is the near end when you sean speak about the issues and troubles that you can relate to and im happy you did so as well as give motivation to angela and i hope she sees that now i have been through tough times and have contemplated the same thing may did but im still here because of the people around me influencing me to keep going im glad you breached the subject with the world it needs to be done more often if im being honest i love your videos and your way of thought i had a pretty awful day today and hearing you say that you believe in me and that im doing just right made me feel infinitely better thank you for that i needed to hear that from someone thank you sean your in my opinion one of the only people on social media that are still supportive like this i know a lot of other people say they are but its not personal like you this video helped me im actually going through some mental stuff right now and im just trying to do the stuff i like to do there is always a speech after a hard hitting moment and it helps me so much thank you damn san u should be a poet jack thank you thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for justbeing there for being so kind and so motivational and so caring just listening to you say that people care makes me believe that im not alone i used to be so depressed and so anxious all the time and i would constantly think horrible things and then i heard the name jacksepticeye i didnt know you three years ago so i checked out your videos and i fell in love with the way you could make me feel through the screen i felt like you were the only person who understood me when no one else cared enough to try to one night i attempted to hang myself my friends were texting me nonstop trying their hardest to save me but they couldnt they couldnt bring themselves to say that they cared about me they just didnt want me to go because i helped them not because they wanted to help me but thenbefore i did ityou made a video you posted a gaming video and through my tears i youre wrong about social media youre words mean a lot to me and im a very emotionally numb person jack plays games like this me happiness noises sen you have definitely changed and so have your videos and im glad about it you dont have to worry about rambling on i really enjoy hearing your thoughts and im happy youre comfortable enough to share them i wish you the very best and hope your mental and whole well being is constantly great also youre not talking like an old person youve just become wiser and thats something admirable love you dont forget to slam dunk some hearts onto him i need to save your words for future use your positive mental attitude movement has been a huge safety net for me sean i am incredibly grateful for your platform and your passion it hurts to know we have felt that deep hurt no one deserves that feeling no one deserves to hate themselves or others these types of videos really made me realise how deep and personal jack becomewhich is good for gossip but its also good for us viewers to understand your situations and help you reply to the pinned post from jack and how would you do that if you do feel completely alone have grown up to be eighteen but you have terrible social skills no friends family isnt there for you so there is no need to talk with them and you have nobody else to go to oh and do not misunderstand i do not feel like the world is too much for me but rather that i am completely alone as i have tried to reach out to others so many times but always fail however i will not give in or give up i was just wondering if anyone had any tips oh fuck for once i played a game before jack did i know that this is very offtopic but i wish i couldve seen tool when any started talking about how its so easy to give up it related to me ive been on yoitube for about 4 years and everytime i say i will upload i stop after 3 videos and give up then i delete the videos because i feel like im not pushing good enough content its weird how much amy related to me i see how people die in my dreams oof lol when its actually ur birthday this video is amazing it helped me a lot im glad that youre growing and i like the new you check the retweets for the green hair on twitter jack this is kind of like a personal therapy lesson for me it was sad but it opened me up to a lot of problems people face in everyday life it helped me feel less alone i have been in some of these conversations with my friend personally i have never been suicidal but i try to do my best to support her without judgment sometimes it is hard for me to think of the right thing is to say any advice would be appreciated also i appreciate the heart to heart i saw this on tumblr the other day when browsing and i feel like its helped me even a little pretend your invasive self hating thoughts are being said by some dumb kid over game or even better by a cartoon villain i imagine my intrusive thoughts in skeletors voice and let me tell you they are a lot less scary when you add nyeh heh heh to the end of each intrusive thought flightsofwonder im a suicidal kid lol butits hard i wasnt expecting that whole conversation in the end and it made me ball my eyes out because i have to deal with a bunch of stupid bullshit that hurts me every day but it made me think that i need to find that happiness that is lost in me and hiding in the dark before i watched this i was very close to ending it all thank you so much for saying that how the fuck do you miss a message i love how open he gets at the end its almost peaceful we all love u so much sean ur amazing we hope ur ok ur so nice and ur funny and great at everything stay positive u got this this video

giving so much of you to us thank you for making me happy every day ive had days like this too but the important thing is to move on thanks for actually being yourself thank you so much you are such a beautiful person sean i just got flashbacks to being a depressed bean boi when i heard the music 558 i need to cry but my foundation is 48 dollars i dont know how to put it into words but thanks so

almost cried and now reading this i think i have jack you are the best thank you for all your support to so many people you probably dont know thank you for being you and helping people get through hard times i know you have changed so much but i am glad you have i dont remember much from 2017 but i know that this rebute is so important to you and the people around you and over all us as a

take care of my friends i push away my feelings my wants and needs to take care of my friends i feel like if i show a bit of feeling that im trying to focus it on myself and then i feel bad for not taking care of them i dont have a lot of friends but the friends i do have i try to make them happy so they dont have to worry about anything i feel like i have to make them happy whenever i get off the internet i always worry what if one of my friends needed help while i was off and they died what if they were going to commit suicide i worry about that all the time and i try to get on the internet at any time anyways just ignore this ig jack about made me open the water works in a somewhat good way though watching this whole video really made me realize things about myself i didnt even know needed fixing well besides the compare yourself part that i forget to work on plus with the whole validation feeling unfortunately sometimes i go there cause i want a second opinion to feel good about something gonna work on that now so thanks for including it in the video but again thank you a ton for this video it really helped me open up myself on some issues and ill find time to do that and thanks for being you thank you so much for this video i really needed to hear what you had to say you are amazing me and my ex at the moment can relate to this game all too much this video just made me love you even more than i thought i could hey jakesepticguy your my favorite youtuber in the world hopefully you get this but personally i think your they beeeeeest youtuber out there ive been watching you ever sense i was 6 im 10 now but i just wanted you to now your they best youtuber yes for the 3 time stay awesome like a boss the constant tiredness day after day that never seems to go away no matter how much sleep you get or coffee you drink feeling like youre stuck in a rut because even though youre already in college youre not sure what you want to do with your life what you love growing up excelling in many areas only to crash like a meteor as you get older looking into a mirror and not recognizing who is looking back only seeing a monster with empty eyes the gut reaction to say im fine even when your face is blotchy and red from tears even when blood is trickling down your arm only breaking down when the person you trust most hugs you not even noticing that youre struggling in a very dark and real way until someone asks you about it feeling like every day is the same but not finding it comforting this really hits home hi jack im a 18 year old girl from malaysia ive always loved your videos because your positivity always manage to make me happy i first came across your channel by watching the static speaks my name and thats where i started subscribed your channel ive always loved where you talk about inspirational talks and everything because it always managed to make me glad when my friend told me that you are spreading positive mental attitude i was so happy because i needed those in my life although i myself think that im not improving at all in my mental health but your words always managed to make me reflect on my thoughts thanks to you ive finally decided that ill study education courses and psychology courses next year because if i cannot help myself to heal myself i wanted to help others about this issue i wanted to be either a counselor or a therapist because i really really want to help others who are going through this problem thank you for inspiring m also fuck all 522 of you who disliked this i played this a few days ago and was going god i wish jackyboi played itand boom here you are if anyone is wondering the song at 1358 is losing intrest by shiloh dynasty kind reminds me of a normal lost phone you project such an important message sen honestly you really use youre platform in such an amazing way you help so many people on a daily basis thankyou for not being scared to say this thankyou for telling people that its not bad to get help it dosent make you lesser it dosent make you weak it makes you strong thankyou thankyou it really makes me mad know depression is an actual thing makes me wanna punch the wall thx sean of doing this being a youtuber thx for your vids and contact im scared to access a hotline or chat because they could be helping someone else someone wholl go somewhere in life and do something with the hope that itll give them ill open the link or let the number ring until i back out and decide that someone else is more important at least when sean plays these types of games i get a little bit of hope so thank you sean i and the rest of the community appreciate you and truly love you jackcepticeye would be amazing in a podcast oh no im crying he is one of the of few very unappreciated gaming youtubers who can change and people can still change not saying that most of his audience is kids but for an example he has grown with his audience metaphorical and literal mental growth i have not really gone through the stuff mentioned in this video but i somehow felt this sadness when watching this video its weird to think how the jokes we make about this topic can get so out of hand sometimes yeah its jokes but someone who is going though that may not even take it as a joke when jack started to talk about how he felt that really got me tearing up i know friends who have felt like this i tried to help each step of the way and it is hard to help when you have no clue about how they are feeling and going through in the end i still tried my hardest to help what im trying to say is that please dont ever feel like there isnt a hand to reach for or your never going to get out of that blizzard there will be someone online or in person that can help you and even know what your going through because they may have gone through it also when jack started saying how he changed i think as a community we should be growing with him because if we love jack bro may looked hot lmao im stupid for saying that when i look at the sky my mind clears and the noice is gone to much jacksepticeye videos always has my mind loudjack scream intensifies but other than that jack is right leave your phone at home nothing will change keep your pma to keep your menttality alive and look at the bright side if anyone gives this man hate i will be confused this man got his shit together me parents want me to be a docter me playing this game for nearly the entire night since i got off work early leaves games goes to youtube sees missed messages in recommended starts watching video bruh i just played this jack is such an underrated youtuber he gives the best messages about the things a lot of people are going through and helps people in so many wayshe has probably saved many peoples lives with the messages he gives and i think he should keep up his work and do what he wants and the games he wants to play and to have a happy life there is no pressure of what the people want you to do you just do the things you want to do hope you have a great day jack and anybody reading this comment thank you for all you do jack who else watched till the end jack i just wanna say something i want ur forgiveness i havent been watching u for a little while but i rlly miss i actaully been here since the little videos of nectar of the gods is the developer ok please bring back the sims please please please like so he can see this no whapoosh thank you for just talkingit really made me feel happy that you were able to overcome it and that your story could be someone elses hope that they can make it too thank you for being so open about it too stay strong sean we love you 3 tumblr is cancer awe man i just want to meet sen and give him a phat hug i often write to escape my own world but i stop because i feel emo i wanna be happy and positive but its hard when people constantly hurt you i havent had it good really ever but i know people have it worse ill cry when my pencil breaks or my paints dried up but when people leave me when i get hit i dont feel it anymore i dont know what i want in life except happiness and i know its hard to be happy without love and they say you cant have love without loving yourself what do i do thats my little rant thats all in case you havent heard lately get some sleep and treat yourself for once itll be alright i played the game myself on steam and it really hit me hard i just feel like everyday is the same and im so tired of going through the same thing again and again we love you sean it breaks my heart that people put so much of themselves into making content for people and in turn some of those people start to think something is owed to them and cross a line showing up at peoples houses or personal space poking into personal lives relationships family etcits never okay thank you for this video me reading the comments everyone finally spelling sens name right my mind is always silent thats why i want to learn more to help people that have a problem i dont need down time o shit thats deep everything about may hits close to home literally as an asian chinese especially and to me at least the obligation of taking care of my family has been drilled into my mind from young age that the way to make my mom dad happy was to payback everything that they have given to me even if that means i have to throw away my dreams so i can provide them a better life better life means wealth in our dictionary thats why i relate so much to may we want to do what we love and be happy even though that means we will be poor i cant do that not only that would make my parents real disappointed they would probably stamp me as an useless child it sucks but life its not like i dont love them but it holds me back from living my life to the fullest just have to keep on moving day by day blandly while hoping things would get better one day the sad thing is people can only save may on the second run because we already know that she commited suicide the first time sadly in real life we never know the sign until its too late and well never get second chances to save someone sean you are so appreciated and im happy that you can grow and make people happy it makes me happy knowing your happy thank you so so much for the ending message it means a lot 345 when they ask yee haw but not haw yee so many have nobody to talk to so many just dont know how to really interact with people some people have both issues thats me wheres the green hair i got over a little bit of that hole in my heart because of my beloved friends that were in a similar situation like my best friend for life treasure and jrusy they were sexualy abused by loved ones but were so positive it was unbelievable i was abused by my father but they were their by my side so i helped them by being there too to repay what they did for me love this vid reminds me of the game about the kid with cancer but just a question if i may but when is the third episode of trover gonna come out i encourage so many people to reach out it feels degrading embarrassing selfish but its not i will tell you all you are worth it you do deserve it you will get through it you will feel proud for getting help you will start to think damn that was pretty great when you speak to someone ive seen multiple people through university through the nhs and even private but after every single one i get proud of myself i did that i made that step i reached out my hand and i dared to show vulnerability and i am damn proud my biggest healer is when i walk my dog i just sit and i listen the slight rustle of leaves the birds the feel of the slight breeze on my face inhale a whole bunch of oxygen hold it until you feel that sweet butterfly sensation in your tum and exhale you will be ok and if youre not ok thats fine its ok not to be ok senpai is inspirational i thought this was something nice to watch on the sideline while doing some work but this game and especially the monologue at the end resonated more with me than anything ive experienced in years i needed to hear this when is the green hair coming youre a beast dog keep it up do what you gotta do to keep true to you this video means a fuck load to me if you need me ill be sobbing because jack is so pure he deserves to be happy i didnt know i needed to

shine through your persona in these types of videos especially and find a way to touch your viewers in a way most lpers dont there is such a ray of genuine empathy and a clear desire to give back to

sense thank you i havent watched jack in a while and i had my volume up high when i clicked on the video and scared myself hey sean when u were talking about your youtube gig the music in the background it made it like a song sort off thanks i really needed this right now its been 7 months since i lost my mom to suicided we always had a rocky relationship and my biggest regret was not saying i love you back your video made my day because i see there are some people in the world who care and know what were going though i love that you are a popular creator and can still be real during harder times i have been a fan for the longest time and i have to say the new style is much better and real i hope you see this keep up the good work jackscepticeye is better than gloom on this vid and all the others like if u agree loved this video really felt connected and felt understood even though im not depressed i used to be a couple years ago now im happy but this advice all these talks about our thoughts and emotions as human beings is amazing thank you whoever reads this have a good day i really needed this today all day ive felt off and in the dumps this definitely helped me get a bit out of it and get up instead of sitting around my room all day thank you for this i work at walmart as a cashier self checkout person and was walking passed customer service and this old woman asked me if could get a chair for this crying puffy eye lady so she can wait on the police i said of course or something like that i try to treat old people really well because i wanna be treated highly and not ignore in the future when im old but im getting off topic i got her stool my coworker uses because she has cane and she just got off so when back to the old lady and asked her what happened she said she had a fallout with her boyfriend and she convinced her to seek help and safety i offered the crying lady a water i was gonna pay for it my mom said i just bought it for her and given to her i dont know the whole situation but it reminded me of my friend who i went to school with and she had abusive boyfriend and shed been and abusive relationships before told us that her boyfriend that graduated was getting all his teeth removed from chewing dip and took out the a this is so sad what the frick i was meeting gay girls was this easy in real life i need a hug right now i love you sean you really are so important and i will never forget you when the girl sad that she knew no reason to her sad state its true you are too overwhelmed by your emotions you dont see why you feel this way you see what you feel this way i think that the reason why we are human is because despite the fact we go through this we have a part of us that reaches out to those we love and vice versa to not bother anyone and to cover up how you feel is a habit that grows on you but with so many people commenting here people can see those that struggled jack included id say that each of us have this inner strength that pushes us through these moments so heed my words people who read this you are strong you are brave you can push through anything becauseyou are you and never be afraid to ask for help its okay to bother people you love the first ending was like sayori also can you revisit slime rancher stay alive 4 minutes in and i relate so much gay wants to go on date with cute girl procrastination more gay memes makeup and more procrastination game my mind gets to noisy jacki thank we can all relate to mesays the one that yells on almost s every video he makes jackshut upim irish im allowed to yell at the top of my lungs mewhatever omg jack i love you this video made me cry so so much its so deep oh my gosh im not being fake im crying right now i dont cry ever either this is wow i didnt realize how much i needed to hear what you were saying thank you for everything you do its truethe sad is that most of the time you want to get something off of your chest be it social media or to other people the hard sad truth of it all isnobody will give a sht about you or your problems but the good thing about that is that the are people who give a sht about you there are people about there who care and are willing to help you and they will not stop until they see you much better than what you were before i needed this im been riding that line for a minute everything is so dark and im so tired thanks for the pickmeup sean why does the thumbnail look like pokimane in anime form this is kind of unrelated to this game but have you ever played a game called fe its kind of like open world 3d ori and the blind forest if you havent i highly recommend it cry out to jesus wheres the green hair sean i almost started sobbing when they hugged idk man i wanna tell this story i was like this my freshman year i said goodbye and overdosed my mom found me nearly dead in the bathroom the next morning at the er the doctors said i should have never lived when my sister came into the emergency room she was crying and angry and said you cant do this to me youre gonna be an aunt one day and ill need you my sister had been pregnant for a couple of days then she didnt even know for sure these days i have a 2 year old nephew who i love with all my heart and he adores me i now think that i nearly died right before i found out my sister was pregnant i almost missed the greatest thing in my life please hang on you never know who or what is around the corner ahhh yesss i saw this on steam and wanted to see some game play for but none had came out yet ahh yess jack thank you for the speech at the end its nice to know that you are welcomed to help so much and tell them everything will be alright though many are too scared i know people who arent allowed to not smile or be depressed if so they are blamed for it they get in trouble for it many people who help their friends make sure they are okay make sure they wont hurt themselves it does hurt that person that person could be in pain but of course they smile for that person who needed help it means a lot to not only the ones who dont say anything or help others dont have to ignore how they feel thank you for everything and im glad you had realized who you are and what you wanna do in life i soo thought he was gonna say like that time i went to la i did some hardcore drugs gosh i could listen to jack talk about this stuff for hours thx you are such a nice person an funny to watch all the time heres the vine sean person why are you looking up girl i want to cry but my makeup cost 29 please tell me if im wrong damn jack thanks im having a rough time right now with confidence and loneliness and stuff like that and your tangents as you call them actually helped im not saying that im now so happy and shit im just saying youre a great guy for taking the time to talk like that even though its only a small bit i appreciate it thank for this beautiful speech and this amazing advice thx jack if your reading this you are wonderful free cookie if you promise to never hurt yourself damn he said its relatable to etika i wanted to cry edit i just love when jack has those sit down chats keep what youre doing jack i love your longer videos like these i love how much meaning and thought you put into what you say in these videos i hope that you are okay and continue to thrive sean i know you will probably like never read this im just 1 out of like 100s of comments but i really want to thank you for saving me im going through the worst year i have had i have had sudicide thought been self harming aand also scared but you made me happy and go to some help im getting a little better but i do still have a lot of downs and feel worthless but you still help me so so much thank you so much this video really helped me me spends over 70 of my time online the rest sleeping jack says its unhealthy 737 also jack plays video games all day like a motherfucking champ and posts it online 3851 i have the same feelings sometimes green hair where is it everyone has thought bad thing also screw who disliked this whoa whoa whoa no wapoosh what is going on biblethumps in fucking chat bois i loved this video for many reasons firstly the art style is beyond amazing so grateful you play games like this so we can be introduced to them secondly grateful that a game like this was even created a game that goes there and openly talks about mental health and struggles finally i am grateful to you sean for creating this community for choosing to be so open and candid about these things i believe we each have a responsibility to find and work on our own healing no one can do it for us that being said finding the proper support makes a world of difference for me you are a big part of that support watching your videos helps when im scared or lost because it feels like hanging out with a friend and by the end of the video i usually feel better the way you make sure to validate the normalcy of mental health issues means so much i really needed this video today for many reasons i cannot say but im still here and i will keep fighting and trying my best thank sea i think i have a few things i want to type out so here i go may said that saying im okay when she isnt is a gut reaction and i relate to that whenever i feel bad i dont tell people im still in high school so my parents are the ones im supposed to talk to i know i dont talk to them because both my parents have emotionally abused me and its hard to find help from the people who hurt you thanks for this heart to heart talk it made me feel great keep doing what you love to do and march to your own beat we love you so much if this was my teacher then id listen too him cuz he talked for 20 mins heh i played this game on kongregate i played it for at least an hour its one of my favorite games just the tone of it and how do i explain okay im really obsessed with this art style now help from karisa i appreciate your person you are worth it you are you and that is the best you can be to everyoneincluding sean to sean you are doing great too i will grow with you you should play more absolver because you left the legend of mc woopn hey jack i just wanted to say thank you i know you probably wont see this but the truth is ive been having a hard week recently and honestly is has put me in a dark place mentally recently and watching this well it helped i have had a hard time seeing pass all the hopelessness and really believing i could come outta this but watching this video ans hearing what you had to say has made it feelhopeful i suppose and like im not alone so yea thank you all i can say jack really is thank you you are one of a handful of youtubers that have helped me get through everything thank you for being so open about depression and handling it so well some handle it so poorly and deal with it so badly thank you for helping me and all those others out there smile again ive been having these kinds of thoughts a lot lately and watching a video like this with sean supporting basically everything and after watching i cried for about 20 minutes because i dont really have much of anyone to talk to mainly because whenever i try to talk about it to anyone they try suggesting taking medication but the thing is ive been on medication since i was 9 and none of the past or current medications work i recently got into a fight with my mom and it just broke me 1035 am i the only person who got larry flash backs this game is so good i felt so bad for may as soon as she first showed up she just seemed so sad thank you i never really understood your community until now ur great c youre so inspiring and relatable i hope you know you are loved sean in case you needed to hear that today ive been depressed for so long and seeing you happy brings happiness to me i hope you can be happy more times than not and i hope you know you never have to face anything alone you are a beautiful person i have also had these types of thing happen to me and i was happy to be able to be relieved but some days i have days that i wish it would end but then it would just go away after i looked away from my life and thought about who i want to be shilohs voice adds so much to this games music oof well that gave me flashbacks of the few times i was up late at night crying and slicing into my arm with scissors luckily i never hurt myself too seriously and ive been okay lately been a long while since i wanted to hurt myself sean somewhat saved me today thank you sean this game reaches me to a point where i think its too much these are just coincidences like mays ethnicity her parents and their pressure on her mays love for art when being ridiculed for it being alone and afraid to reach out not going to mental health professionals because of a bad experience in school etc etc they all relate to me ive been depressed for several years and reached a point where i feel like i cant return to whatever i was like before i became like this luckily or unluckily depending on your view on this im no longer suicidal but just flat out emotionally drained and i feel like everything in life is too out of reach to feel appealing anymore im still suicidal but i know i can never even try to attempt self harm and it feels like hell to never find a way to release my emotions so everything turned inwards because of this i feel like that if i was able to find this game before i became so emotionally drained i would be crying and feeli seriously thank you so much jacksepticeye for making videos like this serious seriously talking about depression is a real tough thing and this video really makes me feel refreshed especially at times when im rushing my assignments and needed a break although nowaday things are better than back then when i have like seasonal depression sometimes things just dont work out and you just dont feel joy in what you do pressured by people who tell you that you have to work better or study harder especially from parents is very hard on you especially in a depressed state im glad this video was here at a time when im in need loved your motivation sean been a fan of pma and always will be in all seriousness thank you so much sean for making this video sean could we please get a monster hunter world stream please and maybe play with us did re7 go into anyone elses mind when he said that his gfs name was evelyn when i heard about etika i couldnt really speak for a bit the fact that his fans thought it was a hoax for him to get views when he went offline is so messed up he really did need help and everyone made fun of him after may i decided to not watch the rest of the video for my own reasons but im glad that jack does play tgese games and does awareness to those who suffer it really helps knowing that others go through it too knowing some people care i needed this thank you for this every time jack declined the messages from the goth i worried that they would also end up committing suicide and that the game would have a message saying something sad like you cant help everyone jack what happen to your hair last time i saw you you had green hair 2915 why does it look like a public bathroom this gave me a flash back whenever i wanted to kill my self because i saw why i have to live and what is the difference being one more person in life so i was up in a bathroom cutting my self i still have scares but my bff came in asking what is taking so lone and he saw and got help and j told him no need but he did not listen and did it anyways and now i see a person for help omg sean this is why is start to watch your videos not only because you are funny and entertainment but because you are so kind with your fans and you are not affraid to show your emotions to the people who might be related with you like me and give us your experiencie and advices really good advices to might help too many people like i can say you make my days happier with your videos so i wish you the best and that you can do everything you love we appreciatte you a big hug for you from mexico sen if you see this just know that you arent disconnected from us at all we are glad for what you do and just know that we will always care for you no matter what you do the last 10 seconds of this video mean more to me then he will ever know thank you sean for everything wow its been a while since i have watched you i have noticed a real big change in you i hope you are doing well and i hope you keep making videos i grew up watching you and it has been quite the ride take care of yourself first we love you and want you to be well and be happy its hard to take time for yourself but you are very important jack i completely agree with you on this matter there are things we cant just tell everyone whether it be because we dont want to be a burden or because we cant put it into words we cant give our 100 self to people because then you wouldnt have anything for yourself and there are people in this world that will hurt you using what you have told them the only people you give your 100 too are the people you love with all your heart that you want to be by your side forever and its not in reference to how you love your fans no thats a different love its the love of another one you cant bear to lose just like you said we cant give our 100 self to people its a bad idea but just as much there are times when you at least need to give 95 because if you give it 90 and are in a bad state that extra five percent can save you you havent told us much about your personal life sean in terms of hardships and pain but i can see it in your eyes hea sean i feel like your a youtuber that still stays entirely connected with their community which is very rare and if you need a couple days off people will understand yo u see where they are not where they have been thank you so much for taking the

cries when he looks at me i have had these thoughts each day for 23 years so and dude ive thought about it no one cares and when i bring it up they said i was just a kid im 15 and it fuckin kills me inside man like not everybody has someone who cares this video really hit me hard i am currently 19 and i do digital art as a hobbyjob my anxiety prevents me from being able to hold other jobs ive tried multiple times to have a normal job id love to have art become my profession and to be selfemployed but i fall into ruts where i feel like ill never be good enough it is hard to pull yourself out of those holes whenever you fall in some of the holes are deeper than others and take longer to wriggle out of i feel so behind in life i refuse to give up though this video that hope ending that really brought tears to my eyes this game is beautiful and hauntingly relatable thank you for anyone who reads this i hope you have a lovely nightday you never realuse how lonely lif is until you stop to look up at the sky and thibk of how you feel about life we will always be there yo sean the love from this video could power the world from 3304 to 3325 i know it isnt easy ive been there myself but i pushed through although i have my tendencies from time to time ive gotten better it may be hard but you can make it if you talk to someone you trust things for people who hide their feelings or are sad and depressed all the time cant necessarily show that they are cause sometimes theyre scared too like me for example i was always a happy person but now i sad and depressed but i put on a fake smile so people thing im happy but you guys dont have to cause you all are amazinv and deserve the world despite what others say ignore the haters and live a life of happiness 3910 ive waited for 3 years same thoughts but nothing ive even talk to my dad about it nothing ive felt similar feelings mainly with feeling depressed i still am now but your right there will always be someone to help you you have done so much for this community and helped people like me feel happy thank you so much sean love you aww jack is really one of the few youtubers who is relatable and speaks the truth and always has a point he is so unappreciated he is so relatable and its sad somebody who is amazing person and youtuber be underrated like this its so sad i watched the full video and just want to say thank you sean this means a lot remember when he used to high five in the begging of every episode me too hey jack i was looking for unturned videos and saw your videos that you made on the game a couple years ago and would love to see can try the game again it has changed so much you would love it i played this like 2 weeks ago its a great and beautiful game it actually kind of blows my mind at how good a friend the main character was to may there are too many people in every depressed persons life telling them to suck it up or just be happy or you really have no reason to be sad i think we all need more understanding people in our lives and we need to recognize that anything you might be feeling is completely 100 valid i used to spend a lot of time around people who were very toxic for me and whenever i tried to talk to them about the things i was feeling they would repeatedly tell me that i was overreacting and that i was faking my depressive thoughts for attention for a long time i blamed my selfdestructive and occasionally suicidal thoughts on wanting attention telling myself that it wasnt real and that i was convincing myself to think these things so i could talk about them and seek validation but that wasnt it at all i was actually very depressed and didnt tell anyone because the people in my life had conditio omg it played a shiloh dynasty song jack your free i dont need to know it all why dislike this like why thank you jack jack youre doing fucking amazing we could never forget about you sean youve helped us smile so much and we will be here till the very end i dont know who need to listen to this but talk just talk to someone who you think is responsible enough to listen to you it can be anyone even for you seannot for jack because he is a youtuber and hide his emotions if you think of talking with us just spill it out not all but some of us will listen i think angela is deppressed ur a good guy jack i respect that i legit cried through his whole speach saun dont do it man u have more to live for 30 min of game 20 min rant of inspirational stuff sees thumbnail lilypichu i wish my niece was still here to see this i wonder if it would have helped her get help talk to someone 235 its cousin it i love your videos they are great dont change and also sfw beautifully said thank you for spreading this message as a psychology major i know that there is a negative stigma attached to mental health but there is absolutely nothing wrong with seeking help this video helps minimize the negative stigma and shows people that mental health is just as important as physical health jacktalk about people whove been through this mejadenanimtions this whole video touched me so deep and is so relatable i was crying by the end because i am the same exact way thank u jack for making such amazing content and including the viewers i love this channel and this whole community thank you truly thank you for this video the message and your words at the

therapist talk this is what we need more of on this minefield of a platform im fooking confused these are the greatest videos for me rn i want to meet you so bad thank you jack and i havent really gone through anything and when i feel sad i feel like its a fake sadness and its not real and i still feel that but i dont know i am just thankful for people like you and giving others hope i hope to meet you one day god its so crazy how i relate to this game my dad always put me down for wanting to be a writer even though id been writing since i was little nothing could ever stop me because its such a big part of me and it makes me happy but i was always told id never amount to anything that i would always be starving and pathetic i spent a lot of time feeling suicidal because of my dad and because of being bullied at school and writing was my way to get away from it i still write and im working toward trying to self publish even though its a super expensive thing to do i have to do it for me though but my dads words keep coming into my head when i try to move forward and i feel like i cant do it im not good enough and im pathetic ive been dealing with a lot of dark thoughts the closer i get to success and lately especially ive been feeling awful i dont have many friends who check up or hang out with me so i get lonely on top of it i dont have a lot did anyone else hear the voice of her singing happy birthday at the funneral ending i feel like lots of people are able to relate to this at some point in their lives thank you sean for being so honest and for making people happy to talk about topics like these are hard but much appreciated youre videos brighten up mine and everyones day just always remember to care for yourself too because that is the most important thing if anyone sees this you are beautiful and you are worth it love you sean its okay to have some down moments we all do i do too but know youve always got your family friends and all of us to support you if you dislike this you are a mean person that shit hurted sen the ending to this video hits hardthankyou for being one of the only youtubers to go in depth about these problems there are a lot of people at my school who act like mayand they joke about it and i dont know why thank you for this wonderful message it made me feel all the feels i loved you back then and i love you more now everyone needs to take time for themselves because you matter you are important even celebrities deserve a private life slowing down is so important i like to take bike rides i live in a pretty quiet town so when i ride my bike i can take my time and go at whatever pace i want and its peaceful and calm i love my town i witnessed two acts of kindness today i saw an older lady help a young lady when the younger one was a little short on money for her purchase and i saw someone help push someone elses car that had died at a stop light things like that helps restore my faith in humanity and so do people like you sen oof this one hit pretty close to home for me personally a couple of years ago i lost one of my best friends to suicide and i was probably the last person to see him alive and still to this day i cant help but to wonder if there was something i could have done something i could have seen if there were signs i missed and if things would have been different had i noticed them its not something ive ever truly come to terms with i still miss him greatly and i feel sad sometimes when i think of him but i can most of the time look back on memories with him and smile now jack u do realise gf meabs girl friend just something relevant to the game each year over 1 million people commit suicide because they are sad confused and lost in the darkness find somebody you know who is lost in the darkness to bring him or her into the light in their life and bring yourself out of the darkness and into the light you will not regret it holy shit today is my sisters birthday as well she turned 11 today edit after watching the full video my other sister k i have three sisters il call them kmr no brothers im the only son was suicidal wanting to kill her self cutting and thinking the world would be better with out her i dont want to get into the details but i can say that this game shows how it feels dealing with someone who is suicidal and i am happy that she no longer dose this kind of stuff and has friends now and is doing better also my sister m who turned 11 my sister r is the youngest and k is the oldest sister im the oldest out of them all but my life rn is great and so is my familys not mentioning the ups and downs what if youve tried and no one listens and no one helps no matter how much you are told you are cared about you dont feel that they are telling the truth and no matter how you feel you just want cry and scream its free and its so sad name because theres no way to save the girl oof bro this got the feels but it was sooo cute at the same time thank you for all of your inspiring words of caring understanding i really enjoyed listen to you talk at the end of the video in the past 7 months ive been doing a lot of self care in the last year i lost 57lbs but i wasnt happy with me yah i was healthier but i was sad and depressed me and boyfriend were going through a lot of hard time there was a lot of self harm and a couple attempts on suicide i got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and since then it been a lot of trying to understand why did i react that way your not alone you are loved think about your emotions and understand them its been a ton of remembering positive mental attitude and i especially think its because of influencers like you and jenna marbles and julien solamita that ive been able to work so hard for myself im starting to feel happy inside and out you guys are so down to earth and real true to yourselves even though you guys dont know me youve definitely been support in my life im so happy your taking more time for yoursel i need see this so badly this hit close thank you sen for being who you are and dont change that this past year at my high school im in tenth grade goin into eleventh we had two kids kill them selves and no one expected it on of them was my best friend they were both the happiest kids anyone knew thanks for the upload this kinda hit hard but what you said really helped so thanks again can i get a one more light in the chat thanks for this meaningful video jack and to everyone out there going through a rough time feeling like they have no one to talk to feel free to respond here everyone needs to know that they mean something watching this video helped pull out of a months long depressive episode i wanted to say thank you to sean and all the people in the comments who are saying all of these nice things and even though they dont think it means anything it can save someone reading comments has saved my life in the past so thank you pssst jack dont tell anyone but youre the best person keep that between us i genuinely love when you have these talks with us and you need the you time always take it if you dont take you time then we can tell love you sean cant be alone if you talk to the voices in your head sean i feel the same way you do i pretend to be happy all the time and bubbly and outgoing but i lie and say things are fine and tell fun stories no one realizes how i really feel because i keep it secret i get angry at people for no reason and get aggravated easily i have severe mood swings and i go from happy to mad to sad for no reason i need help i know it i just afraid to show that im not okay because then people would realize im not always happy and find out the true me i dont know what to do im afraid to speak out my sister usually gets the spotlight because she has been caught cutting herself but i know that she does it for attention because i know her im not trying to say shes a bad person but she feels like she doesnt get enough attention so she cuts and says shes depressed and i pretend im okay ive cut with a pencil in class in front of people and they didnt care i need help i want help but im afraid please someone help you made me cry at the end i felt like you were kind of talking to me directly i dont think im depressed but im definitely not at the best time of my life your words will probably help other viewers as well and its amazing oh and be who you need to be jack we know you love us and be assured that we love you deeply in return sen you have no idea how much you made my day today knowing that someone who is so positive all the time has thought as low as someone as negative as myself make me see hope the entire time through the game i could see myself in may and to hear you relate with her and to talk well of fixing this stuff and the choices you made relating to her mean so much more to me than most anything ive ever been told and always remember we love you youre perfect to so many of us and such an amazing role model for us you have grown but youve also grown stronger and better thank you for even posting videos for us all to enjoy because you are such a beautiful being for us to look up to and watch he is so loud that i have 2 turn my volume down but im still a fan i hope i dont go deaf soon 3310 to end damn sean just dropped a bomb on us i know that im just one person but the reality that is being shown here really helped me thank you sean im truly great full for that and even though you dont know me youve made me feel a lot better about myself i can relate to may sm i need help but no one seems to listen whats up with the hair jack wheres the greeen sean i appreciate how youre so accepting and supportive of us in the lgbtq community and the people who are dealing with serious problems such as the game presents whoever else reads this just know your life has meaning and it can be so much more than you think just like jack said theres always somewhere to turn 1950 shook me to the core this is exactly how i explain my own suicidal feelings i try not to call them thoughts or anything because that make it seem like i would attempt the fact that i know how many people would hurt if i were to actually do anything keeps me from ever actually doing anything god save me if i ever find myself without any friends or family around me i dont know how that would end i have felt depressed many times in my life especially recently and i know that many people have many things to hide and even if you think you know them super well they may still be putting on a facade and hiding how they truly feel i was in school and the day felt endless with me constantly being barraged in with thoughts of suicide every time i had free time to think i would most likely be thinking about it it was very tough because the thought had never once crossed my mind and now all of a sudden im planning out how i could end my life in my mind surrounded by the happy faces of my classmates people i knew and have known for years now i ended up telling one of my friends about it and they helped me through it if they had not been there to talk to me i may have done something i would have regretted greatly i understand that many people dealing with depression may suppress their emotions and not tell anyone about it and if they do those thoughts will eat away at them im kinda depressed but i wont kill myself cuz i care too much about myself this video hit home thank you 2745 i need a friend like the that i wouldnt be able to articulate my words properly like im doing now you articulated it quite well jack luh u man i didnt think this would hit me but it did and jacks speech hit me hard played the game two days ago it really pulled me back also if you didnt know 4201 trees dont move jack this video made me shed a few tears and im usually good with that if im being completely honest this hit really close to home a while back i was going through something and i had been for months but i was still keeping it all to myself until someone really special to me noticed that i was different and started asking about it and i finally opened up to him i talked and still do to him about myself and what was happening but still i felt like i was just a burden to him and at first i felt like talking to him wasnt doing anything so i started committing self harm and i started having suicidal thoughts a few weeks later he saw the marks and urged me to stop until i finally did because i hated seeing him worry for me now a few months later i can say that talking to someone helps one hundred percent i havent seen someone professional yet ive been getting better and i havent felt that way for almost a month but hes still there and gives me resources and tells me about people i can go to since hes extremely caring and hes an amazing pe as someone who suffers severe depression on a daily basis i appreciate you playing games like this that are very realistic towards such mental illnesses it helps others see these illnesses as something more than a phase a teenager goes through i wasnt considering leaving a comment until the scene where may spoke on herself because as you said depression can just make you more and more tired as days go on may mentioned that she doesnt know what she likes and i feel like even that is part of depression a lot of things i used to enjoy a lot i cant stomach the thought of doing those things anymore ive gotten to the point that i only have one hobby and im considering even dropping that im gonna change topic here cuz ive got three very concerned cats meowing at me since im crying so much but know that i greatly appreciate you and the things you do i actually didnt watch your videos until this year i was never interested in watching someone else play gam thank you sean thank you so much i i just felt like this end of 2018 beginning of 2019 and then you can into my life i am not exaggerating at all you saved me from the hole i was in you made my world so much brighter i dont want to know everything about you i dont need to i know enough and thats good for me you are your own person and have your own life i get it you need your space and i wont ever cross that ever i can promise that thank you thank you for everything thank you for saving my life and so many others depression is a very serious condition and it can have lasting effect that this game dose not point out however it dose point of you may not know if your friend is in a dark place and that is scary please learn about mental health especially in teens and young adults they still dont know how things in life work and might get over whelmed leading to depression and in cases like in the game might lead to suicide and not many things scare me let alone horrify me but this kind of stuff is horrifying that it exists and knowing no matter how good our treatments get for any diseases or infection this kind of stuff will always seep through the cracks because you may never know they feel that way before it is too late this stuff is important look up stuff about this stuff so in the case you have to help someone you can because sometimes the right thing to do may seem like the wrong one from your perspective i reallyyyy fucking needed this video today woah that was so freaking motivational oh my gosh thx seaaan i started crying around 11 minutes in not gonna lie but i really relate to this game i had an internet friend who ive known for about 2 to 3 years we were best friends and were pretty close she always told me she had it bad at her side of the world she suffered severe bullying and was neglected by her family her father mostly since her mother had passed away her brother was away and only visited a few times a year she was alone most of the time but she told me she was happy when i stayed around i was surprised she even had the chance to see me in real life shes visited a couple of times now we grew closer until she confessed to me that she liked me more than just her best friend i guess i kinda accepted her confession at that time not knowing what other choice to make even though being homosexual was looked down upon by my family and the school i go to i had to do it she really needed someone to take care of her and the way i saw it there was no one else but me hmmm creators that make games with self harm something team salvato or whatever their name is cringe 101 oh god mays story hits a little too much to home anyone else start getting happy and telling others that you love and support them basically asking them what theyre up to and how they are im so happy that someone finally played this the game is oh so important to me i resonate with it way too much jacksepticeye gets to open up every one liked that a lot of the stuff in this game hits home for me a lot i didnt even see the cutting scene when i posted my other comment and it is heavy and i can relate so much to it for the last 17 years and just each day gets more exhausting and its like i dont fucking want my feet to hit the floor i dont want to get up i dont wanna live i dont want to breath i stop socializing are used to be the most sociable person ever even through the depression but after all the other crap in life piled on top of me it started with cutting at like 12 and 13 turn to drugs and sex for validation or to feel wanted and loved my parents are strict and not affectionate im 27 now and i feel like im 87 i have had a few seriously bad days where i have just snapped and made an attempt but clearly i failed and when i overdosed on coke they got my heart going again and i was so aggravated i mean im now trying to climb out of the hole ive been in for 17 years but as soon as i started to get the motive finally t hi can i be pined in your next video this video makes me feel some kind of way intro yay mid vid o shet oh frick sad time whos ever reading this know that you are loved and cared about soo much if you dont know by who then ill say that im one of those people you need to stay strong and jus try to understand youre not alone and that youre so much more cared about that you think thank you for reading have an absolute wonderful heccin day can you play sims please this was such a great video love you sen having more makes people want more of you and when you preform less people start to hate you overpreform and others hate you i feel this in everyday life all the time sen keep your privacy and talk to the people you love about your stuffs we will support you they also have a cute little game called theres this girl on mobile i enjoyed it despite it being a bit short if you ever have another one of these days then just know well all be here for you aaaa i love the developerr junji ito is the strangest show i have ever watched gives me strange nightmared this is the most beautiful video he has ever done many things said here were very relatable no im not just trying to get attention idk why i automatically assume thats what people think im doing when i say stuff like this 056 welp another trip down into my depression phase that is relatable to the game and remembering the flag i have in my room the two exact flags in my room and doing the exact same fucking thing that soon will show the character trying to kill themselves or harming themselves and making the character into me yup recently i realized about how many people go through this things in my high school not even the best students are away from this sort of things and its incredible when they tell you in the past i cut myself or in the past i tried to kill myself girls and boys say that and from the exterior is impossible to know that really surprise me maybe may is the girl from you left me idk just my theory this was an amazing experience and youre amazing too jack whatever happens were with you all the way also you should play another lost phone made by the same people who made a normal lost phone jack has many forms his true form sen is too pure for this world 3 i dont know if your going to read this but thank you for saying what you did say i dont open up to people bc when i do some of those people say that i say it just for attention or something like that and i guess them doing that made me close my doors thank you so much for telling us things about your personal life you should make more therapy videos just an idea not trying to force you have a good day we love you jack when you want to yee haw but you cant focus yee ahh this video hit me deep thanks for reminding me im never alone thank you sean i played this game just a week ago and i have to say it is as accurate as it can be about suicidal people they arent sick they are depressed and need help so if anybody knows someone who acts like the girl in the game dont wait or it just might be too late existing is the bane of existence you cant care for others with an empty cup sean youre not disconnected from the community your right where you need to be when may said she wrote stuff i was like same then when the main character asked what they wrote and they answered harry i screamed lmao it hit a little too hard potter fanfiction oop not the same harry but same genre lmao forget dr phil this is a real person who talks about are brain this man is the best he is a fucking monk can we take a moment to realize that sean talked for 20minutes about the deepest stuff and how you could tell this was coming right from his heart even the most joyful people the most bright and energetic people still have those dark thoughts but its ok its ok to have these problems its ok to think these things and eventually you will climb over that hill eventually you will get passed that wall that blocks you from your happiness thank you sean for always giving us hope and always making us laugh sometimes its our only time in a day to laugh thank you jack and sean for always brightening our days no matter how dark it is i hate to admit this but im may in this game and i always look happy and i told my friend i was depressed she replyed by saying if your depressed youd cry and be ad and not talk you smile all the time your such a lier and im not friends with liers thats what she texted me and it made my depression worse and we dont talk anymore jacksepticeye u should try play vr blades and sorcery i relate to may on an inhuman level and im crying omg this game was perfect although better memes would have been nice these seems like 2013 memes i just realised the creator of this is zephyo d i actually like this more mature version of you more ive been here for 6 years jesus i used to watch you religiously since i started for like 3 years but then i stopped cause i got tired of all the screaming and stuff and i guess i grew out of it but now im back because you feel more natural and make me feel comfortable and happy thanks for being yourself sean you deserve all the love i have suffered for so long with anxiety and depression and i was really good at hiding it then one day i broke i dont know what made me break all i remember is staring at myself in the mirror and sobbing for hours i hurt myself and thought if i told anyone my issues i would weigh them down i sat in my room for a full day and i just slept thats all sleeping is all i did i thought there was no end to what i was feeling i told my closest friend and all we did was talk im still dealing with this stuff but i feel better talking just talking if you deal with this stuff you are wanted and loved no matter how many times you tell yourself you not your enough i dont deal with stuff well but dont be like me im still hurting but you dont have to hurt please talk to friend family or get a therapist but please get it off you chest and dont hide it please one cant always give out and never take in eventually you will run out of what you have it is important to do things for oneself it is important to take time to look after yourself think of it as powerbank you can use it or let somebody use it a limited number of times before it runs out of power you need to charge it so it can function again properly same with people there is a number of things you can give and take on your shoulders but if you never rest and take time to charge your own batteriesyou will get to a dark place you will grow tired or seem to always angry seemingly out of the blue or for no reason take care of yourselves people do things that make you happy do things for yourselves even if it seems selfish or neglectful to not attend to your tasks or your friends needs or social media ect take time for yourself so you can take care of those things without them crushing you so you can enjoy life and the things you do and the people you have in i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars he should be a motivational speaker played this on my channel before it blew up my fav meme is fish titties i know the chances of anyone seeing this are slim but thank you for surviving for supporting for helping for existing for being independent codependent living doing and being human life is the most precious thing we can give or receive and you have just as much worth as the person next to you and time is what you make it out to be you can spend it pushing others or ridiculing yourself and that will be your decision but you cannot say you are insignificant because no one is or ever will be everyone and everything has beauty value and worth on one hand i love this on the other its a horrible message you are not responsible for saving the ones who harm themselves not ever in the end they still need to make the choice to put in the work and get help all you can do is be the best friend you can be in the mean time but sometimes its not enough and that is not not not not not on you ever sometimes there are no messages sometimes they literally cannot see any light sometimes giving everything you have isnt even enough and its not because of you its not your fault its not your fault i would like to give you a hug a lot of the things you talked about in this video made me realize that i need to make some changes in my life ive been in a hard spot lately and ive been struggling to figure out what to do and what steps i need to take to get myself out but this was very helpful thank you sean for everything you do and all of the positivity you bring to the world your honesty is so helpful and i know this will mean a lot to many people i just appreciate your honesty i think youve grasped a beautiful balance of transparency and privacy being candid and fully honest about the core of things but keeping your own life and your own time basically props to you youre very articulate even if its not the kind of professional heres my opinion and its right kind of articulation like a ted talk or whatever youre articulation isnt a heres me a pro with some life advice its taking those winding paths to explain something imperfect and evolving like any growing human basically keep doing what youre doing and if you choose to clue us in on the idea of the journey every once in a while without needing to detail every little personal thing i know there will always be an appreciative ear looking for that bit of empathy for their struggle im sorry but i was watching and ive never noticed your eyes your eyes are fucking gorgeous jfc it is ok you are not a robot for us you are a human bean 3333 you can hear his voice cry thank you gosh sean this hit me so hard because i suffer from anxiety ocd and depression and i feel unmotivated tired and worthless most of the time but i have amazing family and friends that i look at and they make me want to keep fighting because i know im strong and i can do this for them sean i just want you to know your so inspiring and you make me smile even on the worst days but you should never ever feel pressured inmaking videos because you are a person and your so brave and strong to show us this little part of your life just remember for every hater there are 1000 supporter standing

sean you have just helped so many people jack just you doing this is amazing and then the discussions in the comments of these videos and the actions it sparks its incredible the fact that this community is so supportive for everyone who feels down is amazing this community you have gathered is the absolute greatest thank you for what you do i first started watching your videos back in 2015 after moving home from a really rough first semester at college its hard to talk about without making jokes but the stress of forcing myself to grow up made me suicidal and just a mess i moved back home introverted and feeling like a loser and just plain sad and thats when i started watching your undertale series when i was too exhausted to go see my friends i had your voice on in the background or i was laughing at your ridiculous commentary thanks for talking about these things thanks for being there for your audience and thank you for being there for yourself and showing others that you need to be balanced before you can be happy its been an honor to grow with you and i cant wait to see where we as a community go thank you for this sen thank you for using your platform for these things thank you for being so open and approachable and willing to talk about stuff like this thank you for being such a constant figure in my life for so long i know that its hard sometimes but the fact that you keep pushing through and keep going is so fucking amazing thank you for everything you do all the love from wisconsin this video really opened my eyes and i couldnt help but cry over how relatable it was to me i work as a correctional officer and for those who dont what that is im basically a prison guard and its not a job for everyone and in the beginning it wasnt that bad as i had heard and it was alright but i slowly found myself going into depression but i couldnt find anyone to talk to and i live alone so that just made it worse i found myself going into a hole getting deeper and deeper until i finally just stopped going to work cause it got to the point where just thinking about going would cause me to just shut down like someone turned off a switch but this video has really showed that i can be doing something that i like to do that there is always something else thank you jack whether you meant it or not the video has sparked something inside me thank you there are mentions of suicide and self harm in this game a shoot here we go again free hugs for everyone spread the love everyone 833 might be reference to an arianna grande song i 100 agree we all get effected when something is getting to you there was a phrase i found there maybe darkness that hovers you but there will always be a bright light to shine your way my favorite meme is get nae naed im scared man i think its just the pressure of being the only boy in my family and im not doing well in my major like im on last chance saloon so im just in a real bad place but this kinda helped me out so thanks sean you have helped me so much so no one is going to notice that he didnt include the high 5 my friend committed suicide not long ago and it really hit me hard when they said that they search for her in the new people they meet because ive been looking for some sign of britney still being here but i havent found anyone as incredible as she was hopefully i will because i dont know if i can handle it if i dont all they had to say was warning not trigger warning those are for snowflakes wow thats the first time since undertale a game or even a video has made me cry i really hate how much i relate to may like my hair is even pink her dialogue sounds like how i talk i have a fucking white bell sleeve shirt like that this was a fucking sign of ever their was one youre definitely not close to irrelevant jack the music really adds to the aesthetic i played this game before jack had and when i saw this i felt my heart just melt so many games have such unrealistic themes this one just has such a realistic perspective of life i is cry at the beginning i just uwued at the gay trans wholesomeness thank you what ever happened with the green hair to sean and anyone else who feels down just remember were only human and its okay to be sad sometimes talk to someone about how you feel so the sadness doesnt drag you down life is full of ups and downs trivial things to extremes we just have to do our best to get through whatever ordeals life gives us look to the positive and try to busy the mind with something productive just played this before you this video made me a happy kind of sad ok new idea randomly we have a random hug moment whenever we see someone mention hugs thank you sen youve helped me so much throughout the past years i know you probably wont see this but just thank you and the new you is better i like the new you and a lot of people do to your slowly changing for the better and we all want good content so take a break whenever you want to wed all rather see you actually happy than faking it when she said that she just said that she was ok but she wasnt that it was a gut reaction that hit me hit me hard i have gone through basically the same thing but i have got help and now im a epic gamer you saved a life thank you sean this game hit hard thank you for your empathy sometimes thats all we need why do i feel like its my fault that you feel like this i just want you to know that we no matter what love you for the way you are why are there any dislikes on here ok im sorry but if ur opinion on jack is negative then go to another channel jack is the sweetest person here and the most real pls dont give him any hate he deserves more than we can give love for all good day to every living being shout outs from saskatchewan canada god i hate how much i relate to this feeling like everyday the same ready to give up its hard i hate how everyday drags on the feeling of disappointment from my parents for being an artist instead of an athlete like they want me to that feeling i hate it i hate me will u ever shave your beard or will u keep it like serj tankian of system of a down im 12 so hope u could give me a good answer sean youre an amazing human and you deserve to be happy and live for yourself youre also allowed to be sad if you need time for yourself then take time for yourself we can wait for you to return if you ever need to take a break this isnt just for sean this is also for anyone else who needs to see this maybe youre fine right now but if youre not later then take a break but always come back even if its not to your followers always come back to your friends and family after seeing this video all i want to do is just to run towards jack hug him and tell him that everything is okay as someone who is the therapist friend and who is going to get a therapy degree i would like to say i will be there for anyone in the world who needs it i cant stop crying because i was may i have scars on my wrist that i regret every day but my best friend was always there for me ive also been seeing a therapist im still struggling but im okay thank you for posting this video the part where you just talked after the video really helped me out since im going through a rough time right now pma for the win thank you for spreading that jack sean jack you have to have a life im glad youre around basicallyif anyone is suicidal why fix a temporary problem with one of the worst solutions that would not only wipe you off the face of the earth but also gravely impact many others who truly cared for you you know you can fix it by yourself actually first try to appreciate yourself self love is the best love because you are always available for yourself any day second and most bizzare and fun one think of yourself as doing your favorite activity or any sports now think of all those problems as your opposition you wouldnt want to lose your most priceless things against them right strike them out of the field and be happy actually a minority of person do care but majority of the world dont because they are going through problems like you so why not do them a favor and overcome your problem so that you can be a beacon of light to them for solving their problem be fearless and live your life to the fullest i beat this game yesterday its so sad also if anyones curious the background title music is losing interest shiloh pma jack we all hope youre doing well 3 this is the most hipstergaymillenialcentennial game i have ever seen ooof this hurt on a deep level i am may have been for many years things can get better but in some cases its like addiction the next relapse could happen anytime like many others youve gotten me through some very tough times including the darkest one ive had to date i appreciate you what you do what you support and these messages in some of your uploads i dont think anyone is immune to this think about robin williams im glad youre still here and the darkness didnt nab you and pull you under you do you sen we are here will be here i for one love to see the personal growth and evolution live your best life you deserve it ive played this game before and i was gonna recommend it to you and then i saw this and i got so happy i was screaming so hard every time i saw a gay momentin a good way im pansexual havent came out yet but i plan too when i get a tad bit more courage to but on another note i have been at that stage in my life where i was depressed i met some amazing people though and they helped me through it any of you who are going through this stage in your life just know people in your life care for you you just cant see it yet have a good daynightevening d sean youre honestly such a bright force in my life i know it seems odd or dumb but listening to you always makes me so happy i can see the life and reality of who you are everything you do and say and it just warms me that someone as genuinely beautiful as you actually exists thank you for being who you are if you ever worry about troubling your friends with your problems dont its far more painful to learn that you couldnt help with a loved ones suffering its never a burden to lend a helping hand also i know that nothing makes me happier than finding the light at the end of the tunnel no matter how hopeless everything seems true friends are always there to be a supporting pillar for you just take the initiative to seek help love to all of you out there reminds me of a modern emily is away for some reason you never really know anybody ever ssdgm where was the clap where was the clap 542 hit me in the feels with shiloh in the background i know no one will see this amidst the thousands and thousands of other comments but i attempted suicide twice the other day and my fear of pain and death made me fail honestly im as scared to live as i am to die and i guess my general lack of energy keeps me from doing it i dont know im really really tired but im still here because as much as i wanna quit some dumb part of me keeps from doing it either way this video came at a really good time and jacks message at the end was very uplifting too thank you both sen and the community for giving me something to smile about even when it feels like i cantshouldnt to carry on the conversation thst sean was talking about when your a social media influencer your dancing with the devil you put on a reality show style mask you can go too far if you dont feel like your mentally ill like etika your too gone in the greens and in the mix with some type of illness it can go way too far so if you decide to becone a youtuber or influencer read the devils contract i know very metaphoric but im saying it so it could hit harder on people jack your one of the reasons i still care in the world when i first saw you video even before the green hair you gave me hope and basically the reason i keep chugging along than you jack im cryin in the club rn from 3906 to 4250 i was tearing up in the eyes because i can relate to this im 14 and i really can feel the same way all to much jack has 22 million friends um hey jackcan you please heart this for my birthday thank youeven if you dont thats alright have a nice day everyone youve grown up and matured thats how life works thats whats supposed to happen if youre still clinging on to the exact personality you had when you were twenty you simply havent matured i am not the same person i was as twenty i mean i am in some aspects but i have grown up into a better version of myself someone i feel comfortable leaving the house as someone i can face in the mirror and lets be honest make funny faces at and laugh at myself and how silly i once could be and still am jeez this was a tangent and i think im a bit lost on where i was going with this now to be honest so ill just leave it at that this hits so damn hard this morning i almost went through with ending my own life this is what i needed today thank you sean thank you so much i needed to hear some of the things you said at the end thank you and have a wonderful daynight lol i thought it was a animated music video but this is much better jfc im subbed and kept seeing this in my recomended and i thought the title was mixed messages and there was anime girl thumbnail so i ignored it thinking it was some dating sim but it is sooo not that im sensitive to this type of content but there was something pulling me to watch this i am sobbing but this deep talk really helped sometimes you just need a good cry and a reminder that someone cares so he broke up with me ha why are you looking up i need to cry but this foundation was 48 dollars thank you for being you and never stop growing this topic hit home and im glad you talk a lot after it made me feel a little bit better thank you so much 3 i related to this game in both situations may and the main person i enjoy writing but i realize that i wont have guaranteed money for what i do and i have actual mental health issues and i cried at how relatable this is i used to be suicidal and i had friends i would protect from the world im usually the happy go lucky friend the mom friend yes and i dont show my feelings to people and yeah this is the first time ive said this i love you all if you ever need a friend im here get in contact with me if you want i dont want anyone to feel alone thank you so much sean i didnt know how badly i needed to hear these things until you said them thank you and thank you for being you when is the next we happy few jack i didnt expect this but this opened some doors in my brain thank you ah shit here we go again im very grateful for sean because those last few minutes of him talking about how precious life is was exactly what i needed im going through a very hard time right now and i have nobody to rely on its hard to believe that people arent alone in these situations but thats how it is thank you sean can confirm if jack was a dog hed be a pomeranian i dont care how much you change as long as youre still here you cant compare yourself to others as to who has it worse who has the right to complain it doesnt work that way it is okay to not be okay no matter who you are or what you have you might have everything according to others but feel like youre drowning tired and like you cant keep treading water anymore ive been there i still get there and we need to both reach for help and reach out to help others or else well all sink this is such an important message this is priceless 335340 jacksepticeye you should have said when you want to yee but you just cant haw jack i love your videos theyve helped me get through alot of hard times yesterday i felt sad because i thought everyone hated me but i started watching some skate 3 videos and i just laughed at your jokes and felt like wasnt alone get back in there tear this really gives me the feels man i didnt even know how much i could relate i never once thought id be typing this usually i just shrug off the sentimental and heartfelt parts of videos but this one hit me especially since this is one of my many worst times in my life where i lost all hope and felt like i living was a chore without certain people in my life to tell me to keep going and that its worth it some deep lifechanging personal things happened to me recently and now with this video not only have i cried multiple times but ive gained some hope to keep trying i want to keep going youre an inspiration to me sean and many many others and ill do my best to live out this life till the very end and

myself most pitiful top of the mornin to ya ladies jacksepticeye2019 take the next left were always here for you jack jack this game got near and dear to my heart my close friend kiana has been struggling with suicidal thoughts and im trying so hard to help her stay alive and let her know life is worth living the beginning he sound did like his old self with the out the girl in the thumbnail looks like belle delphine 3317 when im sad and miserable i watch cute doggo videos and they help wash all my pain away even if its only a few minutes it helps its therapeutic for me even if i think nothing will make me happy again they manage to make me smile every time hey just wondering is there a way to contact you on email for nonbuisness stuff not gonna lie this made me cry i was sobbing so hard when she started talking at the funeral i watched till the end and i got to say man some deep stuff but their is never a time that you dont think about us and yourself and for that you have my respect jack 33065120 hit way to close to home jack is the actual best youtube out there and i hope he knows that thats all i got other than listen to him bc hes got some great advice thank u jack this comment isnt gonna fit here but i was listening to chop suey and remembered when you did a cover on it and was wondering if your ever gonna do that immigrant song cover thanks sean not the lofi live stream music playing in the bg uwu i really feel the need to point out something if you feel like you dont have any real reason to feel the way you do there is such a thing as a literal chemical imbalance in your brain ive been in the position of well my life is fine why am i not fine but theres a physical reason some people need medication absolutely just need it but the best thing thing you can do for yourself is combine that with counseling its funny how i just downloaded this and checked youtube and you did a video jack top of the morning to ya ladies me but i wanted to get slapped in the face hey jack i played it and there have four endings and what to do is that when u hear noise from your friends room you go know on it and talk to her and when u need the bathroom you go in and you see your bff cutting her arm and the girl who texts you you can respond but when u go out wit her when you get back u will see that she hung her self and before u leave she will sing you happy birthday so what u have to do is try to keep her from killing her self but remember that theres for ending ps i hope this help d first of all wow what a stunning game just in every aspect the storyline is deep and meaningful visually spectacular and all out a fantastic experience second of all at the ending when you started talking i was in tears you are truly inspirational sean sorry my laptop doesnt have the a we love you jack when are you gonna finish trover saves the universe something happens to trover at the end yes thank you thank you for that lovely speech it made me cry im going through a lot of though things and ive been in the same position may was in in the game your probably never gonna read this lol but thank you it was very nice to hear and i think i honestly needed it omg i started crying when she walked in and saw may cutting ive had to help all my friends stop cutting and stop their thoughts of suicide i could relate so much what is worse is now that ive helped them they have been helping me with my depression love u jack and ur vids wow this really got me man thank u for that talk it really got me thinking seriously thank u how can i like this video 472627 times during certain parts of this video it sounded like he was going to cry dont cry sen youre gonna make me cry thank you i really needed this because i have been in a very dark place and this game really touches home more than id like to admit but your talk at the end really touched me thank you i mean i have life long depression but at some point i started to accept my suicidel side some people will always say to me find someone that can help you i dont need help anymore because i accept myself doesnt matter if im depressed or not i started to accept my way of thinking life long depression is painfull and sad and scary but at some point you will need to accept it the way i started to accept it is kinda dark but it helps me just thinking likei will have a long life so i will suffer more but it helped me even if it is a little dark sorry for this quite long rand just needed to push this out of my system i love that he says do what makes you happy and i love carving weapons and beating things personal reminder to go here 3300 and listen to the rest of the video i have things to do and i dont want to just leave a very important message to just be completely skipped or forgotten well i dont know if i am going to learn something from it but my guts tell me i probably will i rarely find something new on these topics even after looking up on the internet but recently since etika i had been finding a lot of things on this and i love it i really needed to learn more from this i really need the details rather than just the cliche and general stuff i really want to be better i am not in that situation oh my gosh i just want to hug you jack i love your videos and they always make me feel better i love how honest you are with all your fans thank you so much for all you do i really love this game the best game ive seen thank you for the end ive been feeling empty for the last month but this really helped me please i want you to know this video helped me out a lot and i hope nothing ever happens to you because this video helped me with a lot so please keep up the good work and i hope you have a good day if anyone needs help and doesnt have someone to talk to in person please call the national suicide help line 18002738255 if you know someone who needs help also call and stay with them until they have help or are in a safe place like a hospital millennial more like people my age15 they text like the annoying people i try to avoid i loved this indie game i played it like a month ago jack jack play the game border officer its like papers please but 3d well i just i want to say thank you really that was really nice man you have kept me happier and better i have been watching you forever probably since i can remember this hit me hard i feel like im in the same situation as may but instead of my parents its myself im giving myself a hard time i love to write not fanfiction but because writing doesnt make money i try to push myself in doing things that i dont like because it makes money it pays for what we need to live and because of my age turning 33 i am pressured again by myself to start saving for a family this means i really need to give up writing and focus on things that i dont like doing so we can live how or why would you dislike this ok who els played it before watching the videos and tried to get all the endings or just me i usually dont like youtube videos but this one i even shared it love you jack youre a great person me about to cry game uno reverse card mestarts having a slight seizure on bed are you going to play he hit her and grey plague too thanks for the likes i dont normally comment on any video but i felt this warranted at least a small response from myself regardless if it is truly heard as i know some things get lost in the chaos of these forums however this game did truly hit home and your subsequent comments really touched on a lot of things that i have gone through within the last year and a half no details necessary but i just want to say i appreciate your insight and am happy that you are finding yourself and backing away from this machine that is youtube i am learning to be who i truly am instead of what i thought everyone else wanted me to be it is a process and not easily attained in a short amount of time but to echo your sentiments of life being short like a blink of an eye to be who we truly are is the ultimate gift we could give ourselves money and fame aside who we are as human beings viewing the beauty in this world rather than the ugliness can only make for a better future i wish you luck in your omg this made me cry im a writer myself and i found out just how much i loved writing through fanfiction myself my grandmother is very pushy and i live with her im afraid of dying so i could never kill myself but i feel this so much ive had people say im a bad writer because they wanted to manipulate me and now that im free of them my writers block is gone the main character actually reminds me of my girlfriend and our mutual friend thank you again for making me feel better about being in the arts i love how you use your platform for good youre my real world spiderman i named my child gwen im a big fan i feel you sen and this game hit home pretty hard too i was involved in a situation where one of the people i was talking to online was about to commit suicide i eventually stopped her but it was really really scary and i hope no one on either end ever has to go through that there are so many people who want to support others out there so i also dont think anyone is alone either fan fic is real me and my three new just born chicks watched this together they seemed to like it keep up the great work stay happy man little warning half the video is talking is it just me who finds his voice so pleasing to hear thxs sean for this beautiful video it really does hit the heart in some points this was a very nice video i like this video i always feel so helpless with my mom im always feeling so disgusted with myself my mom never forgets about making me feel worthless shes never been there she didnt come to my high school graduation i didnt want her there but seeing everyone elses family being so proud of their kids and giving them presents made me feel sad i gave her so many chances and she always hurts me i still have scars whether it be physical or emotional pain she manages to tip me over the edge shes just one of my many problems they build up over time i gave up on my appearance i spend weeks not brushing my hair or changing my clothes i sit around all day just existing i have been sad since 4th grade i started self harm in 6th im going to be 18 on july 9 and i still feel worthless thanks sean even though you try and tell us we mean something there is always a handful of people who just dont think that way we grew up this way and its gonn this game is so emotional and beautiful and i really feel for may thank you really thank you for everything youve ever done i hate myself now ill try to actually love me i felt this this game and what you said i know what this is like but i never gave up thank you jack for being a real person and thank you for caring about strangers do you still have a drum set would love to hear some septic beats on the jacksepticeye variety channel i now that the roomate scene the music is by shiloh dynasty one hour clean i hugely disagree that you care a lot less for the community personally i feel that you care more than you did like the whole laugh thing the charity and more i really feel that you talk to us and not at us just my 02 keep doing you sean still no green hair jack even if you miss a day of making videos who cares it doesnt matter if you post once a day or once a year we will all wait for your videos because no matter what you make such incredible uplifting content that makes people happy the minute they hear the intros you are more important than whether or not we get to watch a gaming video every day if you feel as though you dont want to upload today or just want to make a random video we will all be happy just knowing that someone we can relate to is happy somehow the knowledge that another person is happy is more fulfilling than being happy yourself sometimes sean words cannot convey how much i needed this today things have been really rough lately and it just feels like ive been stuck but this was like ice water it hit me hard and has made me see that i have to wake up and participate in my life or else it may always just stay this endless gray existence thank you sincerely for opening up about this and for sharing your experiences thanks for this video and the talk it means a lot to me at least put into words some things i have been thinking when are you going to dye your hair sean seems like the perfect person i would love to be friends with just because he seems that he would be able to help so many people especially friends love you sean we all love your content and are always here for you just be nice to everyone you dont know whats going on in their life why that girl done that hi jack i have been

shown you care we care just as much about you thank you for saving me for saving others from the blade of depression and suicide thats held against some of our throats people change sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse in my opinion you changed for the better both as a person and as an entertainer of course you need to do your job to put food on the table but everyone needs some me time or to spend time with friendsfamily and just relax anyone who cant understand or downright refuses to accept that really need to fuck off hey jack havent watched the vid yet but ive seen your streams and ive been watching you for 6 years and you cheer me up all the time even right now as im sick but keep doing what your doing hope you see this great video sean meaning is a jumper that you

kinda wanted to see behind the door like not in a bad way just kind of to give the game some more context or meaning i suppose this game is making me cry guess what ill always enjoy ur videos friend great gameplayive done all the endings and the scene where you come in instead of calling the police is horrifyingi knew whats waiting behind that door but i just felt so horriblethis game also kinda therapy for myselfbut thank you for playing this jack and jackyou could play theres this girl from this same developera story about a relationship of two girlsits a short game but its amazingd once againthank you for uploading this videojack i will never stop watching your channel because of videos like this thank you jack is honestly such a beautiful human like on the inside he really was a great person for the universe to choose for him to have this path in life because hes always pushed through and gone through so much and he is still going through it all with a better set of values of life he has finally had a reason to put himself first and his life first then he had or at least from what he has said he has he put us first for such a long time and not to put that down or anything but now theres a balance between it all and it has been such a great time for him and for us even to see him but still have a friendly boundary i think its great for him to have grown so much and i really think the community feels the same way we love ya sen and we love how you feel now better than ever why did his message at the end make me cry oh jeeeeez thanks sen really needed that you help me with so much and youve always been here for me for all of us you mean a lot to us man so do whatever you need to do in the future take all the time you need keep everything you want to yourself we dont need to hear everything despite us wanting to you already bring us so much joy thanks sen for everything this art style is so astonishing and games like these are so deep i do not have a pc so you thank you for playing pc games live i also like the novel game of this painting whenever i read the this game deals with suicide disclaimer on games i always flash back to the do a flip bit from futurama youre are just simply one of the best youtubers ever because of these sort of videos you help people and entertain them more than you even think dude this game hit me hard ive been so scared that something like this would happen to me i have a lot of friends who suffer from depression and anxiety including myself and im so afraid of losing a friend because i couldnt do enough for them i would love to take them to every therapist in town but i dont have a car and i cant afford taxis i think a lot of people still dont understand what its like to be the friend of a person going through this at a young age ive convinced a few friends to go to therapy but i cant help everyone no one can help everyone i wish parents had more information that showed them that therapy is important and it isnt a sign of failure that your child has to go to it to this day im still scared i may lose a friend because its impossible for me to save them if you are a person going through suicidal thoughts please ask everyone you can for help one friend cant save you all the time but the more people who know you nee for jack and dont let anyone change who u r aw jack i see you wanted to cry you can let it out just like you make us all happy everyday and your always here for us and well always be there for you to support and make you happy thank you so much for this video and this game i really needed something lime this meby negative emotions should not be controlled with an iron fist if you know what i mean but its a requirement to appear strong what do you guys think h hi h this was so long to make plz like so i feel better as a human being txx please bring back satisfactory it was the best great series please bring i tback this game is beautiful is so many ways i was so impressed with your second play through you reacted perfectly sean if someone is ever down or depressed or you think they maybe suicidal you have to be direct ask them if theyre thinking of suicide be direct and blunt and dont leave them alone until theyre safe thank you for playing this and giving it the attention it deserves and being so professional and appropriate with such a sensitive subject jack you promised the green boi i looked up what snowstorms in dreams mean big changes are about to happen is what i found out there is always hope i just played this game last week its a beautiful piece and im glad you got around to it hol up didnt get a high five words have never resonated with me more than your words did in this video everyone around views me as the perfect child the one that gets straight as the one that has a wealthy family the one that couldnt possibly have any problems i feel empty like im only working hard and doing well in school for my family i have no goals aspirations or anything i love to death i can never stick to one thing i draw write exercise and many other things but i never stick with them i never complain because i know im lucky i know that my problems are nothing compared to others i know that nobody understands my problems i rarely get in trouble but when i do its the end of the world when i make someone cry i break down i used to wanna be a vet but now i dont know my whole family wants me to be a vet and i did too yet now i want nothing jack really made me feel like im not the only person that feels this way im not the only one that tries to please others and feels hey jacksepticeye if you like spiderman so much i found a vr game that you might like called marvel powers united were you get to play as so many different super heros including spiderman in the background in the beginning you can hear a lofi version of climax keep your heart towards your mind if you overflow your mind from what others say dont even if they care its just another reason to push yourself to find happiness not for them but for your own sake you can punch that fucking fake smile off of their faces because in reality who the fuck wants to be happy even though its a hipster thing listening to lo fi with someone you are close to not family its great time to think even going outside as rain drops upon your head no hood no umbrella just earth if you think anyone or someone you know is feeling this way please call the police or your local suicide prevention and try to help and find out whats happening ive lost someone due to suicide and no one should have to suffer that and you should try to prevent anything from happing to a loved one or friend everyone needs to know its ok to not be ok sen how do you keep predicting the future i get by in a world with no conscience by shouting it out and being anonymous and the problem is youre just like me anonymous by three days grace dont worry sen we love and care about you you have helped us in so many ways we will always be here for you just like you are us we will always love you sen you matter thank you sean i needed this i truly mean it you said the words i needed to hear would you rather

thanks to this video sean i feel youre like my bestfriend that i havent met for a long time just remember also to take your breaks and you are wellloved im kind of sad the main character couldnt comfort and be there for her friend but also go and be with goth gf i wonder if theres an ending like that you shouldnt have to deny other friendships and possible relationships because someone is dependent on you as the ending talked about while they sought out a therapist i just think thatd be a best ending i loved and appreciated that so much the ending bit when you were talking made me feel so much better than i did two minutes ago because my dad doesnt except me but my mom does and im here with my dad and so i want to go back home and he just sounded so angry at me but he obviously didnt show it but what you said made me feel better than i was so thank you and ive been a part of your channel for a long time so i thank you so much please keep doing what youre doing ive already adapted to the new you and you seem the same thats what i love so just keep doing your best and keep doing your work because youre amazing at it oh i played this game its really good ive been seeing

about stuff like this it helps a lot of people including me thank you sean for everything you do we all love you and we all care about you tremendously i have noticed that the saddest person is always the wisest and happiest and that is jack in a nutshell just wanted to put that out there thank you jack for everything idk why but i year jocelyn from xxx in the background just me ok thanks jack thanks for a fucking shoving a 5050 in my face you made me act sad and serious off and on since i saw this video damit now im face down in my pillow making my friends confused as all hell its hard to see youtubers these days spending like 10mins to talk about things like thiswhat he said proof that he had been through a lot and sharing those experiences with usmaybe teaching us some new thingsso im really appreciate it tho i need more of this jack talk sean you should play dauntless damn sean are you ok you looked like were going to cry at 3320 this gameplay is scary similar with one of my friendships and my heart started to ache this game reminded me when my friend tried to commit suicide and i was there trying to be there for her alcohol was my antidepressant when tears fell you dress less and drink more i was emotionless when people expected me to be ecstatic i was tired when people wanted me to enjoy that was before i meet this person the guy who kept on telling me that its gonna be okay who stuck with me 4705 its true we are growing up with jack but were also growing up with other youtubers ssundee has gone to another career path skydoesminecraft has come back from his break off youtube pat and jen had broken up to make themselves happy these types of things change and i feel like 2019 is definitely the year to change really everyone is starting to grow up and in a decade or so everyone will move on then the next youtubers will grow with a whole new generation and they will also move on its a think that ive been noticing that is starting to happen does anyone feel like that too did anyone notice the the thumb nail person looks like wendy from wendys i no it feel bad like that myself but i get help and now good you should become a motivational speaker no matter what ill always watch him videos like this help me through when things go bad and not so serious videos always make me so happy where is the green hair jacksen im just kidding love you sen you should become a motivational speaker why do i have yandere simulator vibes while watching this sean is the three everyone who loves him is sitting in there everytime we grow and he helps us grow 432 lmaoooo the fob one omfg seanyou need to make more of these videos becausemost of the time kids feel like killing themselves like me when i was in the 4th grade i was found in my school bathroom trying to kill myself but then when i got a therapist i had someone i could reach out to and talk about my problems with i think the reason kids feel like their alone is because they dont feel like their being heard so they want to create something that will give them the attention they need sometimes life is harder for kids than others so its better that they have someone to communicate with thanks for everybody who had problems like me for reading this and finding their way home sen you have done so much for me and so many people i think of you as a friend and not just an entertainer you encourage and help us keep going i have saved videos of your little rants and i watch them when i feel hopeless because you help me see the light you help so many of us i am so thankful to have found you and to have you as a friend thank you for all you do we love you jaaaaaaaaack play dark deception the music in the back ground is shilo dynasty goth gf looks cute with ochacos haircut favourite meme me and the boys i remember that i had depression and the only way i thought i could deal with it is to just not tell anyone i never told anyone for almost all my life being born in 2004 having to deal with hurricane katrina in 2005 at the age of 1 so many people i loved and cared about had either died or left without saying why it came to the point to where i ended up punching brick walls not being able to feel the pain i really do regret it so many years that i could of prevented it and i never said anything so i didnt have to become a nuisance now i im 14 and i help others with depression i guess its better trying to help someone with depression if youve dealt with it in your life because you can relate to it and even though i have gotten help the dreams that i had years ago still haunt me today and knowing what i know today i should of said something when it happened damn here comes the tears play theres this girl i started crying because ive been through that i still am both sides ive wanted to die for a while and i finally got help last summer my best friend liv reminds me of may she tried to kill herself this year and it was so hard i took it like she actually died and it hurt its so real and for anyone who needs to talk to someone im here for you i am blessed so blessed that i dont want myself to feel sad because i have everything but why am i like this why cant i appreciate this and still loathe living fuck i thought the title said mystic messenger im not about to cry your about to cry some people say that jack have changed and they are right he became happier wiser and more confident thx jack for being here for us we value you 3 i cant believe this wholesome game was inspired by junji ito thank you you made me really happy today thank you really me hears existential crisis my brain dan howell again me hears procrastination my brain this is just dan howell in a nutshell ive been in a rough patch for a long time i got sent to a facility in my capital little rock a couple months back and i never really got help but knowing some things you say are true helps thank you jack youre a really good person thank you from the bottom of my heart you need to keep your head up and keep doing good man loosing intrest by shiloh in the back i love angela he artstyle its soo beautiful and i love her game too i played theres this girl its a simple game but have so many meaning sorry for my bad english the jacksepticeye that i subscribed to years back always gave me a goofy smile on my face because he had the energy for a dumb video game when i could barely eat anything that was fun and i laughed a lot the jacksepticeye whos videos i enjoy nowadays are still a lot of fun and still make me laugh lots of times but its moments and videos like these that light me up way more than the screens i am watching them on when you or any other youtuber gets serious then that video means so much more than all funny or goofy videos theyve ever made no matter how hard they worked on them but thats just my opinion i know its a lot of text for just saying that i like the new or changed jacksepticeye more but i think its worth it jack you forgot the suicide hotlines thats incredibly important im not joking get those in the description right now sorry for shouting love you jack theyre trans and gay i like how half the video is him talking about life who knew 438 people like people committing suicide ok this is beautiful but why isnt his hair green yet i need to cry but my foundation was fourty eight dollars song playing 5 mins into video ive never had a positive outlook on life i never let it really get to me though i also never show any or even feel most happy like emotions i only laugh when i see or hear something thats the only time youll ever see me smile im usually a funny guy sometimes im quiet ive never really been depressed i hope anyone suffering depression can get through it this would usually be me cracking some joke but the tones in the video are way too serious for even me to crack a joke i crack jokes a lot usually they would have to do with something said that wasnt as serious as the rest something absurd and unexpected most people dont like it its just me though so i dont care if someone doesnt like it there will be jokes being made at my funeral for fucks sakes ill make sure it happens jack ya your in your 30s but your not old but you have the wisdom you gathered along the way please put on green hair i played this game 2 days ago this is amazing i enjoy your videos no matter what you do that message at the end was amazingly said you are truly a great person and you have such a good heart keep doing what your doing and be the best you that you can be its good to have time for yourself there are so many feeling people have and its hard to express them but somehow you put it in words that made sense and explained everything that at least ive never heard explained like this and i thank you for that this community is amazing and it is so loving toward one another and there are a lot of people who arent as loving and it does get to people but the love in this community is a lot more than it looks and you dont know until you join and stay and keep it up im sorry if this doesnt make sense but it feels like its just amazing to just take a step back and look at everything as it is sean has helped people so much and its amazing to see that so i sincerely thank you sean for everything youve done for this community and for myself personally this community does and forever will love you im sorry if this didnt make sense i just kind of put it out without thinking 4410 i thought he was going to say i took some hardcore drugs hi i have a break from your videos and i started in

sean was determined to save the may after he saw her die the first time random guy in my closet cause thats what heros do sean you and some other youtubers are the reasons ive changed you this community my personality my character changed in different ways 4 years ago seeing myself as this young teenage version of myself not thinking of donating to help for a great cause selfish full of himself thinking he was this big thing one day all that changed i was at a hockey game around seeing my teammates talking trash about other players literally talking trash about their lifestyle knowing i was growing to be that way i wanted to change i was watching your channel at the time however that was my sophomore year of high school i wanted to change after last years start for pma it

the podcast armchair expert the live from austin with bren brown episode she says s i played this game before and its released 8 hrs ago not to at all sound pessimistic but jack not everyone can do what makes them happy and realistically live off of that it all depends on other and sometimes outside factors that you arent in control of it can even boil down to the amount of privilege a person does or doesnt have not everyone can make it work youre right it shouldnt matter whether we make money off of it or not but thats what it comes down to for a lot of people sometimes to the point that theyre working so hard they dont have time to do the things they enjoy pride month bitches turn up i really enjoyed just listening to sean talk this game is relatable for most people i feel like not only is it beautiful but helps people understand these types of concepts i really love this video and for anyone struggling out there youre not alone we love you thank you jack thank you for this

had to cold all the i thought bc she always worn long sleeve shirts well one day my teacher group me up with her and it was just weird hear her speak as a guy who has autism and social anxiety we kinda connected until she asked me out i said no bc i just broke up from a month relationship and wanted to be single for a bit she didnt talk it well on the last day i saw her she showed me her arms which was cover in long sleeve clothing i couldnt tell u have many scars there was she had more marks the skin it seemed she saw that i seen them and left out of class and that was it i was told a week later that she tried to overdose and was in a mental hospital then i never heard a thing since september 18th about here condition bc the school push people to not talk about or be put in lunch and after school detention i just feel a bit responsible for her suicide at did anyone else notice that the background music in the game once you start playing is one of xs songs slowed way downjust let me go everyone thinks that im the person who is constantly happy because im used on smiling all the time but i was taught from the beginning of my adolescence to pretend to be happy when im sad and nobody knows who i really am no one knows that every night when everyone falls asleep im wide awake and thinking of the most dramatic and tragic way to suicide so i can actually make everyone see me to notice me and to observe from the other side if im going to be missed if any of my so called friends will be sad and cry to see if i ever mattered to anyone then i say to myself that theres no way that im going to be missed no one ever loved me no one could ever loved me and then i consider the best dramatic and shocking way to kill myself am i going to slice my throat in front of everybody at school should i jump off the balcony should i shoot my headshould i hang myself early in the morning so anyone could see my body motionless should i stab myself in the stoma i have a semicolon tattoo from the semicolon project however during the last few years i fell into another depression and hated looking at it because i felt like it was a lie i wanted it gone but not like just lasered off i wanted to cut it out to get rid of any trace of it i was always tired i was too tired to even play video games i told my parents but they didnt believe me in february 2019 i tried to kill myself i had promised my bf earlier that i wasnt going to hurt myself but then i texted him i know i promised but i lied and he rushed over and when he came in and saw me with a knife at my wrists i just looked up and went i forgot to lock the door he called the cops and i ended up in a mental health unit of a hospital for 5 days my parents finally believed me i finally started to go to therapy every week i wasnt able to graduate with the degree i wanted in may but i was able to graduate with a degree i found out i can requalify for financial a is it wierd to relate to the suiside part of this game i know many people have probably said this in the comments but imma say it jack is an amazing person thats helped many people including me and doing things like this video help me in a way i dont understand why it helps but it does and if anyone needs help please go out and get help when youre chinese and hear jack pronouncing chinese the cringe these messages are so intensely relevant to me and i want to thank both the creator of this game angela he as well as sean for this gameplay so many of us are struggling with even waking up in the morning both physically and mentally and i know that with my mental health diagnoses and history with the system of disorders and treatment i personally think of the end of my life too much but i want so very much to live i want so very much to not want it to end but it is so difficult it hurts so bad we have to go on though we absolutely have to and we are not alone even when it feels like it i am here sean is here others in these comments we are all here please reach out for help because you matter and the world would not be the same without you i promise you that im 38 years old ive been through hell 3 times but i would never ever wish for anyone else to walk in my shoes instead i am a great listener for those around me because now i know how to carry the world stay strong and you will become stronger 3 what if this video is just jacksepticeye trying to give us his message confused shock sen i love you and appreciate you so much its incredible what you do for the community as a whole and each and every individual apart of it it never felt like you were distant or that you didnt care and only felt like you were taking time for you to grow and be happy i really hope i can speak for most of us when i say that it doesnt matter if you post two videos a day or two videos a year because we just want you to be happy you deserve all of the happiness in the world and im glad that you took the time to realize that for yourself also thank you for talking about it so openly and honestly because not enough people do that and its really needed ok this is really long but just know that we all love you immensely and that we will continue to support you as long as youll let us thank you so much i havent watched your videos in a couple years but i saw you were playing papers please again and it just reminded me of cozying up after school with a chocolate bar to watch every new papers please you made back the first time you played i remember making a personal comment about my depression on your video its been a while you uploaded a year or so ago and knowing the youtube comments section i expected people to tell me to grow up and a couple people did but most people responded to me with care and well wishes i was surprised when even you jack hearted my comment it meant a lot to me that you saw it update since then i found an antidepressant that finally works for me and am doing very well anyway no matter how much youve changed jack your channel and community has always been a welcome place to come back to i trust that you will change how you feel you need to and remain the same in ways you want to no one knows whats best for you but you and how could anyone dislike this video wow this hit hard lord knows my dream job is playing games instead of working in a mill teach me your ways sean i remember commenting on your video at 3 am saying legend says if you comment on a jack septic eye video at 3 am hell reply and you said the legend is true and i flipped my shit and was sooo happy that you responded and i do kind of miss the days when you were so involved but i absolutely 100 know that you as a person matter wayyyy more then jacksepticeye keep doing you we all love you and you can always tell us whats going on thank you thank you so much watching jacks vids are way better than going to see a therapist lmao im really glad you did this video sean it helped me take a moment and reflect on myself and realize some things about myself thank you san i really appreciate what you have done for me my friend was like this he wasnt happy but he hid his sadness and i knew what was going on so i slipped to the part where u gave your phenomenal speech and he opened up and i thank you so much for that thank you for helping mefor helping himfor helping all of us we love you that was depressing i wanna know what the song playing in the background was at 320 jack was watching tentacle henti first before he got the idea to do this game i fuggn guarantee it id bet my life on it wow im impressed with the second play through all the things the friend did were perfect exactly the way i was told to handle those sorts of conversations in the mental health first aid course i attended this is a great video thanks sean making these videos really helps if hug was an emotion like the feeling of a hug this video gives me hug its probably angela heuh like huh but with an e sound in there sorry that was a bad explanation haha this is why youre my favorite sean xx this is one of the few times someones words has really touched me and i appreciate that thank you so much for this kind of videos you make my days happier i really needed this thank you san i was a little hesitant to watch this due to the trigger warnings but your talk at the end was rly nice and very helpful at this time in my life i relate to may in the sense that art is the only thing i can see myself doing happily im 17 and am about to start college and fuck dude college is scary for an artist let me fucking tell you suicide has been something thats been on my mind since i was maybe 8 or 9 so hearing things like this is rly nice and a good reminder that even if i need to find a purpose to live every single day its worth it like what if i do become an animator what if i do end up designing games ill never know if i give up life is worth living reach out and check on your friends and yourself love you jack i hope you have a nice week the jacksepticeye pod cast when he started choking up i felt that i need to cry but my foundation was fourty eight dollars i felt ever word in this video love

work they told her she never showed up at school she left work went home thinking anna suddenly got ill or something she found anna locked in the garage sitting in her car it was running gramma dragged her out onto the front lawn tried to resuscitate her but it was too late i didnt know anna but ive seen plenty of pictures she was a very beautiful girl no one had a clue that she was that depressed she had a lot of friends as far as ik she wasnt abused or anything but that just goes to show that you r this is the only video ive seen mentioning etika wheres pretty much every twitter

people who disliked this video this video show a great message and why do you not like that i was expecting a horror game but instead got therapy in a form of a game sen youre one of the most important parts of my life watching your videos over the years has made me super happy im so glad i found you im glad you exist in april i lost someone dear to me to suicide a couple days before he did it he messaged me and a couple of other friends all at the same time but he sent vague things not really trying to start a conversation i didnt know what to think of it or how to reply so when this game said is there a message you missed i freaked out panicked i know it sounds silly but i cant stop thinking what if and why why didnt he talk about how he felt what happens when you end it is a mother loses their child and sets an extra plate on accident for months a father loses a child and feels like a failure a sibling doesnt have anyone to lean on anymore in their family please please please talk about how you feel i mean it there are solutions suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem someone cares stay alive your whole community were all there for you just like you are for us stay safe everyone man fuck gays bro honestly stop being mental bitch i cryed i feel like ik what may feels like as a child i didnt have trouble with anything and i was good at almost everything then growing up i got bored of going to school felt no motivation to do anything im only 14 so ik some people might think im just a teen its a faze i thought that too i feel like 2018 was the worst experience for me however 2018 is still carried on to this year i felt like if i talked to friends they would tell me what anyone would tell me so every time someone asked me about myself i would just say im fine because it was the easiest thing to tell them committing suicide did come to mind i got bored with life but i felt disgusted with myself i thought what is wrong with me why would i want to end my life when its barely begun my mom caught me crying and i told her how i was depressed and we just sat in silence in the middle of the night and people like you sean really make me happy because it makes me realize if they can pull through so can i this makes me uwu a lot thank you man i really needed that looks a lot like one night stand of anyone remembers that game thank you so much for helping us sen all of us we love you nuuuu dunt even say or thik your nufing u ar loved by allllllll but really please just stop a take deep breath and say i can make a difference and i do matter not just to someone else but to yourself god bless you sen i cried during the hope ending that was so sad and heartwarming and ive dealt with similar things i wish there were more people like the character your pov is set from 3 happy pride everyone would add more but too much work ive always been alone but ill be fine ill suck it up tough it out walk it off and prove to myself my depression isnt real if i were to fail then i deserved it btw this game reminds me of life is strange makes me care about someone that i might totally ignore or even find annoying in real life god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them then god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and they shall become one flesh sin is anything that goes against gods will and his laws to commit sin is to transgress or disobey these laws the lust to sin dwells in human nature in other words it is contaminated and motivated by the sinful genesis 12728 and genesis 224 that like touched my soulyou should be a therapist honestly helped me wheres the green hair for the first time since joining the channel ive need to pause the video to chill for a minute thank you this is deep like i never thought he could be really serious seeing and watching this video made me think about how im doing feeling and making myself wonder if im depressed or something similar to that its making me realize that i really need to take a step back and make time for myself do other things and spend time with people who really care for me thank you sen for making this video it is really inspiring and many other words i really cant really put into wordsor this comment if you ever see it i really dont want to cry but thank you soooooo much this video is very meaningful to me i still live u iv been with you at 700000 subs and im staying with u forever incredible video thank you so much if anyone tries to insult you for prioritizing yourself do your best to ignore it bc the people that truly care are so proud of you for doing things for yourself im glad to have seen you grow this far cant wait to continue growing with you and the channel 3 thanks jack that was a really nice vid love and good feels to all that may be going through hard times jack was tearing up towards the end aww we love u does it workeditok it doesjacksean great videos i started watching again god haz no gendor then the feminists attacked you cant let a few loudmouthed people get into your head and if you do then just remember that theres 22 million of us who love you so what are a few compared to 22 million 1926 shes not wrong dont we all think about it not as a serious thought just like a what if a random thought 1956 thats one of the reasons im still here because i know if i was gone my mom would be devastated and destroyed and i couldnt do that to her not after what shes been through thank you sean and angela i am going through serious mental health issues and my husband has no idea what to do it is killing our marriage this video and game is so perfect because no matter what i say he doesnt seem to get it and i have no strength to explain it anymore it explains everything i need one thing you are consistent in is being deep and thoughtful even in your loud days you are very articulate in how you express yourself this is why you are one of my favourite youtubers you are genuine you have come a long way you are an inspiration thank you sean for being you and helping me save some of my sanity by putting in a positive perspective on things thanks i can relate not the gaming part but you want to be okay and i just can never get to that point wow that got deep i think i really needed that talk thx jack well said sean preach to to those haters dont let anybody get you down they dont know what other people go though on a daily basis also have to admit i am a depressed individual thank you for your time brofist yes i played this a while ago and thought more people should play this then jack fucking septiceye played it the perfect game for edgy teens please do the other endings i could listen to you talk forever youre such an amazing person that is the person i want to be around and watch on youtube being real and not being a youtuber all the time thank you sean for being sean and not jacksepticeye i admire you so much for talking about this as it is not an easy topic to talk about and i wish more people understood its so good to see you in a happier place in your life and it reflects in your videos those people who comment saying you need to go back to that person you were a few years ago clearly arent true fans as those who love you can tell this is a better you thanks for sharing sean made me feel towards others and loved them more this is the sean that i know thanks jack kinda did needed this 2 2 is 4 minus 1 thats 3 quick maffs wow this really hit hard fuckkk right at the end when jack started talking i started crying because i really needed this at the same time i dont know why i started crying right away even before he started talking i think it was because just jacks look is so reasurring that im worth something like even though we never met he deeply cares about me and thinks that im enough this is why the world needs jack hes a sence of reassurance when no one else would be there to comfort meall i can really say is thank you i love and appreciate you jack i do and so do millions of others jack i look up to you as a role modeland when i feel down i watch your videos to make me smile thank you for making me laugh my butt of ima cry this is probably his best video so far sean i always love watching these videos watching you falling in love with characters and giving us your amazing words of wisdom analogies and life stories just fills me with happiness you manage to play a game that hit me so close to home and made me cry like a baby but make me smile at the same time were so lucky to have these videos and lucky to have you still here making them keep speaking the truth if you know someone who killed themselves and need closure tray reciting he phrase requiescat in pace quod sum eres tu exurgens literally it mean rest in piece i am what you will be you will rise i believe in reincarnation if you are thinking if suicide please dont the people who think about it are in my experience the best friends anyone could ask for there are many methods to help but the one that worked for me was to distract myself with something fun but timeenergy consuming in my case it was dd i stated watching critical role and then finally helped to found the official dd club at my school we call ourselves the ddbagsthe lads of the netherrealm it saved my live so maybe give it a try while i do miss how the channel used to be i also love how it is now i understand the feeling that nothing matters the worlds to much you need validation from others even just feeling tired my life has started to fall apart because of people at my school im not like everyone and that gets to me i found out recently that people have been talking about me behind my back then at the end of the school year some of them saw how much i care about doing my best they had seen some of my drawings and heard me sing they were actually disappointed i wasnt going to try out for pop time our schools version of show choir for next year they saw how i love to sing and draw and they gave me the validation i was looking for i try my best despite being different being different made me work harder they saw that and now i hope they will support me no matter what i choose to do honestly as a gay girl the messages the main character and that goth gf girl exchanged are v accurate to modern gay flirting lolol i have had similar thoughts then realized people have put so much time into feeding me teaching me and more it would be a shame to throw that time away i am like a machine people put in positive time in and i return a positive result i would not be a very effective if i returned negative feelings and time hey sean this vid helped a lot more than i thought it would ive been going through stuff so this meant a lot all love man when may mentioned the writing and how it isnt profitable how every day is the same and you feel trapped and always feeling tired i just broke down im always reluctant to experience games like this because i know how hard it hits but listening to jacks speeches afterwards is always so worth it hes so true and genuine and human im so glad he exists that he took it upon himself to use his life to better our own by having us feel like we have a friend in this lonely world thank you not just to jack but to everyone in the world that keeps motivating others and fighting on themselves thank you for staying strong i did a video on this before you yeet i appreciate you talking about issues like such and that you arent afraid to bring up mental illness like most people are the beginning of this video really hit me i can relate so so much a friend of mine passed away last january by unfortunately taking her own life it shocked me to the core i can relate to the main character here i felt numb cold heartbroken i never saw any warnings no red flags it just happened so sudden her passing has effected me forever to people struggling please your friends family teachers anyone will listen even if you think youre burdening them your friends would want to know whats going on in your life how your days are how you are i unfortunately never got to know how my friend really was because she never opened up you do matter and people do care about you i promise 20 minutes of this video should be aired on tv as a psa why did every youtubers carrier start of with a medical problem i know your probably not going to see this but im glad for your change i stopped watching your video for a bit during your main change and i was disappointed because i was like where is the old jack but now i see that you are just as good now as you were then i see that youre happier now and you can see it in your videos i was in a dark place when i first started watching your videos and they made me happy i am better now and i see you are doing better as well i hope the world has good stuff coming your way thank you for being the light in my dark wth we all know you fucking care you show that every fucking day we all love you ill keep watching until im in college thanks for keeping me going this game is aesthetically me and lovely the scenery art style is so calming sean ur such a great and inspiring youtuber honestly man ur awesome i had to stop watching so i wouldnt start crying thank you jack im going through a pretty rough time but this helped me feel more wanted needed even so from the bottom of my heart thank you 3 to be honest i love these tangents cuz they help so many people including me i always read the comments on these types of videos and they always say how much you help them its amazing how genuine you are you should take a well deserved vacation you have helped so many people that i feel like we should help you youll probably never see this but to everyone who actually does you will get through those dark times i believe in you every single one of you is beautiful amazing and so kind dont doubt who you are and the things you can do you can do anything you put your mind to and never give up ever no matter how much you want to me about to non exist jack h e y me d edit dont worry im not gonna non exist i have two doggos to take care of oh boy the tears theyre a coming id love to start a youtube gaming channel idk whats holding me back but watching jack makes me happy so omg i relate to this girl so much my teachers and parents always defined me as a special talented child i was good at every subject never had to study and loved math more than anything it was easy to me when things got harder in high school i didnt really know how to study things because i never genuinely studied before my grades dropped and now im lagging behind the only thing that i genuinely love now is writing and everyone tells me that they adore my stories i have dreamt of becoming a writer for years however im focusing on becoming a surgeon because im scared of the fact that being a writer is an unsafe career i mean i love the thought of helping and rescuing people but writing is my biggest passion its sad cause i havent written in months and my fingers gradually just start to itch because of the need to write but i need to focus on my studies oof life is hard this is why i watch you sean you are the real deal you make me feel loved and i thank you for this i will never meet you ever but you treat me with respect and compassion you always say that you yourself are not responsible for people not taking their own lives that they found strength in themselves but you help just by talking like you are in this video and dude you do not need to dye your hair green just to please us ha ha ha we love ya just the way you are and thank you for just being around when i was thinking of ending my life you make me laugh and cry thank you for it all my friend love ya ive been in an extremely terrible place the last few weeks suicide passes my mind daily little things like that talk you gave in this video are the things that help get me through it at least until the next little thing that helps thank you for taking time to talk about things like this todays been terrible but this is going to get me through it again thank you jacks video brings me a smile every day it was nice to watch this i didnt think i needed this this has me crying and jack 2017 or 2018 was also a bad year for me i went to the hospital for an attempt i was only in 8th grade i feel a safe haven in your videos and you are a person as well so i never want you to feel like you cant complain and you maybe so much older than me but i can see the world differently because of you you and all of my friend became my light and im so happy that i didnt push through with those thoughts because that means that i can see you thrive and become more in this world no matter what you do what you are who you are i will be there if other people dont then whatever screw them dude this is giving me flashbacks to when jack played the game about the family who had a kid dealing with cancer cries he really is underappreciated when it comes to the speeches he makes and the way he tries to help people edit the games called that dragon cancer and it hurt a lot on the inside lemme tell ya im a kid who lives in south africa my father has forgotten about me my brother hates me im having problems and sometimes i wish i was never born i never feel ok i dont know what to do so he broke up with me why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation is 48 thanks for playing this game this has helped me a lot especially the whole talk it has made me think being a person who goes thru all this everyday thank you so much 3 2951 man i relate so hard when she said i had a bad experience with mental health in school i felt that haha fair enough petty on friday night e whats jacks saying keep a little give a lot wow for a split second it was one tear bu then i couldnt stop because of how much i related to what you have to say sean thank you for this it helped me understand myself more this music sounds like its from a lofi hip hop radio i still love and appreciate everything you do jack i used to watch you when you were as bubbly as a 20 year old as i was when i was 11 and i loved that now im 15 and still love all of your work now although youve evolved from what you once were youve helped me so much over the years and im glad youre taking more time for yourself rather than giving your community all of yourself we love you jack today was going to be the day that i finally went through with the thoughts i was just waiting for the right time but seeing one of my favorite people ever acknowledge the fact that things will one day get better made me feel a very strong sense of hope its incredible how amazing and how big of an impact one persons words can make ill always appreciate you jack and this will get lost in the sea of comments but i just feel like i need to give an attempt to let you know thank you last 13rd of the video is sean explaining stuffs glad you have your life back dude dude i just love eveything about you and what you do no matter what is said about you and what you do ill follow behind your message and content this is just so calming and helpful i appericate all of what you put out into the world your videos have let me take a break from the stress of life and stopped me from thinking bad and hateful thoughts continue being the person you are awww jack u made me cry lol thank u for this video it really speaks to me and makes me feel a tad bit better about myself i tried reaching out to my friends before but after a while they got bored or tired or both and just abandoned me i think im better now but sometimes i still think about ending it all cause not many people would care anyway and all friends i used to have are just gone and only thing im thinking about is how miserable and terrible my future will be we will always support you sen we will always be will you and we will always love you and your content and who you are as a person if you want to take a break from social media thats fine take some me time and enjoy your life we will always support and love whatever you do sen and i hope you remember that we care about you and who you are as a person and we will support you everyday with depression as the saying goes a problem shared is a problem halfed just talking with someone can make the world of difference mays text boxes start out dark red but then become light gray when you help her can we all just appreciate how amazing sean is he is so kind and cares about his fans so much and he gives such great advice sean if you see this i just want to say thank you thank you for being there on some of my darkest days your videos have helped me through a lot and i cant say thank you enough you truly are an amazing person sean theres a good message here you make a difference for someone in need but its not necessarily a great message for people who have lost a loved one to suicide which is you could have saved them if you acted differently if youve lost someone to suicide know that there was probably nothing else you could have done even if you try to offer all the support help and distractions possible

think you can play vacation simulator for vr i really dont like it when people tell you not to be sad or depressed because other people in this world have it worse it doesnt matter how rich you are or how poor or what youve been through everyone has their own demons everyone struggles you also shouldnt hate on people like sean or anyone else for changing and growing because we all do im glad youre taking time for yourself no matter how famous a person is or how much you feel like you need to keep working you should always take care of yourself first i love that i had to learn too how to disconnect and enjoy the physical aspects of our world i mean i was born in 1983 and i remind myself i survived without all this social media and electronics in my life and i have not completely gotten rid of fomo but i am not as bad as i used to keep doing you and keep those moments that you need take care why does the room that jack is in looks very much like marks but with red and blue lights and a board weird this hits so close to home i just lost a good friend to suicide a few days ago she was an angel i love how this video made me realize some things about myself that kinda feeling infected my life my freshman year i felt that my family hated me and when i tried to talk to them i didnt have the words they wouldnt listen to me and theyd scold me for thinking like such i eventually broke out to my teacher and she helped me i didnt expect it and i felt so much better so to those of you who think nothing will help maybe theyll come to help you or youll find the right person eventually you are loved this game hit very hard on me i had some depressive thoughts even though im still a teenager my schoolmates were jerks my parents were pushing on me about a year ago i started to feel something or rather i didnt feel nothing i always felt empty like there wasnt gonna be anything of me i was but a shell only a husk of my former self i even thought about suicide the pain the aftermath etc but i stopped thought about my family my friends and all of the other people that i would hurt if i did it i got out of my bubble for a little bit and it felt good my life changed for the better my fight is still going yours has to as well jack i suffer from depression but i got help because of you youre never alone suicide prevention numbers argentina 5402234930430

how the game is a serious one i just want to lighten the mood a game i played before sean whoa am i in the right universe after watching this made me released that i need to do things to make myself happy has since ive left my last year of school ive had soo much on my mind and jack you help me to be happy and you make me happy every time i watch you and jack when i watch you all the things on my mind im not thinking about because you take that out of my mind thx for being the best youtuber i played this game like a week ago and it was really good ive played this game before so ima tell ya its depressing are the audio glitches happening to everyone or just me option 2 really got me i think phonecomputer horror should be a genre at this point at first i though this is a horror game but afterall it is a drama game its scared me i usually cant cry because people say that im weak so i try to stay calm i want cry but i pull the emotions in and lock my eyes into darkness and never ending sadness i love when jack plays games like this with his advise in each one just helps me alot because i can relate with these games and him and everything thank you for helping me jack ive only cried because of a video one other time thanks man i love you man no homo hey guys uhm i usually dont comment on videos but i feel this time i should mental health is important and i really appreciate sean for discussing it we all have dark days and maybe it will sound cliche but all of you are important dont ever think someone is better than you with all of your faults somehow you are perfect live on and be you i am sure life will reward you for being brave jack can you do another drum video i loved when you did them i love the drums too im not good at them as you hi jack u are the youtuber that make laugh tell i cry when i am down i love all your videos keep it up this shit made me cry what motherfer disliked this video i will find u if not then someone else will im going through self harm and have suicidal thoughts and so much shit right now and have gone through it in over 2 years i thought about not watch this video but i did and just wanna say that i did get triggered but this was a really important video and i cant thank you enough sean for being so understanding genuine so true kind mature you changing my life every day to the better why the fuck does the thumbnail look like pokimane hey jack i dont know if you read comments but if you do take this one your words really hit me in ways i couldnt discover its odd its like opening a door and seeing three more and instantly knowing which one is the correct one to go through or running through a maze and instantly finding the exit your words really make you a special person to me ive never formally met you ive never formally talked to you but you yourself your presence seems to be a light you are so comforting and such a inspiration to me and many others and youve fixed my problems my words are probably everywhere and thrown kind of out there to make a paragraph but i just want to say throughout your years of recording ive cheered up and boosted ive found myself become more laughable and happier ever since finding the things you made things or content like this that i can be sensitive to dismisses to me but i only watch because you bring wonderful and comforting words i dont know i re honestly i think about it all the time but i have my baby to keep me going even tho hes a stinker sen is my favorite youtuber and for me and lots others enjoy when he is happy and i support him no matter how much he puts in to youtube i am very happy that he has changed for the better of himself and his many fans thank you sen for being the best this man something about sean is so precious and so heartwarming he makes me happy he has the best responses the best words the best humor this man is a legend he makes me smile every day imagine if you have the simptoms of depression but you simply arent depressed but see everything as pointless i see that trans and gay flag i mean yea same omg you need to play more games along the lines of those as 0 well this feels familiar meso my bf broke up with me my friendwhy are you looking up mei need to cry but my foundation was forty eight dollars i just started the video and i got to the trigger warning and tbh this may sound weird but mentions of suicide selfharm and depression have the opposite effect on me it interests me i dont know why but thats one of the reasons i liked the drunk chara comic dub its weird and whenever it happens i feel bad cuz i know that im being interested in something that takes lives every day i have to deal with it every day that was a very moving message at the end im glad you talked about it something like this happened to me yesterday i felt exactly like may i really needed to see this thank you sean that ending was just what i needed to hear thank you sean i used to have these thoughts and the only thing that got me through them was sean not jack sean this man deserves so much more then love respect money and all that good stuff he has empowered me to not be the one who crys out for help but to be the person who comes running when i hear it i love you sean we all do i have been thinking about this scrolling instagram all day like i needed that to live or breath and how that affects me in so many levels and i didnt even noticed being on social media that much makes us compare ourselves with others happiness because i dont see anybody posting something bad about their day but we forget that that post does not show everything about someones life so we feel bad pressured unhappy comparing ourselves with 5 of someones life that hard man hard to see hard to overcome anyways hope everyone is safe and feel loved im happy that you slowed down a little bit pushing yourself too hard is never good and im sure everyone understands that you not being so active than before is not the sign that you dont care but that there are boundaries and that you have to get something for yourself just like you said youre amazing person sean keep improving and keep inspiring others when jack got the second ending the game implied that it knew exactly why you were playing again and knew what you would do probably wasnt the best to watch this today but it kinda helped with processing some emotions thanks for posting this vid 3 and sean be someone you love love the person you are dont let anyone tell you otherwise thats the point in life is to change and grow keep doing you jack one of the most important videos that was ever uploaded to youtube that was beautiful sean please read im not going to sit here and tell you that i too have had these thoughts because i think that everyone at some point in there life has had them im also not going to sit here and tell you that you have changed because you already know you have yes i love the old you but i love the fact that your bettering yourself even more i look at you as a role model sean sorry idk how to add the thing above the a you and your videos are a big part of my life but ill tell you what even if you were to stop posting videos all together or change your content in a drastic way im still going to love you just as much your an amazing person and you help me grow as a person love myself everyday when i first found you on youtube my life was like that game its always monday when bob said meaning meaning everyday the search for meaning that was me before i found you but now i can say without a doubt that the sun shines a little bit brighter the birds chir ive never related to something more 3 i found myself slowly slipping into mays shoes without realizing i felt like i could stand there and stare her in the face and say i know i play it off with memes changing the subject joking about it i dont know how to end finish off this comment dont be like me i guess i was once put into a days worth of deep depression i lost my best friend and then a year later my dog passed this all fell onto me making me want to die and feel like i should have been able to do something but i knew i couldnt due to circumstances however those times are decreasing and im starting to come to terms with it and becoming a better person than what i once was your videos always cheer me up when i am feeling down even my cat likes your videos that is until you you randomly start screaming then he will try and change the video lol so dont let negative comments get you down or make you feel like you arent doing enough because you are an amazing youtuber that brings joy to many people i finished the video and im shaking with emotions thanks sen really touching video and me and a million other love ya some people dont understand what people are going throw and dont help but others do and everyone has a friend that will help you you just gotta know how they and talk to them 3851 life is like going on a fishing trip you dont know if the trip is going to be good or bad jake this game disturbs me the girl may looks exactly like a girl i met 3 years ago i wont bore you with the details but i became close to her there was a time i didnt see her and then i heard about the car accident she was in i can relate to this game this video is perfect timein gin my life i tried to kill myself this year because i was in a place so far down that i could see no light thankfully i survived today is my birthday and it really baffels me that i might not have lived to see today im so thankful that i got to see this video on my birthday it mena sos much to me jack u really are a good person and while you are here to let us know that u are not alone im here to let u know that you are not alone those 411 people that disliked the video better have a goddam good reason for it btw i loved the video made me cry multiple times jack you are an amazing person keep up the good work beat you to it jack just didnt record audio for it when you started talking to us the water works just started flowing thank you sen you mean so so much this video really touched me it helped me realize that im not alone in this world and there is people who care in this world thank you sean for everything and i will grow and improve like you have through the pass few years thank you for everything you have done for your viewers and for me i like watching your videos it helps me relax i actually recently went through something that made me want to stop existing but i have a boyfriend and a best friend that werent going to let me leave them and they helped me get through it wheres the high five at the beginning im 13 and all the stress is just too too much i am depressed and fighting isnt an option i might look strong on the outside but actually i am a weakling and a burning soul on the inside i have social anxiety and get much hate and panic attacks its hard the fights are no use since im emotionally weak and im mentally instable and probably mentally insane so right now there is no way out right now for me but i am waiting for it to come thank you really appreciate your inspirational speech wish everyone in the world got to see your message i played this b4 honestly i wished i had someone like this when i was younger just sitting there with you and talking about how you feel seeing this makes me want to become a helper to the world even more so im happy you played this game and uploaded it made my summer completely im not crying you are harry potter fanfiction is the best fanfiction why u no open death door huh heavy shit i know probably nobody will see this comment but thanks san for making this video my parents recently divorced and it left me in a pretty dark place the fact that they decided to separate so far into their marriage made me feel like i wasnt worth it like i was baggage on a relationship i didnt know was failing until it was too late for a while i blamed myself for not seeing the signs and my mental health is still not where it used to be i go to a therapist now but this video helped a lot once in a while its nice to know that im not the only one in the universe who feels this way such a hard video to watch based on what i am going through this game sends a good message while also showing the dark reality of what depression is at least for me i cant reach out to my friends out of fear of being a burden but i always try to be there for others funny how that works but if others are like me and cant reach out you truly dont know what others are facing i live day to day or at least exist i self injure and have dark thoughts i have attempted in the past and still have very dark thoughts even though i feel like no one is there that no one cares i am sure there is someone there for you reader just as easy as sending a message hey i am not well the 411 people who disliked clearly were just watching upside down this gamevideo struck such a cord with me ive been through a lot of similar thoughts and moments in my life and luckily had people that could help pull me out also going off of what sen said about why he started youtube was a very similar reason to why i started voice acting and i have loved every second of it so far doing what you love can help so so much on those dark days i needed this today thanks sean jack my birthday is coming up on july 13th and i dont know what i want have any ideas please play this game again to get the other 2 endings aswell loved it humans really arent made to stay inside and on the internet i use to be so happy young pure but then i got my phone i spent time on it instead of out on the playground i got vitamin d deficiency then i was abused and stopped talking to my friends and spent my time online instead of talking instead of eating but my mom found out and took me to a doctor i was sacred to go outside again but i did i found friends i pick my pencil back up and started making cafts i was almost happy then i started burning myself and people found out and they helped sorry for my english you helped me with getting through a lot of shit in my life you make me laugh when i cant find anything making me happy in anything you are so positive about a lot of things and you just improve my mood anytime im watching your videos like i was spending all my time studying things for school because i wanted to make myself busy to not to think about my suicidal thoughts and overthinking everything but i forgot about anything else im just feeling so shitty sometimes and i just wanted to be the best to prove myself i can do something good i was pushing away people and im still doing it sometimes but im trying to talk about my feelings more than i was used to before because of your pma thing i didnt know how to describe it exactly it helped me maybe its stupid but it helped and i really apriciate it anyway thank you jack for making me laugh and enjoy my time on your videos and for talking about things that a lot of people should be i really love this the games story and jacks i love that though dark it shows that may was still struggling even after having a good time talking to her roommate its true and upsetting that some people think that because theyre spending time with someone who is having a hard time they will be better but i love that there is a choice to still talk to her like a human and not have you wonder why what happened happened does that make sense its very genuine anyway i have been having a really really tough time getting past a relationship that went south multiple times and finally plummeted to no return dont spend it wallowing about what could be i have been doing that and i know i need to stop i know i need to try to put myself and my personal goals first and try to see how better off i am without this stress but its difficult difficult to let go of strong feelings difficult to let go of such a big piece of your life and try to fill it with something just as im not crying you are crying it is so interesting how the only thing that can hold you in the world is what others you care about feel like after you are gone the only reason people go though with it is when they have that bad day making them stop think about others and others arent there at that moment to everyone out there you are valid you are loved you are a person we are here for you you deserve happiness that talk kinda helped me i lost the count of how many times i stoped the video so i could breathe and not cry in front of my family incredible how sens speeches can touch so many peoples hearts sean i feel you are perfect just the way you are dont listen to the negativity of other people follow your heart and soul whoever disliked this video is a sociopath jack the therapist maybe that could be his career if youtube didnt work i will always be subscribed to you all the way icebear write out the list of what youll miss it keeps you here it kept me here i have a lot of living left so do you i am sensitive too things like that but i watch it anyway p most of the time the idea of help which society has placed to take this take the pills go to the doctor you need help to look at god blah blah blah the hardest part about life is the very idea of trying to make it better not always yours but everyones else from what life has taught me from speed bumps to even taking a story up but ten stories down the best thing which we can all do is to keep living day after day until you find something to push you shit that sounds easier said than done which it is we are all not so different that is what i noticed throughout my journey we all have our downfalls took a last breath because who wants to put on a smiling mask every fucking day like love to be honest unlike love you dont wait for it you find it call for it whether it takes you three years to even ten pushing forward from hill to hill is the strongest thing a person can do and most of the time you just gotta find the right person wheres the green hair powerful stuff i skipped therapy cause this was more powerful play raft again please thanks jack i didnt know i needed to hear that until i did it just hits me so hard when a game knows exactly how you feel happy to say that im getting better now due to other people around me but upset that this video brought back some tears as memories of the past came flooding in it seems that sen just knows when to upload this type of content thanks a lot mrsepticeye stay alive frens youre too beautiful smart and absolutely amazing to leave im no professional but heres what helps me delete social media apps be around familytrue friends make the sometimes hard effort to leaving your room yard and maybe even your house read twenty one pilot lyrics listen to twenty one pilots for example trees forest bandito leave the city cut my lip addict with a pen listen to music that you enjoy and can relate too it really helps trust me youre worth it just remember pma and everything will be fine and jacksepticeye you are the best this art style just screams hailee steinfeld and i dont even know why listen jack if you have an xbox you can message me at yeetgamer06 for me to listen if i dont respond its because i have divorced parents and i live at dads every other week or im just dead so listen i will listen bro 339 when they always say yee has but never ask haw yee when you want to yeehaw but you can only yee this is kinda nice to watch ive been suicidal since i was very very young i miss the wapush from his intro ooo ive played this before really liked it you are never alone this hit me in a way i cant describe and i havent felt this light and free in years roses are red violets are purple oh i got a like but why is it blue the bloodied scissors on the menu screen i just felt my stomach turn this is so therapeutic at least for me hearing to seans talk and people in the comments talk made me feel not alone so many people are like me there are so many people almost giving up but hey we hang on thats life right hoping for better end and reward at the end of the road people look at me as a bubbly and happy person so i related to sean so much about having depression and not being able to open myself about that or for me personally i couldnt accept the fact that im not as strong as i thought its really help me so much sean and all of you who read this and relating to me and the other people who tried hard to escape from that darkness we want happiness we all do i want to believe we can achieve it i really do can you do a part 2 of this game please thank you wait its by junji ito thats the legendary horror manga maker of japan guys you all are missing out alot how to make someones day hug them just hug them tight you may something nice or you could just stay silent because hug can reassure someone hug will make someone feel that theyll make through the dark times in my country mental illness is frowned upon and ppl never talk about it i remember i broke up w my gf cause i found out she was cheating on me and i felt soo sad i was miserable and i felt that im not worth anything if even her the only person that has my back didnt care about me or my feelings i was suicidal and i remember talking to my sister about it and she made it even worse by saying that i should never tell mom and just stay quiet and so i tried to go to a therapist by they are really expensive and i would never be able to afford it and so i talked to my friends at last im better now but it had been 3 years and i keep falling over it but i agree there will always be a way out of it if its not the first person u talk to then find someone else im sure someone cares about you and will hold your hands and help u out of it im talking a lot its okay sean i like it when you talk and just ramble on about whats on your mind i love the humanity within you the vulnerability it makes you human at the end of day and now i dont know about you sean but i value the humanity and justthe human being more than anything else in this world i know that probably no one is going to see this but i myself started thinking that way that you stopped being loud and goofy new hair less gaming vids and your channel was slowly getting more boring but the last weeks i started watching your more recent playthroughs and u always go very deep into things your a different youtuber because your serious i when youre playing storydriven video games and you always go deep down into the games plot and discuss things you can relate to and its like youre always talking straight to the viewer which makes u like a good friend for the audience and that is what makes u a person im a big fan man keep being u and dont let other ppl opinions shape who you are i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars 3 sean i have battled over half of my life with depression and i remember so many times i felt like i had to hide doing what youve done in this video is so much harder than anyone can imagine so much love for you right now 3 i am a part of the lgbt community and let me tell ya i am glad that jack supports it it means a lot to me man it doesnt matter who you are what gender you are what race you are just know that keanu reeves thinks you are breathtaking this comment offers free headpats remember all your concerns your identities and your existances are all valid thank you so much for talking about this i think it really needed to be said especially with all thats been going in my life and others lives as well mental health is extremely important and i wish more people really took it a lot more seriously suicide really isnt a joke nor is self harm its scary especially for the family and friends of people going through these issues anyways thank you sean thanks sean idk what told me to stay after the game ended but i stayed and listened it got to me and i cried a couple times but the fact that you talked about this topic touched me and its a push for what i needed to hear and i want to thank you for what you said in this video its hard but nothings impossible life itself is your doing dont ever give up keep doing you and thanks again ill never forget this video thats the nicest the most helpful heartwarming thing ive have heard you say sean you are the best youtuber out their you have helped me through so many things ok im only 4 mins in and i know this is going to be an emotional story but i just love the fact they have a fall out boy meme dude i really needed that right now thanks motivational speaker much jack we love you no matter how much comedy and pma shine through your videos it all boils down to a single detail youre human just like everybody else speaking as one of the people that you have attracted with your personality and honesty we would understand if you ever need a break or need to put your feelings out there because of this video we understand how you think and how you feel so thank you from the bottom of our hearts seeing sean get sad hurts me way more than people think it should and theres so much i wanna tell him and theres so much i wanna thank him for some people may not notice this and some of us do u can tell when he isnt always doing okay and we forgive him when we see his videos but for him and for others if things seem bad now it will get better i can promise u thative been there edit jack is actually one of the reasons i get up and keep going everyday browe know you carejust do you man the faithful fans and

i need someone real to talk to im going to middle school and i lost a really good friend im only 12 and it started 10 i always think of cutting my self with a knife and i think its really geting to me

entertain and only to entertain you care about people and your not afraid to put up boundaries and you have helped me personally through some dark times you dont try to make us feel like your always

love you inserts depressing story on how writig might not make a profit jack well when i started youtube as stan lee once said always chase your dreams dont let some knuckle head stop you from finding them jack no sean we care about you a lot you helped many of us through dark times and please keep in mind there are a lot of us who want you to receive our good vibes as a thank you dont just look at those who see you just as a random youtuber hey sean ive been watching your videos for ages and i just wanted to say that youre one of the best people on youtube because youre not selfcentered or selfish but instead youre a truly good person that is real and actually cares about other people and you helped me through some tough times keep making these great videos that lift the spirits of all the people that watch them thanks ohh i didnt think about it at first but may did it on mes birthday jack thank you so much for the real talk especially about etika and yourself youre right there should be a barrier for you the difference is that etika didnt realize that there was a huge problem until it was too late in his last video he mentioned that he knew that he had mental health issues but hed said that you cant help someone who doesnt want to be helped and we know what the end result of that was also its not just youtubers who go through these thoughts i wanted to end things when i was 12 because i was so lost and i was suffering horrible mental and verbal abuse from my mother at the same time i missed my father so terribly my folks divorced when i was 6 something inside of me welled up however and the thought of who would be left behind and what they would think made me stop myself do i still have my bad days everyone does thankfully because of a decision i made at 16 to go live with my father that literally saved my life for anyone who r the thing for me is that im not the person thats going through these difficult and dark times its actually a friend of mine but i didnt know about it for a very long time now the friend is getting better but this video still hit me hard as in i know that maybe theres someone else thats having it rough and i dont know about it anyways thank you sean for playing this this video had touched me deeply thank you for your supportive advice especially since its brought into the regards of writing im writing my own original novel but sometimes its hard to keep going i love writing but there are times where i get in a slump and its not just short spurts of writers block but instead blocks months long im lucky because my mum supports me but often that support unintentionally turns into pressure this helps somewhat i dont know if you ever see this but thank you sean i really needed to hear some of the things you said youre incredible im watching your videos because you make me laugh and forget all the stupid or even serious things that make me feel sad and tired so again a huge thank you for being here for me i wish the best for you jacksepticeye you have to die your first green now your an amazing person and an awesome youtuber you are the jacksepticeye the sean your important to me if youre gone i wouldnt have anything important in the day hit the nail on the head about social media i find myself getting infatuated and jealous over other peoples achievements and lifestyles vs what ive done or havent done in my life a lot really good advice there man ily keep living for yourself bb i struggle with this kind of thing everyday but i constantly remind myself that the fact that im still alive is something to be proud of i really needed your message at the end of this video today huh i had that problem now 2 years ago and it was tough like every day and night i was tiking about ya know man i feel like shit now i dont know why edited what i meant to say is that i felt tired tired of life in general like i wannet to end it all just like that and every day was the same as always it was like a little hell for me and i though if ill end it itl go all away but it did but not that way i talked to some people and i got past it tough but got past it and i dont want that to happen to anyone cuz that suck doesnt it i can really relate to may in the way that i used to be good at everything but then when things got harder i could no longer deal with it now when im not doing something perfectly its easier to just give up im working on it though random person jack is loud me watches his video with headphones turned all the way up also me im ok ears bleed i cried seeing this i love your videos and you are the best youtuber ever thx helping me while i am suffering from clinical depression the feeling of doing the same thing everyday is something i can understand currently its school im taking days off to break the cycle this video was posted on the first day im taking off sorry for talking about myself just kinda got the feels i know no one may see this and whoever does may not believe this but i really believe that everyone deserves more chances right in this moment and day or month ive gone through losing both of my parents to drugs again for the 3rd time my brother raped me again 9th time and ive stayed alive and strong because my dream is youtube and it has been since i was like 12 im not asking for you to check me out because that up to you but im just saying i wanna be able to say that i made it in the end and i wanna be strong again and have friends because i havent had any in years i wanna be able to just be alive again and not just be there like a item or something everything serves a purpose but everything cant serve a purpose if it doesnt have any courage or help to push it to keep going like the game said its ok to be sad and its ok to be depressed just dont sit in it for to long because its bad for you i hope this gets seen by some people at least a couple i really love whoever reads for what its worth you may have started to ramble towards the end but you pulled it together and ended it really well great video and message today jack i hope to see you continue to make more entertaining and sometimes inspiring content thank you so much for this video i always love being able to have a conversation about these topics because it definitely needs to be spread around what youre explaining towards the last 15 minutes im doing my gcse speaking language exam on i know it wont make much if a difference but i hope it helps make a small difference at the end it meant a lot to me thank you for saying this i can relate to this message and game in some way i brighten my friends day every time i talk to them every time i talk to them my day is brightened everyone has their own problems and fights but some people cant deal with the pain because their not a fight but everyone has that thought even most of my friends and theyre alive because of me they didnt listen to the voice because of some many people please help others with their problems if theyre in danger im acutally in a harry potter roleplay as of watching this video right now thank you sean we all love you very much comes for a game gets a pep talk when im going through a depressive episode thank uou jack i needed this i know this is unrelated but did anyone else notice the section of hair the we going in a diffrent direction to all the others i cried so much with this video i am having a hard time in my life and at some point i thought to end it alli never attempted anything fortunatelyi had no one to talk and felt so numb my problems still there but at least try to forget them and focus on my mental health and let everything go hearing sean and reading comments i feel that im not aloneand focusing on my goals or thinking what i improve every year gives me hopethat it will get betterthank you for sharing your experiences things like this bloom up the positive emotions and feeling and brushes of the bad ones helps a lot thank you sean not jack but the you behind the cameras this video hits me emotionally not cause its sad or anything but its cause you can relate to the stuff you say and feel not as alone as you would think you are you dont have to do what you dont like to or what burns you out instead keep on going as you are love you as a fan were it before or now so hope we all can grow more and more each and every day that is one of the most obvious reasons why i subscribed to you not only because you are fin hilarious or because i like your kind of taste of games i just love that you have such a great personality you just dont do youtube because you want to make money you really care and the problems you talked about in this video helped me really much just thinking about it and getting a little better i feel like the world around me is falling apart and that i dont fit in any part of the world except streaming i stream almost every time i have freetime just to do something in my life that really fits what i love to do entertain and talk with people giving people the feeling that theyre having a place in this world or if they have a bad they just make them happy i dont even know why i am writing this probably i will be the only one reading this but if there is someone reading this i hope you are ok and if youre not you are not alone i hope you will get better soon well jack no stop youre making commit the sad at the moment i struggle with anxiety and school even though im out of it i tend to deeply scratch myself when im stressed im still struggling with my gender identity and sexuality i even have a scar or two on my leg due to my nails my very short sharp nails but youve gotten me through a lot and i want to say thank you for making everyone aware of these kind of things if youre reading this then hi thanks again well this hits hard below the beltlot of shitty memories brought back to the light thank you for caring for us even though you dont know us and we dont know u too my biggest fear is letting down the people i care most about in my life like my parents and my sister and my boyfriend and my closest friends i was suicidal for many years in my life because i never felt like i was good enough i still never feel good enough in most parts of my life but i am getting better every day im so glad i stuck around through the years i felt suicidal because my life is amazing today i think the thing that has helped me most of all is when my boyfriend of 4 years hugged me tight on a night that i told him i just wanted to die and he said i will never forgive you if you leave me here all alone like that i knew at that moment that i could never let anyone down more than committing suicide would i havent had a suicidal thought since 2017 and even on my worst days i dont feel like i have to give up on life anymore this hit me so hard in so many different and personal ways and you dont need to show us so much of your personal life that you dont want to show us so thank you anyway jack i really needed this 434 i spy with my emo eye a fall out boy meme sean the stuff you discussed about social media is so fucking true i wish we could spread that message to even more people people need to know dont worry jack as you were talking about people support you and care about younot just us as in your communityeveryone you know and care about will support yousupport from ireland i feel like sometimes i play youtube videos just to hear someone because i feel alone i sometimes have heroic suicidal dreams i dont know if thats okay sort of like i need to kill myself to save others i hate how no one cares about the fact that mays scars faded thank you i dont know how to do it but i feel like i need to holy fuck i played this game not too long ago as someone who struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts its good to see more of this getting out sadly there is still a strange belief that happy people have no reason to be depressed which just causes the depressed person to feel guilt we need to get the message out that depression is an illness like any other im crying thank you thank you so much im gonna say now im 11 years old and i want to die i just wanna fall asleep and not wake up even though i hate to admit it i have infact almost jumped out a window i looked down and realised i wouldnt die from it so i stopped myself im sick of keeping this in i find things in the house that r not knives and scratch at my arm with it i try and try to tell people but when i told them about my anxiety they didnt believe me im scared they will hate me they will not want to be my friend but this has helped me i have toxic friends ones who r fake they dis my appearance because i have short hair because i wear boyish clothes because im thinking about going trans when im older everything they do gets to me thanks c your an amazing person thank you for making this video i know this is sad but i saw my brother die in my room and i couldnt save him i dont talk about it at home because i dont trust anyone i keep emotion to myself and when i see videos like this it makes me feel like it isnt my fault what you said really did helpthank you for being so open and honest honestly the talk jack said really helps because i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was 12 and before that i had a eating disorder from ages 1011 and im pretty sure my depression went back a long time before that because i always was a over thinker where my mind couldnt rest my high school experience was so bad because it got to the point where i did have to get help and honestly i went for help more than once to facilities they helped im glad i did it but it doesnt just disappear and now im pregnant and due october 29th and to be honest some days my mind still doesnt rest im in a much better place than i was i am not in that very dark place anymore im happy but for people with depression even if ur having the best time of your life and ur happy and u dont get to that dark place anymore there still are those little moments where u just feel down and u just feel out of it so you have those days yes but i dont regret ever getting help thank you jack i really feel like may but i am getting better little by little and these videos always hit home for me i love you sean keep being you we are here for you jack youre one of the only people i know who are brave enough to approach these subjects yes this is real and many people go through this kinda stuff everyday they try to cover it up but maybe just find a friend who seems kinda off and spend a little time to ask if theyre ok that means alot to people hurting i needed this today also we love and support you sen we love you sen and we love everyone in this community so thank you for getting this message out go anywhere always treat someone with a smile go compliment someone they may be going through stuff also to those who are struggling dont give up you can do it you can beat this youre not alone people care its hard but sometimes finding someone to help is the best option sometimes talking is better it sucks but you are amazing great we love you this hits deep the amount of emotion in a videoive been there we all have if u havent yet ur one of the lucky few jack has been there for so many in his darkest times and ours jack we all love u thank u u probably wont see this but well done u have done good this video really hit hard most of the things may was saying was some of the things i felt and i got cold and chills i love that you do these videos where you pause and speak about your own experiences or just really talk about this situation thank you sen you probably wont see this but if you need a break then take one everyone needs a break every once in a while i think people will understand so do what you need to do to be happy the disembodied feeling the main character feels here is called depersonalization and is the minds defense mechanism when we cant handle the situation for some people this can happen at any time for what seems like no reason if you feel disconnected like this often you should talk to a mental health professional if you dont know how to find one talk to your doctor and ask if they can provide you with a list of professionals that can take your insurance if you have any as with any mental health problem depersonalization can be a scary feeling but youre not alone and you dont have to suffer through it no matter what youre feeling i depersonalize frequently and easily but im steadily getting better with help i can attest if you seek help you can be more comfortable in your own mind take care of yourself you are important even if you cant see it right now tbh ive had severe depression for years bc of my traumatic past i used to cut alot and i still think about what itd be like if i did end my life the only thing stopping me is my bf my mother and my little sister it is hard and others rlly dont know who i truly am you made me feel comfortable enough to tell someone about what i do you are such an inspiration to me and i thank you for opening up to the world about that bc if i hadnt of seen this video i wouldnt be okay rn but i am more confident and i am better jack i love this video very inspirational yeah we all need to walk outside talk with some friends just about anything or just talk with anyone outside learn about other peoples lives lots of interesting stuff out there you gotta look after your mental health because really you are the only one who can do what you need to we will be here waiting for you as always when you are ready and feel ok you cant do any more or less than that x they have gotten to him so colorblind question is that light blue or purple midway through the video your eyes looked redish and i started to tear up arent memories great sarcasm when i starting watching this video i thought this game would be a weird anime game but when i starting watching and i really like this game its game where you have choices and that what makes it cool game also i have depression and im like that tired and dont really feel like doing anything thou im not thinking of suicide because i think its pointless and one chance only to have a life and throwing it away and even if i did that i would never get to see the things i want to do in life and by watching this video actually gave me motivation to do something instead of doing nothing 3827 i cried so hard at that part i love you so much sean as a best friend to someone who suffered from crippling depression this hit hard it really is really important to just be there for people about 6 months ago my friend had suicidal thoughts to the point where she did almost commit suicide before forcing herself not to she did bad selfharm she was anorexic her relationship with her family wasnt the best and she didnt really have any friends except me according to her she thinks that she really would have committed suicide if i wasnt there to comfort her and she told me that i singlehandedly helped her stop selfharm and fast forward now and shes going to therapy her relationships are improving a little shes starting to get friends and shes eating normally if you see someone who needs help please dont hesitate really all these people need is someone to be there to comfort them and it really can be the thing that saves their lives thank you for literally everything i know so many people need to hear this and its amazing that you were able to talk about it many people arent able to talk about it without brushing it off or trying to make it a less serious topic for the sake of their image or their own feelings about the matter so thank you wheres the green hair thank you sean i dont know why but sometimes in this game i can always know what will happened its so sad to see this video touched me emotionally and is something i want to get back to every now and then stay strong everyone we all have hard times to go through and to all those who are determined to try and lift up others take care of your own mental health too the pain of others can drag you down just like others can lift you up i wish i had a note on the door but im also so glad i was there to save my soulmate i live in constant stress and fear of that with my mental instability issues i will hurt someone or something ive always been scared of that even since kindergarten sean thank you so much for what you shared i know im not the only one who needed to hear this yikes i relate too much to mayis oversleeping and staying in bed all day for multiple days a sign of depression i sleep through the day and spend the night watching youtube im enlisting into the army national guard and im stressing so hardgod i want school to start soon i need the distraction my friendseven schoolwork seems good right now when you said that you were thinking about ending it it hurt me so bad i literally felt my heart stop for a second and tears started to steam over my face you were the only person i could trust and i cant imagine losing you im pretty sure no one is going to see this i still want to say thank you jack you have saved my life in a way multiple times i hope someone sees this god jack youre such an amazing person its always good to take a step back and just think about things take a break gain some self confidence and believe you have self worth because ever step you take on one step closer to recovery dont be afraid to reach out because someone will be there to take your hand even in the most unexpected ways never give up oof this hit too close to home depression and anxiety is difficult to live with i know from experience 2017 was also a really bad year for me it was the first time i had almost gone through with a suicidal thought im so lucky i started therapy right then which was difficult because i was 15 and my mom and doctor didnt believe me until i became super suicidal if i hadnt started therapy when i had i mightve not been here today from someone who was at their lowest things can get better nothing lasts forever not even bad times or horrible thoughts i still feel depressed for periods of time but now i know that life is worth it i didnt use to think that before and that keeps me going i really appreciate jack talking about this remember your feelings are valid and things can and will get better the scariest thing about this game is that irl you only get one chance and so many people arent saved because their voices arent found this scares me what if a friend of mine is about to kill himself and all im doing is sitting here watching youtube when i could be helping them we love you sean just know that youre doing amazing sen keep growing and loving yourself i know for me personally i want the best for those i care about and having gone through my teenage and early adult years with you ive come to care for you as a person your content is still amazing and im happy to hear youve been doing better for you yourself personally we will always be here on the internet when you return so do what makes you happy sean omg dont cry ahhh you are on tv i like gaming steaming and making videos but i am not good at it so i think people wont enjoy it thanks jack i needed this i wont be ok for a while but this helped jackspedicey i invitate you to my 6th birth time that awkward moment when you relate to may thank you sen this helps me a lot i will never understand how people can say just be happy to someone who is depressed its like going to a city thats been completely destroyed and expecting it to be back in working order straight away the city is going to need time to recover and rebuild itself just like the brain needs time to slowly pull itself out of its depressed state you sound like a narerator thanks for the message guys if at any point when youre taking antidepressants and the medication makes you feel worse stop taking it even if your doctor tells you to this happened to me my doctor tried to force me to keep taking prozac which was making my depression worse i stopped taking it despite my doctor telling me to because i knew what signs to look out for my friend wasnt so lucky her antidepressant caused her depression to worsen and instead of changing medication she killed herself24 years old two young children gone all because she didnt know the signs sean if you happen to see this please help me spread this message no im not a therapist but i can say this with more confidence than my doctor when he told me to keep taking someone that made my depression so much worse ive struggled with depression and suicide my whole life ive tried getting help and nothing ever really worked everyday is a struggle for me just to get up out of bed one of the few things that really make me happy is your videos jack and how open hearted you can be thanks for being such a wonderful human being may has heterochromia im not a person that cries but this video and this game hit me and now im crying it hit so close to home i have and still are struglling with deppresion and thoughts like this ive also had friends who have tried to commit suicide and i know how hard it can be to reach out to someone and feal wonerauble but i also know that as long as you dont give up you will be found and everything will be fine ive been there i tried twice obviously i didnt succeed the only thing i can do to forget how im feeling is watch your videos they cheer me up for a while i dont feel sadness pain that is why your videos will always be important to me thank you this game is absolutely amazing it sends such a a great message and let you replay and fix your behavior although thats not the case in real life this teaches us that sometimes we have to put our desires away and put the people struggling first always always always keep an eye out for anyone that seems to be struggling because we can all use that emotional support because the outcome changes if you can put your own desires away and show your kindness to the ones who may need it most this is one of the best games about this topic and teaches a good lesson rather than just raising awareness so thanks for the gameplay and exposing us to how amazing this game truly is and thanks for all your input 3 i played that game a month ago or so its an amazing game its cute but extremely sad i think it did an amazing job bringing awareness and i got so happy seeing you played it may and the carector you play as those to are just like meim super nice and i love to help people but i do hurt myself and i think of killing my self sometimes but i dont want to hurt others so i hide my feelings and say im fine but im always lying and i feel bad for lying to so much people but i dont want them to know the truth or anything ive had a bad past and ive done some really messed up shit i try not to think of my past but when i do i always hurt myself i always feel like i never fit in i feel like everyone is talking about me i dont think i look right i want to be pretty and i want to be someone im not i lost my friends cuase im moving to a new school and i only had three friends so it kinda didnt matter i got lots of internet friends and everytime we talk they always say im the best and i always make them happy it makes me happy to hear that but they dont know what i feel and what i think about like i said i love to help and listen to ot this game hits me so hard and jacks speech but what if your best friends live across the world and the only thing you have to talk to them is social media if you left they could kill themselves any second if your not thereyou have no way to get to them id be broken ive been a bad friend and i am stressed out all the time and i have serious anger issues for example 2nd grade i knocked down two people for braking a stick and its hard to tell people this since most think im disgusting because of my cuts temperamentpast and mental state and stability you matter with or without the channel thank you this is just one of the videos from sen that makes me want to be human and alive he is just such a nice guy and he cares about what seems like the whole world i have been in dark times like this and sen has been the one to bring me back up and just him saying laugh brings a smile to my face this may seem cliche but i dont care sen has been the person that makes me happy not fully but like my best freinds parents etc make me happy as well the pma thing as well has been something that keeps me up and going every day for the year of 2019 i have been writing pma for like six or seven months on my wrist with sharpie so i can just try to be happy and be myself sen also helped me get through my dads surgery i wont go into it because i want to keep hisour privacy i was so depressed for that last week of school and every day that i came home and remembered that they were in a completely differant state and i tried to be myself but it didnt really work so i kinda turned to thank you sean thats all just thank you for the talk when this stuff happens your mind turns against itself you want to just end it you feel worthless and unwanted by everyone and everything you start to pick away at your tiny mistakes and overanalyse everyones snide comment and you let it all get to your head and when this happens you start to lose who you are in this pool of selfhatred and you think that this is normal but it isnt you feel like you are looking for attention and you tell yourself to hide it and to shut up and stop looking for attention edit i became so desensitised to such sadness i can no longer cry at what would make a normal person fall to their knees in sadness and when i feel sad it is no longer having a good cry its now just sitting there thinking about this thing that makes people sad and doesnt make me sad and i feel like a part of me is missing from this because i am so desensitised none of this bothers me at all because i think of this stuff so much its a part of just every day thought for me not that im suicidal jack your videos have helped me more than i can explain watching this video really helped me realize that im not alone and i want to let you know that your not alone i cried a lot during this video but at the end of all of that i realized how much youve helped me i havent reached out to anyone but now i think i am thanks a lot jack i dont mean to be cliche but your my hero i should probably stop typing because im crying again lol 4954 to the end hit hard ive been trying to work through some things but they keep piling up and im not one to ask for help this whole video gave me another push to keep going the thoughts i have are not me and i have to push past them on the off chance that seanjack sees this i just want to say thank you so much youve been a support for years and i dont think i can thank you enough if i ever meet you ill probably hug you with your consent of course thank you and i know lots of people are the same as me so please tell someone and open up look for help youre all awesome and deserve happiness this comment has nothing to do with this game but like if jack should do more satisfactory jacksepticeye thank you this game really got to me its so beautiful and so sad at the same time this video hit me hard i lost one of my closest friends to suicide i didnt know what was happening with her because she always seemed so happy fine like her usual self every time i think about her i regret not seeing the signs before it was to late when she passed it hit me so hard i was like how could i not see it when she was here i miss her so much she was the best if youre not changing youre not evolving this video is so much of what our generation needs to hear thank you im legit crying right now seans confession at the end really reminds me of sayoris bottles poem from ddlc and now im crying this is one of the best videos ive ever watched it hit me so hard keep up the good work no presure thank you sean you really just helped me out ive had a chance to commit to it but then ive come on to this channle your channle and watch you and then those thought just leave thank you i had a friend once who told me never to compare problems with other people no matter how big or small a problem may seem if its important to you then it matters because all of us are important and a struggle is a struggle no matter the size so its okay to talk about things that youre struggling with even if you think someone else has it worse thats always stuck with me i want anyone who might read this to know you matter your struggles matter and i believe in you wow jack thank you for that talk it felt really sincere to me and thats a very rare feeling for me to get when im going through the internet its very refreshing to find that being an actress i relate to the things you said in so many ways just wanna say that jacksean your are my favorite you tuber and you are the reason why i started my own you tube channel keep up the good work and keep grinding to the top like a bosssss i just had a fight with my best friend over something so dumband seeing this video right after it made me realize how stupid it actually was i care a lot about her and i never wanted to hurt her in any way sean is right life is too short its too short for these unnecessary fightsso ill try to have as little of them as possible thank you for this video thank you for the inspiring message sean keep doing that youre doing youre doing great i appreciate everything youve done not only for the channel and for us but for yourself dont forget to make time for yourself our mental health is as important as yours 3 stay safe and pma 3 i felt this i lost a friend last year i didnt even see it coming and i still blame myself and almost gave up before and jack you are contributing so much if im sad or need a good laugh or a distraction i watch your videos you have made me happy for so long and i hope you see this so you can realize that you help people i relate to this too much sen thank you so much for this video you are appreciated as an entertainer and as a person irritated leg jogging i felt that bruh i just played this game like a week ago holy crap 058 you can not harm me game i played doki doki literature club 1045 this has the same energy as the dialogue chain right before sayoris death in doki doki i l o v e this video thank you sean man jack im honestly stunned every single time you have something to say at the end of such videos i love that you care so much and i hate that you even have to worry about pleasing the overall vocal minority here by not uploading enough or not sharing enough of your personal life and while i love the old nostalgic image of jack from 2013 in the cabin making loud happy wheels videos as anyone else do you know what i like even more you being happy and growing as a person and taking us all with you with your experiences and advice and id very much like to believe that a lot of the people here arent here just for the gameplay or because you have a lot of subs theyre here for you because you genuinely care to give something back to the world with us here to listen and to support each other i must admit i dont watch all of your videos lately mostly because of lack of time but i know you care about us and ill always watch such longer selfreflective journeys youre wheres your green hair i relate to this gay rights those very last words were something i truly needed to hear thank you those last seconds really were tear jerkers oh i downloaded this a while ago and im glad it is getting the recognition it deserves its so good and the art style is amazing i think you cant go through life without feeling like this not to be rude but when did sean and singe break up like is she alright i wish i could give you a hug through the sreen of my computer i didnt even realised i needed to hear this i didnt want to acknowledge that things werent right lately but listening to this tears started streaming down my face and couldnt stop them my family or friends dont know when theres something wrong with me becasue i never show it since i dont want to make a big deal out of it so i dont have anyone telling me this kind of things so thank you im so glad i decided to watch this video today man i was just talking to the mother of a friend who committed suicide back in january and we were talking about some of the signs that she missed and how some of us could have reached out more it hurts man cherish those around you and let them know that you cherish them you never know man irrelevant but did anyone hear shiloh losing interest in the background youtube is dying anyways id rather see a dead channel than a miserable person people in the community are great but it is easy to forget that what is in the machine are people whatever the future holds im sure there are others here that will support eachother whenever reasonably possible unless you want to become like atlas put your facemask on and then help others i felt this im the kind of person that no matter what in my life im doing i will always be the friend that helps i will b there as a shoulder to cry on someone to vent to i know how this feels im getting a tattoo of a semicolon to represent authors ending a sentence but choosing to keep it going when im having a hard time i can look at it and have the strength to keep pushing keep going edit my message box is always open if anyone needs a friend how did i not notice the scissors and blood on the menu page until after the second ending sometimes you people complain at people to complain or theyre jealous when some puts a negative comment on your videos its because as a guy whos been watching the channel for years you became less of the super energetic gamer you were but you became more of a person its easier to feel like youre not just entertainment yes maybe youre getting less views but its more genuine this way this made me tear up this is probably one of the videos of yours that i have related to the most thank you thank you thank you this hits all my feels ahhh i can relate so much and seeing jack close to crying oof 427 sees fall out boy minus andy and immediately gets happy ive been in foster care for 12 out of 17 year of my life i hoped everything would be solved when i got away from my abusive family i was so wrong im not close to my foster parents at all they always insult me and whenever somethings wrong they tell me to just get over it ive been diagnosed with depressionptsd social anxiety and an eating disorder ive been suicidal since i was 8 years old luckily i have really good friends i feel so exhausted every day i sleep most of the time after year 11 in school started everything got so much worse and i dont know what to do anymore i feel so alone even though im not and dont worry im not considering doing anything im just exhausted and sad all the time it feels to have depression i have myself but to everybody that does have depression keep fighting move on someone cares even though you may not know them anyone else with anxiety and depression forcing yourself to watch this all the way through so you know you arent alone and to hear whatever messages jack says throughout the video to give you hope i needed to so so much thank you jack i need to cry but my foundation was 48 hairs not green yet honey goth girlfirend does she have big titty without the high fivewhy sometimes some of the happiest people are the most depressed i genuinely started crying when listening to you thats me right now and 2017 was the worst year for me i had lived with on going nerve damage and my mom died of als now its worsened to the point that im bedridden and in excruciating pain every day if it wasnt for my children and my family i dont know if i would have the strength to go on thank you for speaking up about this important issue hello roommate dont go sayori on us plez no matter what you do how long your videos are how you feel how often you upload we will always love you and appricate you we will always come back to you no matter what you do jack i learned more about myself when i watch this video i noticed that i had those traits and that if i didnt get a therapist then who knows what could have happened to me and you getting help saved your life there could have been no jacksepticeye if you wouldnt of got a therapist or got help and you made me think a lot today and i will be more selfaware thanks jack jackwhats your favorite meme meyes i didnt realize how much i needed this until now because ive constantly been stuck in this constant loop of what i think may was going through and at times i felt so low that i attempted suicide several times a week i always just brushed it off as being tired when people asked me if i was fine and ive gotten a little better at talking to people about it but the way ive been raised these feelings are seen as wrong and a cry for attention in my family so its still really hard for me to open up about my struggles this has shown me that its ok to not be entirely ok but i still need to talk about it and not keep it bottled up inside isnt junji ito the horror manga artist who legit makes the most creepiest stuff around leaving a like for dealing with hard topics will play the video on mute for minutes and views but wont watch it anytime soon keep up the great work senjack than you this helped me a lot i love your videos ive been watching them my whole life and i think your an amazing human your message was so touching it really hit home for me even though my mom also has depression it seems she doesnt understand how mine works everything just resonated with me i think i needed and appreciated all of that thank you as the parent of a young adult who was recently placed on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds this games message hits in me in the feels thank you to the creator of this amazing game and thank you jack for playing this i think i wach youtube because everyday is the same and youtube is always coming up with new content some good some bad its ok sean im not a youtuber i dont even have much social media but i do feel as if i understand to an extent what you felt 2017 was a shity year for me too and i feel like i have gotten a lot better i really agree with what you said there is always a way out because no matter what theres always something youll enjoy something you can achieve something you can fill your life with if anyone else thats going through something sees this i just want you to know that you are most certainly definitely not alone there are always people who will care there are good people who want you to be happy there are people who will genuinely love and cherish you i went through moments very similar to this game and please trust me this

entire video is so beautiful this hit home again two years ago was the darkest time in my life and recently ive been slipping back into my depression i have been off all my medication for 3 months and feeling fantastic then my fur baby needed an appointment with the vet that she wont come back from im still in a much better place now but its amazing how such little things can send you back to were you were you saved me then and you have saved me now i wont say never change i like to say keep changing we love you i was so suprised when i saw she was inspired by my mans junji ito everyone who clicked dis video wants to see jack with green hair bruh i hella cried smhhhhh its that pride kickin in i think we know you care jack you dont need to give us that kind of attention for us to know that just be you do your thing on your chanel and thats all we could ever want i was starting to tear up somewhere in the middle but i bursted out laughing when she said no you uno reverse card its very hard to work all day and get home just to find clothes to wash and dishes to do and when you notice its time to sleep and repeat i find it very hard to have time to do things for myself and i really really want to but there is no time thank you so much for saying what you did in the end of this its so important to realize how you never see all of someone inside and out so much love for you your videos help a lot for a lot of people in this way too so thank you i felt what you said it was all really good edit and the social media bit its such a new thing that it seems so real but we can all live without it basing your worth or value to others on that can be really detrimental social media sure can be fun sometimes but being aware of the toxicity is important and knowing you are doing all you can and what you want to do vs what everyone else shows to the world i was trying really hard to keep from crying on his second run but when he went into the bathroom and saw her and she apologized and then hugged i couldnt all the tears tot i feel like it may be a bit rude to say but i relate to may a lot and when i was really low in the past what i wanted most was for someone to just hug me but i didnt have anyone irl to hug or hang out with my social anxiety always got the better of me when it came to social interaction of course so i didnt have any friends during then i am so grateful that this video was posted and that this beautiful wok of art was created im incredibly grateful that i got to experience this and just listen to jack ramble on about such important things honestly hes so wise i used to work with kids who were suicidal and had selfharm habits when i was in high school my best friend used to cut herself so i know the difficulties surrounding this if you ever feel like life is too much to handle please step back and breathe call someone you trust reach out for help many people think that reaching out for help is a sign of weakness it is a sign of strength its showing that you are aware that you need help thats awesome as for self harming i truly understand why people do it and how it seems to help but let me tell you the scars that come with it are not worth it dont take it out on your body get something to take your frustrations out on get a punching bag its very therapeutic draw on the area you want to hurt youll eventually learn to stop and if you slip up once in a while thats okay youre still loved if anyone needs help or someone to talk to reach out to me you are loved you are worth it youre stronger than you know there isnt much to say except we are human and afraid whether its burying it deep within ourselves or lashing out viciously at others we need to gather courage to help ourselves being mentally physically and emotionally abused by my mother for most of my life i can say im only one lucky person thats managed to stay strong and find people to help and love me enough to keep me from making an unfixable mistake i only hope others in these dark corridors in life find their strength to walk into daylight and know they are loved and needed also as a way to bring some laughter you think near 30 is mindblowing im 32 and still wondering when i got here from being 18 when may started talking about her depression i deeply related dang it i might be depressed hey sean i really just want to say thank you i just sobbed on my couch for half hour now because you have made me feel so important im going through a lot right now mainly family and it has tore me apart i have been thinking deep and dark and its not helping im slowly getting professional help butits very slow im so glad i watched thisthank you so so so much sean i feel way better about myself thank you again sean thank you i love you so much you helped me to get out of depression is this english the content i love this makes me tear up gosh thank you sean jack thank you for playing theses kinds of games you are being such a big help to those who are suffering someone that i knew just recently passed away from suicide its such a sudden and awful thing to hear i wish this person could have gotten the help they needed thanks for being a voice to this matter youre amazing jack i dont want to die because i know people care about me and i dont want to hurt them but i just want to stop existing because i cannot live with myself and i dont want to hurt me because i know thats going to hurt others man for when the scene went to the note on the door my heart instantly sank cause of when i heard with what happened to my gf man this got me good random side note that has nothing to do with the video sean do you prefer sparkling or still water when youve yeed your last haw beginning of video i know i shouldnt bring this up right now but wheres the green hair jackaboy final few minutes of the video really got to me womp womp where dat green hair at i know he doesnt have it yet where is the green hair keep doing what youre doing for yourself bro sean the best you tubernon professional therapist that ever lived that hype moment when youve played the game before the lets player so you already know whats up i cried and i dont even know why this may seem out of place but when jack talked about people being mad that hes not as active as before it really made me upset because i love that hes taking time for himself and i feel like thats why his channel has lasted so long to jacksepticeye i love your channel because you take care of yourself and every video is lively thank you i actually started crying reading these comments so many people want to help people like me but it doesnt matter i will always feel alone last year was a rough time for me i was going through bad thoughts but jacks videos helped me and made me feel better thanks jack i cried for the first time in years because of this i lost all my emotions because of all the things i went trough suicidal thoughts depression i am so thankfull thx there are dlcs on south park the fractured but whole i really wanna download this game to see if theres a way to help may and get the date i dont like the message that you have to wholly resign from personal happiness to help friends this video hit very close to home every part of it to put it simply i am may depression is the worst thing that could happen to a person self harm may seem stupid but when you are depressed you dont think right thats what makes you start then it becomes like a drug without going into details as to why because it would make this way to long for anyone to want to read i used to self harm its like a drug it makes you feel good for a very short amount of time like 1530 seconds at the very most but does so many other bad things that to think it is worth it it like saying its worth cutting off your own arms and legs for attention so much messed up shit took me to that point to put it very short my parents hated each other dad had a drinking issue my parents both acting like 5 year olds in an argument all the time messed up living situation doing bad at school and with very little money that was all ages 410 at ages 1013 the following was added in i di ahh the shiloh dynasty music in the background jack dont always be on the internet me okay ill go and stop watching thank you anyone feel a little too much for some of jacks videos just me alright it never seemed like you dont care you grew and youre helping us grow with you this felt too real uno reverse im watching this video from hospital its my second suicide attempt in 8 days thanks for making me smile jack my depression rate to 0 after watching this 3341 aww jack getting tearyeyed you can either go on a date or save your best mate your words were needed thank you youll never understand how much this meant u wont see this but i dont know how to defend myself because for my whole life people have been making fun of me and now everyone just thinks im not mean person because i just dont know what to do when something happens like that i say something rude back when i dont mean it i just overreact when something happens i started watching your videos when i was 14 it was my first year of high school i had no friends i had a bad home life but every time i watched your videos i felt like i was watching a friend play video games i would rush home from school to watch your newest video and just forget about all of the things going on in my life slowly you grew to be one of the most influential remodels in my life someone that i looked up to i admired your work ethic your kind nature and how positive you are i wanted to be just like you and as the years went by i tried to be more like you kind understanding and hard working by 2017 i was having a very hard time my depression was at an all time low and i felt like my whole world was crashing down on me i still dont have a great life but 5 years later i still watch your content now i appreciate you more than ever i love the bubbly games that can take my mind off anything and just make me laugh for 20 min but its videos like these that i felt you were going to cry i was gonna i am annoying since i have adhd which makes me hyper active and it doesnt really help me with getting friends so i go online to speak with people with the same condition i talk more than i should and i move on from subject to subject and it hurts most of my friendships right now i think im losing my best friend maybe i dont really know but we dont talk much except for online but i feel like i should tell you i tried to cut today and almost got caught i tried to walk away from the movie me my mom and stepdad was watching but i couldnt hurt them and i cant imagine how sad they would be if i died and my friends to but also i think some will wonder where i would be since nobody really cares about me i could imagine a happy life without me but only without me without you so many people would be sad and horrified if you died some may get depressed because they would feel lonely so what im trying to say is sorry for everything yo jack u should check out the isle its a early access dino game hey australians pinch punch the first of the month no returns i hate to watch these type of videos since ive been going through things such as depression but i absuatly love to watch thembecause they show me theres hope and that im not aloneim getting emotional just writing this oof but on a happier note i get to smile everyday because your here to make me and so many others happyok you can continue through the comments thanks sean this video really hit home being 19 almost 20 losing my at 8 then my mom at 12 me and my siblings went through foster homes they got adopted by a family that didnt like me so i was adopted by a family who cared about me now im happy and engaged to a beautiful young woman who loves me for me id like to say it again thank you so much sean the viking of seas and youtube this girls art is so beutiful shit i didnt know i needed a good cry today this game and him talking just reminded me of how shitty my mindset was a few years ago ive come so far by just trying to get through it so hey if youre going through some shitty stuff itll be okay i know i wouldve rolled my eyes at that a few years ago but its true yeah youll still have some ups and downs but focus on the good parts and remember no matter what you think you are loved 3 shit time to start crying again just made a youtube channel thanks to you so i made 1 too please sub its called kittys king i have i sub if you can sub with your subs to that will be great this helped so much there hasnt been a reading comments vid in a long ass time jesus christ im uh very emotional atm after 30 minutes i couldnt stop crying i wish somebody would help me the way jack helped may lol i have a dog so i cant kill myself anymore man i really want a hug too i totally agree with you youtubers definitely should open up to their audience not about everything of course and only when they feel comfortable doing so but they should i dont want want to speak ill of etika but he used to do that he used to open up to his audience and in doing so became stronger but with his past livestreams he didnt really do that its probably because all the spotlight was on him and most of the stuff he wanted to keep to himself were put out in the open he had barely anything for himself when i saw the thumbnails on my phone i also had an out of body experience i couldnt believe it i still cant one of the things that ive learned from youtube is that with every video that you watch you learn something from it even subconsciously from etikas stream vids ive learned to be more open with myself and to other people but theyve also enforced the fact that a person can look really happy on the outside but have so many demons yelling an a few years ago i would have been annoyed or dissappointed with him disconnecting with his audience since i watched him every day i wouldnt have understood it but since then i moved and met a lot of new people new perspectives on life i remember a friend of mine who my other friends were closer to than me one time he was talking about something and briefly mentioned his girlfriend and we were confused because we thought he was single he was a very open person but seemed to have a side on him he didnt want to share he had that girlfriend for about a year and we didnt know about it and i really respect him for him it was a private thing and i think just like you said its important to keep things to yourself sometimes aww sir thank you for putting this video up its especially helpful for people who have been where you were or are currently there aww youre still a young thing everyone every day you wake up is a victory and every hug is worth it i wasnt expecting a game thank you so much for this you are connected to us and we know you care and we love you for everything that you do wow this video really hit mei dont have anyone who cares this much about melately ive been sadlonely and bored i always tell myself i can do this on my own but i dont think i cani really need a friend like her i love you jack and i love you guys so much this community has helped me so much and i try to do my best at being happy there are so many times i feel like a disapointment or i dont know what to do with my life but jacks videos help me to get bettereveryone being nice in the comments i dont know where i would be now without you guys so thank you i hope i can find out my life and i also hope that for you guys love you guys sooooo much i want to thank you for what you said in this video you said a lot of things i didnt realize i needed to hear so thank you jack no im talking to wrong person shawn i want u to take a break from youtube and thanks u really helped me im still trying to figure myself out but this really did help i hope u will take my and ur own advice and take a break from us i can wait and anyone that cares for u can wait to so go ahead and take s break ill wait a week for ur next video bye have a good day i love these types of videos so much especially from sen jack i ready lick thes widios plz do more if anyone happens to read this just know that youre loved you dont have to do this alone even if it ends your pain it starts a whole wave for someone else you arent by yourself in this world we are merely 1 person in a world of 7 billion you certainly arent alone just talk to someone were here for you i want to give sean a big hug not gonna lie im kinda glad you had that dark time cause now you know the signs like uh oh this is what happened last time i meed to take a step back before it gets worse and its kinda comforting as someone whos dealt with something similar someone i look up to that we felt the pain and if you fought it i can fight it too im glad youre here sen youve helped millions millions of people even just some of your smacc laugh makes me happy cause theres other people who understand and people come together just for some silly joke that is what makes me happy that i have a few friends because they noticed my jse hat and we have instantly something in common these friends helped me get through so much and its all because you had this joke that someone else understood btw i want a hoodie with the multicolored laugh on it in your handwriting lmao i really needed that long talk at the end thanks sean all jokes aside i would try and improve on myself from a year ago but i actually cant remember anything jack if you offed yourself i would cry for ever while binging your old vids thinking of you i dont care if anyone reads this but have a good day and thank you jack first time i played this i knew i had to protect mays smile jack the therapist thank you man you helped me today i had a problem i could not solve but you gave me the strength to face it tomorrow im not going threw anything that would make me want to die but this video really hit me 810 is the back ground music losing interest byshiloh or is it just me jack where is the drum videos who else hears the shiloh dynasty music the thumbnail looks soo familiar but i have no idea why i just want to say i belive you are an amazing person who uses the power they have to influence the world to do things like this really great things that inspire people i remember about a year ago i started really watching your videos it was on my birthday and i was very down in the dumps because i was alone all day but then i stumbled upon one of your videos and when i was watching i didnt feel so alone so thank you thank you for being so real more outer wilds please forgive me if im wrong but i think that flag behind the pride flag is trans flag not 100 sure but i think it is edit or the lesbian flag is it bad that this relates to my depression times and yeah i have depression i will always support you sean be however you want the thing in that game that hit me is when may said she did kinda seriously consider suicide but shed stop herself when the thought of the pain it would cause others entered her mind i went through the same thing im only just now realizing how cliche my experiences sound i was stuck in a cycle of feeling anxious and then feeling guilty crying myself to sleep and repeat i could see how much my anxiety issues were affecting my familys mental health and i wanted to not exist anymore i didnt want to feel pain or die i just wanted to be forgotten like i never existed in the first place and just vanish thats what i wanted but that obviously could never happen so i started considering suicide i would look at the bathroom the knife drawer and wonder if i could do it and if i should it seemed like everyone would be so much better off without me but i knew that everyone didnt think that way and that they were vulnerable like me if i did something they would to so id jack ive been through this and still sometimes am about tear ago my world broke into pieces when my dad died and ever since some times i have these days and that day after i stoped crying my sister asked me if i wanted to go on a ride it said it helps me think then she noticed i was watching you and she said she asked if thats how i thought and be peaceful and i just nodded and i really understand this game and may because may used to me sean is the only guy i know that can dedicate 25 of a video to nothing but unfiltered kindness play happy wheels as soon as i saw this thumbnail and title i knew i was going to like this and the warning made me think of doki doki 2301 wow i feel like everyone here can relate thankfully i never have suicidal thoughts i count myself as a very mentally strong person but i know not many people feel the same sen all i need to know is that youre a good person you are you dont need to share what makes you good we know it by now now how did this letsplay turn into jack curing my mental issues with his monologue ive gone through dark days and it seems like there is no way out i have a great circle of friends who love and care about me but on those specific days my mind is so toxic it makes me believe that im worthless to them and they wouldnt care if i existed thank you sean for showing us your side and how even people we think are perfect and look like they have the best life ever are still going through dark times like every one else we all love you so much and to how ever reads this i love you to the bottom of my heart why can i relate so much to this i think i have issues that intro made me sade you can do better i just want to say im not a major commenter or subscriber or anything but ive seen a lot of your content and can say i like you how you are now you seemed to have matured a lot and while i dont necessarily believe or agree with everything you sayfeelthink you are still a good man and i like how you have begun to focus on yourself while still making videos you may not see this but as a human who is naturally depressed was suicidal at one point and was pulled back i can definitely say that even the smallest things can be devastating to a persons mental well being and that doesnt make them weak at all i thank you for opening up and talking about this some as everyday is still a grind for me but i fortunately have a wife and a small group of friends who i can lean on when i just want to collapse im glad to hear you are still making strides in your own life and i wish you the best thanks sen your really great and this video helped a lot and we all appreciate you wheres green hair wheres green hair wheres green hair wheres green hair wheres green hair wheres green hair wheres green hair i dont know what to do with my life i am listening ed sheeran happier wow this is very inspiring game its a good message to a lot of people whos going through this considering what just happened recently with etika this makes me pretty sad rip etika hey jack you will problably never see this but i just wana say that you learned me english and got me into looking at diffrent youtubers and i have been looking at your vids since 2 mil and you make my day every day but i have adhd and i only have some friends but when i watch your videos i forget about that stuff and your videos always make me smile this video meant so much to me especially coming from a youtuber ive watched from the very start i havent had major suicidal thoughts but through my life i had friends that i have helped i just wanted to point this out because how serious and real this is and how similar it is to real life thank you jack thanks jack for the motivation means a lot love uuuuu i dont care what haters say i appreciate it when youre open honest chill and real there are plenty of fake channels full of fake people all over youtube dont be one of them i cant watch old jacksepticeye i enjoy happy mature sen thanks for being delightfully you and dont dye your hair green again unless you really want to you have nothing to prove to anyone much love wow thats some really deep stuff trying to help my friends through rough times is something i enjoy and is often how i make new friends i try to find people who need light in the darkness and hold out a lantern for them as i am thinking about this it makes me consider wanting to be a psychiatrist or something similar and help be a light for lots of people it makes me happy to try and help other people something i want everyone to know is be kind you never know what a person is going through and they may need a light to help them get through go everyone and be light for someone who needs it the only time i hurt myself is when i bite my are and thats only when i get frustrated thank you okay i clicked thinking oh green hair and no green hair i say yellow hair xd wait a minute i saw this at newgrounds hey jack i know this is probably going to get lost in the comments but i really love your outer wilds series i know youd like to play other games to bring variety to the channel and also since you play what you want rather than what other people want i admire that but if you ever feel like you dont know what to record then id love to see you play some more outer wilds it seems like such a great game and since i cant afford to get it for myself its really fun to feel like im playing it through your videos anyway like i said before you probably wont read this but if you do id appreciate it a lot if you played outer wilds more i love what you do for people and communities and i cant wait for the chance to meet you at a convention if i ever get lucky enough bye 3 amazing video thank you for the talk you dont even know how badly i needed this i honestly believe that you would make a better therapist than my own like the way that you phrase things and the way you say that everything will be okay makes me actually believe it more than i previously did thank you for talking about this thank you i hope youre doing better try not to worry about what people want you to bestay be what makes you comfortable be yourself and also im glad you can live of what youre doing you deserve it so much youre constantly helping me with these kinds of video and i know thats helping a lots of people but all we can do is watch your videos and virtually interact with you and i would like to be able to do more in return for you but all i can do is keep supporting you and say truly deeply thank you idk if im making sense but i tried xd life is kind of boring we love you sen thats all we can do but we all love you ive been with the channel since i started high school and ieft two weeks ago i loved too see this channel grow and you sean to grow into this amazing person we all see today youve inspired me so much to grow and be positive and focuse on myself and work on myself thank you for everything x jack your problems are not trivial because they are your problems that means that they are personal and mean something to you do yourself a favor and dont add guilt to your concerns because there are people that have it so much harder than me its a guilt trap that has harmed many public figures thanks for sharing this with us and god bless sean i recently took my first step to open up and i try get professional help recently is really just 3 days ago but i took this step for because of my friends and not because i searched for it i always feel tired dont want to do anything because i dont know deep down i always want to do

your in the dark always remember that u can go to someone and they will understand and care i just want to hug you allll the memes the pride flags this game spoke to me on a personal level thank you can we take a minute to appreciate that jack referenced a sarah schauers vine all i have to say is that in 2018 you saved my life quite literally thank you this many people want you too play happy wheels again girl looking up so he broke up with me heh girl 2 why are you looking up girl i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars i didnt expect watching this would get me thinking about it as hard as i did when i first saw that there was a character with the same name as me may i didnt expect much out of it but in the second ending i felt emotionally connected to may i can say that ive felt almost the same as her and weve been through almost the same experience i want to be a writer but my parents dont think itll make me money and feeling alone and sad constantly ive never related to a character so much this really made me realize im not the only person feeling this way all your videos have made me happy lately and throughout the years but this video really made me realize that i can talk to people about how i feel this really made me feel better so thank you sen this made me feel so much better also i found this funny because tomorrows actually my birthday sean im no homo but i love you thank you for everything you have done i have felt like that a lot and you have helped me with you videos soo i just wanted to say thank you and for everyone if you are feeling like this you can get through this and you are loved by many the intro scared me because i havent heard it in awhile as someone who has battled depression and anxiety for years this hits so close i was at my lowest last year and if my mom haddent dragged me to a counsler i wouldnt be here right now getting the help that i needed is the best thing that ever happend to my to the point where im trying to reach my dream of being an artist get the help guys it is so worth it i wanna watch this but dont wanna get triggered rn hell just seeing the word suicide on the warning screen was kinda hard for me to process so guess i wont watch this one but ill save this video for maybe when i get more weed i can probably get through if i was high i guess my life is nmanegative mental attude this im really worried about one friend who constantly talks about suicide says they never feel anything and has a history of bulimia that i had no idea about until last week i feel like this game is my real life but i keep saying the wrong thing its hell im in constant fear because i know that theyre alone right now and every part of me wants to drop everything im doing and make sure that theyre okay but i want to be around them because i like them not because i feel guilty or that theyre unsafe by themselves ive had family members use suicide as a rash hurtful way to get attention and its made me cut off myself from them and most people but my friend isnt rash or attention seeking theyre in pain and its not something i know how to deal with i just know i cant lose them and i dont want it to be too late thats was the most important and beautiful video ive ever seen thank you for saying thats things thats mean a lot that song in the backgroundik it its shilo dynastys song losing interest its a really beautiful song all hisher song are ps i had to use hisher cause idk what they want to be called listen man you are an amazing person and you have helped me through so much and i want you to know that you deserve the world over the past 2 years of watching your channel i have learned that i matter i thought for i long time that i dont and that really made me depressed i am so happy now that i chose to watch your videos they helped me so much and im so thankful for that i love your energy and how positive you are even in the worst times this community is so supportive and loving of you anyway thank you so much jack you are a hero you should play infamous second son again when u talked about how u felt and then that we all deserve achieving our goals i cried i played this about a week ago saying damn jack should play this soon about a week later i check my phone oh shit its a video foundation is only 29 my gf spent like 40 on some freaking eyeliner also i wish i let the game get to the sad part before i made this comment cuz now i feel bad so he broke up with me why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 48 thanks san i really needed this demisexual lesbian right here being gay is hard its hard to find love but we will always find it me and my girlfriend met when we were in 5th or 6th grade in an after school art class at first we never talked and i thought she was really weird but then in 8th grade we met again i didnt recognize her at first but then we started to become really close friends and then on december 10th of 2018 i told her that i loved her right in the middle of our lunch hour ever since then weve been together no one in our family knows about our relationship yet were scared but i love her and i would do anything for her and even my friends ive lost two online friends a few years back and i almost lost one of close friends a few days ago this game makes me think of so many things at once and i low key love it but hate everything because of it and i am now confused but while this game unnerves me it makes me feel really good somehow well at least the last ending anyway just kinda gives hope maybe im not sure what do i know but i like it thank you for the amazing content as always jack thank you for your message at the end amazing commentary and sweet heart and thoughts all together it helps this really hit home no it destroyed home this game is so accurate i used to be depressed until i started gacha i loved and now it leaded to me starting a youtube channel now im happy ahhh i dont know if i can stand watching this video i played this game a few weeks ago and i cried so so much thank you for playing this game and bringing attention to it seans lectures are the best how can i like this video a million times i related so much to what you said the thinking of suicide a lot but not on the verge really hit close to home im being better now and being happier than ever im only 18 but i hope the years to come will be better i know they have to be cause i fought so hard these 13 years or so school sucked for me until high school and those three years have also been tough but with much self reflection and talking about my feelings im becoming better some days are harder but those days are 100x still better than the lighter days 10 years ago and that is something im proud of to have managed watching seans video is enough for me to be honest your words were like an angelic creature reaching for my dusty heart polishing it and showing me a glimpse of a life in perfect harmony with my surroundings and myself giving me perspective and hope helping me to see more clearly in this society filled with information and facts sparkling and blinking on various media showing me how to handle criticism but most importantly paving me the way to realise that there are other people going through hard times and that i can start to trust people and confide into them i am really thankful for this video and your monologue and i really enjoy reading through the comment section here lets make our best ive been in mays shoes and im here to tell you im glad i had a friend to help me without her i wouldnt be here i speak for everyone when i say thanks for the heartfelt talk jack man the game is deep the things i do is to stop my depression and worrying is to try and accomplish the thing that is causing my problem and i try as hard as possible to find the solution and it turns out it works when i because their is always a solution to it ive been waiting for you to make this vid fantasy doing something by candelight is so romanticidillic candle light in real life fucking how do i stop flickering you fuck just give me light here so i can fuck i blew it out ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh srry i scream when i dont want to cry heh mays story about being the golden child really hit hard it happens a lot and pretty much every time i meet someone else who used to be part of some sort of gifted program they almost always feel the same programs like that just kind of tell you youre special over and over again because youre naturally smart you dont need to put in any effort youre always gonna get an a and than that first c hits and than that f and your first thought isnt crap i need to work harder because working hard to get good things isnt a natural thing for you so you give up its comforting knowing that other people feel the exact same way i feel i thought i was being dramatic for feeling so tired constantly lately ive been feeling angryannoyedfrustrated for no reason at all ily all and i hope all of your days are great from now on xxxx who else cried hearing you say those things reminds me of my own depression caused by confusion and other personal experiences and i wanted to tell you that you were one of the few people who made me feel safe to ask for help you feel like a real person a real voice and it made me feel like someone cared it took me a long time to feel okay again and you made that time a lot easier idc if you dont see but its important to tell you thank you for everything so i love you and everything you do god bless you i think something that people do a lot when it comes to this topic is constantly remind you of the people in your life who will be sad but id hate that id feel like the blame was being put on me and feel even more like a problem just focus on them because its about them not their family or friends i used to be depressed until i started a gacha channel thank you for talking about these things im also depressed and still am i have no friends or anyone to talk to at all im afraid to talk to anyone cause everyone i know dosent like me for who i am im saying this in a comment cause non of you know me pls notice this comment jack i hope you read this when i lost my grandfather i went to your channel because you make me laugh the first 2 days i thought of ending it you never had to put everything out i dont care if you keep your personal life to yourself i just want the jack that you want out 531 does the room mate have one brown eye and one red eye this game and this speech is soooo on time and on point last 2 years ive experienced by far the lowest of my life both of my grandma passed away within 11 daysone of them was even passed away right after my birthdayi lost my motivation for everythingwork friends hobbies literally everything but those bills wont wait for me so all my expired bills eventually came to my front door and i have to work for it i hardly keep up to it and ive crashed a few timesand i couldnt find anyone that i can talk to recently i lost my job toomy parents have already helped me twicei dont have the courage to ask another help next bills is within days onlythe thought of ending it all happens few times a dayi am really lost and dont know what to doi really thought about a jump a cut a bottle of pills can end this misery and then i watched this video im still lost but i wont do anything stupidi may still think about thatbut o oh my i just played this last week saw it in a yuri group god dammit how can people meme this beautiful but yet sad video 0050 well fuck i geuss i cant watch i love the way text box colour is used before you play your text box is black but afterwards it is white like youve been enlightened or like the blizzard and as sean pointed out before mays text box was red but after the months of help it was grey to show recovery thank you jack just thank you just because you have dark times in your life and feel overwhelmed and helpless doesnt mean you should bare the pain alone although it may not feel like it sometimes just remember you are loved if anybody needs a friend to talk to my instagram is heyitssadie i have been through multiple things in life that i can relate to you and help with can someone spoil me how bad the self harm and suicide mentions are bc i really want to watch it but im afraid itll trigger me to much this really hit hard but these types of games and videos really help people so much and to know that theyre not alone and to never give up hey everyone as a person who has played this game i really enjoyed watching you play it and how your choices were different to mine at the time this video came out i am currently in a relationship with a girl who cuts herself and is suicideal upon finding this game i showed it to her and played it with her saying oh dont pick that one and stuff like that when we reached the end we got the hope ending and i said to her that its never too late so i want to thank you jack and everyone love ya jackaboy thanks for the help these types of long videos where jack discusses hard things and real life are my absolute favorite although i watch and love his content i love this content to get to know him as a person sean i dont know what happened in 2017 but i can see the pain in your eyes and its really upsetting im so glad that it seems like youre in a better place and found people and resources that support you and love you i love you and im here to support you even if i dont personally know you hugs you do you sean i know you love and care about your community but youre your own person and you need to do whats right for yourself i totally understand keeping more things for yourself because you want to live for you ive been here for several years and i have continued to love and support your content you are a wonderful human being love you and this community buddy i need to cry but my foundation was fortyeight dollars i love these videos were he gets more serious than other videos definetly helped me through tough times the music you chose had vocals sampled from shiloh dynasty i wanna know where i can listen to the music i find it interesting that sean bounces his leg to stop himself from crying you can tell by the chair because i used to have this bad habit of digging my nails into my leg or scratching at old scars or biting my nails until my fingers bled i dont do it anymore because from the help of my granny and my wonderful girlfriend i have started to slowly get better my point to this was that i wonder if sean had any bad habits before he started bouncing his leg but im glad hes getting better and has evelyn is anyone else a little disappointed that he started the video with no top of the mornin slap im really glad you opened up about your own mental health sean youre just such a wonderful person who deserves the absolute best and im so happy you care about mental health and positive thinking i could honestly listen to you talk about this stuff for hours mental health is really important to me and you talking about it makes me really hopeful for the future thanks sean this video made me cry so much ive honestly never been depressed just sad and mad ive learned to take out my sadness by playing games and looking toward the future its the 3rd time ive watched this video and im still crying thank you sean thank you for making this video jack watch smg4 it is funny sean calling himself cute you problery wont see this but its fine do whats best for you your not erelevent you have 6000 people who have commented and cared about you stay tough and stay strong every day is a new beging and every day is a new you so dont care what the haters say and concetrate on your own garlic gla oh garlic therapist this time around this is going to sound crazy but to every person reading this that feels an infillable void of boredom or find things that should be enjoyable to be dull or unsatisfying go for a walk depression isnt just a feeling of being sad its being constantly bored and not feeling any satisfaction when doing things you feel like you should enjoy ive been deppressed for a few years and to be honest im happy that i managed to find a way to not feel as bored as i used to i didnt start walking to use it as cure for my deppression as much as to help me with something else lets just say being less than 170m is not that fun when you live in the tallest country in the world and i read somewhere that moving would help with growing im 19 now some time left im not a proffessional ive not studied it but there is a hormone nicknamed the happinesshormone that is released when you move it could be doing sports it could be a simple walk around the block but just sen my sweet baby boi ive been there again and again if any of you ever need to talk im here we dont know eachother but thats okay im here i love you youre telling me i played this game before jack why am i treating this like a big deal these days you mean depression i dont think only youtubers lived that everyone has dealt with depression at least once i needed this ive actually been planning on doing it for a while because of a lot of stuff i know i shouldnt and i cant but stilli think about it thanks sean hugs man i wasnt sad until jack started talking about all of these stuff but after hearing him talk about suicide and bad memories all of my dark and suicidal memories clouded my head just watched gloom play this i love this game sending all my love to people that struggle i know how it feels you can get threw it im sorry for everyone who went through this sending virtual hug to be honest man i almost saw you cry in this video and it almost made me cry and youll always be my favorite youtuber oof i was tearing up during this video for 20 or 30 minutes i go through all that every day every negative thought i can conjure up keeps repeating in my head i struggle so much like many others that go through this seeing this reminds me to always to keep helping the friends i always care about great game good message that doesnt get talked about enough wish those help who need it and strength for those who give support positive thoughts good luck out there thanks dad you teach me so much and you inspire me ive seen other videos of you talking about this sort of stuff but this one in particular just poked at me a little when you said that one thing which ill keep to myself and its nothing drastic but i just wanted to say thank you for this grand reassurance youve embedded upon me today youll always have my support whether you change or not because hey change can be great sometimes and i think this you the you of today suits you quite well if i do say so myself what happens if your life was great a year ago but now its worse this year how can you fix that you know i go threw this everyday and its not easy there are days where i feel like im alone and i never have anyone to depend on with my problems and all i ever ask is help me and i cry and cry until my brain restarts and just calms down and it sucks i have my limits and the only things that makes me happy and or makes me smile is watching your videos and gg game grumps and it makes me smile every time the world is very scary place a big scary place and im scared and just know that im thankful and bless that i watch your videos to keep me going and give me the smiles so sean jack thank you you are so so so amazing sen i like the you from now because

saying what needs to be said out loud and this community is so supportive and warm and loving thank you all for being who you are lots of i go through this everyday and wish i had a friend like the character you are playing damn this game hit me hard af 1740 thx for the song inspo lol 3152 and no one came no one the character you play as in the game wait thats illegal thanks in nature when the mother predator makes a kill she eats first and only afterwards does her offspring because if she isnt strong and healthy to catch the next meal the offspring will die you are doing the same sean if you give it all to us without feeding yourself first it will tire you out which in the end will be a disaster to you and all who need you dont ever apologize for looking after yourself first thank you for sharing something so deep and personal you helped remind me thank you for that ill forever be grateful for taking my best friends advice and watching this channel on the regular my best friend savannah passed away from suicide in 2015 she was a huge fan of you and shes the one that lead me to become a fan thank you for using your platform to bring light to things like this thank you and thats why youre my favorite youtuber omg i love you so fucking much i need a hug oh my god this scared the crap out of me when may said that her mother never asked her about school because she did well but then her lack of effort became known there the whole time but only known later on by parents and her parents got mad at her for playing video games and not working this embodied me literally word for word except for the writing this is terrifying and i have no idea where my life is gonna end up im praying i dont end up in her situation heart pounded like crazy when i heard what she said sending love to anyone going through a hard time you will get through this because you are strong the adds this video is greetings really disturbs the mood sean please play sky children of the light when its released july 18th its a game by thatgamecompany who also made journey ive been playing it for a good while in its limited live release and its just amazing i would absolutely love to see your reaction of it 3828 jack rethinking his life choices this is such a great game im so glad you played it im happy now i didnt even have to go to a therapist again because jack said a lot of inspirational stuff around the end of the video can you play trove plz jack are you going to play kindergarten 2 as it is coming out july 30th i think everyone will enjoy it where is the wapushhhki i really just wanna hug and talk to my friends actually but my friends dont give a shit if im sad or thinking something thats so wrong for myself but my friends always think idc dude youre just sad but im not they know i cut they know what i do to myself but they dont care jack youre the only one that convinced me to be myself control and be atleast a little more happy about the littlest things happens when nothing can even make me smile thank you jack you literally saved me from myself treading water treading water in an ocean no land or ships in sight and you dont want to drown but youve been treading water for so long that sometimes you just want to stop you just want to sleep its passive rather than active i have friends that i love people i care about deeply but i knew that one day i wouldnt be able to tread water anymore then those friends gave me a life preserver something that broke through the cold and the tired and gave me something that would keep me afloat while i focused on something that wasnt treading water its the dumbest fucking thing on the planet and its the only thing thats really worked my sister and her boyfriend bribed me to come hang out on a work night an hour away with homemade funnel cake i always joked that i cant say no to funnel cake ever and they knew that and for some reason that was the one thing that anxietybrain and depressionbrain couldnt ruin they like having me around enough to offer just finished my make up while watching this video and started to cry there goes my 29 foundation after etika case i feel sad watching this thank you sean and to the person reading you are loved if you dont feel like it i love you this community loves you we care about you thank you sen for this video i was going through a depressive episode then i watched this and im motivated to do what i want to do in my life my family has been degrading me because im apart of the lgbt community and its difficult but this game and your message after that opened my eyes a lot more thank you 3 in a way im glad there is some distance between you and the community everyone needs that space and its impossible to really live if everything is going into this youtube community etc im confident that the people who really care and really matter will be understanding if you need a break or dont want to disclose something thats perfectly fine people arent going to suddenly start to abandon you by the thousands just because you need that space there are millions of people that care about you and there will always be people who say stupid crap as well its part of the career youve chosen i would rather get one video a month that you really enjoyed making and are super passionate about than a video everyday filled with fake enthusiasm with you hating the life youre living of course i love your content and love to watch it but i would rather you be content with where you are than being forced to satisfy the masses like you said at the end of the video oh i found this game on steam last month and have been playing it its such a beautiful game to the 381 people that have disliked why do you hate good things so is your name spelled shawn or sean this is maybe the best video ive seen by jack have a good day and life 4159 that is so true this vid was great and all and it was very heartwarming but when that hair gettin green boi hi sean big fan of your clips this video had touched my heart i help myself when im low is watching you and other youtubers thank you for your pma and your clips keep it up sean i am suicidal and depressed it feels nice to know people that some people are willing to talk to you and take time out of their lives just to talk about your feelings nice and true words if anyone needs someone to talk to i am here im a good listener and i wont speak if you dont want me to ill give you all of my social media info even my number if you want to get something off your chest the art is beautiful yall gotta know u can talk to me in comments or dms im heavily depressed but people tell me ive helped them and yes i have been diagnosed for depressionanxietisocial anxietiso just comment ma duded this game is so emotional and beautiful i love it and the speach he does at the end this game hit hard especially since i can really relate to may it was almost seem less that i was the way i was it was hidden and everyone missed the signs except one person who i talk totalking to professionals dont help and neither does the hospitals or medicine its tough to get through things but dont let anything get you down if you need some just ask to talk it can be a friend or anonymously and if you see someone drifting away that might not want to talk but its good to check in 3255 3300 whats he talking about you are very inspirational jack i didnt know a jacksepticeye video could be so therapeutic sen sometimes you make me cry but i like listening to your speaches but yeah i screw up stuff make people mad but i just want to hide away i dont know what to say but i just wanted to post something because this video means a lot so many parts of this video made me think i do this or i think this or i say this i just want to say thank you to sen and this community for everything dog im tired 247 so thank you for helping me through really dark times i know that doesnt make sense but we are all human we all go through the same things taking a break is truly helpful dont stay on your phones 247 its not healthy go outside even if its just staring into the sky its better then doing nothing i recently moved out of my parents place and likemy parents and even my siblings treated me like shit accusing me of stealing their medication and money hitting me mocking me and insulting me i still have my dad and my brother constantly yelling at me and insulting me in my own mind even though i am away from them physically i am not away from them mentally countless times i thought about ending my life just to make it stop but my boyfriend helps me calm down and he makes me really happy no one else does that for me he always says he wants to help me forget all the pain and suffering that i went through and he wants to help me feel happy all the time sean i needed this the video the concept of the game the 20 minute spiel the story you tell thank you im also handing out free cookies to everyone whos been affected by this video it hit home hard for me too like fucking full hurricane but its okay we all have one another and dont be afraid to reach out to someone even if their someone in the comments chances are they may understand and be able to help and youll also make a friend out of it if anyone wants to be friends after i deck those people who are saying jacks irrelevant and his channel is dying outside maccies ill buy you all happy meals and appreciate you and jack i love you you get the biggest mac you should react to hazbin hotel i think you would like it and the viewer would to we love you jack i appreciate you talking about this kind of stuff i can tell that you want to be here for us fans who are going through tough times i want you to know that your fans are here for you too you are an amazing person and it shows thank you hey sean if u need some time for yourself thats ok its okay not to be okay as someone who is fairly privileged people would tell me you have nothing to be sad about but you dont have to have a reason to be sad depression doesnt have a checklist before it affects somebody i used to self harm and i was very suicidal from 8th grade into sophomore year of high school there isnt an age requirement before you get depressed or dysthymia some days are better than others and some days are total struggles its okay to cry its okay to be a guy with depression its okay to be sad i didnt seek help and it almost killed me i wouldnt be here getting a tattoo or painting or going to college if i had ended my life you wont be miserable for ever youre irrelevent 22 million subcribers thank you please play more i realy feel dipressed some times and i hope my friend saw this comment so he would understand hes been there for me but he pushes of an cliff by saing mean stuff hed nice but sometimes mean so yeah hope you see this crimson i have asked for help but when youre a teen people just ignore your problems ive told people that im suicidal a lot and they often just go over it so here recently ive just wanted to die ive wanted to just hang myself or jump out of a window i have tried everything but it just doesnt help i just want help thats it i just want help but thats apparently impossible i wish i had some help or some attention i fortunately have music and horses to help but its not enough and to you sen i want to say you have helped me thanks i played this the other day and i knew exactly what was going to happen im being miserable i need to step back when i was rock bottom i hated it but i felt like i deserved all of it it fucked me up feeling i deserved all that was going on and making myself numb and worthless i decided to try for some reason just to see what would happened and i tried swimming again and i fell in love and two years later im so glad i just tried one little thing and i didnt give up and it brought me to tears to watch this because i remember feeling like that and how i changed and grew from then so thanks sean youre amazing all i can say is thanks i often feel the same way like i have to put on a happy face for my friends just in case theyre having a bad day but it can get to the point where im just always exhausted and i have had that moment recently where i had those dark thoughts and for the first time i almost meant them and that scared the crap out of me the fact that i was thinking those things at all much less actually believing them do i need to put this in a comment no but i kind of want to just to reiterate your point in saying that it happens to all of us and this discussion needs to be talked about to whatever extent you feel comfortable with i feel comfortable writing this down for the whole world to read if they so choose so thats what im doing because i feel better now im slowly coming out of my slump by talking thinking writing adjusting and theres nowhere to go but up if this comment means something to someone then im glad but if all i did make mysel i cant lie i had to pause and come back to this a few times because i was starting to cry or was crying jack can i just say you are one of my favourite youtubers ever i may not have been here since the very start but ive been watching you for years now and every time im sad annoyed angry i watch you i think i spend more time watching you than anything honestly and i like it and i cant imagine any other way of being happier when im watching you ok i just realized how cheezy that was lol i now kindle regret that posted that after reading the comment section and this video really did hit me hard we love you the way you are and thank you for toking to us your the best you can be love and so sorry for bad spelling i cant tell how much i appreciate this message ive recently had dark thoughts and i needed to hear this thank you sean quick edit note holy crap i have never gotten this many likes before thank you so much for all the supportive messages what an awesome community i think ppl need to ask themselves a question when theyre having dark thoughts ask yourself if you really just want to die or if you just want the way youre feeling to go away i just want to hug sean and everyone you human youre amazing and youre not alone we are here for you we know its tough lately dont worry we will push through together sending virtual hugs to everyone can you play apex legends season 2 when it comes out thank you whoever said seans channel is dying meet me behind mcdonalds for a brofist and a jack slap this is beautiful thank you this is an interesting time for this

the game is and id love to watch the video but triggering content isnt my strong suit hope all of yall enjoy it though videos like these hit me hard because last year was a tough one i had two failed relationships and lost my best friend i had no one to go to but i thought that i should be the person to be there for other people i know how it feels to think that its all over your life ends here i dont want other people to feel that its horrible actually horrible is an understatement i want to help anyone who feels this way i kept on going and my life seems better than its ever been thank you if anyone actually reads all of this i watched this and i feel close to the video and i want of the game thank you play sally face i thought you did a colab with lilypichu when are you going to dye your hair again when he vets to the apartment after that date i got ddlc doki doki literature club vibes from the music rip sayori thats beautiful i love it when i have the feeling that youtubers are evolving and adapting their content to how theyre changing thats authentic and genuine do what you love and take all the breaks you need 4235 so many other people seem like theyre doing so much more than you but theyre not man that really hit deep its funny how im so sad and depressed all the time but i tell my friends who feel the same way that itll get better i never know if im trying to convince them or myself it gets harder each and every day and i need to find help thankyou so much for addressing this issue in depth sean thanks jack hope youre doing well this hit me so hard because ive thought about suicide many times because i felt like nothing i did mattered and that i could never be what i want to bei still have these thoughts sometimes but i think that determination is the key to stop all these negative thoughts seanyou are such a wonderful person i think that you have saved many livesand that you will save a lot more of them with your words you motivate many people everyday and we know you care about usbut now its time that we do our part for you we love you man talk about a different version of ddlc doki doki literature club for those that havent seen the video i love life and my friends and family but sometimes its hard and thats fine your life is your own san and i hope if you ever need to get something off your chest you know we are here and that if you need something kept private then i hope we can be respectful enough to leave it be we love you fine just tired ive said that a million times damni feel that and it never means sleepy tired for me either i really appreciated seans eyes in this video i dont know why great video like always jack awww i love this it got so real and i love it and i think you have changed so much and so much for the better it is so awsome that you take time for yourself and its great you can sit and talk about it all now your words out of everyones got me hit me like a fucking freight train and let me tell you i needed it for a solid year its been rough and ive just felt like im stuck and nothings gonna change but hearing what youve said has really helped so much came for the game stayed for the support that parent stuff really hit home so many things to say to you and i dont know if youll hear them were here for you except the haters but you already said what needs to be said about them i will grow with you im sincerely glad that youre here i can relate positive on the outside for the most part you were trying to find what you loved and im at that stage right now i have my own barriers because of my trust issues ive thought about suicide to the same extent and hoping im done with that i now live by a simple lifestyle but i always try you made me cry with your talk alone you do you keep going therell always be someone to support you make it about you more if itll make you happy enjoy your own life so glad to hear youre living it for yourself more for both you and everyone else change is hard preach man preach probably just a bunch of bullshit probably not going to read the comment and i understand but if you do my main point is that you help me through hard ngl this game really rubs me the wrong way theres so many games like this getting attention recently as someone who had a problem with compulsively self harming in the past this aesthetic portrayal and simplification of mental illness is troublesome imo like the narrative of uwu hugs and talking will fix everything is just misguided at best and makes even the most popular mental illnesses depression and anxiety seem less serious than they are jack plz become a motivational speaker you really just spoke to me and gave me chills thank you for that i appreciate you soooo much song in back ground losing interest thank you my friend it truly means more then i can express to hear your words of not only understanding but encouragement ive struggled a lot of my life with these problems and its nice to know someone takes the time to show they care if anyone out there feels this way please know you are loved and you are never alone does anyone else hear shiloh in the background like the music losing interest couldnt find no better than this i swear girl if you leave just let me know so i wont look dumb i need to cry but my foundation cost 48 dollars im not gonna say an entire paragraph cuz im lazy n shite but anyway this vid and the the sean talk was something i really needed to keep in my mind and heart for a whileso umm thx sean and the fanbase to i suppose yall keep me up when all i want is to go down ok im out kinda contradicted myself so ima just go thx btw aal of u not that yall care i just wanted to say this yeah this really hits me i really one to be a youtuber but my parents think i washouts do something more profitable thanks for the stuff your doing jack cuz even when im sad you always cheer me up you rock can you shout me out ive been recording videos and you can maybe help me out have a good day were all here for you sen no matter what i cant even imagine how exhausting and hard it mustve been but im glad youre doing better now youre giving such a great message to your subscribers and the world i really wish for you to always be happy and satisfied with yourself youre doing great sweetie thank you for brightening all our days and spreading such a great positive energy even if it isnt through screaming and being hyper like the old you would ive been with the channel since 2015 and i have truly grown with you its been a journey and im happy i have you in my life as are so many people my puppies said they love you a lot 3 i know you probably wont see this jack but i just wanted to say that i am so glad that you have taken time for yourself and have reached out to people when you needed it im glad that you are happier now than you have been and personally i think it is very obvious you care about the community anyone that says otherwisei just dont know where they are getting that from with that said this video was really hard for me i have struggled with suicidal thoughts for most of my adult life ive been hospitalized twice and in and out of therapy it definitely made me cry but i feel the game and the video is important thank you for playing it and thank you for always spreading the word that mental health is important and that seeking help is okay anyone help me please the flags are actually me ive been in those shoes before it is hard but luckily there are people out there that do care and sometimes i still get sad and dark i just want others to be happy liked for jacks tangent and explaining of things not going to lie as recent ive felt depressed and dont want to do anything ive had thoughts in the past that still haunt to me this day thank you for everything youve done and keep up the good work god bless i better skip this video especially after hearing about the etika situation there is a big difference between being sad and tired for no reason and being sad and tired for a very good reason but just not knowing what that reason is at that moment usually there is a reason it just might take a little outside help to figure out what it is thank you sean you are always a sincere person and we all feel the same way about you that you are not alone because were by your side whatever difficult circumstances you are experiencing so we love you and may god bless you open the door its only been twenty minutes she might still be alive sending love in so much sadness wheres the green hair bro as someone who is always depressed and also suffers from anxiety i appreciate you putting this subject out there thank you and thank you as well angela jse your just a lifesaver to spend almost 20 minutes to help people rather to purly entertain people in a video it just truly makes u the greatest jack i need help do i hear x in the background thank you sen we love you and appreciate you thanks jack ur amazing and this game is amazing keep up the good work i think this is one of jacks most important videos whenever he finishes a game he usually goes on a long tangent about life but with this i feel like hes learned more about himself youve changed a lot yes but i think in a very good way usually the people with depression manages to hide it the best this really hit some sore spot i am suicidal and nobody knows about it i always felt like that its easier just to die and end the pain it felt good hearing someone comment about it thank you i wish i had a friend like the main character ur thoughts and things u say always make feel warm and relaxed and i really do cherish these vids and u i could care less if u change or dont change because ill forever support and watch u take as many breaks as u need because we all know u deserve it and have a right to do it we love u sen this hit me way to close to home and made me cry thanks sean if youre reading this im here for you i may not be able to relate to some of your problems but i want to help you arent a bother and i love you have a good day 3 thank you hey jack i was wondering if you knew where i could find the music jack dont apologize for disconnecting from us because if its better and healthier for you and makes you happy that is what is important to us plus being overly energetic like you used to be just isnt realistic for a healthy person because you arent a cartoon character yeah it can be pretty hard to read the signs people can hide it so well and i would know stay strong everyone sean ur fine the way u are dont let people get to u u do u ur always making people happy we all appreciate u so much dont let the world burn you out those words are going to stick with me 439 falloutboy meme thank you jack i lost my mom and my grandpas in the hospital its been so hard to get back up this helped me thank you jack even tho you may never see this comment in this sea of comments i just want to say i love what you do thank you jack this is so emotional 4105 early 2019 me goes away 5 days suddenly sees reddit full of lemon cars and bugs bunny big edition im calling you motivation jack from now on how did you get the best ending on the first try im so mad by some stroke of luck this came out on a particularly bad brain day for me thank you so much sean im only like half an hour in but thank you jack for making videos youre an amazing person youve always said youve wanted to be a friend to play games with to just sit next to and have fun and it really helped me during a really dark time in my life where i felt really alone so i hope youre good you feel like a friend i dont know very well but its okay because you dont know me and im sorry youve felt this way too take a break when you need to well be here i guess the only thing i can say is thank you lats face it by 2849 we were all yawning i wrote harry potter fanfiction too i just have had the hugest brain fart and havent done it in a while jack youre here for us and were here for you if you need a break nothings gonna happen to us we love you and will all stay we all want you to be happy so take a break spend time with evelyn and your friends youve helped me so much through moments in my life we know you care about us because youve helped us all in so many ways your channel will never die cause this might sound corny but were not just a community were a family and we all want the best for each other i cant thank you enough for all youve done big loud mouthed jack was good and all but we all mature and of course we still like you the same theres no reason for us not to if anything i like this jack more because loud jack was funny and distracted me from my problems but new jack actually has talks about those kinds of topics which really do help thanks for multiple years of happiness and more years to come thank you fuck man i was not prepared to be hit with emotions like that jack play some minecraft with pewds for those who say that people dont change screw you people change and you cant do anything about it message recieved games like this really make you realize that the world isnt all cupcakes and rainbows i actually went through a similar experience to this i was very depressed and kind of suicidal for a long time i thought that no one would care if i was gone but i was always scared at the thought of hurting myself i tried over and over again to do it but i just couldnt until my friends found out they kept pushing me to be happy and they did so much for me that i just couldnt bare to hurt myself anymore if youre hurting depressed or suicidal just know that people with always care for you and help you get better no matter what happens theyll always be there for you youre always going to be loved and people will always try to fix this shitty world that we live in theres always someone whos going to be there for you you are doing great i enjoy all of your videos that was really heartwarming i just felt so relaxed listening to your speech that actually reminds me few weeks back i saw disturbed at a festival and the singer gave that kind of speech too to the audience at one point he wanted everyone who has or had dealt with mental health issues even if not their own to take their phones and light up the flashlight or to put their screens to the brightest to lift them up so everyone can see what struck me there as he told now that how many lights there where all around me literally almost everyone held their light source upme included dealing with severe stage depression and anxiety disorder looking around me i was stunned and that really gave meaning to his words you are not alone its positive to see that mental health is being taken seriously and that it is spoken too and jack thank you for your words that was really inspirational and i just appreciate you even more not that i didnt appreciate you a fucking lo to those 351 people who have disliked this videoi have nothing to say if you dont like seanjack why did you watch the video in the first place anyone got an uno reverse card hold up 439 is that joel smallishbeans from the picture im not really quite sure the thing that really got me thinking it was him was the shrek photo sorry you need a hug everyone who is sad and miserable dont always show it jackaboy you are a great person you are like a realy good friend you make us laugh you understand us you show us the good in humanity you support us and we support you just thank you for being the person you are good speach jackaboy if youre not finna get sad keep on skeeting through the comments this video really hit close to home i used to struggle with depression and anxiety a lot it was to the point where some days after i came home i would sit down and hold a knife in my hands contemplating whether or not to do it whether or not anybody would care and what would happen after i did it luckily that knife was never used and is now just a show knife and camping knife i know that a youtube videos comment section isnt the best place to talk about this kind of thing but i felt as if i needed to talk about it as of now only one person knows about it and thats my lifelong friend i also just wanted to say jack if youre reading this i want you to know that we all support you and wouldnt care at all if you took a break for a while you also helped me through that time being my favorite content creator im through it now with a stroke of luck but if you are struggling with this kind of thing get hel hey jack dont worry about it ill be here for u if u ever need anything just tell me where and when and ill try to help out man u make me smile so i wanna do same in return that last 20 mins was heartwarming and inspirational thanks i needed it i think i am too emotional for this video i used up a whole toilet roll either way i really liked this video jack even though you are a very energetic person in most your videos you still understand and get these things seriously i really like taht about you keep it up irelate to this so much i have these thoughts as well the same ones as may everything that may says is almost exactly what i go through everyday going through the same monotonous shit all the time waking up getting dressed going to school learn absolutely nothing new or helpful go home do nothing and go to bed repeat it wasnt until i found jacks and markipliers videos that i felt that i was doing something new i wasnt going through monotony of my regular bullshit life i found something that made me happy ooo baby a triple i cried watching this ive had days like this during school to the point where it was beating me into the ground this hits so close to homelove the style of this game thank you so much for being the best motivational speaker jacksepticeye my friend pedro is fully out you have to play it again aww jack when i go on youtube and click on your videos i always think of it is a nice time where i can watch you play games and other stuff and feel like your talking straight to me as a person sometimes im not watching you in a screen i feel like you sitting with me and we are enjoying a catch up you are becoming more you and less youtube thank you this has easily become one of my favorite videos youve ever done never have i downloaded a game so fast and been more willing to support a creator in my life thank you for playing this and showing vulnerability in front of us and letting everyone who needs to hear these things know that they arent alone and that people care getting help is never a bad thing damn jack this was deep thank you sean i need these words in my brain thank you for being here in this moment it really means a lot i did it with your mom last night haha loser harry potter fanfiction geez this really is tumblr the video game this is my first time ever commenting on one of your videos because i was too scared to ever do so before but for this first time i just wanted to say thank you for making me laugh when im at my best and for the most part at my worst thank you so much for getting my through everyday i never cried watching one of your videos but this one hit hard thank you so much for sharing your experiences and your words with us i really needed it and i really cant thank you enough for it so just thank you so much thank you for being you and thanks you for all the help youre giving to people so this really hit close to home sean you feel 100 free to keep whatever you want private we respect you not only as a face or an internet persona but as a friend do what you love and we will still want your content take as long as you need thank you so much for an inspirational message hey i guess nobody cares about it but i just wanted to talk about this i really feel kinda depressed since two to three months and i dont want to talk to my parents because i dont want them to waste money on a therapist i dont know what to do anymore im not going to end myself but i dont feel like anybody cares about it and i dont know what to do anymore i feel like nobody cares but maybe somebody knows what to do am i the only one who found it really interesting how she credited junji ito as an inspiration i mean i can see some of his work inspiring how she build up tension in the game and the somewhat unsettling imagery but other than that there are not many similarities between his work and her game and it is really interesting to see that he was an inspiration for this definetely didnt expect one of ny favorite horror artists to make an appearance in this video damn i had a friend who committed suicide and it really fucked me up and also lost my uncle to overdose and this really fucked me up and yeah you know cant really word it but damn man it hurts a lot also i can hear shiloh dynasty i dont really know what else to put here but if you ever i need just find someone you trust and understand they will be able to help its cliched but it helps you know but if your going through a struggle stay strong and keep going this hit me hard i used to be very depressed in 20152018 ive recently have been getting better there are still depressive episodes here and there but im finally happy ive been clean for a year im so proud of myself i hate all these advertisements that say what would you do for a klondike bar like theyd probably purchase the klondike bar unrelated i just thought id point it out if youre happy youre doing something right if youre not happy find out whats causing that and see what you can do if you cant change it find out what you can change and go do it jack needs to make podcasts haha mean either i felt like crying watching this bc im a gay teen and in highschool i get bullied alot and some ppl really dislike me ive been jumped in the bathroom and it was common and ive contemplated suicide alot and my bestfriend and couple others noticed and helped me if u ever feel down talk to someone u trust like a bestfriend teacher councilor or professional it might change everything for u if u see this comment and struggling with something reply and ill talk to u about it depression isnt something to brush off love u guys and im here to help this video got me scuicidal we know you still care if you didnt care you wouldve left you didnt youve just found a balance between social life and self care im truly happy you are feeling better now we love you jack whether it be 7 videos a month or 1 we will wait for you jack ugh i mean sean are you ok you seem like you have too much experience with this sort of theme if theres something please tell us as we will support you and help you i didnt think i would relate to this so much i saw myself in may in so many ways that it scares me i wish i had someone to talk to someone to listen but i dont have that my best friend is in another state and he is busy all the time i did tell him about everything a few weeks ago but i havent heard from him since and im to scared to try and reach out to him again stuff like this makes me wish there was a magic way to send real hugs online instead of the gifs i guess ill just have to keep sending those gifs until something like that happens jack uses shamrock shakes as his eyeshadow 2434 thanks jackreally needed that mom says i cant make money off my artsays its unrealistic my favorite song was playing on the background of this aww sean is cute when he gets imotional sean thank you for being you this was a really heavy episode and its kind of cathartic to have lets plays like this but i kinda need a laugh segment after this 3 3 3 jack i like your videos you are a kindhearted man who is not afraid to talk about serious stuff you are uplifting and make my and so many peoples days brighter i lost friends and acquaintances to suicide there was one day i remember vividly a friend from our clique in schoolage1720 was mostly moody and i didnt think of this much but on this day a 18th birthday other party attendees made fun of him because he wouldnt party along and was just in the room for a bit i felt to myself uhm could this be he has much worse anxiety and mental issues but i didnt continue this thought weeks after this party he suffocated himself with a plastic bag his mum found him 3 days after the incident for weeks i felt guilty not saying anything or helping him in some form thank you for this it means so much and im not much here in the comments but everyone here is so wonderful the world needs more good people and sean is finding them and managing to bring them here in one area much love to anyone who needs it xxx thank you jack i really needed this i felt like this video was gonna turn into hentai at any moment wheres the slap sound jack wtf for jacks funniest home videos sen should watch detroit become stab wounds and kratos and boi shout at things nice artwork but not that intrigued in the game left a like tho today i felt pretty sad from personal problems and then i watched your video and made my mood youre the best thank you so much your words resonates with me i care so much about you i really needed this video thank you jack thank you for the nice inspiring talk i understand how you feel and understand that life is hard but you only get one chance in life so why not make it the best if i ever feel suicidal which is almost never what i think is suicides gonna hurt dont get me wrong the rise in awareness is beating a stigma that no longer scares us but for sake of discussion in spirit of fairness could we give this some room for a new point of view and could it be true that some could be tempted to use this mistake as a form of aggression a form of succession a form of a weapon thinking ill teach them well im refusing the lesson it wont resonate in our minds im not disrespecting what was left behind just pleading that it does not get glorified maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high find your grandparents or someone of age pay some respects for the path that they paved to life they were dedicated now that should be celebrated this video really hit home we love you sean 3 i know the feeling about being stuck with doing something i hate living the same day over and over again with no change no rewards with all the hard work i do and not get an acknowledgement drives me crazy i also have the issue where i dont know what i am good at or why i seem to be stuck on repeat and cant seem to find what ill enjoy this hits close to home my best friend recently passed due to suicide and the funeral scene in the game was to real shit these comments are so lovely im in recovery again so these comments are the cutest jack please have a break just for two days or two you deserve it you never stop doing what you do and i a human have those thoughts too you have helped me so much in life you have saved me many times and i just want to say thank you so much i feel this is inappropriate to comment but godamn it is hard to cut with scissors and if you manage to go that far you might need some help but like more than normal help cause the fucking willpower it takes to go that far with something so dull just for the little bit of pain you think you deserve but actually dont anyway this is a real dumb comment but whatever just as jack clicked the door i got a fucking ad cmon everyone in the comment section emotional me has alexythemia and doesnt give a shit about feelings suicide was something i had no one for i had gotten out of a bad relationship forced to move homes thought i caused my mom depression from the decision i just made the person who my mom was engage to shot himself i just wanted to end it you know and i did but i called 911 after swallowing a lot of pills something in my gut was telling me to live on and i cried watching my mom cry and my friend crying when i called her up telling her what happened you never really know who is there but understand there are people for you sean when you make videos like this one and the other ones talking about mental health problems it really helps i have been pulled out of many a dark place thanks to your videos from the bottom of my heart thank you thanks i played this game yesterday and it really hit me the first time i played please take care of yourself person reading this sucicide what a game and sweet funky

better and even if you dont feel like it there is always someone who cares i appreciate you and your videos so much so so much this hit so close to home did anyone else notice that amy and may have the same letters and maybe that amy is just an alter ego of may or vis versa ive struggled and still do struggle with this i have scars because i felt well still feel like im so alone i dont belong i dont deserve anything i have reason though i grew up in an extremely abusive household and i was told those things daily i tried to commit suicide but then i found jack well san and he helped me so much i didnt feel so alone i felt like i had someone that i could go to to make me smile laugh i still do i am going to be 15 soon and i have attempted suicide about 34 times i do have self harm scars i still have my blades ive thought about how much it would hurt people i am getting back on track sort of and i plan on starting to make little video diaries to try and make myself feel better jack if

and if i can help anyone i really want to be able t thank you jack you helped me get through some rough patches in the past year and a half again thank you ya but if you dont make money doing the things you love then you will be stressed and sad when you cant pay the taxes or afford anything i would love to reach out but most people just say go to a therapist since they dont want to deal with me most people actually mean it good but some people should damn know that passing people on to a therapist might wont help the person this weekend a friend pushed me into going to a therapist to answer some questions which might pop up in your head no im not going to a therapist professional doctors suck friends are much much better doctors this game is so heart warming yet so sad also i got

love you jack you make me smile and laugh even when im upset im always here for you and i know you will always be here for me i hope you read this and it makes you smile i really needed this today i dont think there is a better youtuber than you in terms of being a human you have definitely helped many people you are the coolest brother the words are so emotional its all so beautiful and meaningful and listening to your talk moved me i myself dont have feelings like this but its really important for some other people to hear thanks for your time on these topics i hate all of you sorry jack i love you the other person i watched play this picked the same person too the stupid wild hoe instead of the nice quiet girl who is actually there for you game god is a woman me i understood that reference this shows that people do care about what you say and feel like doing because think about your heart as a light people who feel like this their light is going out but when they talk about this stuff to another person their light grows and they trust this person and soon their light glows brighter and brighter and they will go on knowing that a person cares if you feel like this talk to a person or family member theyll understand youre so amazing and so many people truly need people like you or just someone to look up to seeing you tear up makes me bawl thank you for everything you do 3 where is the green hair damn now i feel ashamed for wishing you to go back to your green hair 3 but i also know that that is not what you meant i love the way you seem to feel these days it looks like you are more happy relaxed and even enjoying life a lot more 3 and thank you evelien for giving sen that gleam in his eye d you two are adorable d i see face a kiss d but also thank you sen for being that friend to me that made me realize that i deserve to be happy and not being treated like dirt i was extremely depressed in 2017 and contacted my doctor when i realized that i was getting more and more serious about me suicidal thoughts ive been cutting myself a few times and when i was put on antidepressants and anticoagulants blood thinners i still was so dumb to get myself so wasted while i was feeling extremely down that i cut myself again and because of the alcohol it didnt hurt as much so i cut a little deeper and because of the anticoagulants it bled a lot more and i w 293 people that disliked this video need to watch the full thing rest in peace etica is it just me or did you wanna see inside the room 2340 i mean come on she is very much cool in my book even donut from red vs blue we know you watch it wrote some and now i will call her donut from now on i just now realised that they are sitting on blood in the startscreen thank you we love you jack i mean it take some quality time for yourself dont work too hard live your life ive been writing a longass comment about half an hour but i accidentally closed the page and it got deleted so heres the short version we really deeply care about you do whatevers the best for yourself well be here for you well wait just keep being yourself i cried so much in this video i think i need to go watch one of seans happy videos i needed this video so bad i know you will never see this but i just want to tell u how much i appreciate you and all you do for me for everybody through out your whole speech i just sat there crying because i know everything you say is true and its a sad truth i will try to believe in myself but its hard but i will try your words really touch me so just thank you finally someone popular played this game bro its my birthday today thank you sean love you and this community i had an incredibly bad day my boyfriend felt very insecure about our relationship since lately i realized that i am incredibly bisexual and he doesnt feel good about it that is the reason of our fights that are really tiring and at the end of the day i am crying my eyes off and then i watched your new video and it felt so much better thank you thank you jack for telling me you make me realize that im not alone well this made me cry unexpectedly and a real cry that i havent done in a long time dont know why but cried during this a few years ago i started getting bullied online these people where telling me to kill myself every single day of my life i tried to a couple of months after it started i was 10 years old and people wanted me to die i was so tired of being treated like shit i figured out that i was into girls and guys and decided i was bisexual when i came out to my mum she told me to stop being stupid and thats when i felt like nobody cared so whats the point of even being here if nobody likes me i didnt really understand what to do with my life so i started to cut i stopped after some of my friends at school found out one of them told someone and it spread but nobody was taking it seriously people came up to me smiling and laughing to ask me if it hurt to cut i live in a very tall three story house i stared out of the window for hours trying to think of a single person who would care if i was gone for a while i was really happy and made some friends who actually care about me lately i feel like if jack stopped doing youtube he could be a good therapist but idk hey jack its great that you can open up about this kind of stuff and its great to see that youve grown as a person and your doing better mentally and just as a person i really needed to hear something like what you said at the end so thanks im in a pretty dark place at the moment and it can be quite reassuring to hear about how someone such as yourself became more positive and mentally stable because yes you may not be uploading twice a day but who cares its just great to see that your doing better than you was before your probably not going to see this but if you do or if anyone else sees this then i hope you have a good day and take care of yourself take some time and do the things you enjoy stay safe friends to all the people who said sen isnt a real person or is just in it for youtube or fame or popularity tell me that this man is not a real human being showing his real feelings and thoughts for other real people to enjoy relate to and appreciate and if you can say that to me 100 believing yourself then i feel you arent appreciating life enough for the real shit thank you jack i dont know what else to say thank you my big brother goes through terrible swings of depression as his little sister i gave all the love and support for him when he needed to talk to me i was there when he graduated this year he mentioned me in his speech he gave how my sister saved my life he did tell me about commiting suicide but all those ideas left his mind when he opened his heart to me i dont know what i would without my brother if he never told me what was going on my brother is alive and well and a high school graduate i just dont like the fortnite references i believe i speak for everyone by saying this ur fans love u whoever u r and however u feel all of us love u sen hey sean i know you wont see this but thank you for this video 2019 i think has been my worst year so far a lot of shitty things happened i wont go into details but i think i have gotten to the point where i feel just as tired as may your message in the second part of the video hit me hard and made me realize how much i still have to learn about myself and that i need to accept that healing from hard things require more time than i originally thoughthoped i need to stop worrying about things and people who are not that important in my life and just try to live a happier and fuller life i dont know if the things i wrote make sense but it felt good writing this down i will take your advice by heart and try to rethink my life and choices with the help of these thoughts it will be hard to make it but id i want to live my life the way i want to i will have to start somewhere and somehow in conclusion i want to say thank you for all who read this and thank you sean fo sean i do get that even my freind who i consider my theripst dosent know how i feel sometimes like i dont want to hinder them with my problems and my problems are nothing compared to others but it still brings you down to the lowest of lows so thank you honestly we all went through a fanfic stage like if it was harry potter and comment if it was a different series no high five i miss reading ur comments please me and my puppy want some i love how honest and open you are even if someone felt 100 alone by watching these sorts of videos that number could go down to 999 and that could make a world of difference edit ahh no that tangent of yours made me sob so raw and i really learnt from it social media detox definitely needed i can relate to may in some ways this video made me cry thx jack this hit me really hard being sucidial and depressed is super hard i am so glad to have people in this world that can actually understand me i just want to thank jack and everybody for being here and helping people like me to see the brighter side and being here who the fuck disliked this ive felt super depressed and a little suicidal but my friends got me out without them realizing and it confused me because im also a very bubbly jolly person but your videos did help mostly for me though it was wait this isnt what i want to be like so i made the effort for myself im gonna keep this short because i dont really want to get into it but i was suicidal for years i finally opened up to one of my friends and she helped me through it if you feel the way i did find just one person you trust that you can open up to it saved my life and it could save yours too also if anyone you know seems like theyre going through some dark times please talk to them and make sure they are ok hey jack first of all good video of a lovely game and secondly i am a long term lurker and sub to you and your channel and porbably a lot older then most of your views as well as my oldest son is two years older then you well anyway hunni what you said in this video is so nice to hear that you are taking time out for yourself and that you have a personal life outside of youtube to help find your own happiness it has been a pleasure watching you grow and change as you have aged over the years i would be very proud of you if you where one of my sons so you should be very proud of you i always enjoy watching your content as it buts a smile on my face for that day mental health issues are no joke as i have found out myself even tho my life is hard and i have really dark bad days sometimes and it is far from perfect from being a single parent to a 24 hour carer to two of my sons but i can still say that i feel like i have had a good life as it could be so much worse this is such a great video getting to hear seans insight into this side of his youtube life and of many others its such a good thing for this to be talked about more and more among the community thank you jack tumblr the game after ddlc this is mild seems like the start of a hentai game life is difficult heres my secret i smile when i break down tears will be flowing and expectations will keep my smile plastered on dont be like me dont hide your emotions dont bottle them up smile for real cry to express yourself be weak theres nothing wrong with being weak you are amazing you are beautiful and you deserve the world thanks for talking about your videos sothe my depression i have had some bad thoughts recently thanks for making these videos i feel like san sumed it up pretty well just slight things i wanted to add its always good to have a hobby that you really like to do something that makes you happy its always good to take a break every now and then and calm your mind you really dont have to care about what other people think about you its not their life its your life you should be the one making your decision you only get one life live it the way you want to never think you are alone cause there are so many people going through the same thing if any dark thoughts come in your mind the best thing is to talk to someone who care about you and believe me there are many people who care about you and want you to be happy and you deserve to be happy your deserve everything good in life you are an amazing person ive suffered from depression myself and its refreshing to see someone speak so honestly about it pma all the way on the app store they have another game called theres this girl this is the fluffiest and saddest fanfic that i have ever watched or read and people need to be aware of it their dreams and what they are willing to do for each other is priceless and we all need a friends like them i would love for sen to do another evolution vid to see how far hes come and how he matured hes come sooo far matured in such a good way after surviving someone sexually assaulting me and then having other bad things happen to me i felt so alone and i really did think about ending it but i know that some day ill have a body that he hasnt touched so i just gotta hang in there near the end poor jack looked like he was going to cry tt hey sen just to say your doing good things and you matter so much too me and many others i didnt want to look but couldnt click away and now i am crying i have been there myself and could overcome but i also lost friends to it that couldnt find a place within themselves to overcome please if you are in this situation find help dont give in to the dark search for the light life is worth it you are worth it i want jacksepticeyes funniest home vids i love you sean you are an amazing person i really needed to hear that today thank you we are all here for each other we are here for you and you are here for us i have that problem with social media and i also have the same kind of thoughts but i speak to my friends because i know there is still hope when you feel like that and you have noone to talk to talk to us because we are here for each other i started repeating myself i have been depressed since 12 and suicidal since soon after ive tried many times and have my own scars i was told i was fine by family and friends that everyone gets sad but i met a wonderful guy who saw my struggle as our relationship bloomed he took me to places to get help unfortunately i ended up in the psych ward last month but its pushed progression on getting a therapist and meds for my undiagnosed bipolar im doing betterish most days but it is a heavy and tiring climb to the top of the hill i havent been at in nearly 8 years anyone who goes through my stupid monolog just know there is hope and people to help you are not alone if your struggling through depression search up the losing battle its by mat pat who runs the game theory channel and he goes in depth the effects on other people and its real sad cause i know how it feels to be on the other side of being a friend to the friend who has it and you will never know till you talk to them after reading this i want all of yall to go tell the people who you care about you love them cause ive also had depression and it sucks but the way to help is to let them know there are people that are there for them jack please make a vid where you talk about this shit because like this shit made me feel quite a lot better and i bet a lot more people felt better as well and i think a lot of people related to this as well to you and the game and they including me would love to hear you talk more about this sean thank you why the hell did people dislike the video i love how jack spends the last fifteen minutes talking about serious topics even tho he doesnt have to mom missed calls 19 omg i played this game and loved it glad to see sean playing it now i feel like it turned into bond with sen time and i actually really enjoyed that i kind of wished he could do this more just opening up even if its just telling funny stories or something i like it it feels like hes taking time for us out of just entertainment and i really appreciate that i just downloaded this actually jack if you ever need a break from games we will understand and if you dont want to play games or talk about you personal life you dont have to do that you are one the best youtuber i have seen and i want you to live your live how you want i dont just want to die i also want to erase the time i existed im going through a difficult time in my life but i feel like i should watch this and we need talk about this topics sometimes i feel alone but i know im not and if youre reading this and you feel lonely too just remember its not true and things gonna be better you have to fight and life is worth fighting for god this video is amazing and deals with the way how people who have depression to have a look into the mind that people arent always okay when they say okay a legit hug from someone can be groundbreaking and earth shattering bubble from reality im only saying this because tomorrow will be a week from when i tried to commit the unreturnable lol yeah on twitter you just steal other peoples tweets like i had a friend that was having depression and anxiety so i helped her so many times like i wanted to meet her and hug her and give her compliments but thanks to me she didnt do things to herself like one day i was with her and i have seen some scars on her hand and wrist i held her hand and yelled at her what the heck is this she told me i got injured in an accident i told her why didnt you tell me like i could visit her but i realised she didnt u are an accident that day cuz we had a picnic that day and i told her you are lying she did realise that i understand her and she was shocked bro i held her hand got her bandages and some alcohol perfum and cared about her at least for now she is good and not despairful and shes always thanking me cuz i always was with her and thank you jack for this video and really really liked it so much i would like this kind of video 4025 turn off your brain me why does they bathroom looks like a public bathroom ayo shawn im tryna start youtube and i was wondering if you got any tips for editing im using adobe premiere pro and im self taught but i was just wondering if you had any tips thank you please plat this more jacks dislikes exist the other 32039 people who liked time for a crusade that little speech at the end i swear to you seani needed it theres always that moment in life where you sit down and you think why am i thinking this far into it and it hits you to an extent to wonder why am i thinking this i appreciate this so much i really appreciate you taking the couple minutes to speak about that i cant show you my appreciation but god if i could i swear i would just hug you right now every time i watch one of these i almost end up crying because its so fucking relatable to things ive been through with friends family myself people i care about but your moments at the end of these videos where you take a second to speak on it and even the link in your description linking it out for someone if they actually may need help i swear youre just a saint in normal clothing youve helped so much for more than even just myself thank you sincerely fucking seriously thank you games in pride month lets make the main character apart of the lgbtq community nothing wrong with that btw jack you save lives by just by smiling and being yourself you mean the world to us you help us and you make us all smile you keep a lot of us going and us happy we appreciate every video you make happy sad funny and relatable you are human but people like you will always shine like the star you guys are thank you for the bottom of our hearts for what you do we love you i hate that it starts with trigger warning games used to just say disclaimer or a normal warning 3750 that part however is a bit relatable no dark thoughts or anything but for a while now ive felt aimless in what ive been doing and on yt lacking viewers i also feel like im talking into the void without even my own echo to listen to basically just moving forward in the dark without a guidepost simply because i am i always get teary eyed with these kind of videos cause its like i know how it feels but at the same time i want to reach out but i feel like id just be annoying people and then they wont truly listen anymore story time because i need to let it out my mom knows im not mentally stable same for you dad but im going to talk about my mom here mostly i have felt severely depressed for years now i never want to do anything im never endingly tired but she forces me to do things all the time its really stressful my dad does it only about me never going outside i cant do it but i plan on telling my mom today how i feel about it maybe even my dad thank you jack your a lifesaver one of the reasons i have stayed so far im getting ready to see a counselor pretty soon too im offended as a fan and owner of many flanels i actually like you more now than before you seem happier and that makes me as a subscriberviewer happy love you sen keep doing what you do this shit deep saw this on steam thank you sean just thank you jack i have the same b day as you feb 7 what the point in suicide there are people who love you and suicide will get you nothing just make the people who loved you sad saw this on steam i came back from old jack vids and he has a beard what would happen if i die hit me so hard because i too thought like that you need to keep going and think who i would learn to love and meet think about happy thoughts keep going strong just remember i too love you you were suppose to dye your hair green this hit right at home for me as well thank you sen for the wise words and please never ever apologize for wanting to improve and keep up with your mental health without you this community wouldnt be here where it is today so please dont torture yourself with too much work or thoughts that wed forget you because for sure we wont you have helped so many of us me including in so many ways that we cant do else but to at least try pay that love back for you any possible way we all can i am like surely most of us here so happy and proud to see how much you have grown as a person and that youve learnt to appreciate yourself more than before im still working on that myself though but through you ive learnt to judge myself and others around me lesser too than what i used to even tho ive never been really negative or judgemental but as you said too theres always a chance to improve smth so thanks for that really my message sounds little cliche but my english this video made me feel very warm like a hug i dont know why but i just love that it creates an open conversation about something that affects a lot of people thanks sean for choosing to play this types of games and for the developer for creating it why is this video have more then 300 dislikes i relate to may so hard i feel guilty a lot for doing things that make me happy i feel like the stuff you said in the later parts of the video arent really said enough among people people forget to take care of themselves and forget some of the most important things in life i have at some points its just a thing that can happen to us all at any time and what you say should be something more people know and speak about some of the stuff youve said is comforting to hear and i personally needed to hear it thanks jack make sure to take care of yourself too and whoevers reading this i suppose 116 shows a transgender flag which i love cause you dont see them in game i played this game a month or two ago it hit home for me because ive been suicidal for a very long time and i can understand all the emotions going through this game if you guys can save someone look for signs of suicidal tendencies show them that they arent alone please thank you we get itwe love you sen we always will we will grow with you thanks for the words sean it really helps a lot jack whats your favourite meme mee thank you i can relate to this i played this game because i was trynna play armorgames buddy how did the character saying yawn cause jack and cause me to yawn too please take care of yourself3 i was not expecting to cry today jesus that one hit me hard and just when i thought i had myself under control the last 15 seconds youre doing great you cant see me you dont know me but that felt like it was for me thanks jack lots of love the second part of this game really hit me hard the first too but it was more of a sudden shock but the second part you got those haunting feelings that are familiar where you know something is wrong and you feel helpless not many games make me cry but this got me there it also made me want to hug a cartoon i am just glad sean takes these types of games seriously and actually has a message behind it a helpful message you can tell he has a good heart by the way he tries to take time away from the game to talk about these subjects and takes this type of game into a really emotional perspective and not just doing it for fun i am so thankful for your videos i have been in a dark place and not a lot of people have known because i feel like i would bring them down you videos have helped me and for you to talk about your experience is amazing you are truly awesome life is tumbler 3 jack people who tell you arent connected it doesnt fucking matter because those people dont appreciate you like the most of us appreciate you and what you do and in my opinion if someone doesnt change with you then they arent happy with themselves and but just know most of us love you as do i i really hope you see this because you are beautiful 3 anyone else get creeped out why she sings who ever disliked the video fuk a you he is among the most inspiring people i know of when he talks like this when he started talking about etika i had a breakdown the fact that this happens in real life is horrible because you never know whats going on in a persons life until they do something thats its too late to control i myself contemplating suicide and coming near ending it but sean was one of the ones who actually talks about real life things and helping me through it not even talking to me directly thank you sean man its so nice to see this side of you it proves to everyone that you are a great person ive gone through a shitty time this past couple weeks and you have helped me through it all you really have trust me when i say this you need time for yourself even if you take months off ill still be here when you return and so will millions of others you have just gotta screw the haters if people stop watching due to you taking a break then they clearly arent part of this great community so screw them let them leave whenever you return most of us will be here for you it you ever need anyone to talk to im here i get im just another sub but ive seen a few people go through these type of feelings and it is hard to see but im here to help keep doing you san youre a great person please find the people who disliked this video ill take all responsibility for the shit you do to them but they deserve it this is one of the best videos i ever saw from you and would love to see more like this lots of love when sen finished the game i just broke down crying because it brought me back to atone where i was miserable and i was going through the worst im still in tears as im writing this this game was honestly the most relatable love u so much sen i couldnt tell if sean was tearing up while playing the game or not because his eyes had that glazed over look the whole time couldnt help but tear up myself a bit seeing those i care about cry makes me cry too heh this video it really hurt my heart ive been struggling with depression anxiety and self harm this really makes everything be put in perspective the creator really hits close to home and jack you care so much you are so concious about how people are struggling your videos and your positive mental attitude is helping me go on with life you really are the light of my life the thing that makes me just a bit happier thank you sen thank you sen this is very loud in my ears me well now you know how we feel sseeen bruh im reckless af i dont need no sky to not think about anything he speaks the true words all the dislikes are the australians trying to like it my eyes started watering up in those last two minutes i did not think that would happen on your live yesterday i literally kept commenting play missed messages for sean i fell off a swing and scrapped my hands now i am lonely fuck i cried the whole time through this aha its scary how relatable sean is not just to me but to so many other people it just reminds me one bit more of how jack is only human like us thank you jack wait watch trees moving what kind of trees do you have i know you wont see this but jack this was such a beautiful video your words were inspiring and im glad you felt safe enough to talk about these things please dont feel like your talking too much because you arent and what you say has value we will listen yes we will all miss you 2 years ago loud green hair etc but we love you now we love you no matter how many videos you put out your hair loudness we love you because your awesome your funny and silly but also kind and considerate the charity live streams and your videos like this one which contain suicide self harm lgbtq show exactly why we love you so keep it up take as many breaks as you need as long as you come back better than ever we are all human you see you later her goodbye me flashback this game deals with depression and other shit it said me oh fuck sen just doesnt notice sean the same you are our firend we are your firends as well dont be afraid to talk about what you think and how you feel if somebody doesnt like it they wont watch but many people cares about you if you are happy if you feel good at least i do care about you even if i will never have the chance to meet you even if i dont enjoy all your content i just really apreciate you as a person and i also care about this community is one of the best around and im not exagerating people in it cares about everyone and thats precious thnx thanks i needed that talk today i wasnt sure i would be able to watch this video as it reminded a bit of that dragon cancer which in the past hit me hard but im so glad i did just to hear sens motivational speech we love you for who you are sen not the frequency of uploads and dont you forget it theres nothing wrong with writing fanfiction your absolutely incredibly amazing we love you and are very grateful that you make enjoyable videos no matter what changes there will be people who support you and you made a very good point about how we the viewers should grow with you and the channel instead of living in the past your speech also helped many others including me so thankyou dont be afraid to take a break if you need one thankyou for all that you do stay alive who got all endings before jack played this game this vid hit close to home i appreciate and support it has being meme xd what i love about these type of videos from you is that it almost always comes out at the right moment hearing you say to not spend life wallowing about what could be gave me that courage boost that i needed to go forward with a lifechanging decision thanks for the beautiful message sean keep being you i hate constantly feeling depressed and suicidal and being too young to reach out for a hand and being too scared to ask for any help whatsoever it kinda feels like im never hungry never motivated and never happy and i hate seeking advice online because i never seem to find someone who will actually talk sincerely about it and base their story on their past and everything they went through listening to sean calms me down so much and id rather listen to him talk for hours about his emotions than watch jacksepticeye play games and laugh for days genuine conversations like this are so valuable to me and probably millions of other people struggling i really enjoy listening to him vent because he always finds the right words to make you feel worthy and better about yourself after hearing him talk so freely and openly about problems and negative thoughts that haunt all of us i just want to say in short words i freaking love this man so much and i cant describe how much he hel do more prop hunt if anyone is interested i found some music from the soundtrack summer madness jimmysquare its just another day kyvsky loosing interest by shiloh remix all we do is hurt each other kalko yyu eggo when i played this game i found it to be kind of linijer but i like the interactions and the diolog sometimesits okay play gris it has similar art style xd man whenever may was talking about everyday being the same day and all the talk about being an observer watching your actor play their role day in and day out being totally disconnected really hit me so glad to see real talk about this kind of stuff jack in 2016 i felt useless and alone but everytime i watched youre videos you always put a smile on my face and you still do that and when i was at my lowest someone not just you helped me and ive been with her for so long that now me and her are so much more then just having to rely on each other now we just live our happy lives together and its amazing and you were one of the only people tho that put a smile on my face and for that you are one of my heros and im glad to hear that im not alone that even my heros feel the same way at times and for that i thank you man this shit hit home the last 20 minutes is how i have felt for years i mean i thought about it like u said a lot op people have i havent been happy for the last 6 months because i might have used my relationship with my ex to confirm that i was a good and nice person you are awsome jack i hope i get to youre point as wel hey there i know how this comment looks like he only wants attention but thats not my intend i also dont know why i write this i just feel that i want to share it to someone who knows what it feels like i also cant speak english perfect just good enough so pardon me for grammar mistakes my name is david currently i am 21 years old but i did not enjoy the last 12 years of my life i was bullied for 6 years since i turned 9 they even tried to kill me on three times but yet i am here and i dont know why i really dont know why i share this story with people i dont know i just had the urge to do it so if you do not wish to read my personal life then dont read it since the 2nd grade when the bullieng started i fell into darkness an abyss that pulls me ever so closer the more days pass by it haunts me every day and night everytime i try to escape everytime i try to break the chains around my hand and feet they tighten every mo whats the song in the background this has being a hipster it has being gay it has being memey it has being bored and cant focus on work it has great music pretty sure you just described life is strange umm shawn you are more energetic that then and i like you more now and i think is better that way to have a personal life and i really like that about you man you are awesome this game reminded me so much of my experiences with my little sister only shes the gay one lol i love her so much and there were too many times when id almost lost her because she just wanted rest something seemingly so simple but she needed it so desperately im so happy shes still with me she is the light in my life and it shocked me once she told me that i am the reason shes here because i was the one to listen so please reach out and please please listen because it does save lives and self harm is a cry for help not attention this game was beautifully made and so personal thank you for playing this on your channel jack cliche doesnt mean the meaning doesnt hit hard we love you jack your a large inspiration i kinda just wanna distance my self from internet for awhile thank you almost got a perfect ending 1st try key is to pay attention at all times to people or whos closest to you jack

going through a rough patch and this really got me thinking this meant a lot to me the guys who disliked the video just missclicked the like button the reflection at 2924 is one giant enormously cartoonishly big mood mah name is amy hello to all my fellow amys shiloh dynasty is the song playing in the background to anyone who reads this comment you are loved whatever keeps you busy or troubled or even stressed out dont forget to breathe this world is full off millions of people there will always be someone who would listen and just be there for you talking is the best medicine for a troubled mind everybody deserves to be happy jack what about hitler its very heartwarming to hear you talk about these things sean i understand what you are going through being a growing artist that plans to move to la and act in films there are some times where i feel lost and there were so many times where i felt like i should do things for other people but just like you i realized that i had to think about myself i am very proud that you started to take time for yourself as i started to do the same when you talked about going to the gym i could relate because i started working out too and i feel a lot better than i did a year ago i hope you do too may is cute can we have a like an hour long video where sean just talks about random shit what headphones do you have hes such a genuine human being in every way thank you for being who you are when may talked about reliving the same thing everyday and being bone deep tired it just hit me so hard and this is just such a good game sorry i just wanted to say if anyone else feels this way comment we all deserve love as usual motivational thank you am i the only one who loves the relaxing music in the background its so beautiful and peaceful hey your never gonna see this is this ocean of comments but thank you the last part of the video really helped ive been self harming for 6 years my body completely ruined and then came the self confidence issues came and i started to gain weight this put me on a downward spiral of torcher and pain then like in the story i found my salvation my best friend found me and helping me a ton but it didnt last forever i started cutting again after 5 month clean it crushed me then yesterday i had a huge panic attack because i was wearing a short dress that showed my thighs tons of scars then fought with my mum because of it today seeing this video and by chance clicking on it then hearing the end segment ment alot so thank you so much x i really appreciate you ive been and still am dealing with the pressures of anxiety and depression it isnt easy to deal with although i am married and happily at that but it doesnt and hasnt rid of the demons i still bare we love you no matter what jack or should i say sean i am glad you live your life every one needs to live and enjoy life i like the sean that is happy and lives his life the way he wants too keep making videos that has the dash of pma support you and this is why i love you and your channel so so much you are such an amazing inspiring person sean 3 jack here again with his words of wisdom and always an eye out to help others cause no matter what it will be alright people care about you you are not alone thank you so much sen for everything you do for so so many people keep up the amazing work and take care of yourself sean when u feel like that find someone to talk to about it having those structural people to help u up when you beed it is really important knowing you have someone to talk to even about benign things even if it isnt with us we are still here to support you and help when you need it but all in all having real friends not just us viewers that makes the real difference ive had all of those thoughts surface and deep scars remain but im still here now i try to help anyone who feels that way i dont want anyone to turn out like i was especially u not becauee you are an entertainer popular on youtube or anything like that the more organic truer part of you ur still a person a genuine great positive person even doing this helpful talk at the end for people who really need it that makes your presence amazing even if it isnt consistent dont worry about making videos for us all the time your mental health is more important than this i really hope you jack takes a break from memes and jokes to make a serious video about suicide and reaching out to people who care about you everyone liked that its so goo to hear that youre doing alright i cant speak for everyone bu tive been a little worried especially before you took your time off i was hoping the fact that you diconnected as you call it meant that youd grown for the better and it did it makes me genuinelly happy to see a youtuber a person ive grown to care so much for as much as you can through a medium like this do so well youre a true inspiration sean i remember when i went though my own hell your were always there when i needed you when you strated feeling down i always hoped someone would be there fo you as well glad to see that you found exactly what you needed keep being awesome sean i feel like ive grown over the years and you surerly has as well take time for youself of course im glad youre willing to not only talk about things like this but also truly promote pma you are the definition of pma i think and not because youre always happy energetic and bubbly im not crying you are crying this is why i love seanjack he always seems like that older brother who is always muchneeded in peoples lives if senyou didnt care heyou wouldnt be here talking about this with us i honestly feel more connected and loved from this i still like ur channel but seriously that bun sucks your old hairstyle was so much better jack the bacon of youtube oof may i feel you been there not too long ago but getting help was the best thing ive done thanks thankyou i needed to hear that last bit again ive been really into drugs and drinking recently that last school year i felt just like may waking up same day same shit i feel felt numb and u reminded me that thats not okay that this feeling is still here ive been telling my friends that im okay im going to try and look for help again thanks sean thankyou for reminding me to get my face out of my phone too i am sure they will grow with you and with what you are

lil you are right jack you are right thank you so much sen that speech was so meaningful thank you for sharing that part about your life i havent cried in a while and this almost made me cry i kinda like the small talks in this game theres something relaxing about it and the art of course is so beautiful thank you just thank you i really needed the ending sean i love you and i thank you for making me laugh since you were in the cabin i am dead inside and henceforth cant have any emotions that is the start of the video that i grew up with why is his hair not green yet i normally dont write in the comments but i often read it and your all really lovely people i just want to share a little bit today in hopes it helps somebody else who knows right i struggle with depression and anxiety i have been for the last 5 years of my live therere ups and downs and i often thought because things werent as bad as they once where that i was fine on my own that i didnt need help anymore it would be silly and pointless it couldnt be that bad if now i was fine well let me tell ya it wasnt last year was the worst of my life and i meet the best people too and its really weird to say that but its true i meet friends that i didnt feel like it was too much to ask or to show my feeling that they would support me in what ever way a need it i found that in work relations as well which was surprising it also was the year that i seeked for professional help it was the hardest and best decision i ever made seeking help meant telling people my famil thank you for the 302 people the disliked the vid fuck you because people actually feel like this every day if u dont like the game then leave the vid but for u to dislike it is kinda sad you are doing good sean 420 girl you are the most beautiful girl 2 no u youre so cute keanu reeves u are all breathtaking i clicked right away when i saw this video cause i already played it before d girl god is a woman me well technically god is an entity so it cant have a gender and also other random stuff weve all felt that way at some point and i love jacksen one reason being hes genuine hes always tried to show some sort of genuinity throughout his videos and is also relatable hes growing learning and is such a positive role model for many thank you jack we love you thank you for telling this story it sure helps stay happy stay healthy thank you just thank you it might sound weird but i think i was fated to see this video today is my birthday and lately i had been feeling suicidal most of what happened in this game happened to me yesterday for the first time in ten years i felt accepted to anyone who thinks its not worth it it is there is always someone who cares sean thoroughly shrugs off his haters in this video honestly i look up to this guy its not like you get this everyday because like he said everyone goes threw this faze yet doesnt always have someone there to help or support yet some people hesitate to speak whats bothering them while other sit there not even paying attention to that person suffering with depression i love the shiloh dynasty in the background sean tears up and sniffles me dont cry grabs a tissue and listens to him we all love and care for you sean but what do you do if your already ruined sorry that was really cheesy and stupid 440 the picture on the screen is pete patrick and joe play trover saves the universe plzz love this deep content jack also id liove to see you replay nitw it was one of my favorite lps its really great that jack plays these videos especially as everyone says youre never alone well its true youre not just look at the comments if anyone depressed suicidal or anything reads this i strongly recommend you read the comments 3 your intros are getting quieter ive been both characters depression is a real thing its more than just a feeling i quickly got out of hard times but only because my friends needed me my friend has attempted 15 times i struggle everyday to help him but recently hes stopped talking to me it scares me a lot i really dont know what to do and i worry about him constantly but it allows me to look at how my actions effected others i couldnt possibly put a blade to my wrist again after feeling the pain of a loved one doing it everyone thinks im this happy person who is always positive but i am extremely depressed my friend call me a faker if i tell them because im not suicidal i was but im not anymore currently im going through possibly my worst period of depression when it gets to hard to deal with i come to this wonderful place full of positive and uplifting people called jacksepticeyes youtube channel thank you its very easy to hide depression for me personally i was the therapist always wanting to help always supporting always listening to my friends when i had friends so the point is if you have a friend who is your therapist and is always positive chances are they need the same support and help so help a friend talking helps like sean said talking to people who care i didnt when i had people in my life who cared now im one fucked up bean jack if you see this just letting you know ive been watching you since 5 years and i learned english because of you so if youd dye id probably die too half of my life ist just me watching your videos and you are very inportant for me hope you see this did anyone notice that in the dialogue they said youre and not youre thanks jack i really needed that youre the best sean i love you back then i love you now you and what you do bring me joy everyday i appreciate for you are and how genuine and honest too ive been through dark times some days i feel like ill never amount to anything but being around my friends my lovely fiancee that keeps me going everyday and my family keep my confidence a float instead of sunk to the bottom of an endless sea that feels like ill never be able to swim back up again but they help with that i cried when you spoke about the stuff you went through i played video games every day thinking thats the only joy i can ever have but i stepped back i play some every once in awhile but not as much because there is so much i could be doing instead ive made great friends and im glad that i have them in my life ill grow with you sean i hope we all do ill stay till youtube doesnt exist anymore even though i dont know you since i started watching youre videos id like to think of you as a friend came here for entertainment and ended up w the self love speech i really needed thank you jack for prioritizing your health and opening up and sharing it with us it means more than you know in my life right now sean if anyone ever says u dont care they r blind u care about us sm and u care about this community so much idk why they would ever say that u dont care there wrong u seem like a amazing person or atleast u r on camera and i love that about u so please dont go back to what u used to be and please stay happy thank you sean for making such a great and heartfelt videoits genuinely great to see you open up and share your experiences with us and what has been going through your head these past few years you may be an extremely successful and well known yt celebrity but at the end of the day youre just a normal guy going through life just like every single one of the 22 million subscribers that watch your videos every day hearing your encouragement means a lot to me it just sucks that the thing you said about there being a way out of what youre going through is true but its like aliens for example it undoubtedly exists but what are chances youll ever find it he didnt do the hhuuaawpuuddshh for his intro aihhhdhdbfnsjd jack sean or even anti whatever you wanna be called atm your timing couldnt have been better im going through a real rough breakup right now and have just been feeling overwhelmed and shit and it really isnt good and this video put a lot into a new perspective it was incredibly helpful to hear all this and id like to thank you thank you for this you honestly shouldnt feel pressured by doing your job the thing thats youve had almost a unconditional love for years youve helped thousands dare i say hundreds of thousands of people for what you do glad to say im one and if you feel bad about it your doing something wrong you should take time for you and your loved ones you should love yourself and and dont need to return the favour to something that hasnt asked thank you jack edit the things you say arent rambling or being full of your self everyone needs things like this you dont just notice it grow bigger and bigger while youre doing anything you should be able to carry through with anything you want to do thank you its those moments that make sean my fav youtuber me watches previous video with volume all the way up also me clicks on jacks video forgetting his loud intro i never clicked the volume button so fast in my life i love how kind you are this video made me want to kill myself angela he angela ha pride month is to show its ok to be gay i just truly love you all those words mean so much for so many this was to sad tho tears in my eyeees i get the meaning behind this i know that i am not alone and that there are people caring about me but what if dispite me knowing all of this my thoughts still get in a pretty dark place and i cant help it and also youve said that someone would listen to me but what when i dont know what to say what when its just so hard to express what i feel what if i feel embarressed for being that way or feel like im just overreacting what if they are just going to think im a weird teenage girl going through a phase maybe i am but if im being honest i dont think that literally planning how to exit life the best way at least every week is a normal phase what if they would just brush it off or what if i just make everyone worry like all hell my family has enough things to worry about i dont want to become another one it all sounds so edgy and attentionseeking when i put it that way and im thinking about just not posting this comment but always keeping quiet im not gonna cry im not gonna cry fuck im crying thank you sen your words are so valuable i appreciate you sean 4008 i have seen therapists before and none if them helped i just felt worse but because of this i might just keep trying so thank you jack this subject makes me interested in choosing psychiatry for my future education ive come close to crossing the line of no return i thankfully found a light to bring me back both in my loved ones and in faith i now feel i would have missed out in so many things fuck i genuinely tried to watch it i just couldnt not even 15 minutes in and it already cut deep i caught on instantly guys and girls please check on your friends make sure theyre okay talk to them do everything you can to distract them from self harm thoughts please play more outer wilds i love it so much and jack honestly i never wanted to meet you more then i do now hope you get the message how he says nothing is so adorable oh this made me so emotional thanks alot idk what to say 20162018 were the worst years of my life i fell down on such hard times that i genuinely wished to end it all so i can finally be free of the suffering i felt i have lived with since the moment i took my first breath i found myself to be may in this one so completely it almost scared me it was like looking in a mirror if i was chinese and a woman but starting this year i closed off the doors and windows into my past and i started from scratch i started by making new accounts for everything following only the stuff that i love new music new youtubers new games new passions everything i shaped from nothing i managed to find happiness in this world when i thought there was none to be had and i have my friends to thank for that but most importantly i have myself to thank i got off my booty and made something for me despite the people yelling at me that i wasnt allowed to do that i couldnt be more grateful for it am i the only one who got really anxious i recently just played this game it made me cry as someone that missed all the signs multiple times this video hit hard i know this will be buried deep down in the comments but if even one person sees this comment i want you to know that you should reach out in dark times most of the world is dumb and blind like me and we wont see the signs but the right people will always be willing to listen and to help if you reach out umm hey man this maybe is the first time i m commenting something in any of your videos i just love your content and like your uploads everyday to be true i just wait the whole day maybe just so that i can find your uploads it comes up 9 to 10 pm everyday and the rest of the day just goes by like like it just does i am angry a lot angry than i used to be 2 to 3 months ago i mean like i dont know i shouldnt open up to this platform or anything and say all my thoughts but things really related to me in this video like its high time the time when i need to be the most active and running all along with my life the moment when i am just like i need to do something anything or its all gone my future its all gone and i am just wasting all the time i have doing nothing not sleeping either i keep awake till day break and maybe push myself to sleep just so that my whole day doesnt go just weary and doing nothing like i dont know why i am speaking not even speaking typing i didnt expect to nearly cry when i clicked on this video but the messages you gave really resonated with me your popularity allows you to spread motivation and help others through these videos i love you the way you are jack no matter how much youve changed youre still one of my favorite youtubers and i completely understand what you mean i have so many problems with loving myself and i constantly feel like i need validation even though i know i shouldnt jack about to hang out with may meoh im so exctited ad you want some condoms honestly i never cry at video games but mays character hit way too close to home first character i ever relate to is just as suicidal as me makes perfect sense edit sean thank you so much for the last part of the video respect for the video and the good words man thanks jacki needed that this video was beautiful man dont get me wrongi absolutely love and respect jack and you might think of me as a hater but jacksepticeye will live on for 5 years and no more we will probably still get videos and such but the sean that once was wont be there anymore of course it would still be jack of course he will still love his fanbase and his community remember what all for one said to all might about his powers he was just using what was left of it and milking it so people would still see him as a hero even when he couldnt withstand it anymore in my opinion jacks flame has already begun to burn out and just like one for all jacksepticeye will still be jacksepticeye just not the same try taking this as constructive criticism though probably no one will see this youre free to agree or disagree with me its the most heartbreaking thing to see the person that deserves to feel the best feel this bad jack thank you for giving me another spark of hope dude just off the art style i could tell it was the same developer i played this and it hit hard cause ive been there but im doing better and hearing those words from you mean a lot people change dont worry about what they say i love and appreciate you so much sean live your best life thank you sean so much for this and those beautiful and motivational words after thanks for all the great content and everything else your the best and i hope you are happy the way you are keep up the great work do what you want change for you no one else everyone who loves will follow like you for you thats what real friends and family do thanks so much for this video jack really helped me with some heavy thoughts and i can relate to everyting you say well last year i still had my dreamjobsooo thanks i guess youve got a point though there is a fucking lot to live and a few setbacks should never stop you what stopped me from ending it was the thought more like a mantra to me back then what if tomorrow is the best day in your life i know this is a serious game and a serious video but can i talk about mays adorable design its creepy when they say its your birthday theres a girl deeply saying the song happy birthday to you i had to take breaks from watching this video because i related to may so much thank you so much i accept you no matter what jack and do what you feel what needs to be done i understand i also understand the dark thoughts ive dealt with it a long time now trying to not give in thank you about talking about this alot of people dont talk about this kind of thing xd when he was talking about sadness and the problems that we all face out of anytime in my life my computer crashed why pc who else cried a lot of course you changed you became comfortable in your own skin youve realized who you were and became much more mature in your personal identity stay strong jack im gonna give you a hug hug i really appreciate your monologue in this video sean some of this hit real close to home im the type of person who puts aside my own feelings in order to try and help others but usually i end up feeling helpless because theres really nothing i can do besides listen and offer some jokes memes so to anyone who feels stuck and useless you matter dont let anything or anyone else stand in your way youre wonderful and you can do many wonderful things i hope you have a wonderful day or night you all deserve happiness it feels like i should have cried but i didnt i clicked on this bevause i thought it was pokimane i had to take breaks from watching this video because i related to may so much me that last video was quiet last video its been a long day without you my friend me clicks on jack jack top of the morning to ya me falls down screaming in fear im not really great at these but i understand and when the day comes for me to help someone i will but jack for you keep doing what your doing man youre awesome i love watching your videos and i hope you bring laughs to everyone that need it its only human for you to think those thoughts when things do get bad but you should never just brush them off and continue on with life cause chances are they will come back and theyll come back harder if you ever do get to that point where it does cross youre mind you need to talk about it because talking about it and getting help for that one moment could save you from a life time of pain trust me i know im a girl who takes antidepressants because of those moments and i know and knew people in my life who have had those moments too dont make the excuse that you think you are bothering someone cause nine times out of ten they want to be there for you and help you that shit powerful i never show emotion and i was on the break of ending my life and i just want to say that u were a really big help even when i didnt want to watch the video i would just listen to ur voice thank u for showing me hope i would type more but my appreciation for u would be a whole story when i say the title i was like bet its about suicide and yep and thats why i keep watching you thank you so much i really needed that speech sen thank you every time you talk about mental health i always feel so much better it keeps me going sen its true we liked the jack we had two years ago we would all love to keep that jack but the community wouldnt be happy if youre not happy its good that youre the person you are right now also i dont think you care less about the community youre the only youtuber i know that cares so much for his community just please dont start crying the shit i saw from this game and heard in your words jack i realy felt it thank you for making videos like these sean it has really helped me a lot jack you really have changed but in a good way people are attracted to you and your channel because of the energy and the personality but they stay for your heart and honesty with us there are very few youtubers who ive continuously watched for the good part of 4 years i stay because i feel like youre my friend youve kept me up when i was the farthest down i ever was change is good some people just havent found that out yet you care about us and we care about you thats something special even if weve never met edit grammar your so cute oo i wanna freaking hug youuuu yeah call me gay but im not c im really glad jack played this i played it a while ago and watching him play it again gives me a new perspective thank you jack emotional bruh this game hit deep its cool how i was just watching we bare bears and the game has memes about them to anyone thats going through any of this please dont let it get to you and try to talk to people you trust and if those people dont listen to you everyone here on the channel will listen to you and try to help even though i dont know any of you i love you all so much and youre lives mean the world thank you so much for staying strong and hold on until you find people to talk to please dont go think about your best friend shehe will worry that they did something and more times then none they harm themselves so badly that there isnt much hope left in their heart your parents they will always blame themselves and think they did a horrible job as a parent and will beat themselves down every day your siblings they will put themselves down and be in the saddest times theyve ever seen kids at school they will remember you as the kind kid who would let you copy notes or always make sure they didnt miss anything your lives matter please hold on i know im only 13 but if u feel like this please get help my best friend dad sadly didnt i want everyone to feel loved i dont want people to go though my best friend did and his father i love u all shit an hour a work cant even buy a t shirt thats some nice talk thats where you actually gave all of the potential of who you are right at that moment thank u man notice the scissors in the title screen what you said made me think about life and it hurts me because i was just like that now i understand that 1 that no one is really gonna respond 2 that it looks like im trying to get attention and etc but i could care less since im being as genuine as i can but if you feel suicidalunder pressuredepressed or just need someone to talk to im here for you and although i may not be able to help much at least i know that i tried to help this game made me remember that i gently open the door moment this video really touched me the way you talked about your own background and with the games message i have been kind of in and out of depression for a long time and this video really got the tears flowing thank you you have made me realise i should do something about this im not gonna stand for this way of thinking anymore so today i went and opened my heart to my mother and se hugged me said everything would be okay we sat down with my father and talked for about two hours and it helped a lot it made me realise that i have people to talk to and if not parents then friends so again i wanna say thank you and to every body else who feels down or sad please go talk to someone there are always someone who cares keep fighting and thank you am my the only one that cried watching this video there are few people that i tend to listen to when it comes to social media personalities but nobody is so transparent and genuine as you are jack and it really feels like someone you truly know you are the only youtube personality i always watch and follow never change and always keep yourself happy you being unhappy will make a whole lot of others unhappy take care of yourself i hope the people who also have these struggles will get better because no one should feel that way i hope you all have a good day and that it stays that way this motivated me so much thank you ive never cried while watching one of ur videos before so thank you again fuck the 250 disslikes you guys are satan incarnate hey there random person scrolling through the comments how was your day you look great btw

many more good days than bad or hard days trust me that da you know i needed that today thank you jacksen jack should make a asmr video i just wanted to reach through the screen and give him a huge hug this is an amazing game and what he said is so true if anyone wants to talk but prefers someone who doesnt know about their personal lives im happy to listen 3 you are special i saw this for free on steam a week or so ago and it moved me so much glad you got to play it everyonejust shows a version of themselves thay everybody wants to see maybe it is true maybe notbut for mei donteven try im sobad at doing this that i wont even tryifi am hated by people for who i am i will shove my horrible personality into their faces i know this isnt very serious especially compared to the topic but i really want to read the harry potter fanfiction hey sean thank you for saying this for telling all of us this ive been watching youre channel for who knows how long and i always love your content and everything youve done for us never have any video you posted has hit me so hard and so personal that i started crying youre right about never being alone but we feel like we are i just wanted to thank you for saying this because i have being feeling down so much lately and cant tell anyone about it you are one of the best reason why i am who i am today whether it be making others feel better or making me feel worse we all thank you for everything you have given and shown us for the start to the present this is something we i needed right now so again thank you sean and jacksepticeye for the depths of my heart amen brother sean if your channel was dying none of us would be here watching you right now if we didnt care about your thoughts we wouldnt be watching you but we do and i think youre being involved enough you dont have to bend over backwards for us your channel may not have as much upward movement in terms of stats but youre not talking to the void my friend having a large audience means youll have to shut people off from time to time nobody can handle this much attention at once and return it on a personal level we know you think the best of us and care about us and you dont have to remind us that all the time for it to be a thing just keep doing your thing being you and well be here loving and supporting you 3 yo sen i dare you to play reality check through the skull on beat saber its a remix of megalovania from undertale and you know how hard megalovania can be right if you see this comment please play beat saber again and if you do play beat saber again it will be fuuuuuun point of the tangent as i understood dont give everything to others keep some for yourself its okay to be selfish sometimes thank you for saying these things if i had succeeded in giving up when i was younger i wouldnt have the life i live now when sen started talking about 2017 and about things in his head i started to cry i really do understand how it feels to be so stuck that you cant get out but to a lot of people it means nothing just because im 14 yrs old as if my emotions dont matter because i havent experienced things most people older than me have its belittling but thankfully i have a group of excellent role models and great gamers i can go to when im sad thank you sen for being there you will never know how much your videos helped me and i hope you never have a year 2017 again you dont deserve the world you deserve the universe anyone know if the maker of this game has a deviantart i would love to watch them there since i dont have a twitter i know i girl her life is shit she has a boyfriend in england she isnt from there she cuts herself she thinks of suacide i try to help her but now she just doesnt talk to me im sad for her and now i am sad becouse now she will probably kill herself becouse of me i dont want that on my contiance i dont want to know a person who died becouse i couldnt help her and thats jus depresing by itself this game reminds me of a normal missing phone that other game that jack played thanks for opening up sean 3 i have family and friends who struggle with this and ive had such a hard time getting through and

things that are considered right at my age thank you for opening my eye really really good vid and game really love ur stuff man like how you do such good things with your fame to help others man keep

about this game literally yesterday on my lgbt amino life lessons jackaboy i love it u make my day better even watching old videos u make me laugh and i enjoy u thank u for being here jacksepticeye has beautiful eyes this video hit me hard lately ive been feeling so down and useless like im a problem for everyone and i still feel like that because im surrounded by fake best friends that gossip things about me and make me feel like they dont want me in their lives im a very sensitive person and this kind of things hit me hard af but am i a bad person if all i want is just a person that can listen to all my problems and accept all the stupid things i do i have been keeping inside my head all these emotions and i just want to crash i want a break from this life and yeah im suicidal sometimes i wonder if anybody would care if i died and i realize that my family would be the only one that would really care because i would be the second to die after my brother he died because of brain cancer 7 years ago im sorry if im pathetic i know i am but in this moment i just want a big hug and somebody to tell me that everything will be fine thank you sen thank you for ma he brought up etika and that got to me loved that guy rip man i have been through this before someone close to me had died and i felt worse and worse every single day and not reaching out to my friends was the biggest mistake i ever made because i almost went over the edge at one point luckily my friend found me in a depressing moment and helped me out of it honestly without him i would not be here right now just for a message out there if you are going through this please for the love of everything no matter how hard it is reach out to someone else get help even if you just ask to hang out for abit

i love you so much thanks saun dear sean i know its hard when you have millions of voices telling you things about your reality please rest assured your channel is not dying youre not irrelevant and youre still involved with your community we love you the people complaining that youre not as involved as you used to be probably just consider you something akin to a friend and they miss you giving your whole self over to the masses that was a very selfless thing to do but its not healthy or sustainable for you in the long term and nobody can expect that of you please dont feel guilty for not doing that anymore its ok we value you as a human being and it would be really selfish of us to expect you to make yourself miserable to make us happy if we really care about you your happiness should make us happy and to me it does im glad youre feeling more confident now and have found intrinsic self worth youre a wonderful person and deserve to be happy deep down inside never stop t sooo were is

resonates with me man you keep as much as you want to yourself i love you for you no matter how much you change make sure you dont lose yourself keep up the special content that you handcraft for us because we love it x thank you sean im in tears this game is so accurate about how you feel when youre depressed or suicidal it made me remember how hard it was for me before now im crying i fel the same way when i record btw i have 9 subs i feel like im doing good inside i feel like noone cares and when im sad i try to hide it sometimes ive played this game and got all the endings im happy jack played it he has such a sweet fucking heart i love him happy wheels season 2 just thanks i wish i could just talk to someone i have nobody they all left me i wish i could just leave and have friends family or anything at all sounds silly but the feeling of being enough is everything you are anough for yourself and thats it you need no more bad thing with the internet in general is the volume the more you update tweet instagramshare etc is what matters not quality and enjoying mostly is just more more more such as we have so much information but not everyone knows how to find quality ones and the more people share the more entitled others think they are to demand things oh and the anonymity online just allows people to think that they are actions have no consequence at all youre good man thanks for using your platform to enjoy and encourage others and very glad youre better now i really just want jack to be my dad i always resisted the wave of people saying watch this person watch this person i never wanted to come to your channel because you yelled so much and you were super popular which you still are youre quieter now and more of a person than a entertainer thank you so much for taking the time to talk about mental health and especially about your own struggles ive been been getting worse over the past two years and the last few months have been really tough with too many moments longing for it to just stop im now in a place where i found a new and better therapist than last time im moving back to my home town and closer to my family and am taking the days as they come even though some are really hard you speaking up about it and advocating getting help is so so important so thank you from the bottom of my heart 3 jack im so glad you got to this point and that your happy and healthy love your work and have a great respect for youjust be strongeverything gets better and to anyone whos reading thisthere are always people who care about you so just stay in there and reach outwe all are here for you ive had these days before and when i feel sad for no reason i feel stupid like im being stupid and then i just want to sleep so it helps to hear that yall thank you honestly also you can pull away anytime its your personal life and we will support you anyway jack talks my depressioni have only seen this strength once before the boys were here for you what a fricking coincidence that i just played this last night guys think about this what if jacksean never got that shoutout from pewds think about the people he changed what if that never happen think about how much worse alot of ppls lives couldve been for about everyday at least thank sean bc ik alot of ppls lives including my bestest friends has been helped from this man i wanna thank jack thats all hes been such a good influence and help to me and my best friends and alot of other ppl thank u jack love u bro no it doesnt seem like you dont care to me i might sometimes sound offensive when im trying to sound funny so sorry for that but what i see is a bit more calm and relaxed sean not that it was bad when you were more energized you still are a lot more energized than i am im an introvert who would love to be more energized but socializing and all the beeps time limits sounds chaotic atmosphere just wears me out quite easily and thats just who i am you are far from uncaring person as far as i can tell x3 i have subscribed to you xp i dont subscribe to people who seem too selfish and uncaring x3 and i say seem because well i only see the version they want me to see this is why ive tried to tell people about the importance of first impression but when teres all the time coming more and more videos person might choose a video that probably wouldnt give the best impression of the video maker so not that simple i suppose the best thing t to be honest after the game was done and jack started to talk i took my phone and reached out to all of my good friends to make sure theyre all ok and tell them how much they mean to me i used to be really depressed and nobody would ever check on me but these kind of videos helped me a lot thats why i love jack so much and why hes my role model he didnt have to take his time to tell us all of these things after the game was done yet he did i always try to be there for anyone that needs help if youre reading this please do the same much love to yall have a great day and take care of you many youtubers do not talk about this and im glad you brought this up sean many kids and adults feel like they are alone and most need the validation and support just thank you sean i never thought id say that jacksepticeye is really my favorite youtuber when may and her talked it made me feel better because in some sort of way it made me realize that i dont talk to people about my problems because i fear that it will cause them to be scared and worried about me i have never related to a character but may may felt like i was looking in a mirror with her problems and fears with life to even the scary about suicide it felt like i was seeing my life threw someone elses eyes the creator of this game is amazing this game makes me feel like there are other things to help myself without hurting myself and jacks message at the end is really driving me to ask for help from family and friends because to be honest i need help and just like may i really needed this push man what a great video im a hipster and feel everyone around me and stupid well get through this we all will somehow someway were all gonna make it i needed this video thank you we all appreciate you being so kind and caring about us love you man never that easy i know some parts of this game like sent it home like i could put myself in there shoose like when they talked about what would happen when you would die how and what people would think and how there lives would go on whitout me thease thots moustly pop in my head when i am alone in quitnes and just felt wierd and uneasy okay that all realy sounded depressing really appreciated the real talk at the end there i needed that 3 i really relate to this gameim really going threw alot right nowi dont show it and i think thats my biggest mistakei feel things would have been better if i just opened my mouthbut sometimes its so hard to say something because i feel like people just dont careand wouldnt miss me if i was gone there are days when i cant go on when my life goes cold but i just need to continue and remember the happiness of old when i need encouragement and need to know that im still alive i open my computer and listen to the highfive sen you help us in many ways some of us need you to keep moving on you are the best not just because of the charity live streams or any of the pma talk but just because you are real you dont just put the best of you on twitter and youtube but you put both best and worst you dont edit out the emotional stuff because you think we wont like it you dont fake anything like this thank you for giving us hope your fans family first off you should never apologize for your tangents because i honestly love those parts in your videos its like a small therapy session for me i find it very difficult to be open and speak up without choking this game hit me hard because ive lived something similar but i kept it quiet i always lived seeking validation of others because i dont see myself as someone who has value im facing many difficulties regarding my identity and lifestyle youre so inspiring to me and i really wish for you and everyone reading this a very happy life i dont want anyone living the way im living so please dont make the mistakes i do i am trying to improve but it is not easy when i dont even trust my own shadow your the 88 video i ever liked him talking about how people might want him to be how he used to be made me want to bring this up i did not watch jacks channel before now i do i prefer the way he is less burnt out and more happy and more his own person thank you for your words it means so much i am so glad i started watching your videos and i am so glad you think this way i had a sleepover with friends yesterday to today and i spent almost the whole time off youtube i missed nothing except for this but even this i managed to watch it right after so you know what i regret nothing about taking my time off the world can be a pain and we are small in comparison but we grow and we learn and we try get out of bed you dont have to smile if you arent happy instead find something to make you happy talk to people about why you were sad if you were sad for no reason talk about that too believe in not only yourself but the world it screwed you over yesterday but believe that it might get better i am the guy that is hard to get with this stuff but jack got to me now have stomp in my throat just wanting to hug somebody you are the best sean 3 you know what sean i like the changes youve made because you like the changes you madeif you had stayed the happy go lucky guy you were you but felt as you did nowthen i wouldnt mind but since you finally feel valid and feel that you are your own person i feel that you are the person you want to be but at the same timedont listen medont listen to anyone everyone elses opinions arint worth your time because its not yours your opinion on yourself and what your doing should be the only one that mattersbecause in they endyour alive for yourselfnot for others remember that wow i write stories in my free time and i always told myself id just keep it as a hobby because i dont think ill ever be good enough to make a profit out of it and man that section where they talked about it helped me keep my motivation to keep writing just because i love it and its fun if i make money then thats amazing that shit really hit deep manthank you for your words sean we all love you and many of us understand what you re taking about remember to take a break if you need it we will understand practice what you preach gotta stay mentally healthy to keep a pma like her roommate is saying all the things that i didnt know how to say but i knew thats how i felt oh and

doing what youre doing i have a friend who is suffering with severe depression and she tells me how shes always fighting for me because she doesnt want to disappoint me but the thing is if she ever did anything i would blame myself for not being there for her but its just so hard when i dont know whats going through her mind bro this game is so real sean i dont care if im the only person that watches u anymore or if everyone here feels the same we are all always here for you no matter what even if you disconnect youtube for a year or if u stop forever we dont care cuz we care about you and want u to feel like youtube is a good job and a good place to be in life but whenever you need a break from this social bubble you can take one and one more thing dont feel like you dont mean jack

whenever you feel like u need a shoulder to lean on well youve got lots right here that are always available sen i cant express how it makes me feel when you do games and videos like this i cant say what you do and dont go through yet you do videos like this to connect to your viewers that do go through stuff like this ive lost count of how many times ive laughed my tears and anxiety away from your videos last time you were in the usa missouri specifically you were performing near me i was going to kill myself that same week but wanted to come see you even more youve saved my life and probably many more whether you meant to or not dont stop being you sen we love you and this coming from me as a human to human not lowlife to youtube idol as a friend because its who you are we are here for you too we arent just a fanbase we arent just the people who find you only an entertainer and gamer we want to be here for you the way youre here for us this is inspirational and emotional at the same time i dont watch jack usually but i saw this beautiful art and had to now i have a new favorite youtuber we care about you sean dont worry about taking a break if u need one take one i literally played this game two days ago and now youre playing it uuwwuuu i know that several people are going to say things like this but here we go good for sean about being real and being realistic about his internet persona also for separating work and life even in a career like this where he is so visible food on him for being transparent about stuff like this yeah i feel may ive gone throgh this two youre so human i love it thank you for voicing this its so important for people to know how important their happiness is your so sweet and i dont know how to thank you for giving me hope things havent been great for a really long time now like just feeling lost personal problems and all that i dont know what to sayjust thank you for helping me and soooo many other people see the light zephyo oh i love her art free hugs you can do this thank you for talking about feelings in the end it does help a lot i have been in the same state of may physically and mentally to know that im not alone it really helped plz dont cry it makes me cry to im that helpful friend im always there or trying my hardest to be there i put the happyness of other before me because it seeing others happy and smile warms me i do it because i feel to far into to the darkness that i dont want others to fall in when he talks about the other people getting to your own businessthis reminds me of deji with ksi jack what are your favorite memes me keanu reeves memes shit got too real and i cried holy shit its my birthday today lool aye its ice bear you should be a therapist sometimes you look for a long long time and just find nothing its difficult and we all know you understand that i personally have tried to end it time and time again and failed and i know im not the only one whos tried a million times when you cant even kill yourself right you feel pathetic ive seen so many professionals and i just cant find one i can talk to i have no friends my family has their own issues and i cant feel comfortable talking to them everyone needs someone to make them feel loved at least until theyre taught to love themself and some of us dont have that teacher sorry had to get this out thank you sean talking about this stuff helps so much an helps so many peaple and you bottling stuff like that up doesnt help letting it out does help i personally hated the jacksepticeye from a few years ago anytime i tried to watch your videos i was just annoyed by you the way you acted and the way you said things now i legitimately enjoy your content sure it has its problems and there are always things that i dont care for but for the most part it is hard for me to tell that the jacksepticeye from 2014 is the same one we have now its very very obvious sen really cares about this situation and he really wants us to know we arent alone we have the entire community and its not selfish to reach out this clearly hits home for a lot of people sen and i included if anyone needs someone to talk to im here anyone can talk to me im a highschool sophomore in america who has felt like the people in this game and who has reached out for help you can make it through whatever youre going through pls sub to dylan ereabus i had some thoughts about this too when i walked down a street once i thought what will happen if i jump towards a car before i was that thinking i was at school and some of my classmates bullied me i was soo sad and i just wanted to end my life but i cried myself out and i found my own thoughts again and was good again and because of you i found my self confidence backthank you for doing this stuff and talk about this stuff too you should play here they lie i think you will like it my current partner at this time is suicidal they voiced it to me that they were going to kill themself but when we had gotten together i had helped them see their road of life and they could see that their journey was not over yet ive known them for 2 years and ive been with them for 7 months july 26th of this year will be 8 months i love them more than anything they have helped me take my recovery from an eating disorder more seriously and im glad to know that ive helped them on the road to truly becoming happy i hope i can see the day where theyre happy without faking it without meds without a mask when that day comes ill be there just in case they fall again what im trying to say is your actions can make a difference in someones life you can save them from falling into a deeper rut that leads to nothing you can help build them stronger you cant fix someone but you can help them so they can be a step closer to fixing themselves if you have a friend i thee kind of videos and games always hits home but i really appreciate them it makes both u sean and us reflect and feel less alone ps im so glad for you that your mental health is getting better and that you take time for yourself jack thank you for taking your time when discussing these heavy topics i dont cry easily but this game was something else i dont know you personally and i probably never will but i hope you have a happy and fulfilling life even after youtube love from finland omg my friend and i literally played this together like a week ago is it just me or did anyone else want to cry immediately after seeing the home screen and hearing the music i know that no one probably cares but i just need to get this off my chest soooooo here goes nothing in april four of my best friends died also my boyfriend got cancer and wont make it to our next anniversary i have no one i really trust so i told no one i also got bullied severely so hard that i got ptsd some people say i shouldnt act the way i do but its only to protect me so what i wanna say is thanks i wanna thank you sean for helping you dont know me how could you but i watched you since your first project i met my boyfriend through this community and he made my life so much more bearable thanks for letting me shut off my brain for at least a few minutes per day i know some people have it worse i always feel bed when i rant like this because it could be so much worse but i have no one to talk to and like i said i needed to get this off my chest i dont know if im gonna end it all one of my friends committed suicide and im sure i can last 20 mins was exactly what i needed to hear thanks sean sean i just wanna say thank you you will never be irrelevant to me i think that everything you do is important when you need to take time for yourself you should if people cant see that they need to take time to reflect on what type of person they want to be you dont need to stay the same growing as a person is a good thing to do for yourself stay happy 3 this comment isnt just for sen its for anyone who is just having a bad day and they need to know there is someone who cares about them in the world i as well lost a friend recently to suicide he was one of the most kiindest and caring people i had ever met him being gone tore our friend group apart i miss him everyday i miss his smile his laugh when hed help me whenever i needed help he always said i love you i didnt always say it back im so sorry i didnt say it back i loved you more than you know thank you for the awesome gameplay and talk i really like games that give light to mental health or just issues in general stop your great i would like to share this not to ask for someone to pity me but for someone to read this and hopefully can help them a little so i have these thoughts quite often and i feel as if i need to please others to make my life better i have heard for years elders and influencers telling me over and over it will change you will never have these thoughts for ever people can help you i was always keeping this out of mind because i had realized that it wont change i did end up cutting but i saw that it hurt my mom so i didnt do that i was constantly screaming inside i got to a point i would start messing up my words when i would talk and when someone was talking i had to tune them out because it was to much but i got to say i have a best friend that changed me she made me love myself and even though our friendship may be falling apart now because she got popular she thought me things and i found another friend that helps me i know im still not the best right now but im telling you 223 i have the same photos for some reason hehekek i needed that talk in the end thank you that uno reverse bit was funny whoever made this game knows how to do modern story thank you sean we know that you care and it shows dont worry about us too much sen we want you to be happy too jack has a great narrator voice that was the most heartfelt 20 minute conversation ive ever experienced and i want to thank sean for putting forth his experiences and how he felt proving truth of what everyone doesnt talk about and just plainly hitting emotions i didnt know i had to come out so cleanly on how he felt makes me feel like i can do more and to realize exactly what he said take one step at a time try to not compare yourself and be around people who love youbecause those are what will come to matter from this i will definitely try harder to find my motivation again and to seek what i want to love because im not sure it will be a hard journey but trying to find that better outcome will keep you going know that you are loved even if i dont know who you are i care so damn much for you if i come to discover some crazy good thingsill have you to thank sean youre amazing sean ive been suffering with anxiety and depression for a few years now and i started to speak with a counsellor about my biggest fears and everyday life and i feel so much better i actually tried self harming but i was to afraid that the one time i did it would be the last so i stopped and im so incredibly grateful that i have amazing friends and family youre speech was amazing sean it really touched me and its true what you said about most people not knowing what happens once the camera is turned off i love you sean and i love your inspirational speeches keep it up ps i really wish i could give you a hug everybody like so sean can see please it

hope to be here for yours and well all get through it in your deepest of times just know that it is going to get better because it has to hope is a powerful drug i say that speaking from experience 108 did enyone notice the colored flag of the back pma pma pma this video upload if the first time i cried like a baby since i waswella baby etikas death sucked suicide by drowning is absolutely dreadful and no one should ever have to do that ive almost drowned about three times and its the worst etika wherever you may rest be it any afterlife the reader believes in rest in peace you didnt deserve it i gently open the door my name is brad i am unable to admit my issue my issue metaphorically has a hand over my mouth i am tired often but i just tell people that i didnt get enough sleep i lack motivation to do things that i want to so i end up just playing video games all day but i do hate myself not in the way that you think but i hate myself because i force myself to do things that my body and mind are not willing to do i know i need to let my dogs out but body wont budge so i force it my mind doesnt want to come up with a new story to write so i force it i probably have the strongest will power anyone could ever have but im so busy using it to combat my issue that nobody ever gets to see it i hate myself because i make myself do things that i dont want to do because i

really needed this thank you jack i like that you changed for yourself and didnt stay the same for other people i like your videos even better now than before because its the ral you thank you so much for evrithink youve done to make me smile keep on moving forwered im not trying to be much but i can just look in a persons eyes and see their pain and just like you were saying in the video that youve gone through a lot i can see it and how you just pushed some of it to the side and try to always look at the positive side sean you are such an inspiration to the world letting people know they are not alone and that they can get help that they can be helped that suicide is never the way out thank you for being an amazing role model to millions much love that was a good way to discuss depression and what it really is people think its just a constant sadness but its so much worse ive had a major depression and just like may i was tired all the time it didnt matter how much i slept the depression only got worse and eventually i enjoyed nothing all my hobbies were meaningless i failed at school because i couldnt even read 2 sentences without forgetting what i just read i had tremors from severe anxiety and was constantly anxious about everything then one day i sat on the bus on my way home and thought life is only getting worse i am becoming more pathetic by every year and even my therapist tells me im a lost cause i might have to kill myself thats when it hit me and i knew i meant it realizing you are suicidal is a scary feeling its impossible to explain it its like a hidden feeling on the spectrum like you know anger joy sadness etc from birth and suddenly you discover this thing and its lik thank you for this video i feel this way but every time i think im going to go kill myself you come up with a video or a speech like you did in this video if not you i would of been dead a long time ago now i have a friend and she is going thru the same thing this girl in this game was maybe i can help her more i cant always be there because im only 14 but i help her as much as i can im just scared its not enough this is soo deep and i feel you sean damn that

people can go through this when others have it at age like 15 i know its stupid to say this but this is more common than people make it out to be edit ok maybe not 89 but still this is so much more common then people make it out to be oh god i love that line this made me both really happy and hate existing help me i dont know what to do it getting hard for me i try to put on a brave face but it fills like i dont have nothing emotions are hard for me have a nice day is is my father account i just wanted to say something i relate heavily to everything that he said his words hit me hard this made me really think i have been in bad places myself and hearing this rant made me cry hell this game made me cry because how much i put myself in that ive been in and how much i share avout myself sometimes because i felt like i needed to be that way this made to think and im glad it did and i feel allot better this is s good video jack thank you thank you for talking about this and im proud your trying to take care about yourself im glad your in a good place keep doing what you love dear sean my name is brandon i am 22 years old and have been watching your videos since i was 14 i want you to know just how much your content and community have meant to me over the years for a long time i was sad and suffering silently on the inside from moving to new states to having to make new friends at new schools it got really bad a couple of years ago when i began having suicidal thoughts and i hit my all time low just last year with my only every failed attempt but through all of it you and the content you make were there through out the years you have made me smile laugh my ass off cringe my guts out and cry my face off but through all of that you have made me feel like i am not alone and i will be forever great full for that i started therapy a few weeks ago and i want to personally thank you for being a pillar of support love pma and joy for a good chunk of my life thank you sean brandon thank you jack youre an amazing person and im glad you made this video because it really has helped me i played this and it escalates so fuckin quick ahhh the background music thank you i needed that speech i have felt so depressed lately and that talk went to heart i am fine with the way you are doing youtube now and i will grow with you sometimes you can make videos like that just to clean your head if thats what you want then do it i rarely if ever comment on jacks videos but i relate to what jacksepticeye was saying in the video and have been in a similar spot at one point dont worry about me im happy and living a good life now and i agree 100 with everything jack said in his speech remember everyone there is always hope dont ever give up this video made me cry i feel the same vibes i love this game just wanted to say thank you for talking about this my father committed suicide i have had issues with depression and thoughts of suicide and my son also has had the same issues it is so important that people become more aware of what it really means to suffer from depression and know how to better help those who need it thank you again for being open and honest about your experiences i love how sean uses genderneutral pronouns i teared up the moment jacks eyes reddened when people talk about emotions and they actually start feeling those emotions they seem more human and more relatable i like were your heart is and keep making time for yourself i love the art style for this im guessing that dream had something to do with her realsationhip with her dad were here for you jack b baka im not crying im just sweating in my eyes jack i fucking love you this this is why he is my favorite youtuber i remember how i first found out about sen i was in a very dark place and looked up motivational videos and the first thing that came up was a compilation of these kinds of videos where he just sits down and talks and basically tells whoever is watching that everything will be okay i remember crying while watching them and suddenly i felt so validated and hopeful thank you jacksepticeye you will never truly know just how much your words help us 3 wow needed this game i feel so heavy after this but i also feel content i agree a lot with jack and ive had both myself and friends in a somewhat similar situation hugs to jack and everyone in the comments were gettin wholesome here now i really would like may and oc as a couple man i feel like such an ignorant person ive always said that jack changed hes getting worse every word you said was absolutely 100 right i myself always care about others than me and that crap hurts me slowly i think everybody should love themselves more than anyone else cause you will end up crazy and worry some person about your surroundings and burn out eventually i cant really control that but i know i will fix myself somehow i really appreciate everything youve said in this video and almost teared up youre one truly amazing and very caring person always maintain pma it may be hard but it does help i love you so much you dont know me but your words really helped and touched me thank you for everything youve done i feel like a lot of usyour fans wouldnt mind you taking a break so long as youre healthy and happy and okay then were okay at least i am i love you and your videos and personality so much and i hope you continue being amazing and happy jack is the best youtuber my sister needs to watch this she all was cut her self jack is the best yo jack if u see this comment i made a donation to you and you didnt respond to it and i get that there was alot of donations i do and you probably didnt see it but if you could look at it it would mean alot thx jack i actually played this game a few weeks ago im glad jack played it i thought it was really good omg i get the title of the game you have missed messages even though it could relate to the computer at the start it actually relates to what you did in the start ignoring may you lead to heri guess cutting the cored the main character missed the signs of her roommate being sad and depressed leading to what a lot of people turn to just know there are people to talk to like your favorite youtubers or a close friend or family member i am also here to talk if you guys need it have a safe and happy life also pride month me scrolling though every comment not looking just liking thank you jack i really needed to hear this right now this is so accurate and so relatable at least for me my best friend told me to watch this video he knew it would hit close to home but it opened his mind to be honest may is kinda like me or am i kinda like her im not sure this game is awsome and its so truthful i will always appreciate your opinion you do you need a break take one comfort your self i loved the video game your narrating the whole video was a work of art this hits home went through a lot last year i mean i feel much much better now actually i am really happy never was this happy in my life i hope that people go out there and just pursue happiness it might not seem easy but its worth it because you are worth it i love your kind words sean keep it up and you guys out there too you deserve absolute happiness try your absolute best your doing great this game even though it hit some pretty sensitive topics is amazing and when you said that i cried a bit im not exactly sure why thoughor maybe i am and i just dont know how to put into words i am happy but i just i dont know but thank you for saying that it means a lot ah shit what do i say how about stare into the sky thanks seanyour vids help me alot they make me happy when nothing else can creators block is a curse thats been in my head for a long time for drawing not like making video games or anything i want to become a therapist for people i havent had the happiest life but i want others to thx sean for everything really this game feels so relatable and real hold on one of the endings said evan thats my name what this game is the closest game that i have ever watched it hit so close to home on both sides being the person whos struggling but so scared to reach out to others but also being the person who had to support a friend going through so horrible shit last school year has been the hardest so much work but you had no time falling asleep in class then being yelled at and told to sleep earlier when all you do i did was sleep and contemplate my life why was i here what is my worth to the world would anyone remember me will i be forgotten i have had though of ways i could die and how my familyfriends would react the person i was before has changed so much to smiling cracking jokes and not shy to do anything to a girl who was to self conscious about herself to wait problems have axienty to do anything wrong letting others down not smiling having suicidal thoughts to self harming i was always tought not to cry me taking it as not to be sad if i cried i was weak if i was i cried so much and so hard during this watching you talking about those dark thoughts and reaching out great game great video deep moving and really touching green hair now or no more food now get in your cage this hits me hard dude this game i beautiful but hits to hard to life you are such a good human thank you for this sean thank you for literally existing there has been times when i think about giving up but then i watch your videos and smile you make me so happy damn alright thanks jack thank you sean for just being you youve helped not only me get through the hard times throughout the years but many others in the community i love you and what you do man you always give me hope in the sense that its all going to turn out for the better ive been feeling a similar way described in this video and youve helped a lot its not extreme just been feeling lost and not knowing what to do im relieved in knowing that ive had you to look up to for i dont even know how long keep being your lovingself and stay strong were all here for you have a great day 3 that was really weird considering todays my birthday ive been legit bawling oml thank you so much for everything you said sean its really hit me in the best way possible pma for the win i felt like i m incarnated as may in this game i dont have suicidal thinks but i got a lot of pressure about my studies from my family too but i still know its from my own good and i m also a beginer in writing i m writing my own novel my uh exgirlfriend was psychomaniach and she used to manipulate peoples feelings she was seen as a happy person looking for love or something but in reality she was nuts she would constantly send me audios saying she needed me and i was there for her one day i got notice that she was cheating on me with my best friend my best friend didnt know we were together and i was mad with her i cut with melissa my ex and she went with rakkun best friends nickname in the band rakkun really thought that she loved melissa but melissa was actually not in love with her once we were doing a meetup and i wanted her kicked considering it was not the first time she cut with someone because of similar things and she said johan that rakkun was a replacement for me i heard that and recorded the conversation and showed it to rakkun she said it was just me tryna get back melissa in my life but i brought backup with me one of her exs testified against her in rakkuns frie i have been in the shoe of me feeling alone and i feel like i lie to me and everyone around me and i feel like that so thank for the talk sen thank you jack the stuff that happened in the video ive had those thoughts time and time again the talk at the end really helped me out i feel better about myself now i see what ive accomplished ive had thoughts of suicide before lots of them but i feel like im happier now keep doing what your doing sean you mean alot to all of us i tell myself to shut up and get myself distracted to keep my mind quiet jack hun u are such an amazing person who has so much insight to the world as someone who everyday has suicidal feelings from

amazing talk at the end so thank you for this today i had a mental breakdown and i just needed to take my mind off the world and started watching this and you really spoke to all my problems by talking about the social media and how much it affects us and i personal thank you for bringing it to peoples attention and how much it can effect people so thank you sean i recently played this game could only get two of the four endings beautiful and touching work me and my best friend this is scarily close to us i am to scared of pain to do anything but she has done so much and its so sad cause shes so beautiful and talented and smart but people have brung both of us down and it hit her worse and were building each other back up i hope people can get help because its not something people should deal with alone thank you sean for everything you do i have some moments when i just feel alone but with your videos it makes me forget and remind me that i am never alone thank you sean you have saved my life many times so thank you this was a well needed thing in my life thank you jack until recently i just looked at peoples depression like it was kindaidknot as important as it was but then my friend came into school with a cut wrist and an acquaintance from my singing lessons too and then i realized that it was a really big issue that doesnt just happen to them but could also happen to us i hope to help people at least a little by supporting them a little more now getting serious cake waltz by jimin vibes from the art you will not long remember the friends you have laughed with but you will not forget the ones you have cried with wheres the high five as someone who is trying to start valuing themeselves thanks for that talk jack though i wont be noticed i just need to say that anyway ive been watching for 5 years and not once have i been noticed it sucks to be me dude thank you for that amazing speech its rly struck home with me and thank you for opening my eyes im going to try and quiet the noise step by step i can relate to this game this is why i love your channel sean thank you for sharing your feelings with us i love that these types of games were created i relate so heavy to this and i didnt have a friend to help me through this i owe my parents for my life rn because without them i probably wouldnt be here not trying to sound wierd but it takes a lot of balls to open up about things like this welldone i needed to hear this today and so did a whole bunch of people thankyou jack your a hero to so many people especially me we love you can you please stop putting your titles like that for example use this new game missed messages gameplay this hit so damn hard jack thanks for the pma ive watched you since 2016 haters gonna hate haters back off dont let them get to you you are perfect the way you are and nothing should ever change that top o the mornin to ya d thank youi dont even know what more to say just thank you ive had some rough years dealing with bullying and my best friend moving away and the other backstabbing me but ive found out that creating things makes me happy to all the people who are having a rough time do what you love not what others want you to 20172018 were the worst times in my life jack so youre not alone i am very happy to see that youre doing better and i hope you continue with it im so glad i overcame the depression ive had for 4 years i hope that everyone finds happiness and love oh god now i actually want to talk about whats happening to me in a swarm of strangers well here i go im trying therapy thats terrifying to me talking to a stranger i say talking to millions of strangers about what i feel and then they tell me theres something wrong with me and try to fix it and i hate certain things that happen to me certain thoughts i think and i want it to stop but its terrifying and i know this is stupid but i dont know who ill be once im fixed so yeah there ya go strangers as someone with a very long history with depression and suicidal tendencies this game was hard to watch having not only lost freinds and family to suicide but considered it myself these are always hard kinds of games for me and i love them they bring attention to something very real and serious in the world in a media many more people will reach and try out it in a way its nice seeing games that touch on this stuff it makes it feel like something i can talk about makes it seem like maybe people who are struggling will see that they can reach out more games that show how even seemingly happy people can struggle that dont demonize this stuff that show its not the end of the world yet i love it but theyre still very hard to watch your speech at the end is so sweet 3915 that really hit me hard by birthday is on the 10th of july and i have nobody to spend it with and very little of my family lives with me and it just pains me that i dont have friends to talk to or hang out with for my birthday i cried writing this jack ur my favourite youtuber and i loveee ur videos keep up the good work broooo this video mad me cry like a baby considering i had no one to help me through my depression i was lucky to have just such a happy friend group that made me better its back but i can control it a little i hope i get better but this video is so powerful and thank you jack because this is kinda attention craving kinda talk but you helped me too just from your videos and making videos like these knowing theres hope and something better thank you look people this is me talking to you right now if youre going through anything and you feel like youre sad or its not worth it to keep going please for everyone seek help without going into too many details im only 16 and ive dealt with this 4 times there is always someone who will listen theres always a way to help suicide or self harm is never the answer there are people that care about you and love you regardless of what you think so again if youre going through anything of this sort please seek help if i could do it while in the darkest part of my life you can too we allow you to take a day break per week if you want we love you anyway why wouldnt we hey sean you always apologise for going on tangents but i wanna tell you every time you go on one you save lives i know i could listen to those tangents all day long they brighten my day honestly you could post like once a month and i would still tune in to every episode no amount of my entertainment is worth your beating yourself into the ground so im glad you found your balance we love you for who you are sean of course we will grow with you the people who wont and want you to be a certain way can go fck themselves you are so amazing and you deserve praise for who you are ive played this game myself but im happy to see you playing it as well and will definitely be giving it a watch later when i get the chance jack dont think you need to give us everything at the end of the day i just like your gameplay and i dont always need a friend to tell me everything so your a great friend to me and dont make yourself feel like you have to share your life with 22 million people we will always love your content and your attitude this gave me crazy ddlc flashbacks i am so happy that this game was made it was really realistic it was kinda weird how realistic it was it was beautiful im glad you talked about your feelings with us even though you dont know us im happy you felt that you could talk about it with us thanks if youve ever felt alone and lost in a crowd of people know that im there somewhere too just as alone yet together with you thank you sean for choosing to be alive and fighting those thoughts what you said was what i needed to hear thank you jack i honestly love u for all that u are ik thats not a lot but thats all i got to say for one person bc even being u urself genuine w no effort has done so much for so many people thank u sean changes hair colour loudness swearing or not me i dont care what sean looks like or sounds like i just like waching him for him and because he is a garlic gladiator with the best garlic bread ill be honest ive lost some people to suicide but ive also helped my closest friends out of their dark place the saddest part of this game is how it said it was based on a real story if you or a loved one needs help please dont be afraid to reach out please please please dont wait or it could be too late and sean the only thing that has changed about you that i dont really like is your introoutro i miss the old sign off but you have grown so much and you are still an amazing person you need to have time to yourself like any other person i dont have any issues with my mental health but i really loved this i was so relaxed and my mind was feeling so open like i was thinking about how people live hidden behind a facade i could listen to you talking about your thoughts for hours thank you so much sean for everything some of the more specific things you said connected directly to things that im trying to work through today such as getting up and actually having breakfast videos like these mean a lot to me and i hope you know how much you are appreciated about the developer if pronounced in chinese he would pronounced similar to the word her but without the r sound you can open google translate set to chinese and paste to hear it thank you jackthank you i had a suicidal episode over a weekend this month and im just so frustrated and sad i know i have dozens of friends who love and miss me but youre right your brain can say stupid lies to bring you down stop youre making me cry this hit too close to my heart and personal experiences i didnt plan on crying today damn it jack also want to know what a hipster is come to portland or then youll meet hipsters to everyone thinking about self harm and suicide to everyone self harming to everyone with an attempt or attempts behind in your life there is someone who cares about you someone who loves you there are ways out of that state dont stay alone with your problems talking can make them easier i love you and i love every single member of this community with all of my heart if anything ever goes on or anyone needs help reach out to anyone a professional a loved one someone you trust a friend myself anyone someone cares i promise omg i played this game before you and now i feel really accomplished for some reason this was a serious video you know sean you will always make my day these days were so hard for me so i went on youtube watched some of your videos and i felt happy already you will always be here for us and we will always be here for you thank you for telling this message man this game hit home for me and seans talk at the end really helped me i needed this today thank you sean i just want to say thank you i had a suicide attempt a few years back and while i was in the hospital i found your videos and they helped me a get through the hard times both in the hospital and out now i am out of my depression got a new job and cut out the toxic people in my life i couldnt have done it without your help to everyone who is going through a hard time it gets better there is a light at the end of the tunnel you are loved you are needed i needed this today thank you i dont know why but im smiling after watching this video thank you sean jack go without the man bun beautiful game yet i cant help but get annoyed by the foot of the protagonist at about 2000 like wtf its so deplaced and ugly if you need to take time off go for it its your life we dont control you do what you want i really appreciate you talking about and playing these kinds of games it shows me that there are people out there going through and experiencing the same kind of loss that i feel my sisters boyfriend had recently committed suicide and nothings been the same since thank you sean for making his loss at least a little bit more easier to handle if things turn out as i think they will i will probably die a bit after the 6th of jully the last straw after 5 years of depression without any medical help well any help at all actually fake friends dont help guys ive come this far by myself against all odds but hey its not like my best is enough for anyone and certainly not myself protip if you want to raise your survival chances yall focus on tolerating then appriciate then love yourself because fighting alone against the whole world when youre not even on your own side well i tried take care of yourself and just hang on when the ground split under you whoever you are good luck out there youre ok talking about it you didnt lose your point you werent complaining this was good i played this last night i cried my eyes out i guess it just brought back some bad memories lord this hit hard the story and the art of the game was amazing and seans commentary is honestly so touching keep making amazing videos shes holding a pusheen puppy u have my respect jack sub to me jack should make a mental health podcast tbh his speeches in these types of games actually have been helping me figure out how to work through my depression and anxiety cried love you and love ms he i felt so much of this video and i will be happy to be a part of this community for as little or as much as you want to give us i love your old videos for their bubbly factor but i like the person you are now just as much someone heartfelt ive never been one for role models but man i look up to you so much thank you and lots of love great message jack some points hit me good thank you for making this video keep being you well be here no matter what 3 oh i love the mcdonalds shamrock shakes i cried for a solid 30 minutes after watching thisthank you jackmy 48 foundation is wasted tho the music in the background is losing intrest but slowed down extremelyi think the dev picked it because its kinda depressing which would fit the suicidal mode and self harm vibe in the game why does this have 288 dislikes you worded everything really well and sensibly hi sean you probably wont read this but i know how hard it must be to manage such a large fan community people dont like to encounter change and ive seen comments about the intro outro and green hair on your other videos it must be really hard to improve yourself when everyone around seems to want to send you backwards i and pretty much everyone commenting or watching this video appreciate you for who you are now i hope you can continue to improve and just be yourself and have fun in videos ill keep watching and thank you for being here this video should be trending so that more people can feel like they do have the power when they feel like they dont lmao thanks for uploading sean your videos always cheer me up when im feeling down especially when you actually talk about topics like suicide and depression it sorta shows me everything will be alright if that makes sense also for me social media helps me with my depression and suicidal thoughts because it destracts me from them i tried talking to my best friend not to long ago because i was really close to committing suicide and she never replied same with my other friends i know they care about me but they just never try at least to talk to me when i text them about this type of stuff thats why i like social media because it lets me forget and i can talk to people online that actually seem to care about a random stranger thats going through some shit ive started crying when i saw the cuts on mays armthat shit hit hard to me and then when sean started talkingi left like i wasnt alone anymorelike if i ever need helpi will come listen to this video thank you sean sometimes life really fucking sucks like a lot but the thing is that you are only going through a dark phase in your life like me personally i cant find any reason to like myself like i look in the mirror and the only thoughts that go through my head is how ugly i am and things like that and its people like you sean who can make me smile and make me have a moment of happiness so i genuinely want to thank you and i just want to say that i care about you for who you are and just again thank you so much for making the world a better place i love how both playthroughs went in opposite directions the first ending being the sadder one the second ending ideally i feel like jack played this as smart as he could also ive been in ruts like this in fact im in one right now i dont know what i want to do with my life im trying to get into baking so i can have a sustainable job that i can actually enjoy but while i enjoy when i am baking just getting myself motivated to start is a real chore the cake decorating is even worse as that takes a lot more practice than the actual baking i also want to make some video games and even have one idea developing in my head and i even have some characters designed the biggest problem is im the definition of a noob the only real video game ive ever seriously played is undertale granted game ive been brainstorming is a visual novel similar to this one but i also have other more complex ideas that actually involve gameplay also id need to put together som who else watched this and was like please dont start cryingg to yourself ive been there in fact i still am sad and depressed hopeless i know exactly how may feels in fact ive been in her exact position many times but luckily im still here so im just saying if you are someone whos going through that type of thing keep on trying youll get through it eventually im still recovering but i can see light at the end of the tunnel and over time you will too i listened to this about 10 times over for awhile my guys because this was amazingly open about emotions in a whole really needed thisreally im here for you this comment section is so comforting i want to give everyone hugs and hot cocoa shit you got all deep with your feels you got me feels all messed up i needed this where has the high five sound effect gone when sean was at the part when he was laying on the bed with may it sounded like xxxtentacions kill me was playing in the background and it made me so sad when sean said it seemed very on the nose to not be inspired by real life as well my first thought was well yea i mean most people feel this stuff i can strongly relate to mays character i just need to find that someone who will help me i really enjoyed watching you play this game thank you for playing sean 3828 ive never seen this man go speechless it was sad and scary how he just cut out like that i see myself in may although writing for her is youth work for me i was so aggressive so sad but felt nothing that is until i forced myself out of the house to join my local council and since then with the help of therapy ive finally become a person im happy to call my own now i have a career path im passionate enough to work for as well as a lot of experience in the field and happy memories i can cherish im glad i didnt end it and im glad you didnt either who else thought it would be an etika video i dont give a damn about what anybody says about you youre still the best youtuber on the planet would say best person but my brothers got that position sry but youve helped me through so so many miserable moments in my life and yes i did have 90 minutes and they were the best 90 minutes of my life you are highly apreciated and loved at least by me this is why i subbed to you jack for these real talk moments i enjoy your funny videos as well but these videos where you open up i feel are a more accurate representation of who you are and i will proudly support someone whos willing to admit they arent perfect and raise others up instead of beating others down never forget that you are more important than these numbers on a screen or these random internet voices trying to change you into something you arent u know jack someone who recently started watching u probably would just think of u as an entertainer but even though ur loud and swear a lot which believe me isnt a bad thing especially depending on ur age group of audience after watching ur recent videos i realized that u r actually one of the most dammit wut is the word compassionate ya one of the most compassionate youtubers i know thank you for making this video ive been following a long time and im so happy that youve been taking time for yourself and setting boundaries youre leading by example and it has

poor etc ive seen my brother go in a downward spiral from depression but hes so much better now things can get better it just takes a long time to those who deal with depression and other mental illnesses help will find you eventually to those who lost their battles you will be missed by those who loved you i played this game like when it came out and like wow happy pride month it is alright if you complain we will listen just get it out of you there is something about beautiful art and tragic storys that is so powerful this game is truly beautiful even for how small it may seem i feel weirdly inspired to make something and contribute to the world on the theme of suicidal thoughts anyone knows the feeling of being passive suicidal like if something bad would i wouldnt be sad about it id accept it that is me for most of my life i could never actually actively hurt myself but do stuff which i know was bad and had a bad aftermath like scratching open wounds again and again its really bad that scratching became a habit and its hard to stop sometimes i dont even notice for me it was always clear at some point i have to go to a clinic and deal with all that stuff after my girlfriend broke up it became really bad my suicidal thoughts became more active sometimes i just wanted to walk into traffic get hit by a car and just die it seemed so much easier than working on it but i reached out for help and i got help now things start to look better after a year and a half i am working gonna move out soon have plans for the future and hopefully will start hormone therapy so yes it will get better it takes t i learned a lot on this video did you pepl you help so many of us so much youve helped me so much sen we love you i love you even if you miss a video we will be here

dont forget that you are a gift from god as your name entails keep fighting the good fight sean the gallic gladiator jack this message you gave just ment alot to me thank you for always being you and who you want to be i totally respect you and i love youre content just this massive speech at the ending it was so heartwarming and incredible ill always remember this it just opened the world to me and nou i just understand everything way better thank you jack clicks on mays door nationwide ad pops up and scares me shitless i saw gloom play this and i was waiting for this to happen i love you yes you you reading this right now i love you hey i love you reply if you want to talk not only san but anyone in the comments too im here for you jack you probably wont get this but you may have just prevented a death all this time i believed nobody cared for me and thought if i killed myself it wouldnt of mattered seeing this video made me realize the reality of what would happen if i committed suicide i realized my life is valuable and i need to find the things that make me happy in life and cherish those moments i have to open my heart more to the valuable things that actually matter to me thank you so much for this video without you i dont think i wouldve been here today im sorry this is a little cheesy this video really gets me to think and im happy that you stopped at the ending you did that ending is quit relatable for me not because i have suicidal thoughts but i have a friend who sometimes feel depressed and i just want to help her no one should feel that way but if you do seek help or just talk to someone tell them how you feel it will help a lot and if you know someone who feels depressed try talking to them make them feel like you care for them whyd may have to have pink hair people with pink hair are usually the nicest its to depressed jack i wish i could tell you this live while youre playing the game but her roommate is giving me sayori vibes im worried about her i havent gotten to this point but i did get to a point where i could notice something wasnt right because i thought hey what would happen if you died or hey what would happen if you cut yourself and how would others react that what would happen never turned into a you should because i found how i deal with it very fast i make a joke out of it and if my grasp of the thoughts started slipping i would make some dark joke in my head about suicide or something and for some reason it strengthened my grasp to the point where i could take care of it it really grabs on if you dont have an idea that it can exist with you but now im a meme lord so i think im good shet this is sayori all over again i really needed this video i know im not the only one who thinks sean should be a suicide prevention phone person i feel like a god having played this game before jack i swear when jack imitated a yawn he got me to yawn lmfao and heres what i want to say this to all arstatskans glory greatest country mother proud and glory to arstatska thank you you have no idea how much this means to me its fine sean jack no sean you are human you are valid you are able to do whatever makes you feel happy dont let negative people get to you you are amazing we all love you a lot no matter how much you interact with us thank you for being such an amazing person i could listen to jack talk about this stuff for hours and it hurts that he feels like hes talking to much or that he cant talk about it we need a podcast or something where he can just talk about what he wants and not worry about what his youtube audience are going to say jack thank you for including the end part in the video i know some of it you needed to get out for yourself and im glad you did it looked like you needed it and i know theres so much you could still talk about and want to say you probably will at some point when the time is right but fuck my emotions are all over the fucking place after this but i just every now and then i just need what you gave and said this is one of the biggest reasons you are my favourite person in youtube this is why i have stuck around in this community for 5 or so years i wish i could write what i want to say and express but i just cant put it in words just know this means a lot to me and the community and yes this game is definitely relevant it hit me hard because my friend is quite literally going through what may is shes having an extremely hard time and i talk to her every day and try to be there what may said is what my friend have said to me word by word its just a lot it almost a year seen my friend past over the same way may did plz dont hurt yourself plz find help it will be ok there people hear for you i have to say i love your new you more im matured too i like these kind of games more more calm etc real world is loud enough 5040 this hits me very hard i had made some friends over a game and the group leader helped me through my suicidal thoughts and was just a good friend later he tells me he is tired of life and i talked to him hours and hours to let him know he was loved one day he calls while cutting i was shocked and couldnt believe it but i heard every cut the day after that we talked again and i told him he need to seek a therapist it got silent and end of the call 2 days later i get a message saying love you no homo didnt think much of it thought he had gotten better and send it as a jokeish message but the next day i went drinking with some friends and got a call from him but it was not him who took the call it was his parents they told me he killed him self and the only reason i got to know was because i was the last person he talked to he didnt talk to his parents because he was scared of them i got a break down i just dropped my beer and began crying luckily for me one of my friends i really appreciate that you played this game and took it seriously its a huge struggle and im sorry that you had to go through that dark mentality back in 2017 i myself have struggled for years with my mental health and suicidal tendencies ive made countless attempts to end my life ended up in hospital and in prevention and recovery centres and therapy psychiartirsts counsellors medication cbt meditation have also been things that ive been doing too life is really not easy i appreciate this game and that its creating more talk about it all im gay im a rpe survivor and i have borderline personality disorder as well as major depression and ocd these things dont define me i am my own person my favourite colour is green i am engaged to my partner in the uk im australian im hoping to be able to leave soon to the uk so i can marry him finally and also transition and really begin my life i love you all spread love and listen to those who need you always have wonderful messages to share with your audience thank you you can have 4 endings do you have 90 sec meme note date thats what jack does sean if you talked less wed be disappointed we love how you talk about what you like and what can need improving or even your talks about the sensitive topics also the fact you say you love their artstyle instead of saying her makes me happy you care about what people go by and instead of guessing one or the other you stick to the gender neutral option i love that with games like these its not just a play through with sean but its also a message on mental health and a way to just get to know him more as a person i identify too much with the characters in these games jack your words always inspire thank you for being the person you are you are absolutely amazing i dont watch your videos regularly ngl however whenever i do you always seem to feel less incomplete and lost so thank you sean even if this is only one part of you as a person i still appreciate you so much and so do many others so thank you so much for being the person you are and doing what you do we respect your privacy and were thankful for what you choose to provide us 3 this is a great message sean people could really use this i know it one of my closest friend cut him self often and whenever someone talked about it he would say oh its fine he never got help but when we moved we lost contact and i hope for the best for him always so much of this music in this game is reminding me of sally face anyone else 14 year old girls missed messages boys insert minecraft picture here breathtaking thank you youve been such a good friend and support in my life despite the fact that we have never even meet therefore i will always support you as well and would hate to see you lose yourself on the way im so glad that you remember to prioritize your own life and happiness the art style in the game looks so beautiful round of applause for sean because of his support for every one of you people and keep up the good work sean and just like sean said keep doing what you are good at and do it step by step because the world is very big and you

yeah xd thank you sean i needed to hear that talk at the end all i can really think to say is truly just thank you jack youre amazing love this community that youve created everyone supports each other ive run into subs in other comment sections on other vids papers please short film and everyone in the thread was so kind and happy to see each other as if they were old friends on every long video game jack plays theres always a serious subject i really appreciate how you aproach the games most of the people on the youtube play them just to create content and have a video for that day but you understand games you understand the feeling it tries to convey by using games as a platform you try to change our lives in a positive way and it really matters for that i am really thankful keep doing what you do we love you 2652 if i had a dollar for every poem or even thought about this id have my own house car and studio also love you and make sure you keep sean thank you jack watch glitchtale plz because it is awsome it makes undyne more epic also mettaton neo and papyrus people are designed to have fun all the time theyre not designed to work and be active all the time the original and most healthy humans ever spent an hour or two getting food as soon as the sun came up and the entire rest of the day with other people relaxing and making music together the only reason social media is draining is because its not real 434 is that fall out boy this art is absolutely beautiful sean you may be a youtuber but youre still a person before hand and everything you talk about is very reflected on that i feel like a lot of people forget that behind the camera or the profiles there is a real person you never have to apologize to the community most of us could tell 2 years ago you were getting burnt out on everything wed much rather have you on youtube still producing content even if its not everyday than never see another upload from you again if you ever need breaks from youtube twitter tumblr or whatever you just say so were here to give you encouragement and make sure youre just as happy as we are so never apologize for growing as a person a lot of us know you care for the community even if you dont interact as much anymore and honestly id be very worried about your mental health if you were still showinggiving us everything about your day to day life long tangent but ive learned the hard way if youre still the same person you were we will never forget you sean you will remain in the heart omg this is why i love this channel pma jack self love time off social media i came her because i was depressed and overly stressed out im so trapped by selfhate personally its really hard to love myself because i dont want people to think that im stuck up or selfish this year ive really tried to not be as selfless as before it is good to be selfless but not all the time sometimes you need to be selfish so you can take time for yourself and not focus on how everyone else is reeeee your speeches make me cry in a good wae its my birthday as well thank you for being such an amazing person thank you sometimes i really do feel alone and like no one is there for me and honestly watching youtube makes me feel better so thank you for making youtube videos and thank you for addressing emotional things like this you really have made lives better and also never feel pressured to do or say things just because youre an influencer your opinions and feelings are still completely valid youre allowed to be human and youre allowed to have a personal life i went on a bit of a tangent there sorry to whoever is reading this have a great day its okay sen were here for you you are amazing be you just keep on being you we friggin love you no matter what you

but my family is too poor to pay for a therapist and i really dont know what to do thank you so much jack for sharing with us recently i feel like im in such a dark space and i feel helpless you help

playing in the background most of the vid is called losing interest the original is a little bit faster like so others can see or dont doesnt really matter taking time to sit and read a book that is how i stop all the noise in my head it gives me time to just forget all of life and go on a whole adventure you talking at the end gave me a lot of food for thought so thanks 2433 that hit me hard thanks for the help sean we are here for you and for everyone looking at this comment if you need help but feel like you are being an inconvenience i can tell you from experience that you are not your friends family or anyone will be there for you ouch the feeling i wish i had a friend like that sen give to us what you want to give you dont have to share more than you want to we know that you care

the background behind jack looks like the french flag get to anyone else ive play this game on newground i like watching your videos while animating dont let other people tell you what to do and they dont have to be your validation ever you are the best person ever and deserve only the best wine literally the best video on the internet been here since poly bridge i love you sean jack you are still human we all still need to live dont force on a smile i promise that at least 90 of this community would care if you just took like a few months off we care so much about you and you want us to be happy and we want your to be happy make sure you always have time to relax yes the internet is your job but take a break from it we love you so much and want you to be happy please take time to relax

to dont trust yuri its a ddlc video and its mind blowing i think youll enjoy it and sean you have an army we all love and support you you are amazing worthy awesome and a gaelic gladiator u how is this game free the artstyle is worth a lot this game hit hard to me a few years back i lost my best friend to suicide and she never told me what was happening i really dont think it seems like you dont care in any way i was more of a lurker and not a real subscriber until you began speaking about your mental health struggles and then i was able to resonate with your videos in a way i couldnt before youve become more genuine and real to both yourself and your audience youre kicking ass sean from around 5035 i really felt as if you were speaking to me instead of to everyone watching even though i logically know thats not true last year has been the hardest in my life i just finished a year of chemo to cure the brain cancer i had and while i was sick laying in bed i watched the world move on and i still do being cured of cancer other than getting rid of the thought in the back of my head that i might not survive hasnt really improved my mental health i still have trouble getting out of bed and walking around the house while seeing friends and family doing all kinds of things i want to do but just cant something you mentioned in the end of the video was everybody is doing so much and it seems like youre doing nothing live in your lane compare yourself to yourself from a year ago instead of comparing yourself to everybody else this really opened my eyes and you talking about getting out of the bed making breakfast and going for a walk things that are re pain is pain your problems are valid its ok to feel it even if youre a social media influencer 940 thats sarah schauer she would love that you referenced her vine haha she has a great youtube channel too thank you sean justthank you for talking out on this and playing this game it truly means a lot im glad this game had a happy ending it sucks when they dont and i see why they dont but even something less sad would be nice man this video stabbed me in the heart oh heck oh wow hey was that green hair and are you going to play subnatica below zero last year was a really tough year for me one of the worst years of my life right beside 2014 and i had attempted suicide multiple times i could never bring myself to do it although i had done self harm to myself since i thought i deserved it im much better now and happier than before but one of my friends had helped me through that even though we had known each other since 3rd grade it felt like he was slowly but surely drifting away and i had grown to have feelings for him so that impacted me a ton i hadnt told any of my other friends with the fear that theyd just shun me away if i had told them like i was too much of a problem so i had put on this mask to hide all of my problems and all of my sadness just so no one could know anything was wrong with me on the inside i felt like i was an obstacle that everyone despised in their lives that i was a burden to everyone who knew me i never want to feel that type of pain and that type of hurt ever again if youre strug this was amazing i love this and whatever u do ill support you thank you for making millions including me feel supported i hope my comment means something i love you and i love how ur channel can be a place for me to just log out does that make sense and i hope anyone that is in that head space gets out peaceful just thank you sorry not sorry but if people dont like who you are now they are selfish and clearly do not care about you to see how incredibly happy you have been and to be giving yourself more breaks and an actual life to do things you have always wanted to do like the celeb interviews traveling tour all these great things you have worked for and can now enjoy has been such a beautiful thing to watch you go through i beam and cry tears of joy when i see how happy you are and how far you have come you deserve all of this and those of us that care for you and your happiness are right here cheering you on supporting you and loving you always forever being happy to watch you grow and see you smile besides jackaboy being entertaining he is also so inspirational with what he is doing dont stop what you do and always do it to the best of your ability

two years your videos have changed me you make me laugh smile and just make me feel better thank you sean it means the world that someone finally said what i needed to hear play underswap undertale fangame sean i love you this are emotions that i share as well and the same thoughts cross my mind everything you said is something i reflect on and just admire you so much to talking to us and sharing this deep personal stuff we care about you too and we want what you want we who love you want you to be happy pma forever thank you i needed to see this game and to hear you talk about how no one is alone and whatnot i can relate to the video game so much right now thnk you thank you so much for your little end talk im going through a tough time atm and i finally made the step to reach out ofc its still a massive problem to even go with it if your family is holding you backdown but im glad that i on my own decide to talk about it and didnt let my bad thoughts decide what to do im trying to get a therapist even if my mother is trying to get that idea out of my head and i really hope that i can do it and on my next appointment with my doctor we can discuss more thank you for the message it is not easy to talk about depression suicide self harm and the like though we all need to more everyone has moments they feel isolated but we all have people either personal or through hotlines that we can reach out to a friend of mine committed suicide a few months back and all of us who knew him were shocked dont assume someone is ok make time for other people and reach out when you need to the moment i realized i watched this video and when you started talking i didnt realize of how much i needed to hear those words from someone and now i want to just look at you and say thank you for the things that you have done in your life to make it the best and saying to be your greatest version of yourself be the greatest version of you that is also your happiest self when you are also right we have one life and we in some way life it to the fullest for ourselves to find happiness and joy in this life thank you for everything sen that meant a lot damn you sean making me cry at the end but in all seriousness im not a 1000 sure id still be here if it wasnt for you when i was 12 my exstep father started abusing me taking his anger out on me as a 12 year old i didnt know any better i took it and tried to adapt so he wouldnt hit me anymore it never worked tho nothing i did was ever good enough it got worse and worse until my mother left him when i was about 15 those three years were the longest of my life i stopped talking to people i never left my room i gave up writing drawing putting effort into anything really but i never realized i was doing it it just sorta happened i began to cut myself but i never told anyone i didnt seek help because in my mind i was weak i wasnt depressed in my mind i was looking for attention and up until a few months ago i refused to acknowledge that part of my life i didnt admit that i was depressed and suicidal according to me it was so trivial compared to wh i am not good at emotions im guessing because of my past and just hearing you talk about yourself and your view on these kind of things is lately my only way of staying in contact with this part of me that i otherwise learned to ignore for the sake of other people and myself what i want to say is thank you sen for not being afraid of tapping into things people avoid to talk about already love the art i just played the game and i had to close the game when i found may dead that last ending gave me hope like i just got out of the mental hospital and i was getting better but now im at rock bottom again its so bad that all my windows are locked but this ending kinda made me hope it will get better suicidal thoughts are no joke and i really hope people can and will get help im glad to hear jack is more content with himself now and i love that hes doesnt just skim over important messages like this ah pride flags stupid blankets and weird tea gay cant work because bored yep i knew there was gonna be a millineal in this oh shit i just heard the god is a woman part millenials are kinda fucked huh it is good to spill a bit out sometimes i just lay down and look at my light or if i can just take time for myself its the best that you will share your problems with someone that you know that will actually care about you just be yourself and be honest am i going to cry i bet im going to cry i thought this said mystic messenger this made me more emotional than i thought it would an old friend of mine took her life a few months ago she was a dramatic person so when she kept posting cryptic posts like why do i deserve this everyone got tired of asking if she was okay and getting told yeah we overlooked her cries for help in the most dire of times the next day her boyfriend posted that she attempted suicide she clung to life for a little over a month in icu and then one day i got the message that she was gone i wish i could have gone back and done it differently like in this game but you cant do that in the real world please listen to peoples cries for help even if you feel they just want attention reach out listen because it could be the one gesture that could save someones life thank you sean for everything that you have said in this video you have so much influence on people especially on my kids i am glad that they prefer to watch your videos your positive messages mean a lot i have nothing to say i need to stop crying today we need to appreciate how sen gives us so much pma and the great speech from him sen thank you for helping me and everyone who watches you i suffer from minor depression and watching your videos talking with my friends its really helped so i just want to say thank you for everything you have given us thanks for this jack it really means a lot you talked about this thats why your the best this hit me so hard i felt so alone for so long and youtube was my only joy during those times thank you sen the weird thing is everytime i needed a specific type of person you were that person bubbly fun energetic and real and caring for yourself more and connecting with people irl and not posting all the time you were always the person i needed to see because when i was super depressed i needed the overly happy energetic jack and you were that at that time in your videos and now i need someone who talks about real stuff and about their experiences with sadness or depression and you do that and youre also happy in your videos and i can watch them when i need to smile and when i need to reflect i can watch videos like this and ill be ok again i really did grow with you and i appreciate you sharing with us what you do share because it means a lot to me truly it does youve always been someone i could look to thank you for all that you do for me and everyone else i appreciate it more then you will ever know jacks every fan 033 ive played this before i was bailing my eyes out on each ending tho i cant believe i played this game before jack i loved this game so much and it was so sweet thank you jack for sharing this with uswatching your videos has made me strive to be a better person so much that at my yearly review my manager told me that i always take constructive criticism well

that the more i work on myself the more i feel better and if anyone feels that way i can say that there is people that love and care for you and will help in anyway they can and if you need to talk

luv your vids and keep up the good work did anyone else just sat there and just listen to sean i wasnt looking at the screen just listen to him i cant express how much i love and support you sean i watched you during my darkest darkest times and you kept me going through everything even though i constantly thought about things i shouldntve when you said compare yourself to a year ago and work on improving yourself further it just really hit home with me because last year and the year before were truely the worst years of my life so far im so glad that you are in my life and its been amazing

literally cannot thank you enough for everything youve done for me and us positive mental attitude thank you for being the constant support in my life that i needed when i was too messed up to seek it out myself youve made me laugh and cry and you still do im doing a lot better now and you are a big part of that journey me to the girl in the game if god was a womanshouldnt he be called a goddess checkmate feminists ps this is only a joke i dont hate feminists but they are sometimes stupid come on wheres that green hair i feel like this game kinda made me think about how ive been feeling this past year i moved out for the first time feeling happy excited and driven because i had a plan to go to school and be with the person i love while doing it however its been a hard year for me money has been a constant concern and ive felt like when i solve a problem in my life more come in i feel like i cant talk to my family because i get more judgement or criticism vs guidance i love my mother but its never been easy to talk to her regarding my problems work is my distraction and when i drive home sometimes j just cry because i have no idea how to handle anything ive always been a carefree person never letting problems get to me but this is the first time i think in my life i feel like i dread every day because nothing makes me happy anymore i really anymore i dont have friends i dont go out because i need to make sure i have money for gas to go to work or even food to eat sometimes i rip etika jack always makes my day better cause i deal with this stuff and it sucks thank you sean mkay i wasnt ready to feel like this nvjdjvjdjjckdvkdjdkcjkdhv i went through something eerily similar if u have ever gone through this im glad that u have made it through because ur artstyle is lit this video makes me so sad i love it at the same time im in mays shoes at the moment my mum wants to help but shes in america and im in london the people i live with dont seem to care i hope that ill get the end hope like may did thanks jack for playing this sen was talking for almost 20 minutes do i see a trans flag wheres the green hair these games are just interactive paintings thank you jack im not crying my eyes are just sweating this is too deep for a tiny 14 year old who barely knows how to walk i need to cry but my foundation was 48 its terrible that anyone goes through this i go through thoughts and i simply have no one to talk to who would listen its truly depressing i hit the point of acting on it earlier this year and i was being overly nice all day and taking care of everuthing for my room mates and when they went out to get drinks i cleaned the appartment and and was ready to leave and i had a rope around me and one of my room mates came in the room and pulled me up before i could step off the chair and she brought me to the floor and just held me and let me cry for hours from that day on if any of my room mates see im sad they will just hug me and not let me do any thing till they know im better it gets better with friends helping you and people being with you oh jack i want to give you a hug for your talk at the end cause you looked so sad like you were gonna cry c hugs your videos always cheer me up u ignore the vent pls i wish what you said could pertain to me but i dont have anyone and it only matters if you have honorable problems like may not if youre just useless and a loser and ugly and a piece of shit i honestly dont even know why i exist i cant do anything but watching jacks videos makes me happy hes so funny even if its only temporary and im deluding myself its a nice escape i cant run from reality forever though hopefully i realize that one day before its too late and finally take matters into my own hands and put an end to all this bullshit um if anyone read this please dont comment that would be embarrassing if you agree you can like it though sometimes when things go ok for awhile i begin to have bad thoughts out of nowhere and i hate it because they get convincing i know its best not to listen because it would be worse to go back to where i started before therapy youre such a bean we love you jack and were so glad youre still here x its my birthday 30 min of playing and 20 min of talking horree sheet i really needed this todaythank you seanyou always make me happy when i need it the most u didnt make the high five at the intro anymore so sad that u changed i see that fob reference damn i really need to watch the entire video cuz its beautiful but i get bored easily edit finally finished wow this game is full of very close to home stuff anyone out there who is going through the worst someone loves you more than one person those people can help you and you can even help yourself i believe in you i cant remember a time when i didnt suffer from depression or suicidal thoughts its just something ive always had im 21 ill be 22 this year and i hope that maybe maybe ill die through means that arent my own ive tried to end it more than a few times but in the end it was either too difficult to manage where i was or police found me ive been on antidepressants for countless and countless years they dont work nothing seems to work im at a loss of what to do next honestly thank you so much for the wakeup call both with the game and your words recently ive been dealing with so much stress all that i havent really noticed stemmed from my needs of self validation i am such a self centered person and im always self conscious and when you mentioned yourself from 2017 that hit hard ive always been reaching out to people to validate me because of how much ive despised myself and i realized through your explicitly stating that im not happy because of myself and im honestly so thankful thank you so much i just notices this the menu screens floor has blood around it with bloody scissors not far from a limp may love you sean jack when speaks its always true and very motivating ewwwwww fuck the lgbt you should become a motivation speaker you very good at it sen you really are i sent this video to a friend who is vary depressed and i really think it would help thank you sooooo luck for everything it really means a lot there no high five anymore thank you sean thank you for being a great role model you show people that almost everyone is miserable in a part of their life but it doesnt have to be everything you said is what ive been going through like most people im going through things and i dont know how to handle them cause no one knows im depressed ive been covering up my depression and anxiety and i pretend to be happy around others i know its not a healthy way to live and itll take some time for people to recognize that i need help because ive been trying to do it on my own im not doing what i want to do in life and im miserable just like the game said the competition is fierce but i know that shouldnt stop me from doing it anyway this video gave me a bit of a push to get me going again itll take while to get there but im sure ill get there eventually cheers my friend while i did enjoy the days of loud green hair the newer sean seems more human if that makes sense he knows how to handle his mentality and physical health and i enjoy it he is a human and hes like everybody else in the sense he has emotions and a mindset im honestly proud even though my opinions dont really matter i value him so much sen your such an insparation keep it up sen im talking too much me nah man i could listen for hours sorry if i did the accent thing on the letter wrong i would love to hear a whole podcast about jack speaking more about these type of content dude i really needed this today thank you why do you sound so much sharper though i love sean speaks it is awesome ive just literally cried some of the background music sounded sort of like losing interest if i listened closely theyre gay but not vegan something smells fishy right off the bat i really hope that people start taking stuff like this more seriously and more aware of it and i think that games such as this are a great way to get that across this game the best im hearing shiloh in the music but its faint is it me or i tought that the girl on the thumbnail was belle delphin lel i love how it just starts out with the gay and transgender flags we love you sen be strong and be you its okay if you take time for you because its a lot better if we dont get a video for a week than forever ill grow with you life can be incredibly difficult and horrible things happen to good and bad people all the time it sucks but one thing i learned that has helped me immensely is its not personal its not a punishment for being bad or being a failure its just life doing life things and even if what life throws seems insurmountable you can get through it you deserve happiness you deserve to love yourself and to cherish yourself as the good person you are know that youre not alone and that you will be okay jack im probably one of your biggest fans and i enjoy your videos like nothing else but i would not give a shit if you took off a month or more espesially probably didnt write this right if its for your mental health just remember we love you jack that last thing about happiness made me almost cry i remember that one convention were you said that you dont save people its our own choice to keep going but for a lot of people you were the reason to take the step back to value themselves to be able to laugh again and just keep going you are an amazing person sean and the biggest part of the community will keep growing with you ive been suffering what may from this game go throw and way way way much more for like12 or 13 years i still go throw it am lost im a very closed person about my self i live in a place where everyone is very very close minded i cant leave i cant do anything ive reached the point of doing it many many times but cant i dont know why am just hoping that someone will find me and help me out of this im not sure for how long i can keep it up tho i love the vine so he brokeup with me eheh why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 48 i can relate to may a lot i always feel so worthless like a little piece of shit who just cant keep his shit together what makes things worse is that im just 15 years old i always feel the pressure of the future on my shoulders just like may i dont know what i wanna do for a living and that scares me its people like you sen that always help me finding my smile so thanks for being here thanks jack for opening me up a bit with your message you put a tear on my eyes this reminds me about etika rip harry potter fanfiction oh okay mrs fritz im bout to head out i overcome the way i feel recently anyways i started feeling down a few years back shit happened family struggling so i was helping them they was about to go homeless anyway i wasnt loved as much as the rest of my family i was

yourself and dont give a fuck and heres a life tip in life you would always want to regret the things you did rather than the things you didnt do pslove you jack its strange because i got this game two days ago wish it was that easy to get a date irl we need more youtubers gamers and celebrities like jack because he makes people realise that their life might be wonderful but they suffered a lot to get their life like that and maybe they might be suffering depression now there a lot of people like that and all we can do is be there for them and that can help them in a way you cant even imagine all those words can change their life they will know that there are people who cares about them who loves them who wpuld listen to their problems so lets spread and help people when they need us and help them and become a hero for that person and let our our power be words that can change the world oh god ive played this a few days ago and im scared to watch this because i know how it can end i love how you take this time to talk about this and i really get how you need to keep things private and take time to yourself you are so amazing honestly you are a great inspirational speaker dam jack you need to become a therapist bro that ending made me cry gg i love the music in this game its so calming copy paste from an actual conversation i had with a friend i can appreciates that talking about the 13 talk of the video i mean he is one of the only youtubers ive seen that truly cares about people about his fan charities i cant remember him being in any big drama or scandlas he is still honest to himself and plays games the way he wants to what he wants to i can just truly appreciate that even if he is not the biggest he is one of the best youtubers and i will fight anyone on that xd this was a conversation i had with them about this video before i saw the talking heavy part of this it these are my truest thoughts broken down to their simplest we know you care sean you still to this day communicate so much with your community more then i have personally seen anybody else do you are a great person even if you loose sight of what you love or what you want you always find it you are kind to all and you have saved so many lives and helped so many thank you for that speech at the end it helped me so much it means a lot to know that you care and im glad that you are focusing on making sure you are happy instead of keeping everyone else happy we all love you jack and you give such a positive message you have helped me through rough patches and im sure and not the only one what if you got all 4 endings but forgot the 4th ending name depression okay okay memes hope you have a good day if not just come back on here and talk to us the septicrews always here for you 430 do i see fall out boy its not that people post on social media because they think theyre opinion matters to everyone maybe they post their thoughts and opinions online because no one around

there for the community wheres the green hair im just saying dont worry jack we all know that you need time for your self its very important to love your self before every one else even if something that is bothering you seems lesser its still bothering you and affecting you and thats valid no matter what dont let people tell you that other people have it worse much love just a month ago my best friend of 10 years killed themselves this really hit home but i needed this thank you jack and everyone else for the positive messages in the comments thanks sean notice he did the top of the morning without the high five like in the past thank you so much for this video and thank you for everything youve said in it recently ive been dealing with these sorts of thoughts and issues and it got a lot worse quickly but just watching this has made me feel so much better i almost feel like before i was alone but now i realise that im not and that no matter what there will always be people wholl be

im so happy that your better and thank you for helping me your breathtaking oh my god this video is so inspiring i want to hug you so badly i understand you and i never got the feeling you wouldnt care about the community anymore seeing negative comments about you hurts me i mean i get some people are frustrated or simply not satisfied but the way some people phrase it is not the best of course everyone has the right to say what theyre thinking but why not keeping it friendly i dont know how to explain it and no i dont want to offend anybody its just what im thinking either way you should do whats best for you and not what other people want or what you think the people want it is impossible to make everybody happy care for yourself and the ones you love the rest settles itself im sorry if i cant make myself clear english isnt my first language and im more used to reading or listening than to write or speak it myself but i hope you get my point hugs sean sean talking for half a video is the best thing ever loved the video we love you sean no matter what you are one of the most relatable people on this platform especially when you open up to your audience about your thoughts i am sure you have helped so many people just by sharing all of this sean thank you i literally cried my self to sleep last night thinking about this stuff i have a messed up life i actualy needed this from him so ye i agree with what jack said at the end of the video jack seems like the same jack i found entertaining from before just with some more experience this game shows a more sensible part of the world the part that evryone haz being scared being happy and a lot others evrthing that is in this game is pure artalways try to say the family your friends and ones that you are close too what you are going trow even if you are scared do it maybe they can help you and you will be happier those last 20 mins of you talking about this made me cry ive felt like this for years now and i have those kind of thoughts almost every day its really hard trying to ignore whats going on in my mind but i cant end it because i dont want to hurt the people i love edit thank you all for your kind words i really appreciate that and it means a lot to me bittersweet sigh thank you i love this gameand the artistand you shawn this was amazing you can really be proud of the things you do dude also to me you

really happy you can take any day off i love you jack youre amazing and you have changed my life and certainly many peoples lives for the better if you ever think that you might need a break take one because you should know that we will all be here for you when you come back from ireland for a very good reason i am crying by this i feel like the main character there were some kids who i saw crumble in front of me i know a lot of people did a lot of people like to believe they are able to say something but the truth is not a lot of people do i saw a girl in my class she was different then the others i felt what she felt because i in that year had to start seeing a therapist because my mental health was at an all time low so i tried talking to her not in the playful way like talk about serious things but i didnt get the chance one day she felt so bad i could see it so i informed the teacher and the both of us stepped aside for a minute we decided to sit down in a hallway and talk i made sure we had paper i didnt push her but i could feel she started to open up she told me about how she felt like an outsider and she explained to me that there were so many voices in her head that they were all screaming different things and she didnt know what to do so wheres my leprechaun gaeilic gladiator yo youre not irrelevant man youre amazing you have tough me sooooooo much man dont live for me live for u ooh i wanted to play this game hi jack thanks for this beautiful message i will always remember this video and if you are going thru some difficult times let us know we will always support you much love your audience i truly hate when people say man up i kinda feel the same as may but different i remember when i was in primary everytime i woke up i just felt like every day was the same i dont think that feeling ever went away shits fucked keep your head up ull make it i kind of hesitated to watch this because i played you left me in the past and i didnt feel so well after that even though i got the good ending but now that i finished this video i feel like this is what i really really need right now thank you sean i felt like no one understood how i am feeling even though i tried to talk to the people i love but now i know i wasnt the only one almost everything hits home to me in this video but even so its kind of comforting again thank you ghost hug you cant feel it but its there watched it several times ahem its 48 dollars ive been through everything in this game and im still here everyday is a struggle but im still trying i have depression so i know what all this feels like and jack at the end made me start crying because he actually understand what people go through because there are some youtubers that fake being depressed and thats why jack is such a amazing person because he did go through it but he didnt tell people because he thought people would judge him edit im not just saying for attention 3911 dont mind it its just for me when i get sad oh god this made me cry i had a friend who everyone knew was faking his depression he was always surrounded by friends but he ended up actually being depressed all cuz we tried to tell help him help him learn proper hygiene you see he smelled really bad like crap when you leave it in the toilet for 2 days im not saying this cuz he was overweight he just actually smelled one day not too long after school ended he ended up texting me how he was gonna kill himself well he actually typed it in a group chat on instagram but i was the only one saying anything i pointed out to him he has actual reasons to live i took a shot at mentioning how it would affect his girlfriend it was risky cuz for all i knew they had broken up but their was really no better alternative he said his girlfriend was almost killed by her mom he said something else but i dont member it now i told him that was an even better reason to stay alive she needs someone their for her if her boyfriend died who knows maybe i cried this hit hard for me my boyfriend broke up with me why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 48 jacksepticeye is the best youtuber ever this is very powerful stuff as soon as he said i feel cold mockingbird by eminem started playing 943 i need to cry but my foundation as 48 dollars i feel like he was trying to hold back tries because he secretly had makeup on my gahhd i was just editing my goddamn gameplay of this jack wooah im so surprised that im almost the exact same as may im a guy but i find joy in music art and writing sometimes everyday feels so monotonous and i feel like giving up a lot played this game its awesome thank you for the talk at the end it helped a lot whats really awful about the beginning 1210 ish is being close to suicidal i tried to stop myself with peoples birthdays or events because i didnt want to be the reason people hated their birthday so if anyone is that is feeling like this let yourself have your excuses not to do it and try to find help god those last 15ish minutes of sen just talking hit me hard yea this is gaming that girl she kind of reminds me of me i used to do that crap to my door was always shut a bunch of notes pinned up saying keep out dont enter although i would never use scissors although in my family i feel sad and alone so i reached out to my friend she really helped me alot what im trying to say is think about jack said if youre actually going through this crap theres always someone who cares i dont know how to react all i can say is i think your privacy is yours nobody should bother you about it i know i like this you much more because it feels more genuine i guess and i know that i care about how you feel this video really meant a lot to me this is exactly how i feel a lot but its weird ill be fine but as soon as something bad happens it feels like everything falls apart idk this just hit home with me wow that was amazing to hear youre doing fine with your life i needed to hear that thanks when i tell people i have depression and suicidal thoughts they usually just laugh it off take it as a meme or say you have such a great life you have no reason to be depressed itll pass i wish i had good people in my life like mc i go through some of the stuff u said jack and im only 11 years old ive watched ur vids since the first day u played gta 5 thank you for being there for me when im sick the people who disliked fuck right of has anyone noticed how low the views for this video are this video was really needed today i just had a real sudden emotional drop and its really bad this time but your words are a really big inspiration for me thank you im so sorry jack and everbody that is going through shit like this i have been through depression but i got through so i feel for everyone thats going through depression and im sorry but know this there is always a way through it theres always someone to care for u and help u through it depression is no joke and if someone is going through it there is someone that cares for u and if we know or see some one going through depression we should help them anyone need to talk theres no one here to help me no one willing to dig me from the snow the blizzard continues to rage on i cant get myself out its too cold im cold i cant move i give up i cant do anything i give up with everything i want someone to reach out and save me but the snow stings i cant escape im stuck im gone you are not your mental illness its a chemical imbalance in your mind you are not a chemical imbalance you are more do not be afraid to seek help i thought it said mixed messages lmao who else is reading through the coments while watching the video i just watched it the second time and im still crying this hits way to close to home no slap no sound effect i remember a few years ago when i went through some really heavy stuff in my life i just relustened to sean ramble at the end of anxiety attack over and over and that made me feel just a bit better im glad you got to this game i enjoyed it when i played it shame you didnt get all the endings tho i also really liked the message at the end and you did good even if you dont need to hear it i think you matter no dont stop your content keeps me living thank you when you hit rock bottom theres only one direction to go and thats up but also please dont feel responsible when someone hurts themself sometimes you cant do anything just try to do everything so they dont feel alone remind them of things they could miss sometimes one day more is enough thank you not just for still making videos not just for talking to us thank you for never changing who you are as a person youre the best friend we never really talk to just to see you and listen to you is everything sometimes when life seems so dark and far and the thoughts of ending it all swirls in the mind just hearing a laugh or seeing a smile even when you know the impending doom comes closer that gives me hope for a better future digging through that hole to see the light on the other side memes do bring people together jacksepticeye is keanu reeves v20 this video was so helpful it really helped me feel motivated to go out and do something for myself opposed to just giving up and just staying home thanks again sean i really hope i may one day meet you sen and im saying sen because i feel like it was more the person who helped me than the entertainer i really hope i can meet you because i used to be miserable almost every day id wake up and almost immediately wanted to go to sleep because there was nothing for me to wake up to i more out of instinct than anything survived things that i did to myself so many times you did help me a lot even though im more of a newer viewer of yours i was always with a psychiatrist however while i liked them and trusted them i never really opened up but after that video you uploaded after 2017 talking about how you felt miserable throughout the year i finally managed to open up i still have these thoughts and i am often so scared that i wont make it in life or anything sometimes i hate myself for everything but you have helped and i am so very greatful for that i still try my best and i would love nothing more than being able to thank sean is so kind about the creator of this game he really is a great guy guys his name is not actually jack hey sen i just want you to know that you are such a gigantic inspiration for small channels like me you have a special place in my heart a special place for special youtubers thanks sen keanu you spoke some beautiful words my man keep up the good work thank you dr jack i love when you get motivational it really helps im jamming with that song on 544 losing interest i think a good scary game for u will be five nights at freddys help wanted on vr hey ive watched your channel lately and i really appreciate what you said in this video lots of things hit home with what you said its like listening to a mirror reflection i mean when you said i dont deserve happiness and that is absolute nonsense that can t be more true i wish i can improve myself from 2016 thank you for being honest open and helping so many of us we couldnt ask for a better gaelic gladiator i appreciate you sen for opening up to your audience but also keeping some to yourself you do not have to share anything that you do not want and i wouldnt want you to i cannot imagine how you do this youtube thing everyday for so long but i am glad you are take care of yourself thank you for this video 3 i am crying as i listen to sean at the end i have never closer to a youtuber as i do to him i just wanted to say i love this community and im scared damn i actually just played this yesterday at first glance before the video starts someone would this i this would be a sad channel update or something god i love when titles have double meanings lets make a community hug like video to hug im reconnecting to last live stream video i went through heavy depression but i usex to watch ur channel and it made me happy i one time wanted to die yet youtubers help i was usually in an endless rage of sadness and anger yet i never showed it but im better now jack should start a podcast this is truly one of the most beautiful and inspiring games ive ever seen this really spoke to me on a personal level and im gonna put more into my dreams because of this anyone else start crying during this just me cool the game can be restarted again if you get the bad ending but what about your life when you choose the wrong choice and it leads you to your bad ending how can you restart your life again when you already ended your life sometimes bad ending seems like the only solution to end all the pain because holding it on is painful people tried to help me but i dont know why i have lost my trust on everyone i just shut people out i know people tried to help but myself cant accept that i dont even understand myself i really relate to may in the depression part and the parents part where everytime i see my mom i feel angry and sick i had thought of suiciding by electrecuting stabbing and even leaving home i had like 7 suicide attempts and even more but 1 friend and 3 hobbies gave me the reason to live again basically i had someone to talk to when im in doubt and im doing things that i loveeven though my mom hates me making animations and making noises out of my mouth through beatboxing i was a bullied person for almost my whole life and that bullying caused me to be depressed but a very good friend of mine helped me out and is still helping me especially on social anxiety basically if you are depressed talk to someone get a friend who will be the one who will help you when you are in need if you feel like you have no reason to live get something to do if you keep that thought you will never improve accept your problems and adapt to it thats just a word from a depressed this is is good to get out we still love you im not the first im not the last but i sure did click fast this is what millennials do while theres me listing to spotify on my playstation and shooting germans in battlefield 1 i am a mix between those two girls at the end but dont have pity for me sean im three weeks self harm clean seeing this was such a beautiful game and the messages you gave across at the end made me smile i love you very very much youre one of the reasons im still alive today i hope i can one day thank you in person thank you from ally x me a suicidal and depressed person that self harms yeah thisll be fine to watch oh even jack is crying hope he has a good day you too robin and comments i really relate to the bit where may said she doesnt have anything she loves i want to work for something achieve something do something that i like but there isnt anything that i like i dont know what to do with my future and it sucks i wish there was something that i truly enjoyed doing which could become my job some love for sean i feel for jack like really because its true that at one point we all went through something really shitty that made us depressed traumatized and scared and with that you try to help yourself get up you try to be a better and stronger you but sometimes you get those anxieties episodes every now and then and its as if you started back from zero you try to do things on your own with all the struggles you are going through all the things youre juggling with and all those voices you hear in your head you tell yourself that everyone is fighting their own battles and that opening up might be a hassle to them hearing people tell you that others have it worse than you so instead you tell them im fine or im okay and it becomes a habit because you wouldnt want them to worry about you nor you wouldnt want to bother them but all i wanna say is that being honest to yourself and to everyone will make you feel a lot better inside asking help is never a hassle to a this is so true to be honest i would never tell anyone in my personal life how i feel everyday because is better for other people not to know but is not better for me i had no clue how much i needed a video like this the more serious side of sean is a side i like to see every now and then cuz the talks always hit so hard oh shit ive needed this for a few years now i needed this entire fucking video right now wow 4 minutes in and its already just a game about my life jack you inspire me so much i love that you are so open about your life experiences it makes me feel like there is hope for myself and the things i want to do or achieve in my life thanks for everything you do you truly make me a happier person every time i watch your videos this hit home for me as well especially the always bring tired and unable to focus thats been a huge problem for me the depression got so bad that i broke down in tears in front of my mom out of random now i take antidepressants for it im trying so hard to get better and youve helped me a lot jack you are so helpful and supportive so thank you so much for that cool 3 just a heart for you thank god you exist sean took 150 mg of hard core sleeping pills didnt think itd effect me until i stood up its not dangerous i usually take 50100 mg thank you i needed to hear this and im glad that im not alone sean god dammit you made me cry thats the sweetest thing youve ever said thank you those words mean a lot to me hey sen love this letsplay but wanted to let u know sally face ep 5 is out so u might wanna check it out bruh i literally played this game a week ago i cried is all i can say catch me crying in the club jack hahaha this reminds me of that vine me i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars rip vine i definitely didnt cry usually i think this self help stuff is pathetic but i do respect your rambles because of how genuine and golden hearted you are but idk what you said at 4228 that spoke to me im surrounded by everyone and everything telling me what to do and not telling me howwhere to do it and then their accomplishments just add on to that puzzle box you told it like it is like an old school new yorker dad that lived through it all im too stubborn to think i needed it but it was at least something i wanted to hear so thanks for that sean god bless that wild joyful heart of yours this video was by far the best that you have put out i dont have the words to describe how i feel but this was amazing it has made me relize thar other people can feel like me at one minute im on top of the world feeling amazing the the next im stuck in this hole that i cant get out of and even though i try to get out i keep slipping i want to try and get out but im scared too reach out for help i know that my friends can help me but i feel like they dont really care about how i feel or how i deal with things i love having them around but some of them non stop talk about suicide and cutting they make those things seem like a big joke ive had someone say that they were going to hang them self at a public park this summer and the other people in the friend group laugh some of my friends flaunt their cuts like its a contest i dont feel like i can talk to them because they cant take me seriously and thats all i really want to say hey jack i know you get these allot everyday and im not the first but shit is almost perfect now well most of the time i beat depression and now live is perfect but it isnt im scared ill be sick again i dont want to eat i dont want to look in the mirror i hate food and i hate myself and i hate that everything almost goes perfect it makes me feel that i cant be sad and mad and sick but i am i dont want to reich out for help cuzz nothing is going wrong but it makes me scared im sorry for speaking out i dont know why but i dont want to make anyone feel sad for me so please dont thank you jack this video couldnt have come at a better time it somehow made me understand myself better it gave me hope and taught me how to talk things out thanks for your inspiring talk in the end of the video i know you wont see this but im glad i got this off my chest wow didnt think u r that good person 1st i saw u as funny guy only positive and all but this video told me something amazing i love u now more than ever i had been going through this recently my dad died about a month ago and it bad launched me into sever depression and thoughts the thought of the pain i would cause people has been what has kept me around im glad i said something in here i cant around people i have to be the strong one for my sister this is the time where i dont have to be jack you dont have to apologize that you dont care about us we love you anyway smol bean you have made an amazing impact on many lives and we a appreciate everything you do with love the jacksepticeye community edit i started crying by the end if the videolook what you have done jackaboy well i didnt expect it to be so true developer has shown thought process of suicidal person very well i can vouch for that cooli just played this a week ago i struggle with bipolar and this was really deep and i needed it especially the end thank you jack for everything you help me through alot thank you jack i really appreciate you for the portion at the end as i am in a really low place right now but i am the good person i am because of you and tom syndicate as both of you really care about people and reach out so thank you jack really and thank you for the end of the video as it really made me realise that people do care and love me so thank you really love you my dude keep it up 3 sean you might not read this at all but this is my saddest story when i was in 6th grade i felt like i had depression it felt like everyone was against me except my friends sometimes i escaped to youtube i never did any other social media because i disagreed with it youtube made me laugh one day i was very close to fully killing myself on the bus home i cried and that wouldve been my last day on earth if it wasnt for my crush she lived up the street from me and we usually walked home together at that point we were a little distant but we talked every so often she saw i was crying and who knew at that point i was so dumb but that stupidity got me out of depression she helped me so much my life completely took a turn it was like she changed my fate now im happy and content but i try to reach out to people who are depressed and try to help them hopefully she doesnt read this but if she does thank you thank you sean thank you crush thank you all who changed i wish i could have a relationship im lonely didnt sean also play that game about a one night stand but she became your obsession but yet she wasnt real i just realized may is the same character model in the other game who wasnt real and the friend who helps you with it is may now its sort of the other way around he saved so many peoples lives including mine and for him to have thought that it would not make a difference if he was gone breaks my heart not another queer video jacksean look i think i speak for the majority of us when i say that if ever you need to talk any one of us will support you in whatever you choose to do and i will admit that you have helped me through quite a few tough times and im happy that you are here making content helping people around the world and if i am ever half the man you are id be happy just by looking at the title and thumbnail this is going to be sad dude thanks for talking about this ive started watching you like3 years ago yeah 3 years 3 years ago i was awkward loud and childish and i liked your videos for the loudness happiness and that you were generallykinda like me i liked that but then i sort of disconnected i grew up everything changed for me and your videos just didnt make me happy anymore because you were sharing everything and you seemed so happy it was unreal for me i didnt know why later i discovered i had depression and started to treat it i came back six months ago and i feel more connected to you because you seem more like a person to me more real more confident more like a real human than just an actor playing role yes i sometimes miss the loud green swearing jack who jumped around in excitement but i can always go back and watch your older videos to see that guy nobody should tell you who you should be but you know that already you seem more real by setting boundaries by not sharing everything youve made worst thing that people dont actually know is if you wanna die you dont see it as your dieing you think your making the world better by not being there and for some reason its so stupidly easy to feel like that this made me cry and wish i had a friend like this to help me whats the difference between feeling sad for your self and thinking that i need help 243 i got my hat on backwards its summertime and im ready to fuckin party ah this game is so stunning and your words were precious sean ive watched you grow and change over the past five years and im so proud of you for accepting the changes you needed to make for yourself even if it cost you mental health is worth more than anything so thank you for this video if anyone reads this i hope you have an amazing day you deserve it jack play more warframe or else k thx bye thank you for telling us your thoughts i know it aint easy and there are ppl who needed to understand some of the things you said and i cant express my thoughts entirely and clearly for whatever reasons so im gonna stop here with i love you platonically i understood what you said and i am going to respect your privacy if i ever meet you jhivgvgbh writting as i would talk seriously and kind of personnally to another human is very very hard so a part of me hopes this comment will never be seenswallowed by the other thousands have a nice daynight great video jack keep up the good work please like or notice my comment i miss the high five there was no high five that upsets me thank you for telling this to us sean i feel like it really helped it actually helped everyone youre doing such a beautiful work there sean you cant imagine how mush this helps i apreciate how contious you are about these issues and how mush help your videos provide that speach you gave at the end helped every single person watching if they felt like that before or now or even for futur proofing you did an amazing job i really wanna tell you how mush impact you have and how mush you are giving ive been watching you since i was in primary school and now im in high school and your someone who brought positivity to me when i felt like absolute garbage and you made me feel a little better and made me laugh when i felt depressed when i was told a lot of times that i dont have anything to be depressed about and it only made me feel worse about my sadness like i am ungrateful and being told im too young to understand what its like to be depressed when i have everything you just made my day a little brighter so sean i just want to say thank you even if you dont read this i hope you know how appreciated you are and how much youve impacted me and others this isnt me telling my favorite youtuber how much of a fan i am i just really hope you know how great you are thank you for being such a great caring person and making me smile every day i saw the thumbnail and im intrigued it looks beautiful i shall edit when im done watching its slow boreding holy shit i recreated that pic of that pomeranian but my dog isnt as adorable thank you thank you for making this video thank you for helping so many people through the darkest times thank you for being you so many people needed this video i needed this video you know that you have helped so many people through the darkest of times but youre not there to witness it and i think that you deserve to know that so many people are thankful and have a bit more of a sense of belonging because of you watching this opened a whole other world for me i have been swimming in the darkness for so long because i am scared sometimes i dont even know what im scared of i cant say this enough and i know others are the same but thank you again and again sen that is so deep when you start thinking that something is wrong with you because you start thinking about what happens if you commit suicide you are wrong there is nothing wrong with you everyone thinks about it stay strong thank you for the end bit i felt like this before and i never knew what to do thank you who excited about jack dying his hair press like on the video if you do jesus this made me cry so much i want to personally thank you as a person who was depressed and had a similar experience to you im glad you played this and im glad you talk about everything 2 of my friends are depressed and selfharming and i dont know how to help them even though i was depressed and suicidal and worked through it i dont know how to help them you inspire happiness in society and if everyone was like you then the world would be at its best last few lines gave me lot of hope thank you again makeup is a shallow waste of time and a pack of lies who the heck is cutting onions games like this always get to my heart ahh trans pride flag and gay pride flag the developer did great i keep wanting to like this when i already have the first drug you try might not be the best i tried 4 different ones before i found the right combination and thats in combination with therapy i didnt know people feel this good every day its no wonder they didnt understand how i was feeling before someone disliked this that bit where may said that she just says okay out of reflex that really struck a chord with me thank you for playing this game and thank you for handling these topics with such grace and respect it is pronounced angela he sean please play a plauge tale innocence it is a new the walking dead style story game that will make you cry like little bitch baby jack we all love u a lot take ur time and we will always grow with u while u do ur channel and no matter what im glad u are

saved mine multiple timesi was in a dark place once hating myself and hating everyone and wanting to end it then i saw your play through of a normal lost phone and from that point on i new i wasnt alone and what i was feeling was valid and i discovered who i was you saved me from when my parents would say awful things about people like me and you gave me the confidence to come out and you expanded my mind to see the bigger picture not only will i not forget you i physically cant forget you so thank you sean i am forever in your debt i didnt cry at the first ending but during your second play through when the mc said we can drive around to every therapist in town until we find one you like and may said really youd do that for me that made me cry before medicine i was always in such a dark dark place and it was always so precious when friends really did their best to help support that part just really hit me because i was relating so heavily to may and it felt so real to have a friend tell me theyd go so far to help 3350 i dont want to say this because im saying it for attention but last night i tried to kill myself this video absolutely explains how everything is in my life my past few weeks have been mentally draining and ive had alot going on these past few weeks but thank you sean thank you for being the best you are and being the best youtuber and making me feel better with the small jokes and everything you do thank you sm were all honestly so lucky to have someone as down to earth and amazing as you sean youre only human we all are and we all feel such deep and painful emotions at times even youtubers like you but were all just human and were all so so precious thank you for reminding me and hopefully many other people here that we are loved and that even if its one step at a time we can move forward ill post them on my snap chat advice never trust an atom they make everything up i really needed th8s wow damn man this shit hit the heart this hits home sooo hard sometimes i wonder if sen makes these videos just to say what he wants to say at the end and adds a game behind it to encourage people who think they dont need help to watch it jack i swear i do not know how youre this great of a person and i think i speak for everyone in this comment section that you have inspired many people and impacted many lives thank you for your hardwork to keep us happy and positive we love you shit shit from 1736 on that is literally almost word for word a conversation ive had with someone sean thank you for playing this for anyone who knows someone struggling or is struggling you have support youre not alone this is just my opinion by the way and the way i perceive things so i could be very wrong in some of the things i post people who are assholes when it comes to these topics stress feelings really dont seem to understand how at the very least stress works and some of them just come off self centered like take an example of high schoolers in the 80s some of them may barely had any money their family was poor they had to walk long distances to get to school they probably had to deal with a lot of stuff that stressed them out and thus they didnt care about certain things maybe they were too focused on what nasty basic meal they were going to maybe eat they probably didnt care as much about whether they were popular or well liked they had other issues to deal with but fast forward to when those teenagers have their own teenagers and they are able to live more comfortably well once you take away the stress of being poor and living in poor conditions weres the green hair at when youre working youre climbing a mountain but once youve reached the top you can finally see the mountains that are much larger than yours and each other what water and not same great coke taste with zero sugar now with a hint of vanilla thank you jack for being here for usand we will always be here for you your reason of your youtube channel is the same as mine jack im an artist ive drew three pictures of you and their called jackademon jackapie and jackaplier as someone that had to suffer from major depression a big part of my life this game had meant a lot to me and i finished it crying the dialogue the actions were mesmerizing and now jacks playthrough of it was genuinely overwhelming in a good way i appreciate your efforts man i have also had those kind of days and im a teenager and it was hard because i used to cut and i hated my counselors because of that i felt like nothing helped me and years later i realized that it couldve help me but i just didnt make time and effort for anything thank you for talking jack it really meant a lot at the ending when you were speaking 2018 was the worst year in my life this game hit hard i have had experiences with being suicidal both first and second hand first time my girlfriend had commited suicide after being abused by her dad and then getting raped by her ex which just pushed her over the edge i didnt respond right after that i did not feel emotion i just waited and then suddenly it all hit at once then i spiraled for around 2 years getting worse and worse and worse especially with new things going on in my life and me just being overwhelmed with sadness at one point i cut myself and then everyone suddenly was all over me no one left my side they were all with me until they made sure i made it out of the spot i was in i still get emotional when i hear about something like this and etika its hard but its part of it all any of you going through this please please please hold on help is coming believe me i sympathise with may and i wish i had a friend like that to talk to i always feel so sad when i talk with my family and it gets me down for days and sometimes my guy friends dont really help thanks for sharing sean im gay also the other flag was trans i love you sean family loves you friends us fans love you too thank you so much for

edit omg it actually happened at 3131 lmao so he broke up with me why are you looking up i need to cry but my foundation was 48 ive spent 8 months in a row of my 13 year old life feeling this way getting out of bed in the morning felt pointless and going to sleep was difficult i know were just blank accounts in your comment section but we really care for you sean never forget that 3813 ignore this i just have to come back later hey guys im a huge jack fan its fun interacting with everyone online but sometimes in real life its lonely just hanging out online i was wondering if there are any jack fans in michigan who might want to become friends in real life im just a teenager wanting to make more friends in real life for any one feeling lonley or sad including you sean i love you 3 like so sean sees it easliy kisses aaaaand another video im gonna skip because everything is always politicized we love you man the healthiest you makes for the healthiest us as in the community i wish you the best and will always support us the way you support us with your videos what informative escapism thank you im not crying im not crying good video man it hit me right in the heart love your vids so happy that shiloh was used throughout this game the nostalgia is real in the spirit of this video i just want to say if jack sees this thank you youve helped me through some tough times the end of last year and the beginning of this year were the worst six months of my life i was really stressed and anxious and was lashing out at friends and family because of it i became unmotivated and depressed and you helped me realize that things were going to get better and allowed me to calm down take a step back and realize that something was wrong now even though its still not perfect things are much better for me dear sean as i feel and im sure that everyone else reading this comment feels that speech at the end of the video was very heart felt and impacted everyone watching the video its hard for me to put myself out there like this but i too have been feeling down lately i struggle with creating a better self image for myself every day it feels like my family is getting farther and farther apart and being one of four children u always have that feeling that its ur fault at least part of the time another component to my low self esteem is that i am very overweight and everyone tells me that i look fine but the amount that i suck in while talking to people is quite impressive trust me also therapy has been recommended to me by many people but the idea of getting mental help always scared me i just want to let u know that this video has pushed far enough to finally consider and go to counseling it also gave me an image of someone that i look up to going through the same stuff a i loved playing this game i cried so hard tho but theres like 4 diffrint endings sorry about spelling i cried at 3827 his little breath and the tears in his eyes omfg you are the best gaelic gladiator shit my godamn heart hey will you make another goat simulator video i feel a bit warmer thank u song losing interestshiloh i feel terrible bcs you having to turn out content everyday is also the reason that you didnt feel like yourself and for that im sorry sending hugs to everyone who needs one we got this one day at a time 3 hey sen i know that you dont really know me but i want to say thank you life is kinda rough right now and family has been hard watching your videos makes me feel less alone in a way i find it funny that i can feel so warm from someone who doesnt even know i exist watching your videos always make me smile and forget about everything for awhile so thank you for that best regards aide ps not my real name but i wish it was oof its scary how easy it is to fake an emotion the night i tried to commit suicide my dad even told me that he had no idea and that i seemed fine all day it hit me then that its so easy to fake how you feel and this game hit me more so happy i got to meet you back in 2017 during your tour still have my ticket thanks for being there for me when i need something to cheer me up 3 yo its ddlc 2 liv ur vids hope u stay around for a long time i love the music to this game its so beautiful also first time ive cried from a jacksepticeye video in a while when i was young my mother worked entire days and nights runed around the country from place to place sit there on calls writing for work and barely made money she has pushed a lot of her stress on us as we grew she was a fantastic mother but sometimes i pity youtubers for being able to take time of for themselves without working every day and night without holiday in a unpredictable fieldi grew up thinking that was ok and here i am wanting to become an artist which i know is going to be impossible to do because if i try freelancing i wont be able to make a living its what i love but i am not good at it as others are i dont know if i lack patience motivation or talent this made me ugly cry after watching this made me feel much better about myself because of jacks pep talk in end the video made me cry but in a way that made me release my emotions that i never knew i had i was so distant from myself gay people love flannels yeah just like irish guys like anime games absolutely love the channel jack i think that i speak for many when i say that you should take a break if this whole deal with youtube gets over your head we who care will still be here when you decide to come back prioritize your own personal life over youtube your videos become much more enjoyable when you are happy keep up the good work why are u so heart warming anyways ive been on my phone for so many days and months and years that somtimes ive never interact with people that i live with because i always would relay on the inernet bevause i felt like i was safe there and i could tell everything to people but now when i watch his video i relize that i should be gong places and not always be on my phone all the time as i am every single day i should be hangin out with my friends and enjoying life as it is and explore out into the world thank you for helping me be who i want to be and helping me find who i really am and do things i have never done i hope everyone does the same thing tgis summer and actually try to do things you want to accomplish instead of a small device for entertainment thank you so much sean and make the world a better place i am the grass man and i will never miss your messages i cried through more than half off this and it was so good ty jack when you cant watch the new video because you have anxiety and mentions of self harm can give you an anxiety attack awh i really was looking forward to this yo sean are you okay i know its non of my business buti just want to see people happy i dont want to see people sadand depressedand shit like that and the reason why i want to see people happy becausemy friend almost committed suicide and im not saying that just to seek attention im being honest dammit why am i telling people this nobodys gonna care probably because i feel saveon the internethehwell anyway goodbye world awww this is a big squish game that has a deeper meaning and has an amazing art style and jack even though you may not see this never apologize for ranting because everyone does it and everyone needs to do it im not saying you need to talk to us but just remember to never feel afraid to talk same for everyone you reads this i hope you all have a wonderful day and just remember someone out there cares about you and what you have to say who actually started crying when they saw may cut herself youre a good guy dont worry wait hold on are we going to ignore the fact that he did his intro without the high five i am going through a rough time right now this video videos like thisi dont feel alone when i feel down thanks this hits so close to home last year my sister tried to commit suicide and luckily failed and her friends came to help her she had gotten professional help i will forever thank her friends that saw that coming this is showing poeple that its okay to set boundries as well i know the background music its losing interest by siloh 610 thank you sen for not just being our therapist but your own you didnt need to give us a reason for your actions but you did and i thank you for that we understand maybe not on that level but we do i need to cry but my foundation was 40 dollars jacksepriceye is one thing jacksepticeye is the fun

you had to say jack thankyou the timing of this video and things happening in my life are crazy the video and the ending message hit so deeply i know theres a lot of other subscribers here saying how much they appreciate you and how that can just seem like words but it honestly means a lot how raw youve been with us i had previously been subscribed to you but i stepped away because it just seemed like you were like every other youtuber here living a double life for the sake of the viewers but the way you touched on all these topics is honestly beautiful thank you so much for the spark i was able to clear my thoughts and ease the bone deep tiredness today love you loads sean i love when sean uploads these kind of games because they always help me thanks sean interesting i feel so bad because i commented on a video about how i dont like the ways sean has changed and then when he said stuff about that i felt like such a terrible person and am sorry for ever saying anything negative and this video also changed my mind so much we are all ways here for you sen you just remember that we will always listen if you need to talk about things that are weighing you down dear sean i came across your channel at first i thought you were a funny green haired loud youtuber just screaming at games being a youtuber then i started watching your videos everyday and i got to know the sean behind the jacksepticeye even if i dont really know you you feel like a friend you made even the most monotone days feel uplifting and made me laugh for ten minutes i say 10 but it is obviously 3 minutes i suffer from depression i feel sad and alone a lot i sometimes lay in bed for days wanting to do something but just end up staying in bed because i feel not good enough even as i am writing this i start feel tears welling up in my eyes i start thinking about the days i feel like i am worth nothing that i need to end it all ill never do it but think about it i start feeling the anxious feeling to go out and meeting people and fearing the question hey how are you that question has been answered with lies so much that the answer ne thanks for making this video it really helps me thank

followed and even see its announce you should really check her out thank you sean for reminding me that not all is lost and that i can still find light in the dark it is what i just needed today i appreciate that you arent just an entertainer and that you are an activist on many things i thank you for helping and inspiring all of us to be the best of ourselves thank you so much for talking about this you dont even know how many people you will help just by admitting youve been in those bad mindsets and that you can get out of it its so important to shine a light on it 2006 yes ive had a counselor try to talk to me a few times and it was scary i felt like i was wasting their time or i was being treated as someone insane sorry i comment a lot on this video i have q lot of experience with mental illness and need to share somehow again sorry this really hit me hard as someone who struggles with school i know how that feelseveryday is a mountain to climb with no safety harness but i can come home everyday and spend time with my two adorable cats and everything becomes a bit better thank you sean this means so much to me and to all of us i know youve heard it milion times before but i love you thank you for everything you do thank you for creating this beautiful community and this safe place for all of us and for beeing there for us we will always be there for you and we will give you all the love we have because thats what you do and what you taught us to do to show love to everyone we dont need to know everything about your life we want you to be happy and to keep doing what you do you are an amazing person and also you said everything clearly and at least i understood your way of thinking so dont worry about it its hard to open up like that and you did it to make us feel better and to show us that youve been there and it gets better thank you for that love you so much stay head strong and positive shit happens in life but doesnt mean thats the end ive been there too and it does get you down but thats not all there is theres always a light at the end of the tunnel also when you said love yourself im not trying to be a fangirl but it just reminded me of the message that bts keeps sending again and again about loving yourself and its beautiful i really needed to hear what you were saying at the end thank you all of this hits home so hard if you ever feel like this just know that you are worth something find true friends who care about you instead of friends that are just your friend to have friends do what you love find who you love find people that love you maybe go to church and try to meet some people there try to pray about it if you are not christian consider trying it i have seen gods work he truly does help people get through dark times i hope anybody that needs it gets better remember god loves you people love you and you are worth more than you think nice day to be depressed af youre amazing but whats the most important thing is that you believe youre amazing and how can you not xx if this was a try not to cry challenge i wouldve lost a million times this video was so touching and the game is like too relatable to life i think this was one of my favorite videos of this year thank you sean yay my favorite trigger warning this is why i look up to you jack you love what you do and we love what you do you give us so much inspiration who disliked this jacksepticeye oh i dont know what this game is abou game trigger warning there are mentions of suicide and self harm in this game first of all im proud of you sean taking time for yourself thats a big step for lots of people so keep doing you and i really have to thank angela he the developer for making this her depiction of these issues feelings and thoughts youre dealing with when youre depressed or anxious are spot on and the art oh my 3 anyone of you reading this reach out to someone and i dont care if youre struggling or are completely fine you go out there and reach out to someone you need or who needs you you deserve it or they deserve you we as people need to stand together more i didnt know i needed this gametalk this much wow thank you so much wow this game and vid really helps me in life like i am a kid but i do feel annoyed sometimes so its good that i have someone that entertains me to open my door so thank u jackcepticeye your my shovel i like these videos they feel so safe i really liked watching you play this it was an experience you are doing good and youre never alone we love and respect you sean ya he broke up w me y are u looking up i need to cry but my foundation was x dollars i have been depressed for years now due to my parents financial situation not well and my dad is also sick so its hard im in 11th now first class tomorrow actually thank you jack you are amazing i love you tons if you were happy every day youd be a tv game show host veronica sawyer i love that you use neutral pronouns now for everyone you dont know the gender of i might have had some thoughts that i still have but i shoot them out of me by playing with my dog and going outside and sometimes i watch you sean and your videos help me find my way out of that pitch black tunnel and you are that light at the end of the tunnel you have done that so many times thats why this video made me get out of that tunnel thank you seriously i dont know what i would do without you and your videos my parents would always yell at me and ask me why i was always on my phone and what could possibly be so entertaining on it and in my head all id be thinking was that i was just watching youtube idk just all the different people making you laugh and stuff really just helps you feel not alone in my opinion you feel like you have a friend you dont even know or might not ever meet which frankly im ok with 20 minutes of jack therapy did anyone else notice the bloody scissors in the bottom right of the main menu i am currently medicated for depression but thankfully i have never considered suicide or selfharm as something i would be able to perform my form was more emotionless then sadness im glad i can still laugh jack people want to know everything about you because they are alone they want you as their friend i am sometimes so lonely and have no one for me to go out with or have fun with i play games and watch people on the internet thinking they wre my friends i draw pathetic comics thinking i am gonna make it and the only people i can get along with are people i dont actually like but i make it seem like i do so that i can say that i have someone there i am a loser this tipe of video hit me hard because you give me something nobody else can you help me turn my brain off when bad things happend and give me a bit of happiness i cant find with who i consider friends this video helps me realise that its not ok to feel this way thank you am i the only one who is really grateful for this man being alive he has made me understand a lot of things of life and now i feel like i should be happy for once i love these developers seeing may talk is just so hard for me sad but many times we dont know why we always say were fine but just to not bother everyone else we were the golden child excellent when young but then we start to slack off from the lack of effort and we have so high expectations from our family and we try to escape from reality with jokes memes and games i hate seeing this seeing another one like this but at the same time i like it seeing that im not alone well i know that im never alone with this situation but readinghearingseeing this makes me remember it whats the background music in the last 15 minutes you may read this alot in this comment section but this game really touched me deep inside i mean not just the game i really dont know what to do with this life so many hills i need to climb ive already failed alotthis character may really seems to feel like me in some way i dont know why am i saying something personal like this for some strangers to read even my parents doesnt know what im going throughthis emptiness really does hurt like hell but i know i am not not giving up i know if i push my self i really can do anything what i mean is never give up in any way shape or form it all will be worth it if you just put your back into it thank you sean my mind is so loud that i sometimes cant even control myself thank you for reminding me of what i need to do and what life is worth youre one of the people who saved me and i wanted you to know that i love when u play games like this u always say the right thing like u seem so emotionally intelligent jesus christ sean thank you so much for that message this video reminds me of my friend who tried to commit suicide i dont know what led to it all i know is that maybe one of the causes is because her brother told her that she should hate her real dad her parents got a divorce and since she loved her dad he told her that she should kill herself so that night she went down to the kitchen and popped a handful of pills she went to sleep and then woke up feeling bad and she realized what she did and she didnt want to die so she went to her mom and told her they went to the hospital and the doctor said she woke up on time if she would have stayed in bed for another hour she would have died in her sleep thank you sean for making this it makes me more aware of other people in conclusion people watch what you say to others because your words could be the flame that causes and explosion and give a friend a hug im glad your playing this i couldnt watch the whole thing because its a bit to much for me right now but i think its nice for us to know we are not all alone i love you sean i really do everyone has felt the same thing at one point or another i tried to hang myself from the bathroom door frame didnt work im still here shit gets worse and shit gets better you gotta roll with it and find an out find a distraction so the misery doesnt consume you im not crying my eyes are sweating from all the real talk cheers jackaboy youre a good dude every now and then i feel a little bit lonely i still feel suicidal sean youll most likely never see this but i just wanted to say thanks the second half where you just talk was very much appreciated the second bit really hit home for me i would like to drive trains but my mom is forcing me to go into engineering and i never had to work in elementary now i am failing and as such my mental health is suffering its scary how that hit home warning edgy comments are coming i know you wont see this jack but thank you im genuinely thankful honestly you made me realize that i should take a break from media and find happiness talk to my family and friends about how i feel and live my life and try thank you and also know that we support you and care wow this really touched to heart this reminds me of me in a year ago the ending almost killed me ive been struggling with depression and self harm for years now its getting better but its still there im glad you said something about this jack because not many people wanna talk about this subject yes it is a very heavy topic to talk about it needs to be we have more and more people committing suicide every day every second every year what are people gonna do when they see that even people in younger grades killing themselves its a scary thing to think about i know my message wont reach you and it may never be read but i hope everything in your life goes well even in the darkest of times please know you are loved ive known depression and pain most of my life within my family if it wasnt my brother or mother trying to take their own lives or my father being imprisoned for life it was my own depression hitting me to the ground but you will realize that there is more to this world then pain and anguish and life will get better it may not be today or tomorrow but it will get better all i can ask anyone dealing with depression is talk to someone let someone know that your feeling this way please express yourself let them know what you are feeling there is support out there for everyone please dont leave this world in pain talk to someone i know im just a random person but i hope my message gets out there and helps someone when the green hair jacks therapy

impacting them thank you sean for letting me know even more than i even did about you take your time because you can have the rhythm and consistency you want go with your own flow especially because

suicidal but now i saw this video u helped me and idc what my parents say get off the phone stop playing video games and stop recording them u are not gonna be nothing in life ur a mistake that is now destroyed in pieces im doing what i love but also respect my parents so they can understand me i talked with themu know when i first saw u 5 years ago i was more suicidal but i just wanted to forget so i spent my time watching u so i can forget thank u sean love u and i will always remember u thank u 1850 mean either sean thank you so much for sharing your story and being open about these difficult topics i am so so so proud of you for taking care of yourself and learning how to build boundaries something that is so important and helps us take better care of ourselves youre doing amazing and im so glad you feel you are in a better place now life is about learning to grow and youre doing a great job cant wait to keep growing with you this really makes me think of me and my girlfriend though were long distance its really similar how we met and how we started really talking and getting closer both of us dealing with a lot of stress and hard stuff in life but both of us have been in the same place as may or the main character and helped to lift each other up it really is an upward struggle and a lot of people hide away not wanting to be a burden to the point they really cant do it on their own but with one person willing to reach out and help you pull yourself out of that hole you dug its easier and really can shine some light in what you thought was a dark meaningless existence just one person can really help remind you that life is still worth the fight and give you that drive to cling to it so you can work to better yourself oof just oof words dont begin to describe how your words have profoundly touched and everyone here do thanks for everything you do man usually i ignore stuff like this but you somehow kept me listening i know that a lot of the people who have watched this whole video are willing to help you because whether you wanted to or not youve helped a lot us not gay but i love you and everything you do and your officially my

to miss out on the things i could do with my family your message at the end has touched me at such a deep level i have had dark thoughts before not as dark as others but i felt tired and without drive basically every day but somehow i got help when i didnt even think i need it because i always thought i was just complaining on a very high level and could deal with it on my own and it has opened my eyes to how much better i vould have been all this time had i just gotten help and i feel like a message like this has the potential to get people even those who think they dont need it to get help and that is wonderful thank you sean i love that jack is so real and so wise did anyone else catch the mean either i swear u need to be on ted talk u are so motivational i swear i cryed to this and that helped me just a little bit but more too 2211 i feel that way too when i talk with my dad they told me their name amy me my name is amy o surprised pikachu face we love you jack 3 well this is the first video in a while that made me cry i really needed that jack i didnt know i did thank you while listening to that i kind of just started crying it was weird amazing story eyyy im in the first 43k comments yes i realize its not an actual achievement watching this gave me the push to tell my dad im going to cosmetology school instead of university you dont look any disconnected just yourself and thats whats important i was thinking about jack my first attempt i cried and watched his videos all night and it settled me down for awhile i always come to you when i need it you always bring me up this game was to relatable for me im happy that may had someone that was there for her that helped her in my case im mostly using music do distract myself from all the shit that goes through my head and ive lost most of the people that would stay by my side the friendship just ended is what im trying to say thanks for video jack the 200 people who disliked this need to grow up and let themselves learn about emotions listening to jack talking about serious topics motivates me very and i just enjoy the serious game jack youre frickin outstanding man does anyone else see the pollen playlist on spotify i was listening to a sad song on my phone then accidentally dropped it and all i heard was top of the morning to ya laddies u do care and anyone who believes the same as me knows u

and live your best life aint goin back and forth with you hello comments my name is ivan im 12 years old and i suffer with chronic depression and i cut myself and think about ending my life on a daily basis sometimes i cant handle it and i wanted to speak about it my life has been very rough recently from my parents falling out and my mothers drug addiction i have been more self harming than ever i fell off and started smoking weed and doing meth now i dont even live with either of my parents this video made me think a lot about my own personal mental health and my life recently i had started to distance myself from my friends for some reason whenever they reached out to do something i would always say sorry i cant today but im starting to realize that my social life and my friends are two of the most important things to me im not proud of who i am turning into but im trying to fix myself and be more open and active with others i have had the worst year of my life this year with lots of emotional hills which made me want to give up but remembering that everyone is there beside me helping me through life is what keeps me going im still not the best with my mental health today but i think im a lot better than i was waitjunji ito the junji ito the one who make horror stuff wait what sumimasen nani the fuck thanks jack i needed this i have been so depressed for a long time and its started to become harmful its really tempting to give up but ill keep going something about the faces of the characters is sobreathtaking and beautiful bruh its the only game with no capital letters on its name you know i have one of your quotes constantly flipping through my head i even put it on my wall it was the youll be okay maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but some day you will be okay sean how tf am i gonna fit half an hour of the most encouraging thing ive ever heard on my wall hug to everyone going through this now that i care even if i dont know who you are great message in a small game and this why i love jack for playing these types of games jack this is the person most of us are proud to see you being yourself and you being happy thank you for sharing this with us i know i speak for all of us when i say you really motivate everyone on this platform this reminds me of a time i just stayed up late at night to help a friend of mine she had so much shit going on and she almost offed herself luckily she didnt and shes doing okay love the message in this game i relate so hard to may god i need a hug wheres my cat oh waiti dont have a cat dang honestly though mays character hits me down to my core i hope i can find a friend i can trust that much in my future me talking to my friend after this video you have a cat right thank you i would never quess that you of all people could say some thinks that push me to try to find some help for last few month i thought about suicide pretty much every day with only thing that help me dont do it was my promise gived to myself when i tried but failed few years ago everyday waiting for that final push to make me go for it joking about it with my last friend remaining but never actually say that i have that problem to anyone immediately after end of video i went on internet and find some places where i can go for help hopefully i am going to be able go there tomorrow i am sorry if anyone read it i just feel that if i dont write it i not going to go tomorrow and once again thank you jack for giving me the push i want to hug may through the screen someone rant about anything if you want ill listen xx thank you for being the greatest person 124 they have a trans pride flag its so nice to see a game acknowledge us i cant do what i love coz i dont have a pc and thats a massive fucking hill to save up to taller than mount everest i need to cry but my foundation was 48 509 hold your cup right jack jacksepticeye talks for 10 to 20 minutes straight 201617 was the worst years ive ever had in my life i unfortunately went through a lot of negative things had lots of bad things happen to me thankfully i got the help i needed from family etc and now i am stronger in some ways than i was before sean ive watched you for years and i really love how youve grown to support mental health as much as you do today taking the small victories really helped me get through a lot youre so on point about not comparing yourself to others and staying in your own lane i compare myself now to a few years ago and even though it felt like i only made small strides this whole time ive actually come a long way mentally i downloaded this a couple weeks back such a good game really makes you think just thx the universe for jack you are here for us we are always here for you dont you dare forget about that 3 came for gameplay stayed for life saving advice this looks and sounds like ddlc these drawings are so amazing i could stare 50 mins at the characters and admire them im truly in love with this artstyle you made me cry i really needed that thank you ur an amazing person jack dont stop being u and take time for urself if u have to i wont judge the art is so cute but after the first ending i dont think i wanna watch anymore this is an amazing game damn these people are good at what they do loud jackaboi is fun but this is quality gaming absolutely an amazing game i played it myself and its honestly one of my favorite visual novels its difficult not to compare yourself to others one of the many things i struggle with is the lack of experience with anything in life people around me often talk about trips they made relationships theyve had drunk stories and etc and when you compare that to yourself never left country no friends to do stuff with too shy to try new activities alone never been in a relationship more it makes you feel like youre nothing compared to them you have contributed nothing to this world to anyone else who struggles with anything in their life especially depression of any kind dont give up theres supposed to be a light in the end of the tunnel but it wont come to you if you stand still i honestly havent watched you for a long time since you had like 9 million or so and youve changed so much and its not bad change is very important and i actually like you more right now because you are still hilarious but also respectable but for me there is no happiness on january 6th 2018 my best friend james ended his life he sent me a final text the day before and i wish i wouldve acted on it earlier but ill forever and always be too late i wish i could go back to that day and see him go to his house that night instead of the next morning but i cant the universe works in crazy ways this lines up with my life at the moment perfectly really really needed this today thank you so much i thought this was gonna be a happier video since its sean but thank you for touching on this topic and it was much needed im a lovely bubbly person who bottles up emotion i guess im just waiting for that day eeeeeee it has a shiloh dynasty lofi song w that was one of the calmest intros i have seen jack done i played this game while ago it was really great supprised to see it on youtube i honestly broke down crying so many times during this video hit way too close to home lmao is it bad that what i saw the notification i thought he messaged me and i got exited love you sean youre actually awesome just who you are what was the other game called 2019 sucks so far jack just look at the difference of likes and dislikes and youll confirm that more people care about you than they dont was that gfuel i saw who dafuq dislikes this video why hasnt he dyed his hair green liked your vids for a while now and i could never get bored of them i needed your message sean i literally just told my husband this game is too much like me and cried im trying desperately but its one of those times where life just takes it out of you i feel lost doing what i love doesnt pay the bills and social services dont consider crippling anxietydepression to be in need of financial and medical help how many suicides will it take for our friends family government world to care i was completely okay with the game and actualy liked it but when jack started talking after it he made me cry because everything in it is so true thanks for sharing such an amazing talk with us honestly ive been going through probably the darkest times of my life right now this video really means a lot of me and while i am not actively hurting myself though have suicidal thoughts from time to time i hope that i will find the friends and support that i seek out and deserve i think there is a lot of hope in this video and it makes me stay strong especially the end about your life and really your 2017 video meant so much to me as well as i was really depressed and wasnt honest with myself during that time ive been trying theropy and admit it hasnt really helped but i will continue to press forward thank you my god where was this video sophomore year i really needed it back then san i seriously love and appreciate you so flipping much honestly thank you for this video youre such a saint thank you so much for being open with us and never feel ashamed of complaining about what youre going through that feeling like your problems are small and inconsequential can hurt you that goes for anyone they say not to cry over spilled milk but sometimes you have to because its the straw that breaks the camels back because so many little big and in between things have piled up and the smallest of issues become like knives slicing through your mind heart and soul every problem can cut so never let yourself believe that yours shouldnt if your body gets hurt you tend it even for the little things because the little things can become big if you let them and you mind is the same way you wouldnt sit and bleed saying it wasnt important because the cut was small so dont sit and break in silence because the problem is trivial someone cares even if its just a name and some text on a screen somewhere someone always cares and when you find them they are th i missed jack playing games like these and really engaging with these issues this made me shiver every single second of the video the messages in this video hit me super hard they just stabbed my in the heart multiple times i just played this game last week and jack one question do you watch clumsy if you dont please do he got the memes everyday omg the other day i watched someone play this its an amazing game wow i really felt sad listening to this but i enjoy listening to him and watching his videos ive struggled with depression for a year now and there were times when i just didnt think anyone cared i still have hope though and i keep my head high because i realize there might be light on the other side of this dark depressing road i just have to lead myself to it thank you sean for talking about what you think about this topic i know its really sensitive to talk about and just an update i have a therapist and im getting better we love u sean we love u alot wow i really didnt need to cry while doing my makeup but thank you sean for talking about this so much 3 damn midway through the video and the talk with may about her parents hits me so damn hard i know how that is i know its a game but thats literally how my lifes going now i feel like more games like this need to be released yes they are sad and upsetting but they always end in a good message suicide is never the answer i dont know why this reminded me of etika this really touched mekeep up the good work and i feel you how do i give an award to a video you could tell this was not scripted jack was playing a game so how would he script it he cant so how would he script the end he didnt there is only one therapist in my town and she made me feel guilty for being sad and violated the hipaa i think thats what its called where you cant tell patients about other patients laws the next closest therapist is over an hour away and i dont have the money to make the commute im not looking for pity just for advice wow a toppa tha mornin without a high five green hair you said in the stream you would thank you for showing these kinds of games the topics are difficult and the fact that you take the time to discuss them is heart warming your journey with your own well being and mental health are uplifting and seeing you go after happiness and what you deserve is a welcomed reminder for the rest of us can you play fnaf help wanted vr please 545 that melody got sampled i a papithbk song hes kinda underrated but hes really good sen you say people say that youve changed i would totally agree with them but not for the reason they would say it is normal for people to change over the years especially in your case with your impact on this platform and the joy youve brought to peoples day people tell you that you dont care about them anymore but this isnt fair on you you were a lot smaller back then which made interaction with your viewers much easier having a far larger audience is great but it makes the interactions far more difficult i understand youve matured youve grown up and i respect you as a person ive watched you from the beginning and seeing you grow and change so many peoples lives has put a huge smile on my face as i am irish myself i love the person youve turned out to be keep on spreading that positive mental attitude love you dude sean is always posting his videos for us but does he ever take time to post videos for himself and post videos that he wants to post team pma sean you dont have to act like someone your not because no matter how long the road gets that your going down i will always be there for you for me im a totally perfect person until something wrong or strange i fall apart till i have to pick myself up im never full already love the game trans pride flag and pride flag jack its honestly bullshit that your channel is dying and people who tell you that just want to see you suffer i and a lot of other people really really care about you and your content i dont care if you change as long as its for your own benefit duck life i absolutely love your speeches thank you for them it is really videos like this that show what an amazing person you really are and yes i totally noticed the change youve made with the channel but if you asked me its been the best change there could have been you can really see how much better you feel these days you seem far more relaxed and calm and if anything more like you not just the loud guy who is just there to entertain you grew so much and im so proud of you sean and im also so happy to say that i grew with you ive gone from literally relying on your daily videos to feel some sort of happiness and having full on panic attacks if uploads were late to someone whos going back to school picking up my own future again not minding if i cant watch videos today and im very proud of myself but that last part hit home i know what im doing is great but just hearing it feels so good so thank you sean thank you so much for helping me through some rough times i love you man seeing jack on the edge of crying almost made me cry i relate to may too much as someone who dropped a carrer almost at the end of it to start another one the par at 5046 is the one that hit me the most thank you jack for your words so yeah he broke up with me why you looking at the ceiling i need cry but my foundation cost 48 dollars this was the last thing i expected when i clicked on this video but its something thats definitely important and worth mentioning to the entire world i feel so sad when i hear about everyone talking about when they wereare depressed or suicidal but happy at the same time happy because they are opening up about it happy because they are trying to fix it whether by talking to friends or from professional help happy because they havent given up yet because they have decided to keep struggling and get over the hill that seems taller than the everest as someone who hasnt had any real life experience on depression etc i cant really say much other than that this game does help so much for others like me to understand the people that go through this it shows how most of the people usually wear a mask and hide their true feelings sometimes for the better and others for the worse ive been watching you since you had around 6m subs watching your videos for all this time i wanna give you a hug i wanna hug can someone please give him a hug jack you deserve all the good things and love in the world jack you are what people call real thank you for everything we still love you jack getting older shows you what really matters do what makes you happy we will all still be here e t i k a 746 that hit me way too deep thank you so much for this video and your amazing tangent at the end it really helped me me ohh this seems interesting sees that its 50 minutes umm ill watch you when the series is over i didnt know i needed this today but im glad i got to hear it thank you jack watching your videos have definitely helped me through some tough times and youve definitely impacted my life for the better i love these videos because of your message at the end i love the game its gorgeous but listening to sean relate on such a high level and make the whole youtube thing look how it actually is emotions happen and to hear that he went through these things it made things a lot more real if you have gone through this or are going through this please reach out it helps a lot you are loved you are cared for please take care of yourself suicide is never the answer neither is self harm the storm will pass and we are here for you i needed to hear this today thank you for this jack thank you so so so much dude ive been so stressed and blue lately and today i sat down with a vanilla iced coffee played some minecraft and watched this video it helped so much to just chill with you for a bit thanks dude brilliant commentary i really thought it was very thoughtful and informed i agree with the message man i really needed to hear that message in the end thank you jack you would make the best grandpa dad assuming youll have kids one day you are so chalked full of advice of value and life that everyone needs today is it just me or should sean really a motivational speaker just played this game had no idea it was this big this is littlerly almost an hour thank you sean you have changed my mind a little bit on my preceptions recently ive thought about cutting again im on antidepressants but like you said i still have very bad days ive thought about trying youtube and you really have helped methen for those of you considering suicide stay safe i know how it feels i cant stress this enough you will overcome this right now im having a hard time but im still here today because i know i can get over this this video is better than 1000 of psychologists your a good man sean that end part was great i was left hanging for the highfive the heck bwaha after finishing the video i see this comment could be taken wrong i just have ocd ive gone through things like this me and my best friend both have as i was slowly figuring myself out i was becoming more depressed i changed pronouns but only with her and her family to my family im still their perfect little girl but they dont know all we me and my best friend go through i kinda feel like may in the 2nd ending i have the scars but i also have the hope so thank you to my best friend and her family and to you jack you all make the world all the more bearable you made me cry with you from the inside but remember leave those things behind and start a new page and always look forward and plz if you see this jack remember this when you look up high you fill like a bird flying freely thats life harsh but kind thank you again for being so honest i felt like i just wanted to reach through the screen and hug him one reason for the profession i strive to do is as a therapist i really want to help people who feel sad or like they have no one to go to i want to be that person that they can go to for help but im 12 and will have to try my best to get to that point also the end segment is really touching

video is about sean does really care please finish layers of fear the end portion i can relate to more than most of my friends and family know i thank you for always being truthtful and real i myself am very positive but inside im kind of broken and sad but watching this video makes me realize some things it makes me look at other people in a new perspective it makes me that much more determined to help people thank you for being here for us i need a clip of the end bit from 3245 to the end i relate a lot to may writing is my passion specifically fanfiction so many people devalue it simply because of what fanfiction is painted as but some fanfic is better than any published book you could pick up at the bookstore but writing is something for me to pour my heart into and the community gives so much positive feedback even if i think my first story is a bit poorly written there are thousands of people that loved it that look forward to the next chapter thanks for reading through the entire rant x3 this game really hit home for me just over a week ago i had a friend commit suicide in his college dorm he really was always smiling and the sweetest person but after his parents disowned him for being gay he struggled a lot i didnt crywhat are you talking about thank you very much jack for all love and respect u for this all i do is distract myself i wish that i would have heard this so much we cant promise that when you talk to someone they will understand how you feel but we can promise that its better to talk to someone then keep it bundled up i love everyone in this community stay strong all of you to everyone if you ever need someone to talk to im here i feel like you are my roommate my friend that i just love to stay next to i dont know is that bad when you

much love and hugs thank you close sean it was called you left me the people that want you to go back to the way you were are the people that havent evolved themselves because i recognize the feeling back when i had depression i put my entire self in this channel i did nothing other than watch jse videos and all the constant positivity was the only human interaction i had and the only human interaction i liked for those that care i am way better today i god rid of my depression a year ago but i think the people that want you to go back have out their entire self in the channel and now that they cant do that they dont know what to do other than try to get the constant positivity back i dont really know where im going with this i just felt like sharing this sean im not trying to put pressure on you but if you died that way i would die that way because you are mostly the only thing that actually keeps me alive i hope you never feel that way i love you sean the boss is awesome i need to cry but my foundation was 48 dollars i was on a plane when this was posted and i was so sad that i didnt see it right away who misses the high five senwe are here for you thank you jack i have

waiting for jack to play it im in love with this game wheres the slap no high five wait gf stands for girlfriend right am i being wrong or is jack just getting old this was actually very anxiety triggering for me because it keeps reminding me how much stuff i have to do that message was so powerful though ive been dealing with depression since i was 15 sometimes still think of ending it all but i know there are people that care about me there is always hope so jack you made me cry again today and the last part in the speech made me cry i thank you ive played this game and i might have not but it helped me including you playing this game thank you that speech at the end really got to me i have just been thinking everybody is gonna die so while not just do it sooner but that end part

things awaits i know this sounds so cliche but its true lots of love honestly your real fans who care about you and not just what you do are glad you care about yourself more take care of yourself we want you happy and healthy more than anything tbh we all need to disconnect even if just a little bit all this exposure from the internet and social media really messes with the lives of everyone everyone is just glued on their phones years ago when people would say that id just think that its how life goes and its progress its the future but sometimes progress this fast will be negative to your health my mom just says im lazy and pathetic when im proud of a small victory she laughs at me sen i completely agree with you someone is always there for you except when there isnt lily x albert the game ive been a fan for 335 years i know thats not a huge amount of time but still throught this period of time ive seen sean go from a green bean to a coffe bean to an irish gladiator he has changed but in his core he is the same kind and genuine person the truth is that this year i havent been watching jack as i did considering i was watching every single video he uploaded now i watch only the games that seems interesting to me but i am forever greatfull to you jack for getting me through the entirity of high school the long term fans owe you a lot and the people that just got here hopefully will get the same beautiful advice you give about the world as part of the community i just wanna say we love you and we dont need to invade your personal life to be entertained youve already given enough of yourself the only way for us to engoy your content is when you actually feel happy making it and believe me theres a huge difference from game to game omg i love this developer this is gonna be good lol this made me cry im a fortnite fan but if i watch any videos of yours im happy rest easy desmond a real legend an amazing guy really he was an amazing human being so kind and generous and never mean or negative the fact that the mental illness was in him because thats what it is an illness shows that youll never know how someones really feeling rest easy etika ive never really wanted to comment before but that game and how you honestly talked about such a heavy topic thank you ive felt like this every day for years thank you for your words and compassion your an amazing person with a huge heart thankyou for this video so many people value this video and your words and motivation many may look up to you as a hero giving everyone joy its important to take care of yourself before worrying about others it might sound selfish but sometimes you need to be you can be the most cheerful positive person around but without feeling miserable and sadyou miss so much of living life to a full understanding because everyone suffers at some point so take care of your self anyone who has read this your unique somehow and theres so many people you dont know who love you for you i am very proud of how much you have grown i have watch your channel for years please continue to move forward sean it is inspiring to see you grow rude people getting insulted no u keanu reeves getting complimented no u wheres the clap to be honest these kind of talks is what i need personally i feel less isolated now that i know that im not the only one who struggles to find true happiness or to love themselves i see that over tge years you too has grown so much as a person and im so proud of you it takes a lot of bravery to talk about whats currently on our mind or whats bothering us but at the end it will feel like a massive relief so if you do struggle with something anything really talk about it im very happy to be part of this community and that you are still going keep it up and love ya if i knew what i love doing that shit hit me hard i like how this game has some lgbtq pride in it i know this game is about something else but kudos to the dev for the lgbtq shout out good on her i feel you bro this will sound dumb but 6th grade depressed me because i genuinely had a bad teacher who would abuse his power so i feel you and your a good man shaun im not crying i just have northern downpour in my eyes may could maybe write song lyrics i love your videos because they make me smile at times but can also make me cry at other times the way you talk about these subjects deeply inspires me to be who i am and to improve thank you for sharing and your words of encouragement jack all of us love u it looks like the game one night stand i am going to share a bit of my story my name is hemi and i am 12 but my mind had thoughts of a teenager i did things to my body that made my mom force me to go to a doctor and get medicine i have not gone to the doctor yet but my mom is making me even though i dont want to but i thought i was fat and i was never going to be happy and i thought i was stupid i have panic attacks and anxiety attacks too frequently trust me i am not over exaggerating i dont share my story very much but i love jack and i felt as though he was in my mind telling me that i could trust everyone here and i would feel better doing this 936 omfg i love shamrock shakes bro them cuts on her arm were like real suicide atempts because whan u cut yer arm diagonaly it creates a lot bigger hole for the blood to come trough but when you cut it horizontaly it creates a smaller hole and you cant bleed out from that my father told me stories of a friend that woked in the ambulance and when he arived and saw a guy with his arms cut open horizontaly he just stood there not doing anything because he new that the guy wouldnt bleed out and just wanted attention be carefull of your frends esspesaly those who want attension ps go help em ether way i have bipolar when i was unmedicated i did stupid things and my emotions were everywhere i still have downs but luckily i have a theropist and meds that help alot also jack helps make me happy when im down and im eternaly greatful for that i can tell all of you that sean is right you never know what people go through take me for example when im outside in public i try to be a normal good citizen talking to people socializing a bit although im not the best at it lol in public its like a flower blooming feeding off of the warm cozy sun but when i am alone its like the flower hides while a natural disaster comes by frightening uncontrollable when im alone im a totally different person i feel lonely sad its like ive turned into a monster that i hide from the outside world and the only time to unleash it is when im alone because im afraid of what people may think afraid that i may show the dark side of me i feel so darkened that i honestly question my existence why am i here whats my purpose doesnt seem like i belong why do i still try why cant i be a handsome guy that gets friends easily and is open look at yourself an ugly monster no matter where you this video is probably one of the most inspiring things ive ever seen on youtube thanks jack i typically dont comment on videos but i felt like i needed to on this one i love you so much jack you have always helped me through tough times some people say that youve changed but to me you have always been the same caring and loving person youll always be my favorite youtuber person in this world thank you for everything that you do think of that lets play the end message was so sweet i am almost exactly like may except im ugly and fat but the message at the end really warmed my heart and it felt really good thank you jack this game and video brung me to tears i was at this point where im stuck i dont wanna be here and all of that even now few years later after i came out i still get that feeling like before those dark thoughts i always wondered what would it be like if i was gone being trans or just different isnt easy in a country where you cant be yourself its very hard all i wanted to say this and for someone who can relate i believe in you and please hang in there theres always hope and if you need someone to talk to or just to vent your feelings out day or night you can reach out to me ig deadloverboy im sorry for my rant but i just couldnt help it this game brought me so many memories and so many emotions stay safe hang in there heres a free virtual hug everyone needs a hug were all human we all have feelings dont be ashamed of yourself for that get help your not alone yea from my personal experience i can say that your brain is your worst enemy that rush of darkest thoughts and you in the eye of the storm fighting it all where every day is you trying to do basic things and all the limbs fail this mean so much to me you know jack i already have plane to kill my self this morning im cry and keep screaming i want to die my family keep pushing me to be perfect like my brother sometimes my parents hit me and keep yelling at me they say pain make me feel motivated so i think they dont care about me they dont care if i die anyway i dont need to stay nobody will miss me if i gone then i remember i have a friend i dont meet her for a while shes busy but i remember when i tell her about committed suicide she screams dont die i need you you are the one and only i dont want to make her sad she need me i need to stay and this probably not important but my name is angela too respect from lithuania we have the bigest suicidal rate in eu and its the worst jack is very good with this stuff which is a talent you should play mystic messenger lol jack just take small breaks freaquentinently take a day here and there mabey take sundays off most people will be ok with that just tell us beforehand jacksepticeye playing middleearth shadow of war bruh i played this game its sooo good i cried and thats not the only time i did being on this journey with jack since the beginning also throughout that ive changed a lot as a person i went from being a kid to almost a full adult im going through a lot and that speech really opened my fucking eyes i love you sean keep making everyones day a little better anyone else miss the slap at the beginning jack i much rather prefer you now insightful and easier to relate to than you old self take it easy man i honestly dont know what i could say i have been crying for the last few minutes because something in that talk just hit home i guess even though i do feel bad myself i still try and help everybody that i can but instead of helping them i just ended up internalising their desperation and made myself worse i still want to do so much for others because its the only thing that makes me happy right now but i realise that i cant just rely on that thank you jack i needed this if there is anybody out there carrying a burden please reach out i stayed on my own for too long and i feel its starting to break me there are people that can help whether it be a friend a family member or a professional dont feel like youre bothering them it hurts me more to see somebody say that theyre fine when i can sense that theyre not than having somebody reach out to me because then it is easier to give the support that they need please everybody stay safe i thought i could handle myself but im feeling woozy jack has a grate point people arent predictable like you see in movies or behind a screen inside they could be hurting people who think that jack is being a attention seeker are completely wrong as a community we need to start raising awareness about this this isnt people trying to seek attention this is people trying to get the support they need as a community we need to stop being judgemental and start trying to make a difference sen plays my life tries to call it a game im onto you this is a really cute game with a very good message i saw gloomgames play this thank you i stopped at 127 is it me or the audio quality isnt quiet as crisp as usual im staying off of social media for a few days starting today i need a cleanse i need to get rid of some of these toxic friends ive made i need to leave it so badly life has been getting bad because im on social media so often and all these bad friends have been influencing and ive been being such an asshole to my brother when weve only got so much time together i cant push him away and let him think i hate him forever ive got such an argumentative personality and thank god i know i can fix it and im not one of those girls who blames it on their zodiac ive been so much more outwardly positive but ive got such a bad attitude and vibe given off to my brother im glad i have the mentality to fix it youre such an inspiration and i cant just say that anymore youre the one person in a very small group of who cares to speak up this much and cares about their fanbase i dunno i wish there was a better word than inspired but you did ins my dog is sickwhite gums very bad but if she makes it through the night we can take her to the vet shes what keeps me going and if she doesnt make it i wont be able to go on she keeps me grounded its upsetting to see just how many people are seriously depressed these days i honestly feel like ive lost all hope its been like that for almost a year now ive been holding on for so long im so numb to the world and nothing makes me happy but i have to hold on for my loved ones its so fucking unbearable that i have to sleep for most of the day ive been trying to get better for five years and its just gotten worse i dont really know what to do no psychologists or medications have really helped im just kinda relying on alcohol now and that also sucks idk maybe ill get better somehow just gotta hold on i guess like i said its difficult but things like seans videos really keep me going i want to cry but my foundation was 48 this game is fantastic but wow it makes me feel so lonely in a strange way makes me want to lie down and talk with my nonexistent gf for hours about junk this game is a sad dream for a lonesome queer i love the story and messages and metaphors of course but the cute illustrations and conversations made me feel a little sad it is good to know that a story with the hope ending is possible though sean thank you so much for taking the time to talk about this subject you really tugged at my heartstrings and this brought me back to when i was having those dark thoughts and how happy i am to be here today what you said about being a different person but a better person for yourself really resonated with me i am so much more different than i was five years ago when i was having suicidal thoughts stuck in a very deep depression and i am a different person for the better im not living my life for the people around me anymore i am living for me and my happiness alone to anyone out there having those thoughts remember you have people that do care about you so take some time quiet your mind and seek the help you need you are worthy of living you are worthy of having happiness shiloh dynasty was a perfect audio choice for this game thank you for being there and saying those simple but clear things to so many people who wouldnt hear them otherwise i have a long story of mostly useless therapy so i already know this stuff but unfortunately so many people who need it dont also beautiful game and can we talk about the fact the mc is trans but the game doesnt make a fuss about it treating it as just a detail known because of a flag and not turning it into the usual dramatic tearshedding so sad plot point like it should be sorry for dont have the best words to say but thank you for the gameplay the words toughts and feelings peace xd i discovered your channel 5 years ago and didnt regret you make me laugh and make me happy from all your funny videos thank you i literally had the same dream as may did a few days ago which is kinda creepy yaaa i recommend this game this just made my day thx jack i love you sean if you need to spend some time for you and your new girlfriend take that time spend some you time sean has the greatest personality and is a good man jacksepticeye this video reminded me of my friend talking about suicide and cutting him self and he was so depressed he would answer the phone and just say nothing and we just talk in silence and then i would start crying saying dont do it and i walk to his house and that is 9 miles away and i walked ther and i found him ab it hang him self and ran as fast as i could and i stopped him from going through with it i just hugged him and people might call me gay for that and he was my bestfriend and i stayed with him for hours and days and i got my dad to bring my clothes and i just stay with him i was getting called gay for doing that and i was slowly going down hill and he helped me get to the mental state i previously in and im the nicest person he has ever met in his live and we got called gay bc he was my only friend and i was his only friend he got jumped at school and he was getting the crap beaten out of him and i jumped in and broke it up and the boys who done that broke his didnt expect id cry while watching this positive years that speech at the end really shows a soft side of sen and that is what makes sen one of the best people out there we need more people like this and more youtubers need to be a bit more open like this we will always love and support you sen thank you so so much thank u smol bean does everyone feel like theyre going to cry when they hear this kind of stuff or is it mainly people who this hits home for i dont ever really cry so even feeling like it rn is crazy to me omg im so excited i love angela i wish you werent just another stranger you seem like the best person on camera i wish you were my friend sometimes i just wish i had a friend stop man you made me cry youve made me cry with you sen id just want to give you a hug wish you where closer so i could just come over for a cup of coffee and talk xx your words mean so much jack i really needed that motivational speech lately so thanks keep doing what you do it helps a lot 3 thanks for the message at the end jack that was beautiful much love to everyone what happens to him doing the drums thank you jack the people who dislike this need a soul all those people who disliked were crying so much that they couldnt see and accidentally pressed the wrong button dont worry 20152019 has been the worst year for me im fine a bit now im leaving home more but im still alone i had a friend but his bissy a lot so im all alone im sorry youve felt the way i have this makes me think that i am not the only one who is doing self harm and being sad all the time because i act positive all the time because i want to hide my true self all day long so no one will question me in some kind of way but i found other people does anyone else think that jack would be a really good therapist this video hurt my soul i feel u sean were all in this together bro im also a meme lord 2800 haha youre righ omg frisk stay determined message subscribe to me san take all the time you need and thank you so much for all the time you put into this and im glad youre enjoying things and theres absolutely no need to tweetinstagram everything like you said enjoy your life the literal moment this video ends im going to watch the other again you should watch daniel and depression i think u probably already have but theres a bit in there that talks about how if u feel like you dont want to do anything including eating all you want to do is lie in bed and just be thats when you feel depressed this comment if for u sean but also anyone else wondering what its like to be depressed 515 already with the we bear bear references and no i dont care if i absolutely butchered the name i gently open the door hey may are yo i have played this game so many times and almost every time i have cried who the fuck disliked this video in the words of tyler joseph take pride in what is sure to die you will die one day but now shouldnt be that day everyone should fight to the bitter end and stay alive because everyone has at least one person that cares for them this just reminded me of etika knowing we had a chance to save him but didnt you never know what someone its going through ive been noticing a pattern in your thoughts in recent months or even years im noticing your fear of being misunderstood and coming off as if you dont care about us so i just have something to say about that you know as someone whos been in the community since the good ol days where you were more caring and hyper and energetic and have watched you grow all i can say is that 1 i have grown with you 2 i love the version of yourself youve become just as much as i have loved every other and it just feels right you feel authentic and honest and mature and i can relate to you on a personal level which is incredibly rare with social media influencers 3 you havent become less caring dear please forget this fear of yours you know its irrational youre one of the most caring and kind people ive ever known even if i dont know you irl and have never met you im crying as im typing this because the kindness of your heart is always contagious and can be felt through th hey jack if you ever need to take a break from youtube and making videos we all understand 3 i came hear to laugh not to get hit with the feels train this is the best video and whoever dislikes this is too happy or something thank you jack like this is you didalmost cried for some reason i just needed the motivation thank you so much san it is much appreciated thank you for making this consversationi appriacte it nobody regrets this video i really needed this video i have been going through quite a bit and its been rough truly rough i lost my best friend to suicide in october of 2017 and it still haunts me the fact that i feel i still could have done something i still think maybe i should have done the same followed in suit but this video it really helped me see what i need to do your speech was the most inspiring part it made me realize that i really just need to get the help i need after trying twice and flatlining once before being brought back i still didnt see the point in life but now i do thank you sean this video just like all the others have truly helped me you truly are an amazing person haha woah i played this 3 days ago i cried at that last bit why you got to make me cry man 4412 not gonna lie i thought he was going to say hardcore drugs love you sean a lot of people think that because you act happy you are but sometimes you arent you have to find someone or something that keeps you happy so you know that you can still be happy came for the gameplay and got a great speech from jack wow man you really made me think what i should do with my life instead of watching videos and playing games all day long it was a good choice to watch the video till the end thank you very much 3 the lack of wapoosh but with top of the morning caught me off guard my names amy to 3248 until the end is what everyone needs to watch in case you were looking i am just crying for one girllol thank u d gaymemeall this all ive ever wanted thank you for telling what was in your mind sen have a good life your life you are amazing and im happy that your happy and i want you to be happy and i know im a random fan but im in depression and i know how it feels wheres the green hair huh nah but on a real note thanks for the good message and taking things seriously as always good lad jack the therapist oh god i thought i was going to watch a political free vid uhhhgggg pride flags and trans flag really game developers fuckin liberal once again nothing personal to jack but he shouldnt play games with a pushed influence who else could relate to this because there friend is like may that end part of the video got me thinking just thank you for talking to your fans it helps so much we appreciate it i was at a time at a verge of depression but i didnt wanted to be so called up a friend he scolded the shit out of me and told me i could get depressed i cried it actually helped it made yaaas write that darry fanfic lol im not crying actually yes i am when he said tumblr the game did anyone else think life is strange hey man dw whatever you do its fine with us ur as involved as u were in fact if not everybody then some people actually appreciate it that u are taking time for urself be happy man only then can u make us happy 3 also people say that service before self but thats bullshit cuz if u dont serve urself then whats the point anyway have a good day jackaboi and also say hi to gab lots of love from the community who cares about u jack 3 jack talking about his mental health made me cry but i felt so happy he felt he could and the advice he gave was amazing for anyone going through something like this youre never alone talk to someone even if they are just a friend it helps and remember someone always cares and that somebody is there for you x stay strong septics 3 thank you for sharing of yourself i know that putting that kind of thing out in frount of people that you really do not know it means a great deal to just hear someone else say this kind of stuff one of these days ill come here and endure this but not this day not this day seeing sadness in people uno reverse card youre loved you heck just trust me in this dont try to put on a fake smile for me or anyone just rant to me itll be fine its going to be ok im here were here to help why is may at minute 20 me edit thank you sean you helped me more than you know with that final talk i almost lost one of my friends like this a few years ago so this video fucking hit me hard but it got so much better for them so maybe it gets better for us all thank you so much sean for being as open as you were i feel like people often breeze over this topic because it may be uncomfortable but sometimes we just need to talk about it in its fullest and it helps it really does it shows that other people actually do understand how you feel and that if you talk to someone then they can actually help because you rent as alone as you thought you were again thank you sean that was deepu are a good good person and we do like u the way u are we will always ur a good man sean sean thank you so much i cant wait for the day to meet you and tell you how much you mean to me i definitely understand the snow metaphor i just had a baby almost 7 months ago he is the happiest baby and the joy of my life however the postpartum depression has gotten real since probably a couple months ago then i found out i was pregnant again and life just kind of started burying me my husband god bless him works so hard for me and our child now children but because he doesnt have depression like this he doesnt really understand how i feel i love him but its so hard to think i am just existing purely for my baby not for myself finally after 7 months of the ppd i have set up an appointment with a therapist to try to find one i like i am sharing this to show that it is ok to live for someone else or something else it keeps you alive so that you realize you need help especially if this person means something to you and you to them love and live thanks jack or rather i should be saying sen this video has really helped me i dont know how to explain how but it has thank you thank you for this after 3048 i cried till the end of the video and it took me like 10 minutes to calm down that art is epic man i love your way of looking at life keep up the good work tw self harm and suicidal ideation at first when i saw that may had self harmed i immediately wanted to relapse and do it myself ive actually wanted to hurt myself and have been suicidal for weeks now but looking at the way the main character just hugged her and was there for her not to mention your little speech in between they made me not want to do it anymore because i remembered my friends and those that love me and my talents that make me unique at sometime around 3452 when you talked about how watching your videos might make someone feel like that theyre sitting with someone they know that just hit me hard its when i really started crying because there are days when i feel so fucking alone i just sit and seclude myself ive been doing it whenever im alone since i was 11 and im 16 i found your videos at 13 and watching you getting to know you for these years youve helped me in my darkest times like now especially when im without thank you omygosh i played this a couple days ago and the style is sooo pretty honestly thank you sean the words you said felt like a fluffy blanket draped over me healing my mind ive done this multiple times hurting myself ive been through so much shit sometimes i feel like life just likes seeing me in my weakest state but i power through it faith and people like you people like me suffering with the same thing are keeping me alive helping people who goes through so much more than what im going through is what makes me wake up saving others saves myself and i thank you for changing that i need to learn to love myself too thanks jack very cool you hit it spot on everyone has their scars to deal with sometimes the happiest people are the ones with the worst intentions or thoughts everyone has someone that cares about them find that person talk to that person most of the time we dont realize how much people care about us theres always someone theyll listen trust them we all have our problems we lie to ourselves so often we all our people that belong and deserve to be here this video was so helpful for me and so many others thank you i thought that was pokimane in the thumbnail lol you have thousands of people waiting for you to post everydaymaybe not millions but thats ok thank you for telling us i feel like this is important to talk about hello random person running through the comments whoa youre beautiful i care about you i know i dont know you but i do okay buh bye youre awesome 3832 jeez that hurts thank you for this and thank you for being who you are i dont have depression nor have i ever felt suicidal but ill admit things have been a lot harder than normal as of late and i assume its just my teenager emotions changing and such but ive just in general had a hard time controlling my emotions lately and getting some quiet time really is important my day has been great so far but i still decided to do what jack said its a really nice day i went outside without my phone i watched the trees move and sat in the grass picking clovers letting the sun hit my skin as well as the small breeze and just silenced my mind and god it felt really nice even for just the 20ish minutes i was out there my head feels so nice and clear thank you for all your words love and care for others jack 95 of comments omg i cried 3 of comments

any friend has over the past week 2 weeks month jesus i dont even know how long its been ive been so depressed i dont wanna do anything i dont care it got to the point where i even started cutting myself and ive been in the same place as may where i felt like no one cared for me enough to ask how i was doing and that voice in my head telling me no one would care if i died so thank up you jack youre still number one on my eyes i appreciated the game it was beautiful and meaningful but i really needed the talk more right now im a small youtuber who makes music and its the only thing ive ever done right in my life and the only thing i have that keeps me going and makes me feel some kind of success my following community is really important to me i have been doing a lot to make them more than just a fan base because theyre really what has kept me going and the only people who have helped me through everything but they hardly know anything about me the majority of them at least i think im going to do something out of the box soon to be more transparent about myself and let them know how important they are to me and the role they may play in peoples lives here on youtube that theyre not just a number or part of an algorithm we all love you jack everyday you effect people into a more positive light including me you are seriously the biggest gift the world has ever seen how come every time i need a video like this you make one get out of my head im not crying u are about the thing when jack starts going on about making money and enjoying things and youtube i think one of the main reasons jack was so successful at youtube was because he came in with the mindset he didnt care about the money he did it for fun nowadays you have people only doing youtube to get money and milk 12yos for cash its sad and usually they arent successful idk just a thought mays dialogue in this game very much pinpoints what i felt but couldnt quite figure out how to say im so glad that i was able to get help and get on meds im much better now thank you angela for making this game and giving people a voice thank you jack for being and amazing human being you are my hero ps sorry this comment is long haha when i feel most alone i know you care sean and thats one of the greatest comforts a person can have thank you thank you gosh this video is hitting my heart really hard i spent most of my teen years feeling this way and figured id grow out of it but ill be 23 in a few months and still feel the same and i dont know what to do anyways this helped some thanks jack am i the only one who thought it was lilypichu in the thumbnail character what do you write about may oh god its embarrassing me fanfiction got to be fanfiction may harry potter fanfiction me boom knew it also that last section really got to me much respect for you jack how can you love someone else when you cant love yourself see this is the message that i learned from my own personal experience with depression self management is such an important thing its shocking how this isnt taught in some school systems but it is necessary thanks for taking the time for reading this and enjoy the rest of your day does anyone grabs a tissue while watching this vid edit omg this vid is the most beautiful thing ive ever seen thanks jack for having a small understanding chit chat and play this game 4339 guys sen is saying something important and all you care about is fucking green hair be thankfull he deserves so much more i dont have any social media and i feel like the two friends that are partly depressed social media has quite a bit i also feel sometimes im falling into this but watching these videos helps me stay on top and help keep my friends from falling farther im not good at explaining thing so the comment is a bit sliver the place i love these types of videos after all at the end of the day were all people and very once and a wail we need to talk were all love jack and we all care bout sen sen youve helped me alot through a lot of stuff and when the pma thing came around i used that message to me being positive when i feel at my lowest of the lows thank you sen youve been one of the people that keeps me going i like the way you are right nowthank you sean for being who you areyou have gotten me through my worst moments of my life when i was so desperate and sad and your pma helped me this made me cry thank you so much sean for your message i needed to hear that i havent felt joy from anything i do in a long time im not a self harming type either i just learned to live with it i have talked to therapist and that didnt help at all im not going to use any medicine i still appriciate life ps you are the best jack thank you for being you i dont know if i can handle this anymore i know no one will ever read this but ive become so fucking pathetic and lonely that i have no choice but to complain about how life sucks in the comments instead of trying to ask for help i dont know if i can handle this everything feels like a nightmare i distract myself with gaming and hope that it will eventually get better but it wont i feel so alone and so lost and so numb at this point im just tired of everything i keep cutting myself and burning my skin knowing it wont help but i cant stop i dont belong here and i cant do this anymore and sen thank you for being here even though you dont even know i exist thank you for helping my community thank you for being so wholesome and honest and thank you for making me feel a little better isnt it interesting that sen and dave from boyinaband keep me from cutting my fucking throat open and help me much more than people around me i live in a shithole called russia wheres the green hair jack everyone today can relate to your mind being too noisy me in my mind do you have 90 minutes i know its probably old now but i thought it was hilarious 3203 wait wait wait junji ito the manga artist or a different junji ito wow i didnt expect its gonna be that hard my god those words sen i know that virtual confession is not the same as a living person next to you who will listen who will give advice who will just be silent with you so that you feel better but i do not have one and never had i just wake up every day with the thought that how huge the sky is and how petty my problems are every day i wake up with the thought that something is about to change but nothing changes every new day is like the previous one the more i think about it the more i realize that the thoughts become much more darker from time to time i dont even know what it is where it came from what i should do just give up and wait or fight backits a silent despair my english is not good enough to describe all my feelings and thoughts but i am grateful to the universe for creating you sen it may sound clichd but youre a ray of light in my gray existence thank you for everyth love all the support in this comment section i hate it when he cries its heart breaking awe jack we love u youre a great man sean i am having severe deja vu right now because i swear ive seen this video before the most difficult thing when you are depressed is find someone who really cares so many people tell you they are always there but when you need them they dont take you seriously and the next time you wont tell anyone so then you deal with it on your own its hard why does the thumbnail look like pokimane i didnt realize how much i needed this video jack facecam smaller pls thank you for reminding me theres still people who care about me sean is a humbled hero thank you this is sad i almost cried and i never cry the game withers name maya he miya ha haha jack i like the new you if your happy with yourself then im happy for you and with you i love that you spread happiness and positivity bc alot of people need it i think i can speak for the whole community when i say we liked loud mouth swearing 2017 jacksepticeye but we love happy sean so much more even if it feels a bit more disconnected at times the time videos and insight that we get is so much more valuable thank you jack this has put me into perspective really thank you where was the highfive in the beginning were i the only one actually imagining being may or just relating to her a lot i feel like this topic is a big taboo and it really fkn hard cause i really feel the same as may and i only really feel like these kind of videos really help and jack thank you so much for the message at the end your such a big help and you being open about this stuff is really fkn good and really fkn helpfull thank you jack and thank you for being you jack youre great its great that you get to spend time for yourself now thats amazing and you should keep going with that 3450 thats so true sometimes watching youtube videos i feel like im facetiming with a friend i didnt know how much i actually needed both the game and the motivational speaking you are an incredible person thank you sen for that speech at the end i got kinda anxious from it because it hit so close to home yet its exactly what i needed to hear what gets to me that i cant get a girl and feeling so lonely but idk when i feel like im to down i get in my car and drive whoever disliked this is pure evil i love how sen reads ive been watching your videos for a couple of years now sean and you have noticeably changed you seem much wiser and more at peace with yourself its a joy to see and to be honest it helps me too thanks man when you relate to may too much that it hurts deep inside you jack plays papers please and puts his face on the top right to block action also jackplays this and puts it on the top left to block the words sean everything you said in this video really helped much respect jack we all care about you so much all your feelings are valid and you deserve to see yourself the way that so many of us see you we all love you dearly and just want the best for you im proud of you for being strong enough to share what you did you are amazing and everything you do to make yourself happy will make us happy all that we want is for you to be happy we love you sean so so much honestlyi think this video is for etika youre so fucking incredible i know you most likely wont see this but i just wanted to say that your talk at the end there really helped some days it feels like everything is pointless but you gave me hope thank you this is why we love you or maybe just me i relate to you and this game and when i was i watched you and it helped like a bunch and now im fine but this hit me hard and i did cry love you jack i really wish i could have watched this video but i get triggered really easily and i dont want to fall into a depressive episode and end up cutting myself again i love how you make people laugh this is sad if anyone is feeling sad please dont we love you and we care about you you are not alone sending love to everyone i relate to may in every way could jack be a mom while missed messages is great only real ogs remember the stinkbug plague i used to be suicidal because people made fun of me and i thought i was nothing and also i was really good at things i was always bad at them but then i realized im too young to be thinking about this to be suicidal and jacks videos especially the happy wheels vids and the lis were amazing they really helped me so thank you jack i love you jack thank you for that last portion i am currently going through a lot of the similar things as you expressed in that portion and as touched on in the game i wanted to say thanks for motivating me to start to fix my outlook i havent seen any other youtuber talk about these topics in such a meaningful and impactful and truthful way as you have so thank you you might not get a lot of this but the work you do is meaningful and impacts a lot of people positively also thanks for your trevor project stream yesterday now i am going to go outside and read a book good shit jack good shit ive been through something similar to this game and luckily my friend and i helped him back up so i wanted to say that message at the end couldnt be better said i feel like jack plays these games when hes feeling low its nice to see these types of games coming out and seeing someone like jack playing them because it makes him feel closer to human again i hope youre okay sean like really okay we are all here for you just like you are for all of us much love jackaboy sean the messages you give are always so comforting thank you jack is such an uplifting and caring guy hes not one of those cheesy therapists or anything it is really nice to see my favorite youtuber be so bright with everything i love how he doesnt act like everything is perfect and fake like most youtubers he shares personal things with us that is how you know he cares for each and every one of his fans i would really love just a video of sean talking i feel as if hes talking to me it makes me feel speak up if you do people will listen i loved the message at the very end its so uplifting for others who feel like there nothing left for them watch this video and you will see that you do matter thank you for being my therapist love you i myself am struggling with making time for me i totally understand how you felt and im glad you are taking time for yourself my issues are much different but also involves social media mom with two kids and a husband i have given all of me without making time for me and it wasnt good im a much better mom wife and influencer when i have me time taking care of yourself is so so so important and im still working on it ill still be here for the videos when they come this whole end of video is why i love your channel so much some videos are silly and fun but others are needed and important for people who look up to you i needed that speech at the end and were always here for you day 5 of asking jack to play witchs heart if u can like for him to see that would be nice its sad that not even 5 percent of seans viewers saw this he really sent out a message that got to me thank you sean im not a fan of these games but your message was very sweet when she wore short sleeves i started to cry i love you jack keep doing what you do cos i appreciate all the things you do and you make me laugh 3 i know theres a bridge between youtube you and you you but i love you all the yous every you i see i will love them oh excuse my earlier comment sen thank you for the speech ive been going through some tough things and im glad to hear someone say things that needed to be heard this video made me cry so much my best friend commitment suicide a few days ago ive been crying for days when i watch this i felt like i had somewon most of my friends dont really help me and my family social media is a bad place i fell like everyone hates me my friend azalee has been helping since i was 6 she is the only friend that believes in me the only friend that helps me ive cut myself before ive almost committed suicide when i watch you you make me happy you should know that i love you and the other people that love you i know that i said that i love you but i do really love you that talk at the end made me just cry cause it was so helpful for me and others i have people that say to kill myself and call me ugly and other mean stuff my brain said to do those things i have my freind azalee with me and friends i love you sean annalise i appreciated this video so much thank you so much for the message i really needed this jack youre the fkn best youve always been there and thank you for making as crazy content as i am in my brain im so happy that you do these kind of videos every once in a while and youre so open about that topic its heartbreaking to me im so so thankfull that you speak up and get this message out in the world and you help so many people with this stuff i had so many problems i figured out i wasnt normal when i was 12 and other kids in my age didnt had those suicidal thoughts on a normal basis these thoughts always were with me i really thought it was normal but at that time i couldnt do anything about it i got late in my therapy i was 23 when i had my first meeting with my first psychiatrist its so mind blowing to look back at that time who i was and who i am now i got lucky that the first professional was so helping and i could do it on the first attempt others arent that lucky as i can see with friends i met through my journey again i love you for putting this topic out in the world and letting people know you can get out of that state thank you so m well im listening to carti so i dont cry myself to sleep aw jack you never have to feel like making a video about stuff going on in your head is complaining because im sure everyone in this community will understand and i honestly needed this video i swear if anyone needs someone just to rant cry or just talk to hit me up im here for anyone who just needs a friend i had a friend that talked me out of suicide and then she just stopped talking to me and ignored me i felt like i was a toy and she helped me because she was bored lve you jack love you with all my fuckin heart we all do thank you we love you man this game hits home because sometimes i can get suicidal because my family and friends just forget about me for example on mothers day my brother was driving and my sister grandma and i were in the car and we got into a crash no one got hurt the rest of my family started asking everyone if they were okay but they forgot to ask me the only person who asked me was the parametric because it was his job but usually when it comes with suicide i wont do it because i always wimp out thank you for the message at the end as someone who struggles with stuff like this i really appreciate you playing this and the talk at the end because it reached down deep tears sen fucking tears real tears i didnt even know that i needed to cry them and it wasnt even the game as much of a gem as that game is it was you i didnt see this coming im not depressed im a happy person im content with my life im content with myself or at least i thought i was it feels like you pointed out a longlived hole in my heart that my brain didnt even know wasnt supposed to be there thank you for this thank you for being you now im going off on a tangent heh sorry i needed to say though 2222 they do say that 90 percent of people who seek a therapist just need someone to talk to no one will see this comment or care but here it is anyways mental health is tricky i like when you speak on this topic jack because it is important and your personal experience has made you passionate sometimes it is so hard to keep positive when you feel isolated or in pain i know i dont know you really and youre not exactly a friend but thanks for putting your face out there jack it gives me something to smile at hey just a reminder to people scrolling through the comments if you feel even a bit off from normal for a long while consider reaching out to someone anyone in fact if youre still living under your parents money also dont worry about burdening them financially theyll understand its worth it for you to feel better therapy is a literal life saver and its never too early to talk to a counselor am i the only one who thinks she looks like marzia when it showed may cutting herself i started cryingi didnt know why until i realized that i went through a similar thing this game helped reminded me that theres already help and things get better all the smoke from the tires fill my lungs as you calmly but also aggressively fall through the corners i feel your pain seriously i do jack and may good on you sean i love how you can share this with us it makes me glad to know that you care for all of us i love the game but i love the last part thisreally hitdamn when i watched this my crush texted me she was proud of me coming out and jack thanks to you i sought help from the trevor project to come out and i found the number from miles chronicles because i was nervous about coming out and my mom is ok with me being bi so lifes fine now thanks thank you sean for always being there for us even though ive never me you in person i always feel like im hanging out with an old friend that ive known for years im so sorry that youve gone through that things you did nobody deserves that especially someone as kind and as caring as you just know that we all love and support you through thick and thin and that we will never leave your side i hope u see this but if you dont thats ok too im just happy that i put it out there pma for life 333 am i the only one who likes his videos before the video properly starts we all know his video is gonna be good is that shiloh in the back ground drifting also makes me calm down you know like vaughn gittin junior who dislikes a vid like this seriously man have a heart sean thank you hey jackthank you for the message the youre conveying here im dealing with depression personally and its nice to be able to know that other people go through it aswell i know that sounds badbut its true 3 uno reverse this game is the best but the most inspirational you needed people to tell you was doing good you somewhat disconnected no jack you didnt you havent changed and if you had we all know it would be for the better im so happy to know that your focusing on yourself as well as you did and still do on the community we are all human and like you have said in so many of your videos is that we are not perfect and thats ok keep up your self loving work as much or even more than you do in the community your a star jack and we are so proud you took your time to sit down play a game or have a laugh with us and most importantly helped us understand more on selflove as well as loving others take care and keep it up your doing amazing 3 youre right it is completely okay to feel that way every now and then i am a writer on wattpad a reading writing app and sometimes it does feel like i have to update my book or let my fans know whats going on with me but i dont have too thats perfectly okay if you want to just record a video talking about whats been going on with you thats fine we will still listen you want too put out a video every other day instead of everyday thats fine too im glad that youre taking time for yourself you deserve it gayism should be a felony if someone want to talk about anything iam here i will talk to anyone even though iam a nobody but do you have 90 minuets sean i love you man i cried well watching this sean you are perfect the way you are and you will always be perfect in my eyes even if you change you will always be perfect in my eyes always i cried at the end of this but it really got me thinking im sorry you had to go through that sen and i know how hard it can be i really hope you are ok now your amazing please can you do more dad of boi aka god of war sean we completely understand if you need to take time back for yourself you are still a human being and you have the right to say no when people keep pushing for more from you if you need to take a hiatus for the sake of your mental health thats ok if one of your viewers has a complaint about that it shouldnt matter because its not their choice what you do with your life you have helped me so much through your videos and i hope that on the off chance you see this comment it helps you too this game remind me of those weird visual novel porn games p youre amazing continue to be like that that tangent that you went on at the end got to me and inspired me i know that you know that youre not irrelevant but its always good to hear that you are not irrelevant youve had a impact in my life if i feel down i always watched your videos and it helped me so much thank you so much i want to hug every single person in this comment section who needs one i played this when it first came out and my god i loved it i relate to it a lot stay strong everyone jack check out 198x its a cool little game why do some people are hurting themselves they arent ending their suffering just adding fuel to the fire i had lost 2 jobs and was struggling to find work i was going to lose my house and all i had was a holiday to japan for months i kept saying to myself ill commit suicide after and that it wouldnt matter about losing everything but on the long plane journey back i decided no i will go out there and i will keep trying and evenutally it paid off and i found a good job you are such a beautiful human being sean thank you for being there and saying these things angela hes he is pronounced like huh with a soft h sean you brought me to tears i have been growing with you this whole time and you are perfect the way you are ive noticed something about how people say the letter h america at ch europe hay ch canadians me eh ch sorry for extra post just need to recomfirm legend doki doki theme song comes in and im sure im going to burn in hell so im not scared to burn nor die on earth as someone who is and has been clinically depressed for a long time depression is something that you want to hide but you shouldnt in reality you just want someone to notice how painful you feel how alone in a crowded place you are i personally have gotten through a lot by looking for those moments of joy and embracing them in full even though i know they will end and ill just go back to my mental corner my advice is find people who support you mentally and emotionally that dont wont question your feelings it was the same for me i got really depressed along with an eating disorder but reaching out for help was the best thing ive ever done please if youre hurting please try to find help find the light again this video really hit home for me been going through some really tough shit these past few months losing close friends losing the girl i love just all round depression just the loneliness and feeling of isolation was enough for me those times id stay in bed crying to myself cause of how empty i felt and just wondering to myself what would happen if i just died if im being honest i still feel the same way point is thank you sean for your words at the end it really hit close youre a good man jacky boy you will get no hate from me for living your life bro as long as your happy im happy and that gos for everyone in the world hate is the only thing that needs to die and thats the truth jack thank you for growing i am have really an grateful to be on this journey with you its under rated to grow as a person thank you i havent read through a lot of the comments mostly because im writing this before i watch you pointed out the pride flag but behind it is the trans flag and im not here to say you purposely missed it im just saying the fact you even pointed out the pride flag made me smile its a small one in the corner keep doing what you are doing jack you are a great person thank you jackfor sharingcoz i hope talking to the camera helps you as much as it helps me i know this has probably been said a bunch but the message at the end hit hard and i get so much of that not even being a youtuber thank you for that that made my day hey its my birthday today and no im not a entitled white girl theres 2 more ending to do im sorry but 3006 why u sad idk nan molla thank you so much jack i needed this because i know how you feel because i think about it but the your the reason i havent gone through with it because your are a great person that understands things so thank you so much i needed this they always say yee haw but never ask haw yee this game really touched me i really missed the messages coming from a friend we would joke talk like everything was right with the world then one day he committed suicide i went in and out of emotional numbness i would see a crying friend and cry with them but then i would tune out go into my own lonely world my grades declined and my personality changed drastically after that day i thought about joining him three times and three times i was saved from making that mistake he did suicide hurts more than the victim it spreads to the friends and family get help as soon as possible trust me youre not wasting anyones time seeing you play this game and speak this great message at the end really made me selfreflect since the beginning of the year ive been in a really dark place boyfriend broke up with me left me for someone else i couldnt get into the program i wanted to be in though im still trying etc idk i just became sad for no reason almost every day but then i started rekindling a friendship with someone i was friends with a long time ago and ever since i started hanging out with him ive became more happier than i ever was he actually listened and was there for me every time im down this video made me realize this so i thank you for recording this video i honestly needed this i havent been in a good state for a while and its recently gotten worse because something happens where it feels like i no longer have a family this honestly did help me out quite a lot so thank you kinda odd to see junji ito in the credits considering his creepy manga this is really deep and also i really needed this and it makes me kinda connect more with jack and makes me more confident in myself thanks jack your always there for us as always sean the really white knight you might not be the biggest stat on youtube but man you are the brightest not because you dont have any problem but because you do and face them in a grounded and relatable way thank you so much for every day of hard work that you have put for us i understand so much how you felt when you said you were giving too much of yourself to everyone and how mentally draining that is i am the same way and it becomes very rough to get through day to day tasks i had to have a therapist teach me how to take care of myself in that aspect i appreciate everything you do for this channel and how much support you still give while trying to live your life as well just keep doing what makes you happy and people will follow i love the music aesthetic in this game like i want all the music 537 you hear a really good song by timmies excellent choice of shiloh dynasty background music jack you know how to talk to people on a way i wish i knew how you talk to almost 23 million people about a single topic and you never keep anything in your head my parents got divorced when i was young but i knew what was going on since i already had been into lots of fights in school and out of school in my life i just act like the little happy boy i should be thank you for reading become muslim what you said helped i been struggling trying to find a job in the career i want which is working with animals i went to an online college to learn about becoming a vegetarian assistant but i didnt graduate because the final thing they needed me to do was find a place where i can get hands on training and all the places near me didnt want to train me so i spend 10000 for this school and its all a waste and a waste of time im so desperate to get a job in the animal care field ill even settle being a kennel technician which is just me checking up on the animals walking them bathing them and also feeding but i cant even get a job doing that and i been trying for 5 years now and i know it will probably but easier to get a job in fast food but i have social anxiety and im bad at math and really not good at counting money since i have some learning disabilities i kinda think thats why those places didnt want to train me or hire me because i take a lot longer to understand thin thank you for telling all of this that really help people to feel better youre a really good person and youre right taking break from internet is good for mental health goddammityoumademecry but seriously thank you for playing this and talking about this and being open with us i could never articulate just how much this means to me this really hit home because i always feel like im not good enough and i feel like i have no one to talk to and i feel like everyone talks to me out of a feeling of obligation and i know its not true but its always in the back of my mind and i feel like im never going to be good enough and its not worth it youtubers doing these making these types of videos helps so much its good you reminded people that you needed to step away from the community a little bit i already understood that the reason for that was because you wanted to prioritize your personal life instead of us to me that was easy to see and honestly im happy you did you deserve to have a good balance and do what you love while enjoying time for yourself too i absolutely love videos like this because it helps us all remember were not alone and taking care of ourselves is so important im just so glad youre in a better place now mentally you deserve that we all do thank you for sharing your personal experience so we can relate to you more youre the best keep shining sen i wish i had people like that in my life but i just have drawing also im getting help but no one is that lucky i hope anyone whos going through something like this finds someone to talk to and find a way to keep going because you will be missed and you are loved whether you know it or not if theres a typo in short you are loved and deserve to be happy jack look i was going to kill myself but watching you saved my life cuz you give me hope to live so thank you for

your story i been thru similar situation i even tried to take my life on 3 occation this is why i want to be a counselorpsychologist when im at college i know people are like this and i know people struggle i know i do and it hurt me to research how many people give up i had done a paper to see how affective antidepressants are versus therapy and antidepressants actually miss a lot of marks many patient reviews i read had them on multiple different meds and they still werent working but with therapy it was more successful thats why im wanting to be in this field this is why im always so down to earth and accepting to what others have to say because everyone is struggling deep down and i want to change that i want to make a difference the suicide rate for teenagers and young adults is fluctuating but its still high and its not ok yes making it aware is wonderful it gives hope but if changes arent being made to actually solve it then its not going to make much difference thats just my spill for today i hope whoever reads this shaun just be happy part of my first name was mentioned im proud so glad you do videos like this where you allow yourself to just talk and motivate all of us after playing a game i need this video it helped thanks jack jacksepticeye im going to be personal with u and everyone else but i have depression and im suisidle and im going to a therapist so ur

anger issues so i get in lots of fights and stuff and then i think about you know what i always feel like someones watching me and im always stressed because im putting lots of pressure on myself because of school and other stuff i dont really wanna talk about i use english as a way to calm myself down since im swedish and english is just a soothing language it flows nicely and everybody or almost everybody can speak it i love when he plays these types of games it makes me feel closer to him i love how be stops the gameplay just to talk to us it makes me feel a lot better jackthe intros are not the same anymore i suffered with depression a lot and im not going to lie i used to self harm and i would cry ive stopped self harming many years back ive even tried committing suicide but it didnt work im still here now i have my son he looks at me with so much love each morning he wakes up he tells me hi mommy and gives me a kiss he tells me that he loves me and hugs me and theres time i cry and he holds me so tight to be completely honest my life has started changing for the better slowly ive been dealing so much for the passed few years before my son was even here i also have

the long sleeves even the part where may is talking about not finding good doctors shit take the time you need and do what you have to no one should judge you and if they do then they dont understand what is going on youre doing great sean and you are who you are today hey jack those drum covers though where are they preach man you are amazingthank you for all you do i enjoy all you do and i am so happy you have stopped showing us everything you need to keep something for you please keep growing and keep doing love you thank you this game is sad because if you think about it this game may be what the creator is feeling thus meaning the creator may be suicidal other then that the video was great no person should have to go through that jack thank you awww lets give jack some hugs you are loved i have been there and i had no one my mom was the one how gave me the rope but you was the one who saved me in that moment when i had a rope right in front of me and i thought of you and i stopped so thank you for everything you do jack thank god for you we bear bears as a gay woman i can relate to this so hard lol i love this game i love your channel i know itll be here when im crying your speech at the end is great btw a game i know angela he made was called theres this girl and its really good i really recommend it to u bros the last 15 20 minutes is why i love you jack this video really meant a lot thank you so much as a person who has a friend who goes through depression and suicidal thoughts as well as physical abuse to herself i agree with alot in this game its important to listen to them and talk to them about what theyre going through but i do remember this one time me and her as well as one of my other friends were sitting at a table eating lunch i noticed she was really quiet but i shook it off thinking that she was just tired but then she started crying we asked what was wrong but she didnt respond my other friend say next to her and tried to see what was wrong but still nothing she didnt move she just cried silently i walked over to her and wrapped my arms around her afraid that if i let go she would fall apart she cried louder into my shoulder and it broke my heart i asked her if she was ok she responded no i asked her if it was just overwhelming and she answered yes after a while she calmed down and i told her that i would always be there for her and that if she needed som thanks jack im still going through some things now and you saying this has lifted my hopes in that i can get there and that i thought i had no one because everyone left me i was giving in i have gotten help but im still waiting to be free from things that traps me from being happy jack what about slimerancher oh sen hug thank you for this message remember depression does not discriminate it does not care if you have a good life you are entitled to your emotions good and bad im so glad you kept fighting on a personal level sen your willingness to open up about depression and mental health has helped so many people its helped me thank you for all you do thank you one of my favourite song what brings me up when im down is hold onto your memories disturbed its a beautiful song everyone gets down sometimes some people have depression some people have really really bad depression sometimes people try to talk about it and it seems as though a lot of youtubers fall into this trap where people try to talk about their issues and some dumbass comes back with yeah but you have a good job and make so much money like money actually means a solitary fucking thing about actual happiness some random asshole on the internet is annoying and a douche when its a friend or family member doing it it is even shittier now not everyone needs help and games like this can popularize the idea that no one can do it themselves which is an amazing feeling if you actually can some people can beat it themselves and that is conquering it it is an incredibly complicated issue and so many people totally suck at dealing with it whether it hits them or someone they know i almost downloaded this game a day ago and i was about to say i want jacksean to play it now ill watch the video when im done in minecraft and done listening to xxxtentacion rip c changes 1 hour loop edit blew up my minecraft houses basement and pathway again edit 2 yeet kinda surprised jacksean knew the pride flag btw the rainbow flag is the gay flag the pink blue and white one is transgender flag yeahthx for opening upit helped me todayi suffer from depression and im still pretty youngand i have thought about suicide before its gotten better over the years tho thx so much for the speach do what you think is right what up fall out boy shrek and we bare bears memes ive said this before and ill say it again ive attempted suicide three times in my life its not easy to stay happy when youre alone at the end of the day ive cut myself but it makes no difference even if i felt something at that moment it wasnt a good feeling if you feel this way just reach out instead of suffering alone also i thought this was happy wheels thanks sean everybody needed something like this my parents jus took away all my happiness not allowing to go outside dropped me of college not allowing to have somebody to love and i felt miserable but watching this makes me change my mind about everything bad i wanted to do to myself and i want to thank you for this you not only helped me but also all the other people who are feelin like this too jack i went though the same thing and it was hard but i poshed though so thank you for the words and for bing a youtube keep it up if you have depression at any moment you should think of it as a physical problem rather than an emotional problem i have suffered bipolar for a long time so i get what you feel remember that your situation hasnt changed most of the time try to be thankful for all the things you have shelter food and people and ride through the storm please try to think this way it can save you from doing something many will regret i respect you even more for the message at the end thank you sean we want you around uploading for as long as you feel you want to mostly above all else we want you to be happy i actually dont like games like these and when these messages are delivered in this way but it seems to be helping people so its cool came one hour late and 0 views but 5000 comments youtube is drunk jack can u please play brothers tale of two sons thank you jack for saying this this really went through my mind and its great once again thank you thank you for being open bout this and about how important it is to not open too much that is very real please take care of yourself that speech at

time for your self u deserve it for all the hard work you have done youre a very big role model to me and you make me happy when im feeling depressed and in a dark place you pull me out of it you need time off you deserve a break this summer i was actually going to try and work a lot on my mental health mostly after abad night that i had with a lot of suicidal relization i decided i needed a large break from social media during my vacation i am taking time to myself and staying away from my phone as much as i can or maybe just for music and im going to take time for myself i remember this one weekend that i was on the computer pretty much for three days straight i was on for the almost entire day for the entire weekend after that i legit felt so fucking terrible i felt sick and so depressed i was having mass sucidal thoughts after it and i have never done that again and its why i want to take more breaks from it and limit myself from it more i have made a habit of pushing myself into other peoples livesi try to keep up with everything about their life so i know everything and i want to try and stop that too i know why i probably do it its the same reason i do a lot of other things to the message at the end hit close to home thank you sean i needed to hear this today thank you for that little message at the end of the video i really needed that a crap this vid got

want to but he deserves it and so much more i know exactly how this feels because this is exactly what happened to me my best friend realised something was wrong and help me i was trying to kill

little person talking inside your brain you are believe me hope yall have a great day wheneverwherever you are i have went through this some time ago i actualy felt hopeless and wanted to end it and i actualy almost did it but than he came he saved my life and understood me been here for me when i needed he listened and i listened to him back we have alot in common and even if we are not from the same continent speak the same language or are the in the same age barrier i love him more than anything and dont care what people say at the end of the video when you were just talking about stuff i normally would have skipped listening to that but today i didnt i sat and listened and thought i may not of fully paid attention but i was listening so thank you for everything your channel your gameplay your way of sharing and just everything you say you inspire and lift spirits i love you for you never change if you dont want to always change what you need or want lorelai sean thank you he is pronounced huh its easy to give up it just not suits you i just played this game im so happy you played it i loved the art style and how the game plays out this definitely shouldnt be free its worth more than that mays dream was a connection to her suicide she got infected well thats her depression taking over then you discover the cure well thats you being there for her and saving her thas you saving her if it wasnt for u jack i would have ended it hgbdbfdnfbbdfbfdv sorry i just needed to get that out ok but uh i do cut and fuck its hard to stop i am only 12 and im not friggin doing this for attention im friggin sad ok but my family always puts me down youre not gonna get anywhere in life if youre an artist you cant do anything right cant you youre gonna get held back in school cry baby and that has led me to putting myself down this monday im going to go see a therapist first time with the therapist stuff when i heard my grandma the one person who put me down so much i started harming myself and yes its confusing said yes to therapy i literally made a happiness noise but yeah i really cant wait for tomorrow i love you jack dont give up not yet my insta bc why not smokingcatnip art insta acc probablykatty have a great day uwu thank you for always opening up to us to show that its okay and normal to have depression if any of yall are experiencing anxiety depression bipolar or any other mental illnesses please seek help in friends family strangers on the internet a professional it will help you if medication is recommended please take it you may not be able to fix it on your own and thats okay dont forget to take your meds and stay hydrated i started watching you in my somewhat early teens and back then the type of content you made was exactly what i needed to distract myself but i think i kind of grew with you cause now i easily prefer the person youve grown to be idk of this game lesbi this video was really nice i used to be like this but ive gotten a lot better and this video makes me happy to see how much people can change for the good thank you sean thank you jack for playing this see i have chronical depression where it doesnt go away i relate to this game a lot i have actually unsuccessfully committed suicide twice i am grateful for you because your videos help me everyday but ive also found something else in my life that i love doing 2 things actually i have gotten better over the years but since i have chronical depression it doesnt go away its just something i have to deal with ive found that writing music lyrics of my own helps and helping people like me i thank you for showing me that depression doesnt define you anyone else getting emily is away or life is strange vibes here or is it just me i needed this talk thx i just found out about etika mental health is very feeble suicide is a very real thing that happens very often from people who seem so happy im a happy person but even i suffer with depression i havent always had someone there for me until i finally told people i was sad me and my brother never got along and had bad childhoods which helped in aiding the depression everyday is a struggle and wanting to be alive hurts it helped so much just by talking about it sure it doesnt go away instantly but it really does help i have attempted suicide a few times it was bad i still have depression but i have healed a lot it is okay to talk about it dont hide it this is the best video ive ever seen also sean i dont care how many videos you make in one day i watch your videos for you ps your my favorite youtuber for me most days are very very dark and i feel like i can tell people who cant really see my face so i say that i am not really that deep in life i am only thirteen so no suicide for now ive thought about stopping and i want to tell everyoneexcept me there is always someone or something to help you thank you for reading and if youre like me hope we get better i am so glad that i didnt know you had a girlfriend im so glad that you have parts of yourself that are just for you you deserve a life outside of youtube happiness outside of youtube you are not your job we love you san it is so sweet how sen almost cries in the middle of the game made him feel so human so close to us his community people always expect a lot from youtubers and its hard to be yourself and talk about you when so many people are watching and judging but that doesnt matter because you can do whatever you desire and nobody can control your life just a message to all the people who need it and sean uwu even if he doesnt see it i dont know if this is just how the camera is but when ever san talks about topics like this you can see things in the background kinda shake as if hes bouncing his leg or tapping his foot i feel like that just shows how human he is how he feels just like we do he gets anxious and depressed and he talks about it and i really appreciate it because it takes so much courage and im sure thousands of other people care and are thankful too thank you so much for being you i wander what your supposed to do when you dont have a friend to turn to and your family just dosnt care thank you jack for talking about this it helped me tremendously and i really appreciate you and this youre the best sean and we all love you you made me realize a lot of things and now i know what to do and uno reverse live your best life too 3 such an important message at the end of the video thank you i really need someone to say those things i needed to hear someone tell me that i appreciate you talking and playing this game me motivational speaker much what happened about the green hair when you when you said it in the stream yesterday sincerely thank you ive only been in this community for about 9 months now but i just want to say that i can tell that youre happier you said that youre living more for yourself rather than for us and that you can hang out with friends without having to tweet about it it shows whenever we do get an instagram story or a tweet it seems so much more genuine like you want to share that youre having an amazing time we can tell that you care so much about us youre always so genuine and sweet and we really appreciate that you said some things i needed to hear as well like if you miss a few days on social media the world isnt going to end also you have a really amazing fanbase who probably wont ever stop watching your videos and we arent going anywhere i blocked myself from social media i dont go on there everits crazy out there cyberbullying is becoming a big thing and the place i am now i cant handle it jacki know this will probbly never happen but is there anyway i could reach out to you i need someone to open up to and seeing as how youve gone through what im going through i figured you may be able to help me or give adviceany how great vid i love this game you can play it on kongregate as well but it is not as good i feel like when god of war came around jackaboy the green bubbly boy became the glorious gaelic gladiator and i noticed the difference and i loved it cause you essentially manned up and matured even through youtube and alongside it and i think it was a good time cause your audience is getting older so you adapted why is no one talking about what he is saying at the end of the video its beautiful it literally made me stop thinking negatively even if it was just for a short time hes literally saying facts im gonna download this so i can listen to it everyday just to bring my moods and mind up and at some point i wont even need to listen to it because it will be a part of me you know its like the things therapist and psychologist tell you that you have to say to yourself everyday but in better im sorry if this whole comment doesnt mean anything its just that jacks speech hit very close to home thank you for a nonreligious person san can sure preach just remember nothing would be the same if you werent here dude youre not the truman show we love you for your wackiness and we dont need to pry into your life we realize you have a personal life and a professional life and they need to be separate when jse plays a gory game no one cares about the content when he plays a game about suicide all the angsty teenagers are glad about his speech to calm them down i needed this in life right now thank you jack thank you for making this video it really means a lot to me needed the speech today thank you for that man shit got deep jack thank you for making videos and i know that they can make the world of difference for a person with depressive thoughts or even suicidal thoughts i think that it is great that a big youtuber like you can open up about these things and share their personal experiences i cant imagine how it must be for a person to feel like they live in a world of pain and to feel that death is the only way out things will get better people will help if you reach out and ask for it even though its not easy the message at the end of the video turned out very important and insightful it really does take will power and believing in yourself to live your own life and other messages that were covered there are absolutely coherent and clear and needed to be said out loud thank you in the game they were also talking about messages and thats what i realised one kind messages is electronic and you can miss them and come back to them later but there are other messages may be non verbal that other people are sending to you and you cant miss them especially when they are ones asking for help look after each other and dont leave any important messages from people close to you unread or missed mate do you want to take a break a video a day is hard now i feel empty again like nothing is there its so noticeable now start of the game btw im gay fuck its gonna be a hell of a ride you are truly an inspiration san you are the person i like to go to because you really connect with people in a special way i resonate with you in such an amazing way because ive gone through a lot of the things you have mentally but its because of youtubers like you that i stay on youtube so thank you for everything this game is too cringey and revolting lost me 2 minutes in i cried this is why ily sean hi to whoever reads this i want to warn you about my english first its kinda all over the place but hey i want to put this here cause no one really knows me here all these years i never opened up the darkest thing in my life i opened shit yes but that one i just cant ever since my dad was and still is a msssive help but im scared im scared that im too dependant and if the day comes ill be lost this day ive been getting more and more thoughts of doing it ive disabled all my social media things to get rid of some toxic matters but i just cant help myself watching jack play this game it opened up things in my mind i never thought of i wanna thanm you jack for everything youve been a massive help ever since i was young i tried my best to eatch every single of your vids im a very quiet viewer but after this vid i just wanted to thank you and sah keep up the great work love you jack awwee poor jack thoughtslifepeople can be pretty hard to deal at times but like he said its good to take a break and just be there and enjoy what you are doing it also helps to see if something is bothering you to try and fix it so you can get through it easier mental health is hard to handle but its better to work it out then throw everything away 3 brother i just wanna watch your videos your life is your life keep it comin when you are watching this in your livingroom and it hits so hard but you are trying not to cry since you are next to your parents thank

the end you mean so much to me dude youve helped me so much these past 4 or 5 years idk what i couldve done without your help you are an incredibly intelligent dude and i really fucking appreciate you man thanks jack for this honestly this seems more like a talk rather than a game so thx why would you go out with someone you just met online thats dangerous jack youre really amazing you know that sean im glad things are going better for you than before and i just want you to know that i only want you to be you because whether youre super energetic or super chill i love your videos and will continue to watch what you post this game brought back a lot of dark memories for me too but hearing your thoughts at the end reminded me that im making efforts to get better as well and that i have hope thank you for being so thoughtful and kind ill always support you sean i thought the gameplay was gonna be 50 minutes but i was pleasantly surprised thanks for the long talk really needed to hear that ive been struggling with suicidal ideation for decades so it feels normal for me now sen thank you so much last night and some of today ive been crying about some things going on and i wished i wasnt alive for this to happen and i have dark thoughts and for you to tell people that its okay and that i will get through itreally helps me out thank you so much im glad i watched this video somehow everyone forgot about the green hair thing thank you for this video and that talk at the end sean for what it is worth you are probably my favorite channel and easily my favorite gaming channel right now because when you play a game you enjoy i can really get a sense of your enthusiasm genuine pleasure and glee is so refreshing your ps4 spiderman playthrough was an absolute blast because of your enthusiasm it honestly made me tear up just hearing the joy in your voice and while not as indepth i still got that sense with your ffh vr video gorn and tabs are still an absolute blast to rewatch enthusiasm is contagious and i just want you to know that youve got support when youre down and were right there with you when youre riding high you probably dont use tiktok anymore but i sent you a couple of things in there i think that you are really an amazing youtuber you manage to maintain boundaries with the community yet you sound so human i just loved the speech you gave after playing the videogame which was amazing too i really resonate with everything you said its a really important message that people should be more invested in thank you so much for your words im sure it will help a lot of people just like it helped me watches jacks video buys all of the pma merch after im not crying u r ur fans are always here for u jack we love you sean im so happy that you can be someone that will talk about this kind of thing genuinely and actually make people recognize that they might need help and you talking about your personal experiences really helped me today so thank you please play danganropa trigger happy havoc jesustoo many missed messages and theyre all from mayguess i should answer ummhey there sorry for not answering your messagesits just that you left me alone i know im sorrythe whole thing is that emily is away and sara is missing and i need to solve oops vee is calling talk to you later you know ive never had sincere smile like a warm happiness or ive never been happy its a good feeling straight forward warmth and i wish i had more experiences like this happiness i never really felt anything i needed this thanks sean for the video please do more like this the end made me think jack thank you also you are still the same no matter what but even though i stopped watching you not because of you just the games plz ppl dont get pissed plz i just recorded me playing this game too this is crazy thank you for this sean i hope youre better now ive gone and is currently going through some garbage and you and your videos always bring some light to even the darkest days we love you i cried at the bathroom part ive seen people going through that thank you so much sean this video meant so much to me and my friend and no the people who say that your channel is dying dont know what they are talking about your channel is better than ever in soo many ways also f those people who say otherwise also yes i am ready to grow with you and your channel and i cant wait to see what it becomes pssorry this is alittle long 3 thank you i didnt really think i could ever get more help than i did today thanks san this is so somewhat inspiring god bless you sen its awkward how much i relate to almost everything in the video is it sad that i can kinda relate to mays situation i used to be the golden kid of the house myself i had straight as and was usually labeled as the teachers pet i think around 7th or 8th grade my grades started falling and later i found out i had depression and anxiety my parents were having a hard time understanding they would yell at me for missing work and make comments that made me feel like the only good i was to them was if i had my good grades it took a long time but they did finally understand what was going on and now i feel like my life is going in a better direction for anyone thats going through a tough time right now i encourage you to go and seek help from somebody whoever you think will

have to go through some type of pain or hardship in life but always remember that what you feel now is not how you will later on in your life so give yourself some love instead of seeking validation from others constantly i cant say i have succeeded in finding happiness for myself but what matters is that im trying once again thank you so much i needed this today i love deep and long videos like

always find myself looking forward to your videos it helps to have something to look forward to all the time a lot of people often forget that youre human just like us and you have your own life going on around you in whatever form of shit storm it takes im glad you make videos on these games they show people that youre vulnerable just like them we werent made to think were perfect but to someone else we may be just that just go day by day doing your best having fun and living life im glad that may found happiness and im glad that amanda made this beautiful game it gives you hope ive thought about cutting before because of my adhd but thank you for helping me and being here for me thank you so much for making this video ive been having such a rough time lately and i really needed your advice i have no one to talk to and im always alone with my thoughts so again thank you for everything youve done edit fun fact i was planning not to watch the whole video because i thought it was going to be too triggering but here i am thank you the background music of the game is shiloh i truly feel like ive seen this before frome jack is it a re uploaded thank you for this video sean i am also kinda suicidal and you stopped it so thank you i think we all needed this video thank you jack there are millions of youtube channels sean but there is only one you we dont watch you for the

intentional its never planned its never anyones fault its just how my life is how life goes and how things turn out in the end i realize people who may or may not reading this are here watching this video for the same reason and to connect emotionally to something relatable and to them i say you are all wonderful people and hope you find goodness and wholesome meaning your life our loves arent defined by our shining moments dealing with personal struggles rather our lives are defined by how we extend our hands to others in times of need and despair life is often short and we get caught up in our little problems little struggles that distract and corrupt our path in life and i hope everyone finds direction and meaning in life thank you sean there is more to life than youtube enjoy your best life doing what you love the part beign i always was good at everything when i was younger so my parents didnt pushed any effort on me so when things got harder and i didnt put effort into it

stuff like this keep being you jack omg so thats what depression is i think i have depression i honestly use youtube as a getaway from my life dear jack thank you for playing this game it really impacted a ton of people who love watching you i too am dealing with depression and i once considered suicide but for anyone else who is reading this comment or thinking about it dont perform permanent solutions only for temporary problems stay safe and keep it up jack sans from undertale jayce i thought this was gonna be a serious video i needed this thank you i didnt think u would upload today ohhhhh jack i wanna give you a hug now virtual hug thank you sean i really really needed that speech at the end and it really made me feel better and it touched me deep thank you jack when i was in middle school i was so close to ending it all i hated my life and i just wanted it to end i found youtube and eventually i found you i laughed all day watching video after video regardless of how old it was if nothing else you gave me hope for my life so while some of your content i might not be into i make sure i watch everything you post because to me you were the person that saved my life i know you must get 100 of these a day but you are not irrelevant in the slightest not to me and not to the others you have saved this line every day is the same day oof that hit hard for those who doesnt or not yet watch this vids u just missed messages hi sen first of all i want to thank you for your great work and for talking about these issues again and again i highly appreciate it personally ive been struggling with these issues for as long as i can remember literally i have very clear memories of lying in my bed as 6yearold even on vacation awake at night looking out of the window and just thinking about jumping its always been like that i tried to reach out for help thrice so far but it always failed the situation here in germany is really bad when it comes to therapists they all just tell you that you have to wait for 3 to 12 months and if you ask whether they can refer you to another therapist they just say no and not in a polite way at least thats my experience lately ive gotten worse so far ive always managed to go on somehow but for the past two years i barely ever left my flat i lost touch with almost all of my friends and even my family and the thoughts have become louder and clea just thank you so much for this oh my gaaaawd no youuu uno reverse insantly realises its also in the text screaming laughter intensifies iiiiii fucking saw this and i have the game it is so ggooodddd omg i cant belive ure playing it with deeper subjects like what this game covered and what sean went into afterwards its important to know that everyone has bad days and good days and with youtube in particular i cant speak for everyone else but with myself i can certainly state that i watch the jacksepticeye channel for sean not for the games i know other people watch youtubers simply for the game they play and they dont watch it for the individual who plays them when watching sean through the years he has changed but for those of us who watch it we watch his channel for him because of who he is if someone watches a youtuber and doesnt appreciate who they are and how they change then leave it basic point being sean has grown is ways that better himself and there is a supporting community here that watches him but also stands out for one another if someone is upsetdepressed this community is one that will help the fact that sean is happier now is the best thing for himself all everyone needs i am crying half way through the video thank you for this i feel like the rant was slightly inspired by the incident with etika thanks sen gosh well this game made me nearly cry i love everything about this what about trover holy shit sean that bedroom is my sisters with the tea and the flag and plants all of that i love ypu jack no homo jack if you havent heard of junji ito you need to read his mangas why havent you dyed your hair green oof another game about depression where everyone else is at fault and the world is a big meany nah thanks me used to suffer with mental health has triggers sees trigger warning also me yeah i should be fine i came as soon as i got the notifications 3333 really my 2017 sucked as well i like when he plays these types of games because it hits you right in the heart nobody jack playing any game omg the art style tho asmar beard crunch didnt know how much i needed this video today thank you and sean im so happy youve changed that youve learned that youve bettered yourself im with you no matter where things go this video is so incredible and i know i needed to hear this and i sent this to several friends who needed to hear this thank you for sharing i really needed that pep talk jack and i thank you for that i have a therapist but you are by far the best this honestly made me cry while watching this i just think i was like this at some points in life this video made me really happy i wish you well have a good daynight you are appreciated i love watching your vids but i would rather have half the amount of videos of you being truly happy then to have more videos of you not being true to yourself you are right we have all been there people are there when you need them the community was there for you when you needed them the greatest accomplishment of a supportive community is to be there when you need them and then to be able to fall away when you dont its a good thing that you dont need the constant support of the community it doesnt mean you love us any less well this game and everything about jack has said hit me too hard i cried lmao thanks for being always being the uh friend who comforts me i suck at english but bottom line thank you when youre so tired of being depressed that your depression gets depression and are too tired to be depressed what do you like to write me sherlock holmes fanfiction johnlock it makes me sad that people have gone though this stuff that hit hard i think that you need to find people that love you and you love them truly if youre young and your family isnt there for you if you focus on your schooling you can get to a better place and then find someone that you will love i just played this game the things may says her feelings her thoughts i can understand them so well i was lucky i had supportive parents and a good social environment and i was able to go to therapy before it got too out of hand before i started self harming or worse but i used to feel just as she does emtpy and worthless and going nowhere that is also why i can say from the depths of my heart it can and it will get better its a process and its exhausting to go and it takes effort that at first seems impossible to make but now i can look at this and i can see myself in may but its no longer my current self but a past memory that still influences the way i am but doesnt control me this video was a reminder for me im so grateful for the people in my life for helping especially you sean i watched you ever since 2016 during my dark times you were like my little antidepressant before i got my own you were here to pull me out of my thoughts im so grateful for you and i recognized how you felt late 2017 i felt terrible you were going through that as well now when i come back to check in on you i notice that you really are a beacon of help thank you for helping me out with my mental health through videos i really would like to thank you for staying here instead of going away sometimes even the strongest people dont notice that there is something wrong with them if youre depressed you feel like nothing is right and you dont know why but that can change because even if you think nobody cares about you someone does you just dont see it if you think anybody around you is sad struggling with something or youre just concerned then talk to them but make sure that you dont ruin yourself in the process people care even i care about anybody who is reading this because you are beautiful you just cant see it keep yourself happy because its worth it i needed this the second half of the video youre a good person more hugs for anyone that needs them wheres the hand clap at the beginning thank you sean for this message at the endi really needed it this week i love you for youand im happy that you grew i love that you improved for yourself and for noone elsebut you thank you just thank you dont worry be happy dont worry be happy ooh a therapy session with jack and yeah i know 516 can anyone please tell me the song in the background your such a nice person im glad your popular the world needs more people like you xoxoxo man this video hits p hard alexa play despacito oooh boy this hit hard sean i just want to tell you that you matter you matter to us so much that i dont know what i would do wout u and the others youtubers who make my life a little better everytime u upload i feel happy and every time u take time out for yourself i am even more happy because your doing something for yourself you have changed but in a good way your growing your learning and understanding and you do care about the community your latest charity stream is proof dont ever try to change to please us be happy take time for yourself and with your gf we wont judge you we know we have been with u since thr very beginning and thank u again for being there wout knowing it thank you for making me laugh thank you so much i love this game it brought me to tears and made me smile a little and made me feel less alone for a bit this really hits home for me i feel like both the playable character and may sometimes at the same time i did go through the cycle of thoughts that may talks about and i still fight to not sink back into that cycle im getting help and i highly suggest getting help sooner rather than later st i ruined my foundation uh im very happy you made this video and yeah idk what to say i wouldnt say im suicidal or considering thosethings but i definitely have a lot going on and ive thought about it a few times i almost always feel like everyday is the same day and im just doing the same things everyday and then i go to sleep im always trying to be the funny positive person but having a lot going on is hard because hating my bodyfeeling sadhaving a lot going on with that i havent come out yetto my parentsand so much moreit feels like when i just hold in all these things and not telling anyone because i dont want to waste peoples time i feel like im gonna explode soon like a ballon with too much air sometimes i just think that if i end it i wont be able to regret afterwards i dont even know why im putting this out so that so many people can see it but i swear to god im going to explode soon just thank you love you have a great day bye i basically never comment and i know this will probably be lost in the sea of green hair requests but i wanted to thank you for bringing light to these problems this game hits so close to home for me i am going through a rough time at the moment and your videos always bring a smile to my day and videos like this make a huge difference your message was really moving to me and it mattered i and im sure others as well were greatly affected by this some days your videos were the only brightness in my day that i could hold on to so thank you sen and to whoever is reading this im so proud of you for being here your life matters and people care about you i care about you i believe in you thank you 33005120 i think red lamp can relate its so important to ask for help to tell yourself that its good to ask for help that its ok to be sad angry scared and that its so important to lean on each other when its needed its also important to allow yourself to walk away to let yourself be without so much chaos think about you do for yourself who ever put a thumbs down you are a horrible person 337 when people ask where you are bet never ask haw you are man life is a crazy thing ya know first off this was an incredibly touching game which meant a lot to me but what you talked about at the end meant so much to me and i just wanted to say thank you sen im proud of how much youve grown and how much more you that you are why is no one here for me it would probably be nice to hear you ranting every now and then if that is what you consider the second half of the video to be but im just speaking for myself please do the ghost pepper you said you would but you never did i now know why i was pulled to watch this video first i needed this today and so thank you sean especially the ending really showed you care thank you i feel alone at home very often because of the weird things i like that no one else in my family does but mostly because im closeted to them ive tried telling my mom whos the more understanding parent that i swing both ways and she basically said im not allowed to like girls and i should stop listening to people who say lgbtq is valid because the bible doesnt condone it i had a break down two weeks ago when she said it and my friends had to comfort me your message has made me realize that someone is there for me thank you i cried my heart out dealing with depression myself this vid really touched me i hope everyone who is dealing with stuff like this can find the strenght to move forward step by step i thought this just another trashy visual novelput now im regret not buying it on steam i absolutely love jacks long speeches at the end or at a point in the video it really positively make me happy he just cheers you up so much you know i was having a tiring day but after listening to jack talk about topics like these its just heartwarming i just wanted to get this out there that your an amazing person and you can do anything you put your heart to remember that there is always someone that cares about you thanks for reading if you did im rooting for you from this side of the screen thank you jack for making videos as well i dont know where a lot of us would be without you love you jack and you as well you beautiful human being reading this sorry i dont really know how to express these through textmessagesbut i wish you tons of love thank you for being you i know where she got that dog picture from on reddit i saw a story where in public a guy airdropped a picture to a random phone and he got that dog picture in return this hit way close to home thank you for the message at the end i really needed that i noticed the tears jack i love you bud watching you play this made me cry because i am experiencing almost the same thing but not so drastically the only reason i am getting by is because i have a few friends that have or am going through the same thing and they are helping me sometimes i just feel as if nothing is worth it and i just stay in my room watching youtube because that helps me as well just trying to forget things within youtube and talking with friends i hope things get better for all of you and for you as well jack i hope you all have a really good life and thank you so much for reminding me what life is worth honestly i feel like may alot i am literally the nastiest teen youll ever meet but still thanks jack were here for you and honestly that message made me cry i really liked this video and this game but i probably shouldnt have watched this i lost my dear friend she went missing april 27th 2018 and was found on my 18th birthday may 8th 2018 i like that theres games for this kind of topic but i dont get a replay button i dont get another chance to see her signs better and that hits me so hard because i dont get to save her yeah i know the feeling of depression from my childhood i had to deal with it alone for some time but this experience gave me strength for the future life but its easier to deal with it with someone thanks sean for the message to all those people that has to deal with it right now feel like its important to point out if youre someone who went on the date and didnt stay with the friend youre not a bad person and you cant fix people look out for signs in your loved ones but theres only so much you can do if you need people please dont expect someone to do this get yourself some help part of me thinks this could be a bit dangerous for people who have lost love ones to suicide or think they can fix suicidal people thanks n stay strongur doing a very good job so far he should make a video like this people really need to hear things like this and hearing it from sen would be perfect ive been having such a rough time recently and have been trying to deal with self harm and depression and anxiety and this video hit so hard to home the game itself hit but at the end when you jack were talking i started to cry ive felt so alone but covered it up with a plastic fake happy that no one could tell i never ever take time for myself but you really opened my eyes and i just want to thank you so much for that hey jack do you remember the game with benjamjn the fox if the full game comes out can you play it no matter what you do what decision you make i will always love and care about you because you make me happy and i want you to feel the same way take care sean and keep moving forward you are doing great damn mays character hit me hard having asian parents like that is something i can empathize with for such a long time i thought i lived in that type of world as stereotypical as it sounds math was the subject that my parents cared about the most and growing up i hated it while also being actually terrible at it i cant understand math the same way or as fast as i understand english or art things that are creative things that are not as celebrated in asian culture i always knew that i loved art and most recently i decided that i wanted to pursue film but i didnt want to tell my parents that because i thought they would shun me for pursuing something that relied a lot on luck and creativity a career that didnt guarantee a lot of money so i tried doing what i thought what my parents wanted which was to study for school so i studied hard trying to get my grades up but it led me to developing depression i burnt out constantly and i lost it in school a lot of times all these developers getting so woke these days memes and gay pride and so on in their games look at us we are so woke lul devs are probably proud lgbt community members ps suicide is the cowards way out and its selfish as fuck its hurting all the people in your life more than anything i am absolutely awful with words but fucking hell the big talk at the end of the video really hit me seriously seeing sean talk about this kind of thing so openly and saying that everything will be okay idk it just means a lot for real this helped me i always miss these long rants good video we appreciate you sean even though i started watching jacks videos for a few months and then stopped watching them i came back out of all the people that make videos jack is the best also this part of my comment is for the game that was played missed messages the art style on that game is absolutely amazing and im not saying this because jack did im saying this because its true i am also kind of depressed in my life my mother left my dad for someone else my great grandmother passed away recently and a few other things not to be mentioned but the way i forget about all the bad shit is by playing video games with people that i feel i care about as im typing this im thinking about how ridiculous it sounds jack even though i started wat thing your videos back in 2017 i believe i realize that i shouldnt have taken a break from watching your videos because the content that you have made and uploaded over the time you have been on youtube has fantastic edit i missed out a very i just thank you for that speech you mean a lot more to so many people than you think and thats not only for you sean thats for everyone reading this to everyone going through a tough time just keep fighting life will eventually get better you are loved greetings from germany we all grow with you jack dont worry because we care about you too it doesnt matter if youre talking too much because it means a lot to us take care of yourself more thank you for telling us this it means a lot 3 thanks for that message at the end im going trough some stuff and i really needed that i really appreciate all that you have done for us and inspiring us to keep going and always get up thx 4 the message jack youre a bright light in this dark and toxic community and you should never feel obligated to a persona if its not who you really are we are all still watching because we love you for you not your persona love all of your videos and pma i love you jack were irish buddies hon ireland ps your the best for real id love to meet you if this was from personal experience then which road did the person who experienced this take take that time for yourself dont let the world burn you up its so important to remind yourself that thank you for all those positivity and the time you take to share this message out with the world jack you good bro dont worry too much we all love you like you areyou be you i nearly cried at the end what he said really hit hard we love you sean iv played this before and got all the endings and its on steam but i failed a few times when i played i was like and then i seen a freaking bts meme outta nowhere it was jungkook but after that i got a ending a dead ending and then 10 mins later i got the true ending ive had hard times like these and the best piece of advice i was given was to turn mountains into pebbles to take my biggest problems and break them down into smaller more manageable problems i appreciate you jack and have watched you for years thank you was 2017 just a terrible year for everyone psychology with jacksepticeye but for real i feel u man amen jack i agree with you social media isnt the best and a person needs to like help their mental health if dealing with depression because all social media can have a good or bad impact on a person its where they need to disconnect from the stress and have help ya for me i had it i have been disconnected and reflected so much in a way love was a issue also due to depression but i just thought it wasnt needed at the time because i pressured myself or i was constantly hurt but it wasnt needed and the stuff after it i have just got back on social media and your right you dont miss anything yayou may find lots of stuff u missed but you need space from stuff taking for myself and its nice being able to socialize in person than on a phone and that people change just try to love yourself how everyone should i got tired of posting on social media or on my streams due to drama and always talked about itand i just said to myself i needed to stop and actually find myself and please talk more people need to hear this i loved this video my heart goes out to this community and jack stay strong and pma you dont need to fully explain why you arent sharing as much i feel most if not all of your fanbase that stayed after you changed knows that you need to keep stuff to yourself thank you just thank you for reminding these things do you ever see a mirror in a game reflecting you a few years ago hey anybody whos reading this if anybody know where i get this game sorry again to be honest i really like the way you are now much more sean before you were like 5th favourite person on youtube now youre my favourite person on social media ah fuck this video was nothing but i big motivational speech and i love it i want to hug this man jack you made me cry you never played escapists again after episode 7 and they patched the bugs jack just got a meme about himself from a video game everyday is like this anymore but thank you for the thoughts and message mental health always comes first the ending message you gave will help my friend greatly thank you for that thank you you helped me so much throughout my worst days even though you dont know me you have felt like a best friend thank you sean today has been a really hard day for me and ive just been feeling really low for no reason i really needed that 20 minute talk at the end and i even cried a bit thank you jack and as you said to us keep believing in yourself these characters are oddly similar to me and a friend of mine we both help each other and it is scary how relatable this is can we also talk about just how much a person like our main character can mean so much just knowing someone cares someone to hug and you know they wont let go its means a lot if you dont suffer from things like may then please be a kind person like the main character you could be someone who saves somebody else from ending it all we need more people like her im talking about the path where she ignores amy and helps may but even in that first path even if it wasnt enough she was very very kind to may its videos like these that just my my appreciate you being there more and more love you sen that was a heartworming speach thanks sean im in tears of joy because of the understanding and motivational speech at the end but also in frustration that i keep forgetting to care for myself and stopped believeing in me and hearing this again that i should ouch hey i love our new more calm gaelic warrior hey jack i have deppresion and have had it for a long time im also a youtuber and doing youtube helps me when im feeling downand your videos have helped me so much ive been with your channel since your 52nd happy wheels video anyone else who has deppresionyour not alone life is too short to end it ending your life is a permanent solution for a temporary problem look sean i know you dont need this and probably wont see this but you are such an amazing person and im so glad you are able to take time for yourself and enjoy your life the fact that you changed is a good thing you have more growing to do your gunna be a big boy your so inspirering also i cant spell you do so much for all of us and i love that i love you as crazy as that sounds you have done so much for all of us its amazing to see you talk about hard times u have had to see you on on there verge of tears just shows you mean everything you say im sorry you half to go through all this and i just want you to know you think your not good with your words when it comes to this stuff but you really are and i think its funny when people pick on youtubers for having the majority of their subscribers as teens cause i am one and teens are the ones that need people like you we go through so much shit and you make our day do much better and you have saved so many lives t where is trover im crying like a baby thank you so much for the message i love these one off videos especially the heavier games i had a kind of monotonous phase during winter and when i finally spoke to a friend i felt so much better because it was off my chest the monotony didnt stop it was wake up while its dark work smoke work some more and go home tired and exhausted the only thing that brought a sliver of joy were video games and my scouts troop so when i got my head out the gutter and realized that i was settling in some twisted kind of winter blues i needed the talking most pitied the way she went but didnt miss her im in tears that line hits so hard seeing mays cuts were old makes me tear up so much that means progress im so happy over a video game but also not guilty i relate way too much to these situations except i didnt have anyone that comforted me in my times of need my comfort was to draw and youtube my scars have been long healed but every now and then i remember how it felt omg i was just about to download it on steam but i got bored so i went on youtube to watch something of urs or marks and i saw this im just amazed i actually shed a few tears when he you taking it really got to me im confused this game is fantastic the art style is magnificent the message is scarily relatable and the scenario is understandable this game really is extremely similar to what i went through a while ago i wish i had that roommate to help me when i went through this im also really glad that this portrays lgbtq relationships in a realistic way this is the representation that we need i truly needed this extra 20 mins because i almost went fully down this path 543 first thing that hit my ear was shiloh dynastys singing very appreciated touch by the dev i really appreciate the 20 minutes motivation because i felt so depressed and since ive put the pma into practice i felt better as if things were finally looking promising it took me courage to speak up about my feelings and i decided i could go to therapy at least once a week things get hard i know but it doesnt have to end that way mental health is important you can rest as long as youd like but never give up because life is truly worth it its crazy to think that these influencers do have days like this but it also makes sense that they would theyre world is surrounded around millions of people thank you for this message sean it means a lot and not just to me but i assume every single subscriber as well this is a powerful video jack well done asking if someoneis suicidal should be blunt jack thank you for playing this hey jack i was having a really bad times this last couple of weeks listening to your word and support in this video really help to make feel better thank you so much for everything youre doing thank you jackyou changed my life this video is 100 my favorite video jack you are right there is more people who are depressed and sad im one of the i know how you felt buddy i know that from my experience the worse think is that im fighting with depression for two years and im still trying to not give up this video is deep and understandable people who suffer the same think i feel you i have no support from anybody im fighting this for myself but not everyone is that tough i will try to fight against my will to just put myself down i tried once and i barely survived that if my mom didnt opened the door i would not be alive remember people try to fight against depression try live better life start enjoying yourself that would be better for everyone sorry for this message i didnt want to make awareness or anything i just wanted to say what depression made me do what hell in my life made me do i hope everyone will take a lesson from that this game actually related to me once but your message picked me up the message at the end hit me hard i have heard countless youtubers talking about suicide and suicide prevention but none of them have hit me on such a personal note thank you may dont you dare pull a sayori jack u really hit me hard with this video thank u we all appreciate u there is nothing that u cant do i wish u the most success love u jack high key trying to be friends with the game creator for 51 minutes i tryed to

times like this when my aunt tried to commit no alive i dont want to say kill yourself but she didnt die and she continues to live on and shes now all types of healthy love you sean shortly after watching this video i ran into a room and started crying not because i was sad but because i held up the facade of being okay took its toll on me and made me realise that its ok to be sad and that you can reach out to friends even in the most shittiest days damn this video was deep not to get away from the video but sean should revisit the last of us on the ps4 you are very inspirational and i love the new you this may seem absolutely idiotic but sean you as an individual were one of 7 people that stopped me from ending everything stopping going it seems so horrid to me that so many people in my life just dont care and i had gone to your videos for hope you made me at least somewhat happy you stopped me i cant thank you enough as of now im three weeks clean of self harm you are one of the reasons that i stopped you make me happy sean and i dont understand that i know i barely even know you at all but you still stopped me from ending it all i ask myself why a lot but i am happy that you helped me thank you thank you for being here sean the last 20 minutes of this video kindainspired me i always sit around wether its infront of my pca console or my phone always trying to find something to dolook through social media and make myself feel worse and worse from things likenot getting as many messages from people as other donot having that many friendsall those kind of things i find myself shut off from everyone and everything always trying to be someone who im notalways trying to do things others do and make myself feel worse because im not as good as them and nownow after the speech from shaun i want to change myself i want to do things i lovei want to do things that i enjoy not what others tell me to do or anything i want to take some time for myself to take a break

awww i just wanna give may a hug thank you sean we really needed this where was the high fivewhiplash the voice crack when you say top wheres the intro we remember dont forget outerwilds i love the videos about it jesus jack are u a therapist youve helped me so much and that message has made me so happy and its helped so many other people also jack please play this level on beat saber its called reality check through the skull megalovania dammit jack im crying so much my room is a pond now thanks jack for this speech last month i came out to my parents that im trans im a girl in a boys body and im just sooo scared to be the person thats trying to come out 3201junji ito isnt that the dude that writes horror mangas this genuinely made me cry and pairing this game with sen and that long segment after the game was extremely therapeutic couldnt put into words how much respect i had for sen and how much it increased after this video i actually played this game when i was it the other day on armor games but i didnt think any youtuber would play it this has motivated me i felt like this before this message will forever touch me thank you junji ito the horror manga artist and writer jack you made a statement about doing things for the love of doing them not profit but if i remember correctly you once had a video where you were on the verge of quitting due to that very fact that if it didnt become profitable you werent going to be able to do it anymore idk i guess im saying never forget your origins people are always talking about things such as aids and cancer and how theyre something that we need to find a cure for as soon as possible and thats right i feel bad for those people who have that but theres also very big things that we are turning a blind eye to such as depression and its something that we need to find a cure for as much as we need to find a cure for those huge diseases love you sean the game was really touching and well thanks for always being there since long ago you always made me happy even in sad games i really appreciate what you do and cant thank you enough for it this really hit home im so proud of this artistgame developer i found her through tumblr and tried out her dress up games that she released in the app store and fell in love with her art sen we love you no matter what and we are always behind you just shows how youve matured as anybody does and that youre clearly on the correct path for you right now this video gave me a lot of feels thank you jack check your streams mesages jack we love you you matter to us we are so damn proud of you those haters arent worth anything i know it gets to you i get that and i know its hard to get over but youve grown so much over these past 2 years you mean so much to me and your community you deserve a good happy life you dont deserve to feel like this you deserve all the happiness and love in a world if you ever need a break from youtube or just a break to help with your mental health take it cause you deserve it from all the work you put into these videos and this community thank you for the preach i find it hard to have friends i have my family thank god but sometimes i feel lonely its just work and sleep lately im currently going through the transformation of where im caring less about the people who keep bringing me down a year ago my only two friends gave up on me at my worst because i went through with an attempt it didnt work but after that i decided to seek help which didnt work i focused on my family which works for sure now i keep treating them with nearly everything i earn and it makes me feel good holidays and tech and games just spent 360 for a pool dammit haha just thought id share this because why not a lot of it doesnt make sense but i know that so dont me for it im reading the comments before watching the video and i can already tell something sad is about to happen it may not be huge strides but even if its a case of getting out of bed today and making breakfast for yourself and going for a walk take the small victories were you can its 125 pm and i havent gotten out of bed yet or eaten not saying oh pity me just fact so that really hit home ahhhh jakes speaking is amazing i like seeing his videos bc i cant say what i want and dont know how to explain it its like a feeling you cant and i love how he takes parts of that feeling in words but still not completely but ill deal with that parts later bc you cant always relay on other people i just wanted everyone to know that this game is almost exactly how real suicidal and depressed people feel im sure a lot of you guys can relate with me on this last year i set a timer for 2am for a time to kill myself because the urge was so incredibly strong i was so close to the point i was actually in the bathtub with the razor in my hand the only thing that stopped me was my siblings if any of you guys feel the same way i did before you do it just think of the reasons you have to live and youll be thankful that you have yourself a second chance and for sean its no hard feelings when you say that you dont want your whole personal life out there we completely understand sure there may be those ass hats that think that you have no feelings just block them out and talk to someone you help us so much already we dont need you to explain your self when you just want space you know if anyone wants to talk im here when are you going to dye your hair green again d who are the 42 aholes who put thumbs down for the video i wish i had friends like this acually i just wish i had friends edit thanks this made my day knowing im not alone this game looks very sad these things does happen in real life aswell l awesome vid jack keep up the awesome work thank you i needed this today hey sean just wanted to say people are always going to yearn for the old jacksepticeye people do it with felix heck theres a whole generation who define themselves as people who value nostalgia its human nature well always miss what once was because our minds only remember the good times what i want to tell you is just stick to who you are now and the person who makes you happy your true fans will stick with you through thick and thin all we want for you is true happiness we cant wait to see what happens for you in the future we love you sean the epidemic from mays dream is depression leading to suicide and you being with and spending time with her saves her from depression because the cure for depression is almost always a good friend who will listen to you and understand you at least in my experience anyway i had a bad day today plus having 1st degree sun burn jack really cheers me up on a bad day and he has been since i subcribed to the channel in 2016 thank you so much dude i relate way too heavily how i draw so much for my measly 1000 followers on instagram and not just for myself i get so upset over not being good enough or feeling good when people think i am bad i havent read in so long and ive had bad thoughts and i hardly go outside or excersise and i recently logged out of my account so this makes me feel like it was a good decision i took so much shit to heart and hearing everything you said at the end card made me cry like 3 times i cant express how much thanks i have for the end card you just helped me a lot i keep thinking that i cant grow into adulthood but you changed my mind at least for now and i absolutely think that your distance from the community is a healthy thing dont listen to people who complain i get this cause i was at this point in my life before sen i absolutely love how your channel and how you as a person developed i dont care you upload less content its better better content now actually take pauses every time you need live your life how you want to you dont have to live on internet more than in real life im so happy youre doing the right things for yourself wherever those might be at the end of the day your mental health is more important for your subcribers than seeing like 10 videos per week are there some fucks out there that only think about seeing some gameplays every day yeah they are but they represent a small amount of people im so grateful for this video im glad youre honest with us and i wish you the best im struggling at the moment so your speech at the end helped a lot and to anyone reading this its ok youre doing great i believe in you thanks i needed to hear that especially today i love when you just talk at the end of a video and you just are so motivating and its the best its what i look for every time i watch your videos you awesome and thank you for being you and pushing people to be there best keep it up this video made me relaxed and i felt like may i knew what shes going threw because i have gone to a therapist when i got in a fight with my dads wife and him and so i couldnt go over there and i was always able to get back to school but i felt depressed and thought about cutting my self but my family was there for me fuck that is one deep game also props to you jack you are a great motivational speaker if we ever see you out in public hanging out with your friends is it okay to come up and talk to you dang all this dust in here no im not crying your crying wow i never really thought i needed this when situation that happened in this game happens in real lifei always felt unsure on what to do this really helped me out a bit thank you for this for playing this game for talking about this a year ago id have been crying about how true this is for me now im tearing up because i realise how far i have come how i am slowly coming closer to who i want to be and being happy with my life and myself thank you your not useless ur the best yter sean you are such an angel thank you so much for what you said in this video wow thats i just wanted to be this video my last video in my life this is no joking i am crying right while i am typing this i dont really know what to say but i think that this exact video about this exact game with this exact creator who has gone through shit and knows what to say this probably did save a life today three days ago my exgirlfriend who i consider my first real love in my life and trusted so much kind of cheated on me with another guy although i wouldve talked about it with her and probably wouldve talked it out of existance the way she told it to me broke me she never wanted me to say it right away yet i noticed her behaviour and after hours of just asking and trying to get it out of her she went from i have no feelings for him to i have feelings for him but this relationship wont work to finally i have feelings for him and i feel this relationship would work fyi i am living far away from her we live at the i love reading all these comments thanks jack i only have one thing to say etika deserve rest in peace f edit thank you jack for that message at the end i needed it i really really neded this to day so thanks you so so much for being a human being thank you for sharing this sean we love you so much and what you want and your mental health and happiness will always

dark times im sure this story is relatable to any depression victim and im 100 happy with the approach you took jack youre awesome as you are never let somebody tell you something else your channel

kind to people you dont know the battles they are fighting remember you are loved you are valuable you are worthy if you are going through hell keep going keep fighting youve got this i believe in you youre a good person sean is it just me whos waiting jack to play mk11 one i had gone thru depressions and there is nothing worse then deppresion and suecidal thoughts and it makes me cry but i was feeling the worst and when my parents came over to visit me since we ware goinng on vacation and i even forgot that after we hadnt seen each other in around 2 years and when my mom rung the door bell and huged me as soon as she came in and look and my hand and around i dont even know how long abo i cut thru my hand with a knife because i was on the edge of probably ending my life and it does make me cry and for any people that are depressed theres people like you who care about you just remember that oh my god my heart i hope everyone who reads this knows that youre loved and if youre going through something shit at the moment i promise it will get easier also if you feel you need to talk and cant talk to anyone close to you you can message me random stranger on the internet and we can talk about stuff no judgement this video is so important to me and im so thankful for it and it breaks my heart that sean feels like this sometimes you deserve the world sean youre such a wonderful influence and i wouldnt be in the state im in without you you opening up about your struggle is so incredible to me and i just cant express how grateful i am for it and how much i wish youd feel happier chances you wont see this high but thank you so much thank you boundaries are much needed all the time but we as your fandom are just grateful for all that youve done so far so know that we know you care thank you for doing so much have a great day this video hit a little too close to home to anybody else wow the message at the end really hit home for me been through alot the last few years and been in a big rut just going through the motions seeing jack open up about his mental health issues gave me hope that life is worth everything youtube isnt letting me edit my comments so heres a second one i just watched your talk at the end of the video and i totally understand fam it doesnt matter what people are doing we all get sad sometimes and life can be a struggle but i hope youre doing good if we were in person random stranger alert i know i feel like id want to listen if you were struggling and stuff because like you say you appear as like a real person to your viewers and we feel like we know you even tho we really dont but uh yeah i hope youre good now d thanks for the words dont worry about it being long thank you for your message at the end ive been feeling depressed for a while now more than a while tbh and i really needed to hear that ive had a few moments where i have had bad thoughts but ive been quite lucky by being such a happy person this video just made me want start helping people more thank you jack this is so real and what sean says about like trying several times to find someone who can help you properly the way you need is very true i had several bad experiences for me each time trying to seek out my own professional help i had one lady who was down right get to the point and mean i had another individual who was trying to push prescriptions on me with everything they heard and while medication helps yes i do take medications for some things its not the only thing you want to hear sometimes from them at least not for me but point is eventually i found someone who is really helpful to me thanks sean thanks angela i needed that 444 oh look its pete wentz from my chemical romance someone can u let me know the name of the music from this people just make a meme about youre depression youll be better i hope you will you wouldnt be there forever cause the hole doesnt fit for everyone everyone feel the same but the different is the way you take care about it thank you so much for what you were saying near the end i really needed to hear that today wow funny thing is that may in this game reminds me almost identically of myself same situation same issue but ya know i had a friend who helped me so im doing better just its almost surreal seeing a character that i can relate to so much were that green hair at this is so important life gets so hard and you can feel like youre so alone or just tired keep going on youre not worthless youre not useless you are priceless you are loved you are a warror jack this was a good video could we get a asmr video of you rubbing ur beard really hit home for me thanks sean i really needed to hear something like this everything you said is 100 true i understand the feeling i was completely fine until he said you deserve to have the best life you can have that hit me so hard the tears just started falling it was the first time someone said this to me and it felt genuine thank you so much for this most of my friends have committed suicide the thing is if u dont reach out to people u could end up like my buds and maybe me but yeahh im getting literature club vibes the fall out boy meme holy shit this made me really emotional as someone who has gone through this and still goes through this your talk at the end was really sweet for anyone in the same situation as me think about all the people that care about you people love you and dont forget that ps dont hurt yourself it wont help take it from me me finally seeing a shrek meme in a game huzzah a game of quality me when i see a lesbian call her gf mommy cries being reminded of my gf who isnt lesbian but makes lesbian jokes to cheer me up i cried so much i now look like a psychopath who relates we all love you sean 3 i just hope if it happens again you can see everyone kind and want the best for you and im meaning with friends and family and the fans that do care for your well being i feel this can apply to everyone and truly mean it play one night a hot springs steam recommended missed messages after i played it jacksepticeye is a virgin jack if you ever need us all 22 million of us we are here for you shes trans trans flag is behind the gay pride flag idk if sean got that when the question what do you write about came i literally said its probably fanfic of some sort and i was fucking right play minecraft when sean started talking about his personal experiences i wanted to give him a hug so much who else loves the fact that shiloh dynasty is playing in the background also ive been through very tough times like this ive been depressed selfharmed but with good friends and a great therapist i got better and i feel better thanks you for those who help and listen yoto i relate so much thank you jack for talking abt thismeans alot to me and sorry if we ever were the cause directly or indirectly of ur pain this whole video hits so close to home for me thank you jack for uploading 3 my makeup does not cost 50 its either 5 or 2 where the hell are you getting your makeup at you see us listening to you for 20 mins but we could listen to you talk about this and just talk your mind out for as long as you want and well listen what in the kentucky fried fuck is this ive been in a bad place too not necessarily directly suicidal and making plans but so deeply depressed that you feel almost nothing put a face on in every existence in your life and realistically wouldnt care if you did die social media can be extremely toxic when everyone is showing their best life wahooo you feel wrong and stupid when you arent always feeling this way im so glad people are coming out of the woodwork and talking about these crappy feelings were alll human and we all have bad days love to anyone and everyone reading this x well i know everybody else is doing so much more than i do im talking about my friends and girlfriend cuz they talk to me about it and they snap to me about it and here i am sitting alone in my room and not doing jack shit lmao pun intended i was waving my fan cause im getting fried here but it felt kinda disrespectfull to wave that green thing especially where he opened up so i just stoped and committed to the heat and my full attention to the words said to whoever sees this messageyoure not alonei experience depression and feelings like this as well youre not alone and i love you youre worth a lot and i hope you eventually take a breath stop and move forward because you are worth so much more than you believe you are you have such a kind soul and i believe that you can make it through more than you believe you can youre okay and just smile and stand in for what you believe in smile because it looks good on you love the small talk at the end i cried when playing bo4 this is real deep okay sean this video came at just the right time i really needed this you are such an inspirational person and i wish you the best with youtube and the rest of your life life is like a tunnel even though you might not see the light at the end if you walk long enough you will see the light conventionally you and this whole community is amazing and i love all of you i love listening to this jack im not crying ur crying uno reverse card everyone seems to be talking about seans hair not being green but youre completely ignoring the whole video sean this was an amazing video its inspiring to see large creators to speak openly about their mental health its okay to be disconnected from the community to figure yourself out your health is above our entertainment always the community has grown an insane amount and at this point its impossible to interact with everyone and thats o k a y no one can keep up with 22 million viewers youre doing everything you can to keep up with the channel but also taking care of yourself take care of yourself first viewersfans im 18 and ive been through hell and back with mental health it started when i was about 11 but at this moment writing this comment i can tell you that i feel better now than i ever have that doesnt mean im happy but for me it means that now im planning for the future instead of thinking completely in the moment sean i dont know how to say this but you dont need to give all of you to us youre not obliged nobody has rights on your personal life anyone saying that you dont care about your community is also wrong ive known you since long but i have only been really following your videos was late last year and you know what you are one of the most genuine person in the whole wide world you care a lot and it shows you dont have to force yourself to please us all and i know you know that but man you deserve to be happy for your own life go do your life as is life is short go ape shit on the world play katana zero pleaseeeeeeeeeeee i will donate goddamned 1000 next time oh you are gonna so love the game why the fuck am i using caps i love being a lesbian im a dude the long talk you had at the end really effected me i can relate so much to a lot that you said about not knowing where youre going or feeling like youre not making any progress in life i constantly go through these tough things and i still dont know how to cope with them but im still trying i try to tell myself everyday that i am worth it and i should keep going but sometimes that breaks and i become a mess sometimes it can drag on for hours or days or even weeks but you sen have deeply effected me in a good way you make me smile when i feel like nothing matters you spark my heart to keep going and im extremely thankful for what youve done for me and this community you have an extremely beautiful heart with a lot to give to the world and im so incredibly proud of you last online 6 years ago this game is beautiful and your message at then end had me in tears but i have autoplay on and while i was staring at the black screen and being all omg and feeling all these emotions l is for lovers who love one another i fucking was so shocked i sucked in my own tears via my mouth and started choking that last twenty minutes really hit hard thank you sean when he said your doing great keep believing yourself i started crying so much man i was crying through this video yas the pride and trans flaaaaags ive been where may is and i still bear the scars the emotional and physical and will for a long time to come im so glad im still here i can honestly say it gets better maybe not tomorrow or next week or even next year but eventually it will and you have to work on it you have to be vulnerable in front of people tell them your biggest fears and what you see as you biggest flaws and mistakes you have to tear open every repressed memory and thought and bleed them out for hours and hours its hell but worth it in the end when your brain tells you youre worthless and noone cares its lying to you its the sickness of depression its not reality theres always someone who cares if you cant find it around you find it online theres always someone thank you for sharing this i recently actually had this realisation im not a youtuber but i follow someone and commented something with the best intentions but it affected the person and she gave me that feedback that really gave me the realisation that as you said we dont know the person running the channel the reason why i said the thing i said was because i think i just saw them as a friend and got to comfortable with commenting not realising i dont know them and thats ok but yeah we dont know our fav youtubers and they are just people and they have their own life sorry for the rant but yeah love your videos and just do you and continue to be happy i cried i am feeling like that but hey thank you man the last 20 min of this video i really needed that i love you jack because youre probably one of the most open youtubers out there i love all of your videos hey sean please make part three of trover saves the universe and love your vids the green hair comment earlier is not serious because you are the best always and never not thank you that long message at the end helped quite a bit am going through a very noisey time right now and have had all these thoughts in the past and in the last few days so this really hit home and really did help please read i was in the military and we had training to see if people are feeling down or suicidal if you think someone is suicidal ask them be blunt people want to avoid saying the word but ignoring it is the worst thing to do if they say no stay with them for a while if they say yes there are helplines out there to call and use dont leave them alone stay with them until they feel safe there are different levels of feeling suicidal just feeling like they want to die is level 1 thinking about a plan and how to do it is 2 having a plan and intent to carry out that plan is the max level if they are in the max level take action immediatly and get help for them but remember not everyone is super easy to read dont blame yourself if you couldnt see the signs thank you for reading there is more but its a lot of information im sure you can research it thank you again please spread the message thank you jack this was so inspirational i i appreciate this so much it it made me cry because it reminded me of everything ive dealt with yet pushed it away to make others happybut this also reminded me that im not alone and i appreciate it ive felt trapped in a box for so long i i really needed to hear this i was blinded by all the negativity that i couldnt see anything else i got so used to doing stuff to please others that i forgot to do stuff that makes me happy this means so much i i really appreciate and i know that youll probably never get to see this but thank you sean i really appreciate i i hope life gets better for you too thank you for being the light that shone down on me in my darkest moments i cant thank you enough for making this video and sharing your story even though i cried you made me have a different outlook and i want to try thank you sean i have watched this whole video and i felt like 5 minutes went by when i dont feel well jack allways makes me smile again and im very gratefull for that as someone who suffers from suicidal thoughts and self harm and has a tendency to put on a brave face and just get on with it seeing jack talk openly about this stuff makes me feel so full of love and support and just not so alone thankyou jack for 5 years of keeping me going through all the ups and downs even though ive never got the chance to meet you and you dont know me i thank you so much for all the youve done i hope you see this thank you ive had a horrible time with grief and it seems like no one understands me not friends family not even the school counselor but i watched this and got reminded of the people that make me happy thats why ive watched you regardless of my stepbrother making fun of me for itand thats why i would like to say thanks you and ill see you in the next video 2724 i feel so relatable i almost cried because im almost going to university and i still have struggles deciding what to study about this game makes me think on knowing more of myself love the game the hope ending was breathtakingly beautiful the art style really sums up what the messege is supposed to be it was inspiring wisftul and investing this was a really good video its my birthday today and im actually really glad i watched this video im kind of going through mays situation like i have no idea what im doing every day i wake up i do things i dont really enjoy i go to bed im worried about getting a job thanks to social anxiety and i dont know what i want to do with my life ive hurt myself before ive thought of what would happen if i just disappeared if anyone would miss me logically i know people will but sometimes it feels like hardly anyone will i feel like im simultaneously getting better and worse at the same time im getting better because i dont hurt myself anymore but im getting worse because the thoughts of doing those harmful things appear more often i i dont know why im even typing all this out i guess i just want to say something to someone so sean if you end up reading this that doesnt sound too weird does it thanks for playing this game and talking about it it made me thats how you should use a 20mil subscribers platform keep it up thank you for everything you do i know this is your job but you didnt need to take that time to talk and try to help with your words you help so many people and i hope you help yourself as well when needed even if you dont know me and arent talking to me specifically thank you for helping me not want to do certain things and try to think more positively pma just like in the game listening to her friend we are listening to you jack im so thankful for these tipes of games and videos that are more serious because it feels good to see that anyone can have a bad time in their life not just see the perfection and also thankful for talking about it and for anybody who sees this if you need someone to talk to please bother me youre not alone 3 is it weird that i usually give good advice to people but i am a total mess this sounds really cliche but back a while ago i think 2017 you and plenty other channels were talking about depression and suicide and it really helped me if it werent for your channel even youtube as a whole i probably wouldnt be here today thank you sean for always making me smile and relate to you even if i dont know you youve always helped me incoming edgy 12 year olds jack plays game also jack gets into real depressing shit me in my head parcour shoutout to you paula i am always here for you thanks for the motivation man really meant a lot to me i didnt talk for the first 12 hours of today but when i did my voice was strangely deep my friend is just like may she cuts her hands with metal and uses knifes on her neck but when i go to her house she stops and just talks to me its hard to go through but good to help her wow sen actually played this game i like it a lot despite its heavy theme its very meaningful and im glad he played this also to raise awareness on mental health issues reminder if youre going through mentally hard times please talk to someone close to you or call your local mental health hotline you matter you are not alone no one deserves to feel alone especially at times like this i literally have the same flags in my room the same problems this game is just my life the life of my best friend i get you man im getting scared and nervous of the new things coming in my life too no gf to worry about having one would be nice no twitter either got a new job gonna start driving by myself getting scared of that dont really get death treats cause im basically a nobody i honestly wonder if people like projared get these suicide thoughts i dont know they are getting what they deserve but i wonder if i ever fucked up that badly would anyone care about me im pretty sure everyone would disown me i get those thoughts alot am i wierd for wondering thank you for the inspirational message shared at the end of this video it helps so much to have a reminder that somebody cares about you and its true youre loved thank you for playing this game and taking your time to talk i really appreciate it sean i know this will probably get lost down here but im going to say it regardless this is exactly what i needed and really wanted to hear ive been feeling exactly what you talked about and what this game talked about this has been the hardest time of my life but im seeking help now and ive been talking to my friends and my fiance and finding ways to help myself even and im so glad that i can see you as a real person in this way and i like the person you are now much better than the way you used to be even i really liked that stuff back then but i grew with the channel and i like the stuff now i really hope that in seeking help and getting better i can be half the man that you are today thank you san you helped get through some tough times with this video a round of applause for everyone keep moving you will get through it life is valuable make it count i think people today put so much pressure on them by comparing themselves to others i unfortunately do it too sometimes and things get not great i realized how damaging that can be to my ecosystem mind even more when you have no one to talk to and feel that you cant hear yourself because of all the noise from all of the too many thoughts so yeah i just needed to take this out trying to get better at balancing all i wish you all a good day i literally played this the other day it really hit close to home i love you jack thank you for this i needed this talk as assuming as it seems to make it seem like youre talking to me personally i honestly feel like the words youve said in this video have been reflecting the things i have been feeling for the past time and this has helped me a lot and i just want to take the time to know that i and quite frankly a lot of people appreciate these advices you have been giving us it may not seem much because were just connected through this platform but your words really help and you matter to all of us and no matter how you change and adapt to become a better version of yourself there will always be people like me who will be with you until the end ps i dont know if youll read this but i just wanted to say these words thank you jackaboy if you are only happy if you never go through hard times you are not human beautiful and sad at the same time i love how some people in chat cant tolerate gays or trans its amazing what dumb people write im just here to let you know that you made my day im just feeling like every day is exactly the same and everything is numb but after what youve said i feel a bit better thank you sen so much this video had actually made me cry and this stuff had actually had to me sean im so thankful about your message i fill my life with lies because i want show that im not depressed and it became so painful that i have had those thoughts this really hit home and i got to release a little bit of the sadness i had thanks shawn ive been going through stuff in my life where ive often felt like this and the speech you did at the end of the video made me feel better stay positive and keep up the great videos also im sorry if i spelt your name wrong i can relate to this there was a time when i believed i was worthless and just a waste of space multiple of my friends would say i was beautiful and smart but i would still believe i wasnt worth anything i felt i was just a burden for them multiple people said i was ugly and i believed them i woke up everyday and said i was ugly i didnt want to wake up knowing its just like any other day just waking up going to school thinking im a waste of space crying and then just going to sleep i did that everyday for 8 months i cut myself and i now regret it i only wear sweatshirtshoodies to cover up the scars now im just a positive person i kinda love myself i mean there are things i want to change and theres things i wish i was for example i wish i was skinny and pretty like all the other girls i compare myself to i still feel a little depressed but i just kinda ignore i regret so much in those 8 months and i regret i didnt do what i wanted and i regret that wheres the green hair we were promisedd i started crying at the end because ive been there and im still there and im trying so hard to get out and jack has helped me so much but sometimes i feel like i wont ever get out and this helped so much 2340 their position changed as you got closer to helping may and talking with may its so detailed 3122 you can see the scars on mays wrists sen you are a wonderful person im sorry you went to such a dark place and im so so proud of you for getting through it not that it means much coming from a total stranger but just know that we see you we hear you and we support you no matter what the artstyle that goddamn artstyle i feel inspired by this artstyle inspired to not be the irish argument guy inspired to do something nice for someone the speech at the end really shined light in my heart thank you for everything jack we love you just the way you are thanks you so much sean i know what you mean unfortunately i went as far as may did in this game thankfully i had a loving family and people who care about me who helped people like you and others online helped as well so thank you to all of them just a bit of advice for anyone going through this trust me its not the end i used to think it was but now things are better then they were dont get discouraged by relapses i had one recently and got scared but thats okay if any of you need someone to listen im here for you i dont want you to get lost may started wearing short sleeves out of the whole game thats what almost made me cry i think you could make another video on that game people really need to talk about this oh sean love u buddy honestly the new you is more relatable for me so the fact that you changed is actually making it so im not watching your videos and thinking to myself i wish i could be that happy i have depression and i used to pretend to be happy so i wouldnt drag people down with me but after you started changing to be this version of yourself i decided to stop pretending and start taking my time and focusing on my own mental state and after a while my depression lessened i stopped wanting to kill myself i started wanting to live for myself not just for others im still learning to love myself and find positive about things i love this video was very impactful not only was the game very meaningful but your words too im not very good with words but thank you thank you so much for talking about this ive almost been at the first ending hearing about your struggles helps me rationalise my own thoughts and noticing my own bad patterns thank you i see you care about us the community and i want you to take care of yourself too im glad you are taking care of yourself i want to grow with you thank you im not crying ur crying shut up huge fan of angela he its odd that the developer choose to include harry potter fan fiction when may said that she wrote them considering the reputation the franchise have nowadays i mean the constant retconning by the author and the movies that came out after deathly hallows part 2 you know fantastic beasts and where to find them and crimes of grindelwald edit but i guess the character is based on the developer so that explains it this video got me tearing up v it reminded me of a similar experience i was going through and the overall journey of getting past that tall hill im inspired 3823 thats hard man i felt that no hes not any one get it i really needed this today jack so thank you this is why we all love and watch your videos because you make us laugh but at the same time you bring perspective to things that are serious amd things that alot of us go through and we all appreciate it so thank you huhmy birthdays tomorrow so i guess its fitting this was truly beautiful and my god the art work is gorgeous damn this game was really incredible thanks jack for allowing us to eperience this with you i used to be very depressed but with ur videos i came out of my shell jack has matured so much i go through this stuff every day bonedeep tired self harm should be dead sleep repeat i talk about it but no one really seems to hear me this one hits close to home i just fibished playing theres this girl and this reminds me of it so much im beyond happy she didnt romanticize selfharm or suicide she portrayed mental illness really well and its so much more realistic than the media tries to make it out to be anyone know the song the game uses in most of the game i really like it and wanna find it thank you jack means a lot this is what i needed to hear thanks jack dude i think that gf is girlfrend i just played this yesterdayit threw me for a loop and i loved it it was really powerful and made me cry if you have time on your own theres 2 other endings you can get other than the ones you got in the video i feel theyre worth checking out 3 i need to cry but my foundation was 48 jack should do audiobooks thank you sean hearing you talk at the end hit me hard i found myself crying as you spoke for some reason hearing it from you is so much better than hearing it from someone who went to school for years on such a topic everyone needs a person like you in their lives love you and love that you played this game this is the best mental health message i have seen got some serious black mirror vibes through the i was living through you guys lifes scary man shiloh dynasty in the back i love games where jack has an inspiring and motivational message at the end jack is and always will be my favorite youtuber i used to self harm and attempted suicide but jack helped me a lot this reminds me of doki doki literature alot you should play rust its such a good game on pc jack you should play theres this girl ill be honest i cried in the last minutes of the video and i really needed that thank you as someone going through stuff i cant express how much of a difference a friend like the mc can make someone willing to go with you to the doctor and to go through hobbies until you find something yhey enjoy it really can save a life the meaning and purpose of life is to find your happiness happiness is not a solid object it shifts like the sands ebbs and recedes like the waves of the ocean and changes like the color of the sky with each morning sunrise as you follow the trail of happiness you find obstacles that must be avoided or removed dont stop and dwell on those obstacles they are standing in the way of your path if you dwell on them too long you may lose the path altogether awe jack we love you and respect you thank you for playing this game i think about suicide sometimes but the thought of hurting others stops ms everytime when this came on it hit me i have that thought so much love you sean i also adore jack and his entertainment but sean is the person i want to keep hearing the voice of seeing you get boundaries wasis wonderful because i couldnt convince some people that they should think about themselves first and that doesnt make them a bad person it makes them a wonderful person who can still have time to love themself tea warm sunlight rad music pride flags perfect i meani do miss the old jack but i prefer the new jack more because he takes the time to care for himself also this video hit so close to home because i am going through my own problems right now and they are very similar to what jack was going throughjust minus the social media aspect thank you for the message at the end ive struggled with kinda bad depression and anxiety for years probably since i was 9 or tenim 16 now about 3 years ago i tried to kill myself luckily i didnt and im still here im still often suicidal but your videos and videos of other creators always helped me to distract myself from the real hard and sad world sending hugs and love to everyone who feels that way and right now to my lgbtq family 3 its ok sen you dont really have to talk about it but thank you youre very amazing you really made my day thank you alot i saw mixed messages messages missedmissed messages what the differences im so happy u played this game thank u jack uwu the last portion of the video is just too true i almost felt like crying not ashamed of it not because i was sad or ashamed of relating to it but because i was so happy that this kind of message was being broadcasted thank you san you are truly a gift to us all and thank you viewers for shaping today and the future of our society sen thank you for being with us and making us happy ill forever be glad about it we love you please remember that my brother committed suicide that dog meme was a pic of bts

thats great thank you for the message at the end 3 btw behind the gay pride is also something about necko shit im not really sure but i think its the flag that represents the necko pride or something im do glad i havent gone though this i feel really bad for pepole who do 97k views and im here buster i needed another talktime with jack i was feeling really down lately this is why jacks archnemesis is antisepticeye the spirit of suicide that is always a potential threat to us all i think youre doing amazing and you doing what you need for your mental health is more important then not posting a video i love your content and you make me smile so much i have days like this for multiple reasons and its nice to know that you arent alone in this world you being here makes me feel better on days i cant think i really appreciate your just being here and making people smile also this is gonna sound stupid now the new chapter of sally face comes out in october but thats aside the point im a big fan and im happy youre getting to a better point of not taking other peoples opinions so harshly tysm jack all the advice all the just talking at the end made me feel a lot better after relating so much to may and how she was feeling yours and a lot of other youtubers videos help me thru my daily life love ya jack 3 thank you jack for the message at the end ive been having a hard time recently

eventually you just need to be patient dude this means so much to me im going throung similar shit right now i even got to a professional who tried to make me think that this mental state i am in right now is because im gay wtf and yeah i wanted to give up so badly after this but my friends insisted that i look more now i have a good professional helping me and everything is slowly getting better its really hard to get out of this but i believe its worth it jesus christ jack your speech at the end made my eyes leak that was the real video the game was extra it was a good fame dont get me wrong but i left this video taking more from your speech than the game and the end really hit me youre right dont worry about others go at my own pace thank you for being an awesome person and everyone have a wonderful life thank you what is dis no person on this earth is more relevant than any one else people are people and thats that man i needed that part at the end love ya jack tysm this made me reflect my entire life decisions thanks for making this video sean you are my idol and you are truly inspiring this hit me right in the feels 1 like 1 prayer for all the people who are in the roughest of times bc you yeah you can still make it in this life you just gotta focus on you enough to put forth the effort in your ideas and or careers gj on the vid and have a great year time and life through this craziness of a community i love sean so much hes so inspeiring and i just love that he spreads out happiness and knowledge to others about stuff for example the stuff that was in this video about depression and such things thank you sean for playing a game like this and opening up to us you are not obligated to but we appreciate it so much sean you have a genuine and kind heart we dont deserve a wonderful person like you take the time you need for yourself and your new girlfriend we love you and we care about your health also i used to give myself 100 to online relationships because i thought that they completed an empty hole i found in my heart but when i opened up to dating my irl bf i left that toxic fallacy behind and moved on that is not to say i didnt like any of those past relationships but they were not real to me so it was easy to leave that behind you know what great super great jack i am so glad you found this balance in your life everything you said was completely correct you have a right to have personal barriers you have a right to keep work and everything else separate and you have every right to have your own life and of course you still care about your channel and the community we can all see how much love and care you put into it i have no idea who those people are who are saying otherwise but im sure the vast majority dont see it that way so keep doing what youre doing jack all the pma stuff and charity streams and just regular content its all good so dont worry about not doing enough pray for the boy etika omfg i was playing this game when the notif popped up im scared also what headphones does he use just remember everyone we dont have all the same problems but all of us have problems the thing is instead of trying to identify who has the biggest problems we should just support each other sean if you need to take a break feel free to do so and well be here waiting to hear from you again he is the greatest i have been watching him for so long and its true its hard to see people struggling and what he said at the end made me feel comforted and how everyone including me needs to try to be more aware of people hurting or going through something some people could really use our help through these times by the way jack i love your channel and thank you for making everyones days better by uploading i teared up twice already by 20 min and i havent really cried in years now brings back some memories i guess tbh i cried at the speech in the end it really hit me but in a kinda poositive way maybe i just really needed to hear those words so thank you and thank you for being here cheering us up etc 3 well its time to watch this i waited one whole hour to watch it bc its almost 1 hour long so that when i start watching it can get spoiled in the comments please send help ha i just finished this game a few days ago thank you im so happy that i watched this on one of my incredibly low days i love you so much jack and i could never write a single sentence that would do justice to how much i respect your transparency the fact that someone like yourself that is viewed as only loud and irish is going into their own experiences with mental health problems it means so much because it really does go to show how so many people are going through things that you would never even know thank you so much for all of your advice in this video it has helped me tremendously and i know for sure it has had the same effect on others man i live when games and game developers do this they give you one of todays problems and represent them in a realistic way that also makes you root for the characters whove got said problems i really hope angela didnt go through depression herself but she really captured the essence of what sadness is really like without just using stereotypes and leaving it at that props to her also this game gives me strong doki doki literature club vibes which is a good thing btw holy shit the 2nd time he pressed play may sounds like what im going through the real ones here are the ones who love you regardless of your upload schedule what videos you make and not these peeps straight spamming why no green hair a happy sean is the best sean loved the video and you keep doing what makes you happy man dont worry sean me and the 21999999 other subs are here for you gahhleave it to me to get a crush on a video game girl this game is so beautifully made memes jokes relationship seems real thank you i cried but this made me realize that life has more thn youtube im so glad that you take the time to talk and do things like this it really reminds me why i came to your channel in the first place you have grown into such a great person im so glad that i was able to start following you when i did cuz i feel like i got the best of both sean and jackcepticeye and from my perspective ive gotten to see the jack that cares the most for his community i hope that everything keeps improving like it seems to have been there are people i knew who i wish could have heard the second half of the video its so hard to say goodbye to people that way to anyone struggling please make sure you make time for yourself find something that motivates you and find people that make you feel worthy because everyone has their own purpose even if they dont know what it is theres so much to do in life so many things to see when people say enjoy the little things do enjoy them some of the smallest things can mean so much to you take your time find happiness in everything you can and try to love who you are you might not feel unique but you are you are so different from everyone else and thats beautiful i really love hearing your thoughts at the end of these types of videos hearing you say things that have a crossed my mind as well really helps me know im not alone youre a really great person and im glad you feel happier and do what you need to for yourself looking after ourselves and not comparing ourselves and our lives to ones that dont even exist is really important youre right about the online persona thing people dont like to share their hardships you only see what they want which gives an unbalanced view on their life and makes you think yours is crappy thank you so much for everything you do your videos help so many people dont ever think you talk too much you help so many of us thanks jack i really needed this this video inspired me sooo much sean i am thankful for messaging this bc i am depressed for two years when i heard u say this it made me happy and stopped my depression i am thankful i love u sean what are these songs theyre really good is there somewhere i can get them thank you sen that was beautiful hey jack i just want to thank you for talking about what you talked about in this video you helped me realise i was falling back into some toxic habits thinking id never get better thinking i didnt deserve to get better thinking theres no reason for me to feel the way i do when other people have it so much worse im not good at opening up to people but i did that recently and now im in the process of getting help so just know that talking to someone can make all the difference there is a long hard road ahead but im so relieved to be travelling it before i did something i wouldnt have chance to regret thank you to angela he your art style is beautiful and this game really helped me to understand my own feelings when ive been feeling so lost youre an amazing developer and i appreciate all of your work so much just thank you 3915 i didnt know how much i really needed you to tell me this thankyou this made me cry coz im going through depression and this gave me hope thanks sen inspiring ending i love conversations that get deep especially if you learn a good lesson this is so fucking important i want to say that i might be in the minority but i can tell the difference and i love this sean more because he loves himself i dont want him to go back to who he was inspired by junji ito cool for me my biggest time to calm and relax is walking my dog me and my labrador go to the park

may never see this message but i still just want to say it in the small chance that you do im about half of your age sometimes i do art and i love writing books i watch your videos often and your happy attitude is one of the things that a while back pulled me out of a dark place and again over these past two weeks there was a moment of about three days where all i could do to keep myself from the thoughts of i dont mean that much to anyone or it would be better for everyone if i was gone was to watch your play throughs of papers please even when it got to the point i almost memorized what would happen next your videos pulled me out of a dark place im so so happy that you pulled yourself out im so happy that you found people who like you did for me pulled you out of your worst moments

through life lately and i just really needed this so thank you so much and just keep being you inspired by junji ito as in horror manga artist junji ito the one known for some of the best and most grotesque manga i wonder where the inspiration was present in the game i have gone through depression it is a b but there is always someone who cares about you you are never alone shiloh dynasty in the background as a person with anxiety and depression turning off your brain would be wonderful but it isnt easy your always thinking about what people think about you and it irritates me so much so

burning in u it give the will to never give up to push forward on the haters be happy and remember pma great game artwork stuff but i feel like the message is a little over pushed just i understand

chronos on vr thank you jack for playing this game from time to time i feel the same as may but only your videos keep me floating a few weeks back a was on the edge of the precipice after a huge fight with my little sister thinking already about the beyond and how free it must be but the video you updoaded just at that moment gave me strength to continue on to fight for a few more weeks before the next attack and every time it comes i will check out your channel and watch as many videos as i need to see the light again thank you for being my live savior i feel like this game all the time i have an exam tomorrow and i was stressed the fuck out and i felt horrible this video couldnt drop at a better time right now 3 sup sean when are you gonna play slime rancher please get in it soon me remembers sayori while watching this the sad thing is he probably wont see these lovely messages i was not prepared and now im crying damn this hit me harrrdd mostly im the main character in reality this kind of art concept reminds me of dream daddy this games writing is so good and hits so close to home the more i listened to jack the more i cried the game is just hitting my heart strings in so many ways i dont regret watching this video game was awesome and all and green hair hype but is no one gonna mention the heartbreaking 20 minutes of heartfelt dialogue that sean made it clearly was painful to say those things for him and i for once really took time to listen he is wording it so perfectly what so many people sometimes go through including myself so it shook me i doubt i ever gonna meet him in real life but if i do i am gonna shake his hand and maybe offer him a hug you always manage to make me emotional and cry when you talk about shit like that maybe it is because im going through a lot of that stuff im still so grateful for people that talk about that because people who struggle with shit like that cant always talk about it i struggled silently for years until i finally told friends and my parents and im lucky that they all are supportive ive had negative experiences with doctors and one therapist but here i am like 3 years later and trying it with another therapist in 17 days guys please dont lose hope and always try finding someone you can talk to about shit like that there are always people out there who care this has being hipster it has being gay it has being memey it has being um hashsh bored it has cant focus on work it has great music this is tumblr the video game jack i want to see you play rainbow six siege off topic but the one who

words around 23 of the video and your amazing content that always makes me smile thank you for being so empathetic i really appreciate you being so open even though you dont have to people can easily bottle up feelings and make themselves feel like they cant talk but others will understand even if that person isnt close to you i went through major depression that lasted 7 years from when i was a young kid i fixed my life with help and it was a long process i still have dark days but now i know there is light that i cant always see and i make my decisions that help myself feel happy i cant be the only one that cried honestly i was crying throughout the whole thing it relates so much with the world i struggle sometimes but i try to stay motivated do what i love be great but sometimes the world just throws you down prevent suicide do not do it your life is great the way it is you are great the way you are 3 3335 me trying my best to not cry when getting told off you are so loved you

community and all of us are here for one another and i love it that was beautiful well shit now im gonna go hug my roommate sean the words u say u male meanful ive got some bad shit going on in my life and watching ur vids make me feel happy and makes the world seem like wonders now u probs wont be reading this so im just going to say thanks for starting ur channel u make me and 22million others happy so thank u so much sean honestly im so happy that jacks changed and that theres a separation between jakcsepticeye and sean because that makes him seem even more real to me more of an inspiration to always care for yourself he sends a very valid message that you dont owe anyone anything just by existing especially on the internet strangers only know the version of you that they want to see not the real you so their opinions arent reflecting who you are just who you appear to be to them please remember that hes a real person that doesnt owe anyone on this platform any personal information hes doing the internet a world of good just by creating the content that he does i want to say thanks thats it this really helped im happy you found yourself important enough to put yourself first and develop yourself this way i hope to be able to do that myself one day you seem a lot more self aware and appreciative of life enjoy it jack i realli appreciate everything you said at the end also ur acct is not dying ill fight i have been feeling really depressed again lately and everything is just a big mess both physically and mentally and i dont know what i really want from life or what i will be able to do in life im 26 years old and i dont see the future life past 30 havent done it for years and i feel like its silly to worry about it but i still do i try to love myself but im just so unable to cause i just really hate myself a lot sometimes i feel like i might slip into my old habits and it scares me so much that time was such a dark time and im glad i came out on the other side but i feel like if i fall back in i wont be able to get out this time it always makes me feel better when i watch your videos and this video really came at the right time with that speech i know im enough and worthy it just doesnt always feel like it but i know its true i love this game 3 i played this game on steam a month ago its very interesting and very heart wrenching thank you for the talk at the end of the game i may not have been feeling the worst but it wasnt the best it really made me think about self care and how to deal with sadness thank you sean i relate to this game so much not because of may but because of the main character im always there for people who are going through a hard time and its difficult to keep yourself above water as well as everyone else thank you jack for helping me keep myself from drowning while i help others i dont claim to be en expert or even an important person in the world but i like to think that i am helping others stay in this world but it is difficult and videos like this really help so thank you jack for everything i need to cry but my foundation was fourty eight dollars ill go home as someone who went through this to anyone who might be dealing with depression right now dont hesitate to go to a professional they wont judge you i know you think they might but they wont if you dont establish a good relationship go to another one if the treatment doesnt work there are multiple others to try there is always another way always you can be happy again i think i like deep conversation jack more than loud jack ps if you dont play outer wilds again im gonna have to edit green hair on you and post it into the subreddit sen mclaughlin you are one of the best people on earth the way you connected with me was amazing ive gone through some of the stuff you mentioned and i feel for you i love all the we bare bear memes thank you for this jack honestly this hit home and yeah thank you 737 thats not the exact time of what im about to talk about but when i think about how big the universe is and how wide and expansful it must be i make peace with it the reason why i do such thing the reason why that i dont feel insignificant is because the world went all this way just to create me to create the ones i love thats how i know i have a purpose and so do yall that purpose doesnt have to be about getting famous or doing something thatll scar your existence in this world this purpose is the amount of time youre here and the impressions you make on yourself and others around you its the time you spend to be happy no matter how longand no matter how short i think its good that you talked about it i mean now that you have actually talked about it i believe lot of people like me are glad to hear explenations about life and how cruel it can be for those ones who dont understand one day you will go through it probably if not be happy just to think young jack without the beard oh no it feels like i have watched this video for 10 min and its already over d awwww this is so cute i love you sean this was a great video pleaseplease play my friend pedro the full game is finally out is the shiloh dynasty sample used in the game licensed wow this hit me i relate to this in a way i never knew before this video really helped me help myself thank you i am a weird and funny guy sees deep stuff gets confused cry run everywhere that was deep i really have to thank you sean i started watching you tube with a video if yours like 2 or 3 years ago it was an uplifting one and it helped me and still help me to this time im a gendernoncomforming asexual person i have to take a lot of shit in every area of my life besides your videos and scouts i feel down less and less but when i am it helps so much to watch some videos of you and have such speeches that just touches me and help me to go through everything im so glad that you are here im so glad that you have find a good balance for you and im glad that you can handle yourself so good pma for everyone who reads it and i really hope i can watch you for a long time from now tanks again your personal growth helped me learn how ro start genuinely loving myself its still a work in progress but thats life have the courage to exist thank you sean you helped me remember that im not alone i love the person you are now and im so happy to have been able to see you get to this point this hit me hard holy shit its nice to see someone so positive talk about his darker moments after playing or seeing something that is pretty hard to relate to from what may was saying about loving what you do but dont know what you love doing even with sean being jacksepticeye your alternate persona means little to me its youre real personality that always brings me back here and people have their alternate personas like on social media or youtube people may think their online persona will make them a better person it doesnt and it wont its the real you that people want to see they want to see how fun you really are and how caring but to put it shortly jacksepticeye is a fun person but sean is realest person to know and to focus on saen sorry if i botched it you seem like a great guy excuse me where tf is the wapoosh who hears shiloh dynasty as background music lol he was on the edge of crying you can see it in his eyes wow this really became an emotional ride i missed the notification of this video it doesnt matter how you look or act we will love you anyway when you realize he may legitimately not know what gf stands for sean being open as a person is a choice that some people make but keeping a lot of stuff in makes you one of the heaviest people that try their hardest to make everyone happier before you by young poetic i needed this today thank you sen state my physical attractiveness female progenitor i thought he was playing mystic messenger for a moment and i almost passed out help this is probably his best video yet in my opinion because its just so real and to the point i lovehate these types of game it just makes me want to sign up to be a volunteer firefighter or help anybody with depression i dont know it inspiresdepresses me but if youre thinking about doing something like this thats in the game commit suicide or hurt yourself dont do it just reach out for help theres millions of people out there that will help you all you have to do is let somebody know and i know its not that easy but still life will go on for u please just try dont give up please im suffering right now and everyone thinks im the happiest person in the world jack you are inspiring everyone that whaches this video please just stop complaining about the green hair thing the green hair days are over and no matter how dumb that sounds i mean it i thought it was a joke as san wrote that tweet and i dont get why people want him to dye his hair again its such a dumb thing to talk and complain about but still i wanted to say that im not first im not last but i just happened to click a lil fast ive also been in dark times but i dont feel like i can talk about it with many people so my friends often think im happy all the time but im not the thought of my friends and my family is what keeps me together i think its a good thing that you bring up these topics so people can be more understanding about them from one sean to another i appreciate you this really hits hard ever since i was little i was praised because i was the top student and that i had a lot of talent people had high expectations for me i already put enough pressure on myself more added pressure can break my back and thats exactly what it did the pressure was too much and i lost my place as top student i also got bullied a lot high school came in and it just got worse no one liked me i was nicknamed crybaby because i was really weak and an easy target so i would cry in my room shitty roommate found out and told everyone after all that everything wasnt worth living for i was a failure i just wanted to end it all then i started cutting my arms it hurt in the begining but over time i got used to it after some time i felt that cutting myself wasnt enough so i got a rope i really wanted to end it all but i just kept pushing to really see if life is worth fighting for now im taking professional help got a new roommate who is a when i saw it was a true story and my name was included i felt like it could have been my own story im 14 and this is deep i was beat down about writing and music in elementary going to middle school the teachers thought i couldnt do it because it didnt bring money i soon stopped talking about it lost my passion gave up last thing i remember was making a date for suicide saturday during the week my friend came and helped me out brought back music writing happiness stay alive loved this jack were all brothers and sisters here d sorry jack noping out for this one this was a very emotional game and with its lifechanging elements it also has hope itself this game makes anyone and everyone question well almost anything in their lives and in a weird sense it kinda comforts you as well but the message is different for every single one of us because we are all different with each amount of sadness and joy that we all have deep down a person who looks at the glass as half full may see the message as being with your friends and comfort them when theyre in need of rescue and you will get it in return a person who sees the glass as half empty may see the message as when you need help you have to hope believe and pray on your friends and the ones who care about you for help because theyre only a true friend if they do help but a person who sees the glass as both half empty as well as half full may see it as balance just like them help your friends no matter your situation and just focus on the things that count ones who love im halfway through and im already drenched with my own tears anna farris nobody cares about what someone will do for a klondike bar let me watch my damn video youre doing great jack love you d actually i love they way ur as long as ur happy thats all that matters thanks sean for being who u really are this video is wonderful and so important i love you sean i love you guys so happy i am a part of this wow i cant read missed messages not mixed messages god this hits hard i literally went through the same thing with one of my friends last night he was thinking about committing suicide and i spent so much time just talking with him i felt hurt knowing his pain but he accepted me and my offer for help and i thank him for allowing me to help hes done so much good in this world and hes also the reason i have such an amazing girlfriend and i needed to do this as a way of self help for me too considering i was in his same shoes and i didnt seek help from anyone but when i felt like breaking down my older brother pulled me from that darkness anyways im ramblingand this is probably only important to me and a couple others but i guess i just wanted to share and vent a biti hope everyone remains hopeful and keep on fighting please ive been in that position with depression and the things that were touched on in this game and i went there but thankfully i survived im still here and im thankful for that and im so proud of you for opening up and talking about everything at the end learning to love ourselves and put ourselves first for our health is the absolute key to everything im coming up on 7 months sober and learning the importance of self love and self care has been a huge thing for me theres a part of me that hates me but thats okay theres also now a part of me that loves me its all about balance for me at least but truly thank you for opening up and touching on everything you did im proud of you and it will help you and everyone who watches this take care jack i wanna see more outer wilds its been so long th art style and the message are so gorgeous 3 love this game i want you to know that youre great even when i cant tell you my mom a few seconds ago why are you looking up me i

thank you for your kind words i will listen to your advice and try to be happier love you sean 3 once you go jack you never go back hardcore fan since 2014 this game really hits home for me ive dealt with the same things and its definitely hard to get through your videos have made me feel less alone and i appreciate everything you do you knowthis video is one of the best ones youve ever made jack this game is so relatable to so many people and the fact that youve shown the world that someone as happy as you can go through these things as well shows people that you are indeed still a human being ive gone through so much like this and it always helps to have people who care and will listen this is an amazing game and you are an amazing person and i thank you for that thank you you knowyou dont always have to be dvayou can be hana too everyones a dva and sometimes they need to take some time off to be hana i love jacks soothing voice when reading this we hide our faces behind a mirror of laughter and smiles i really appreciate you talking about this issues jack luckily the things that im going through arent as deep as for example in the game but its still sometimes hard to be motivated to do anything also props to you for talking about your own experience im so glad you took some time for yourself and now live happily thanks jack i really needed this type of talk game right now ive waited so long for another visual novel this is why i like jack because even when hes talking about dark topics he sounds optimistic thanks i mean it the talk at the end really helped thank you so much xxx not trying to sound rude but its either 1 people comment before seeing the whole videodescription 2 optimism trying to drive back the depression i love that they used shiloh songs and i think they may have used cavetown but idk 2310 well thats true because writing is art and art is intangible subjective science is not usually this hits so close to home i love this video and there always someone there for you and you are never alone thank you in my eyes they are everything but in their eyes im just another fan we are here for you sean jesus christ this hit too far close to home why was there no high five my life used to feel monotonous and i was so burnt out from doing the same thing over and overbut that consistency is gone and now im just empty im just brokenits all gone and i hate how much i miss it now but hated it all so much when i had it now i never leave my room i stare at the wall blankly knowing no one will walk in and ask if im okay thats okay though i dont blame them im the one who pushed them away im the reason theyre all gone im the reason im empty i love when people open up to that stuff it hits really close to home and especially when people that i look up to show that even they have doubts about themselves and have bad moments and dark thoughts that really kept me going a while ago ive watched jack since 2015 and at that time i felt like i had a friend a really close one at that that was always by my side and always made me smile well time to end this cheesy cliche comment and i hope that you guys have an amazing daynightweeklife d great video your insight is always appreciated and really hit me cuz ive felt this way for so long gotta make time for yourself this is a reaaly good video thank you im sure that im not the only one who needed the motivation this exact hour thank u did they just ignore the fact that may had cut her arm jack over the years you have changed alot but it was for the better at least you have time to live your life and to enjoy life much more and to be more of yourself edit i also do like it when you do some of your personal advice talks thank you where the high five at sean amazing video as always thank you sean this game is all too real and ive these thoughts before but it also teaches you that people are there for you good job developers i cant relate more this world was my world for years its amazing how just a few acts of kindness can change the fate of someone ive felt like may and still do sometimes and to see what my friend went through from their perspective really makes me think to hear sean say these things haunts me as well i never think people care but they do they know theres always a way out when you dont thank you sean your 2017 is my past couple of years i was doing a lot of what you were doing wanting so much to be validated by others online just to be happy so many things went wrong being beat down and burnout etc although im not getting professional help i have discovered meditation for when my brain becomes filled with so much that i dont hear words just one loud monotone noise im no where near where i need to be but its a start and i will get there eventually i hope you do as well i needed other people to let me know i was doing good i think its the same as seeing yourself as a goodbad person based on your marks when theyre not the best maybe just a 2 not a 1 and you are the one always telling other they shouldnt care about their marks i just see how ironic this is lmao if anyone is sad tell me ill try to help as much as i can its i need to cry but my foundation was 40 dollars thank you for being so honest with the message at the end with someone who may seem as far away and untouchable like you recent events and the statement at the end shows we are all human made of flesh and bones emotions and thoughts no one is exempt from pain no one dont cry jack half of this video is just talking i vote that jack makes a side channel where all he does is talk about deep shit jack please play another lost phone i know its kinda off topic here but the message move me to tears this game hit real close to home up until a

harming sayori sucicde i wish i had missed messages or any messages for that matter 2339 harry potter is on my tv right now coincidence i think not making someone feel that they are not alone can be far more powerful than you realize im so sorry seanjack i dont wanna be weird or be invasive by using your real name your messages are really powerful and i love how honest you are also just shows how many people can probably relate to these types of games which is really sad but good vid jack for the way you talk about this its strong and honest it takes a lot of life expiriance thanku so much for lighting this up sending everyone out there love and positivity i love you all you are all beautiful and incredible human beings im sending you hugs and kisses hope youre doing okay thank you so much sen you honestly have no idea how much this means to me i should have took the warning of not watching the video had a lot of flash backs with a lot of things they said heh heh i missed these monologues from sen jack is great and all dont get me wrong but sen is why i subscribed im glad hes learned to set boundaries as much as some people wish he interacted more hes being a better role model this way for his younger fans boundaries are important not just for youtubers man i wish i was a girl sometimes it sucks that i cant just have been born a girl todays fact crystal the monkey from the hangover 2 and night at the museum has her own imdb page giving away free digital hugs are you sad here free hugs be happy and remember that you are loved and important to someone i watched

think youre an inspiration sen thank you for the real talk sean im a content creator with chronic and mental illness and everything you talked about resonated with me its a topic that needs to be discussed and not buried under the rug 3 it sucks man i dont know what it feels like to an extent but i kinda get it im no professional but i know its tough im glad your feeling better and are in a better place and to anyone out there who has these thoughts it gets better and if it doesnt seem that way try find someone maybe not a family member maybe not a friend even a stranger find someone to talk to that u trust find someone you love i understood this game so much ive been through this and im still going through it but i working hard to overcome it also im so proud of sean for being able to tell us about his struggles and how hes overcoming it all ill always love and support you no matter what with green hair without green hair with your old intro without the old intro happy or sad you have honestly changed my life for the better you never fail to make me laugh or smile and im happy that you dont have to feel like you give us all of you because you dont because its not fair on you lots of love while watching this i got missed messages with my mom i dont know what you went through in 2017 but i hope youre alright and what you said hit to close to home whers that green hair sean thank you so much for this video for your words im going through a bit of a hard time right now and i cannot convey how much this means to me thank you for your channel too you make so many of us happy daily it makes me personally so happy to know you are taking care of yourself and working to be happy with yourself and with your life so thank you for taking care of yourself too jack i love your old videos and i love your new videos no matter how much you change ill always stick with you the thumbnail looks like a fanart of belle delphine dont get me fucking starting i wanted to watch this video but the warning stoped me from watching this always love the serious aftertalks doesnt happen enough on youtube in my opinion seans mindset is exactly in the right place for these things have fun playing the games and talk seriously about stuff at the appropriate time honestly one of the best content creators on the internet without a doubt i think angela he is pronounced as her this game but home tbh you have 1 missed message from tom holland jack im sorry about 2017 and how you were sad 123 for everyone who doesnt know this is a gay pride and a trans pride flag this is a really nice way of story telling and getting to know the character better this was a sad start sad intro you alright buddy suicide is a subject i take very seriously ever since i saved a friend from suicide i used to know girl that wanted to commit suicide i would try stopping her but she would say thinks like youll never know you cant stop me and i wont stop myself she would never do it tho i tried helping her but i felt she didnt appreciate what i done for her cause she would yell at me and use me as a punching bag to take her anger out onshe overall wasnt a good friend my parents though so too and so did my other friends and told me to leave her but i felt i could help her if i tried hard enough but i never could and she mistreated me so much so i had to leave her i felt bad for doing but i had to im in therapy now cause of her she messed with my mental health badly i dislike that the top suggested comments werent even abt suicide youtube is trying to censor it off my comments and thats annoying bc suicide shouldnt be censored bc it is the 2nd top killer of teens in america so youtube if you read this plz stop these messages need to be seen and if youre depressed and youre reading this right now you saw sean too and i wont drive the point home farther than he did bc he said it better but your feelings are valid and help is possible and available this was the greatest video for me thank you for opening up and talking about your personal experience im sure it helps a lot of people out there this video was so heart warming it made me think about some personal things that i will be getting some help thank you sean if a fan ever came to me and said jack doesnt care i will passionately punch them in the throat some how i watched this 51 minute video and it felt like it was only 10 minutes long do what you love and what makes you happy stop trying to live up to other peoples expectations that speak at the end was very inspiring i am so glad he said that i really needed this video i suffer from depression and all i could do was understand what may was going throughi actually cried cause of how relatable it seemed jack i have been watching for since i was like 7 im 14 teen know and you have made myself and probably countless others insanely happy and feel better i have gone through dark places i have leterly thought about end it but you have made my smile and get me distracted for countless hours from all the shitey stuff in my life and i just want to thank you i was half way through and i realized she was gay and wantednto commit suicide i hate it jk you need to make a pma podcast or something so i can listen to it every morning i love the art style this is such a good game it helps shed light on the dark parts of life that so many people go through some getting stuch some manage to push through i couldnt watch it till end cause of rain butthank you i needed to hear that owo jacky boi is back almost twenty minutes when he talked about touching stuff this is why we love him also anybody watching this vid and going through stuff like this just think of life as an empty canvas and you need to get to the paintonce you get them in your hands you can paint your desired world on the canvas can anyone yeet me the source of the bg music in the game pleez subscribe to me gets date in 2 seconds me thats not how life fucking works jack so i just became a big sobbing mess and i just want to say how much i love and appreciate this man you have helped me through so much shit jack and your videos brighten my day and i feel that just watching you has made me a better person you have completely changed my mindset in life and i seriously couldnt thank you enough you are the best beginning to my day and just watching you makes my day better thank you much love and we understand that people evolve people change and if we truly are true fans we will stick to you no matter what we will grow with you we are the cushion you can fall back on and we wont expect you to give us everything you need to keep some for yourself as long as you are happy we are happy we like you the way you want to be thanks for coming to my ted talk love yaaa life is strange the walking dead and this all the have in common is jack making two girl in love your still cool jack sean youre little tangent at the end of the video changed my mind for a bit ive been in a hard time and today i had a really bad dream about suicide you really helped me today thank you ive considered taking a break on social media and asking my parents to take me to the park like old times youre one of my favorite youtubers i have felt exactly the same and i still feel the same way i hate myself to the point that no one can fix me i honestly find this very therapeutic sen i understand what you feel may i understand what your feeling and going through its hard to sit there and tell people its fine or im fine and im ok knowing that deep down inside that youre not i feel like everyone around me is judging me off of my smile after seeing one smile out of me they permanently think that nothing is wrong im ok i am happy but inside im crying and screaming and hurting it isnt a cry out for attention it isnt me asking for me it isnt me asking for love its a cry for help and that is completely different to anything else love is a very hard thing to find nowadays simply because everyone thinks that faking their happiness and life is better they want people to think theyre higher than them and its not fair you get pressured into things people hate on you for nothing people make you feel like shit for just stating an opinion i think we all kind of miss the days where we could go out and ac from both my personal and online experiences i have sadly grown into asking myself the question who isnt depressed at this point and its a sad realisation that its a struggle so many people face if anyone is suicidal call someone if you cant call a help line the world wont be better without you heavy topic i really liked the video jack thank you for playing this game and for what you said after cool gamegreat vid to everyone reading this dont forget to sub to jack to anyone who sees this i want you to be happy and please know that there are people out there who love and will miss you deeply if you feel you have no one then i will be there for you to all the friends i havent met yet i love you so much she looks like billie eilish and i love that i love how jack uses his influence to make the world a better place it makes me smile he says the things that i need to hear see this is nice and all but the problem is im too socially awkward to say the right things xd so this is just about as unrealistic of a concept for me as a fantasy game where people fly and cast magic thank u sean for talking and opening up about your struggles we appreciate you my dad says hell buy me my first dog if i reach 2000 subs in 2 days plz help a brother out bro this game hits so close to home i love it im lucky to have a support system but not everyone does so be kind to everyone for those who give unconditionally give a part of yourself but not all of yourself youll wear yourself out and wont be able to keep yourself going it may seem selfish but think of it like this the more you recharge the more you can help others it hurts others to know that you are hurting yourself to help them i cant words but i hope yall understand what im saying sean emotive powerful and therapeutic video comments green hair11 thank you for talking about etika he will be missed just watched the whole thing i absolutely adore this video thank you so much for making this video makes me think about a lot of things concerning life jack sucks milk out of bottle me whos gonna make a meme about baby jack 2800 it looks like frisk on hisher own soul anybody who feels sad dont be there are always gonna be people who love you and people who are ds stick it up their arses you are a better person than them and you will always be just dont be like them dont change into an f thank you soo much for being kind and caring i feel you are doing a wonderful job your community loves you sean please never leave youtube we all will have a fucked up life without you i hope you have the happiest days of your life before you leave to a better place i decided to watch this because of how beautiful the art is only to find an even more beautiful message im glad i clicked on this video i dont want to sound cheap but his is one of the most relatable games and videos ive ever seen ive been at that point in life before multiple time and seeing it represented so beautifully in a game and hearing a large influencer like san talk about this is truly inspiring thank you this gives me hope those last 20 minutes of this video mean so much to me because i also listen to those voices in my head that say im not enough and all but what you just shared with us makes me so much happier and i actually have motivation to work on myself now thank you i havent watched the whole video but the part with the roommate may reminds me of me and my bf the chats we have and all were a internet relationship things are going well btw about what were going through how we feel what we love and not it reminds me of us we always give each other motivation and it helps sometimes it doesnt but the other is okay with that we ask each other if we need to rant and if the one says no then wed be fine with it well just tell each other jokes and all we always remind each other were there for the other and so on imma stop typing now oops hi jack i love your videos please do more youtube i want to meet you one day and you are awesome and notification squads i hope everyone watched the whole things the game was great and what you said after the game is needed to hear for a lot of people who would have the nerve to dislike oh no this is doki doki all over again hey jackieboi just wanted to say youre not irrelevant and ive been watching you since 2017 and ive been fine and happy with how much you have been in touch with the community since then i love your content and love you as a creator thanks for your epic content and the stream yesterday peace anyone with an open and accepting mind are with you all the way its your life you may be a slight bit different but its still you and thats all we need hey you comment

again you might feel completely happy if you do great enjoy it and try to take a second to take the time to enjoy it because then maybe when you do feel bad you can at least remember the good times no matter how thick the clouds are there is always blue sky behind it and you dont have to try and go through the clouds in a straight line everyone needs to find their own path but try to remember try to know that the blue sky is there and sean you have nothing to apologize for im enjoying every single video and for me what i want you to do is to simply play the games and make the content you want to make because that way youll have the most fun and when you have fun your content is fun everybody wins you are awesome thanks sean like damn i just want to thank you sen just for playing this and making me think once again i have been there as well selfharm suicidal by now im six months clean and i still find the struggle of resisting but im managing i found incredible people in these past months and i actually sought for help so thank you for bringing attention to these kind of things and making us your unknown friends think about it this game was so sad for me it almost made me cry when i first played it where is the green hair jack you make my day your like a therapist i feel better coming out of the video then coming in thank you wow i didnt cry during the gameplay but i teared up at the and of the video because what sean said was so relatable and inspiring i felt that because im going through the same thing im feeling well i dont actually know justtired all the time

off ur my fav jack i wasnt sure if i shouldve watched this especially when i saw the bloodied scissors on the ground thats what i used so i was worried it might be a trigger i dont regret watching this video everything may described was exactly how i feel and it sad because thats how many other people feel as well honestly this did trigger me a little but thats because its just so real even so i dont regret watching this thank you jack for playing this im so thankful for angela he for creating this game as well rip etika man theres always someone to talk to my god i have gone through what may is going through not to the point of suicide or thoughts of it but i understand completely thinking every day is the same day where you just do the things you hate and repeat never knowing what you like to do or what makes you happy worrying about the future trying to piece it all back together even with writing not harry potter or fanfiction but you get it haha im slowly getting better but im glad that there are games out there that shine a light on this sort of thing 3 anyone else watch till the end we love you sen and we appreciate you you help so many people feel a sense of comfort

those people that loved to help everyone and hear there thoughts so i can give a spirit back but after this i see what everyone told me is true i need to have my own boundary and limit i can still

where i need to pull back on being out in the world where i should be with my family and plan my career as i just graduated high school thank you so much the day can be so bright for the world to see

everything the suicide thing hit hard ive had a friend attempt to commit suicide and its so accurate they go from freaking out one moment to almost at peace its scary i noticed that jack hasnt been smacking the camera and then yelling top of the mornin to ya laddies hey sean no everyone you can talk to us most of us and we may helpbut just to be sure and not take that chance of talking to someone that may make u worse talk to your family friends anyone you trust ive been throught it i regret not talking to a friendi have much more to talk about but it will get too clichethat word got

was so important for me thank you i love what you are doing with all my heart thank you sean this resonated with me in a way that i havent felt in a long time just thank you is it bad that i noticed patrick stump from the back of his head i love this omggg wellthat hit a lot closer to home than i expected i didnt even think to comment bc i forgot i got the notif and didnt just open the video

topic an individual video i honestly love the sean that u are now its crazy how many opportunities we actually have to help someone even a comment on youtube can help someone in need right if your someone who is feeling down or depressed or even thinking of some bad things talk to someone there are people who love you no matter what just reach out and talk to someone i watched the whole video it really is okay for you to take a little break or maybe like a week break from the internet and reflect on yourself people need that and you need that fuck all the people that think that you need to keep working all the frikin time take a break all the time that you need love you jack hi jacksepticeye sen well always be there for you for the last three years your kind messages that you put in

question but if i commit suicide will god let me in his heaven oryour scentive of this game this game is not for you i wish life was as game so i could load an old save and stop her really hit home glad jack talked about his personal experience with it because it helps to not feel alone in it always seek help no matter how much of a shitty situation youre in is it just me or does anyone else got the doki doki literature club vibes jack play bendy and the dark revivel and cool video our skin is like a white page but when we write on it we see that someone cant erase thire pain when someonelost himself to pain that is unbearable they will make sure to suffer in silent not letting you know harsh words can make you work faster or they can choke you at the moments were you need air lonely persons get kicked often but no one looks behind thire its ok fassade receiving no love is a deeper pain than any blade can cut no love is the most big pain that we even consider death to end this not physicle pain ps put an eye on the people you love fearselfhatedepressionlonelyness those are silent killers they like to torture befor finishing off love and care is the key to the heart of overshadowed individuals it literally took me 10 different therapists and 2 years to find the right person but im so glad i did im glad that i hung in there you are such a smart man you had me and my husband crying at the end of this video thank you for being so real play minecraft with felix aw manwe love you san i think thats how you spell it lol i hate when people say that men dont have

your content is amazing too thank you for this video it helped me so much thank you jack your hair is not green im not mad just disappointed sean with having seen all this video and watching you since 20132014 i believe you have truly grown and matured and i absolutely support even you stopping youtube if it means it will help with your wellbeing you are doing things right and dont think otherwise because people put you down for changing change can be hard and you can feel very insecure about it but it sometimes is vital for your mental and physical health i want green hair jack but im going to miss brown hair jack thank youjust thank youi really needed that wow shaun is going deep pewds played this too hey jack can you go back to putting the game name in the title damn sean that stuff that you said at the end really hit hard talking about how you sometimes felt like you dont have the right to complain in the position youre in i think about this all the time haha i know its not the same but i have great parents a great childhood amazing friends but i feel exactly the same way i know people who live in broken homes gone through abusive relationships and divorced parents and its like theyre doing better than i am mentally a really touching video and a really great message its almost nice to know youre not alone haha still fucking monetized where is the fuckin green hair sen get on it fuck this type of game again this is not good for me cuzz i have alot of depresion the first ending jack got looks like someting id do im only16 and i feel like i wanna drowning in the middle of the ocean jack i love you you are a hero what you are doing is so meaningful to so many people im sure youve helped more people than you can count you have made a change and youre channel is not dying its not growing at a massive pace which could cause in a crash and burn its staying steady and rising and thriving at a steady pace i thank you for helping me out of so many holes i thank you for giving me hope and happiness when i needed it thank you for so very much that i couldnt properly list thank you phone down head up i think this really helps the people who need it most if we had more people like this instead of the controversy that goes on i bet you the world would have been a better place 545 shiloh as the background music beautiful artstyle im already loving it i could relate so so so so so much with may i started crying at first i was confused because it was him playing a pre recorded game for about an hour and that usually only happens on a stream human brain is a stupid bitch c my suicidal thoughts have been so constant for so long i dont realise that its not normal that healthy people dont think like that i never thought id live past 2017 and im still there i wish i wasnt but the fact that im alive tells me that im stronger then i think jack wont say hi to me ive been doing it for years the antidepresnt is love wheres the green hair when i played the game and got the bad ending and saw that the girl hanged herself i started crying i know this is a game butthe problem is i tried to kill myself many times but i was a coward i couldnt let my family sad i still have suicidal thoughts but i always try to see the bright side of my life even if is a low light i still smile so anyone who is reading this message suicide its not the answer even when it seems like it your life will be fine you will be fine cause even the darkest nights have the brightest days so dont give up on something that some day will make you happy believe me i know how life can be hard sometimes so please dont give up on your smile and try to be happy at the max ive been there myself and lost my older brother through suicide its not easy but i know now that it does get better thanks sean for being open to talk about these heavier subjects cheers i had a point in my life where i tried to commit suicide multiple times and videos like this really helped me a lot and gave me the feeling that i wasnt alone now i am very happy to say that i havent attempted to kill myself in a very long time wow this this hit close to home ha gaaaaaay i love this so muchhhh i feel like doing what i love as a job would make me start hating the thing i love for a second i thought this was a video about belle delphine by the thumbnail weve been tricked weve been backstabbed and weve been quite possibly bamboozled thank you for talking about this sean as someone who has gone through this it means so so so much to anyone who is feeling these things i love you you are so valued there is always light im sorry you ever had any thoughts like that a lot of us know how difficult it is to deal with thank you for continuing to try and help people and being inspirational on days like that your videos can really help me sigh this hits hard because this couple months have been highly suicidal ive lost my best friends and nothing feels more alone than that speak about not knowing what to feel anymore and everything else is just gut feeling yeah sen i just want to say thank you ive may have not met you in person but your videos have always been there for me ive been down so many times but when you play games like this and talk about what its like going through this and having these experiences it makes people who do go through this not feel like theyre so alone anymore so i just

mom wants me to go to therapy but i dont need it im not sad or depressed but she wont believe me she says that im thinking about suicide but im not sorry to make this a sad fest but i just really needed to say this dude the second play was a really creative way of what happens in undertale for example with how sans knows every ending youve come across so far that dream was her remembering how may had died in the previous playthrough everyone ive talk to about my sadness always says the same thing that itll get better but waiting for it to get better just contributes to my sadness why should i wait to stop being miserable and even if i try to be optimistic and hang on to the promise of a happy future the world is dying and everything is just getting worse nothing its getting better why would my future get better do i even deserve a happy future i got triggered by the trigger warning shit the chat between our mc and may really made me tear up everything from the way shes feeling

talk at the end it helped me and im sure it helped many others for anyone to have thoughts like these i hope you have a good day and hope that you get through the darkness and laugh and everybody have a good day can we just talk about how may is basically me bad relationship with mother suicidal thoughts was never really pushed to do things as a child because they did things on their own without being asked so is kinda lazy and unmotivated at this point the only thing they really put effort into is writing too scared to see a therapistprofessional about their problems because finding a good one is so hard is passionate about writing and kinda wants to do that for a living but is too scared to because of the fear of not being good enough at it to make money is constantly tired and cant do anything about it because thats just how depression works doesnt actually know what they love doing otherwise theyd probably be more motivated at least towards what they love doing hates bothering people with problems because they just feel like a nuisance honestly just needs a fucking hug no high five omg youre such an inspiration sean thank you what jack said about doing what you love regardless of the pay really spoke to me all ive done in school and such is things that will give me a good pay taking no care to see if itll make me happy thank you jack ive already seen this game because i watched gloom play it but im here to see another persons opinions on the story this game breaks my heart every time theres that man bun i know and love anyone know the music in the background because its fire thank you jack for the message at the end i needed that today what would you do for a klondike bar jack giving some deep meaningful message and insight about life while holding his tears everyone including the 1000 missed comments why wont you die your hair green who else started crying when he started talking about his own experiences hey jackso this video is like what is happening to one of my friends but not like it like my best friend her boyfriend broke up with her and her first dog died and niw i been supporting her and caring for her ive seen this on steam and was debating to play it because it looked so beautiful then jack uploads a vid about it and now happy noises yes youre finally playing this game if jack reads this i want to say your so kind

gosh youre playing as billie eyelash billie eyeball bally eyeball bally eyelash thank you jack im going through a really rough time and i feel utterly alone i always feel like giving up i needed a little pep talk so thanks god i needed this advice thank you when she asked what may writes i jokingly said harry potter fanfic and i was right we came for the 30 minutes of gaming we stayed for the 20 minutes of motivational speaking if only i could get a gf just by sending her memes can we just appreciate how lgbtqia friendly jack is dont worry sean were always with you hey jack you can trust us if your down we will send nema to make you better jack is the best youtuber ever i always come here when i feel low and always feel better afterwards you dont get to decide when you cry sean decides for you when he plays a sad game 1419 is that a trans flag on the shelf behind the pride one the pure fluff is too much i was smiling constantly yes angela for your amazing game and the love you have for your artwork thanks sean theres a lot of us who are afraid to talk and knowing that even your biggest idol goes through the same things as you really means a lot thankyou xx being hypersensitive is suck im crying every 2 seconds w i willing to bet 200 that jacksepticeye has helped lots of people through depression with talks like the one he gave at the end of this video its amazing that jack can help that much 2448 when jack tells us that he was miserable and depressed and felt like he had no one to talk to and no one picked up on it seeing jack so close to tears made me

gayqueer woman its great the art is great the story is wonderful and relatable i love this this is a game am i the only one who watched the whole part of jack discussing his life jack i love the whole speech at the end and i relate on many levels im so happy you made that at the end of a serious game it hit me hard imagine needing to cry but holding it in because your foundation costs the equivalent of 20 shamrock shakes damn so many of my friends have stopped themselves from crying because and i quote i dont want to ruin my makeup and its so upsetting but i also find it upsetting because i get it like i get trying not to cry because itll ruin your makeup but it also hurts when the first words out of someones mouth after crying are does my makeup look okay does it look like ive been crying because weve been raised in a culture where its not okay to show that youre upset because you have to keep up appearances and you have to look perfect always this video has genuinely hit home hard as much as it seems im young and 13 is young i still fell like people just dont care im so bad at this life crap hell i cant even keep friendship which dont hurt them so i leave them alone i stay away from everyone but they come back and i dont what them too cause i know ill hurt them to care about me still ive gone through life and had fun for the most part ethier way i loved this video tell me im beautiful mother me yep thats me what else is new wait by depressed did u mean like miserable or actually depressed man you made me cry youre such a beautiful and brave person im so glad i watched this video ive played this game a while ago and it it home these kinda topics are not easy to talk about but you handled it so well im glad youre feeling better now and im glad there are

world to do whatever the fuck you want i love you regardless i played this a few days ago it has such nice art jack can you play kindergarten 2 please that game is the most beautiful true and touching game ive seen in a very long time i know people in my life like that and i know how i can make people feel like that its something we need to see more often to help the people in our lives that dont seem like they need it but deep down if they do to anyone having struggles in the life i wish you all the best oh shit i literally played this 2 days ago this game hit so hard in so many places it was almost unreal im really glad you played this game actually i found out about this game about a week ago and i love the message behind it that because of your decisions you could also safe a life i own this game but now im really glad i didnt play it i love everything about it but i feel more comfortable watching jack play it than i would playing it myself as to the negative feedback jack dont you worry youre doing great and theres no way your channel is dying take care of yourself dont give the community more of yourself than you can afford to take vacations love the art interesting that part of it was inspired by junji ito i did not want to cry t o d a y perfect music if anyone needs a supportive friend and doesnt have one hi i am now your friend message me at any ungodly hour and i will make sure to be there for you i dont care if its 9 pm or 3 am i got you you can rant to me for hours if thats what you need my advice isnt amazing but i try my best its touching i appreciate the we bare bears memes me reads title me oh no when your so early that youtube notifications dont even go off yet i wanna tell my crush who is 20 years old and im 14 and im a dude and shes a girl i wanna tell her i have a crush on her and that she is the first girl i had a crush on ever since we first met and i wanna tell her how i feel for her games like this are extremely important but although it may be sad its true everyone has those thoughts at some point you just need to find the right people to teach you that its not the way to go you are so special sean you have helped many people with talks like these never stop did anyone notice that his eyes were slightly red and teary when he started talking about depression poems remind me of some game called doki doki literature club we love you no matter what the speach sean had at the end hit me hard there is always someone there for you if anyone need someone to talk too im here for you this this this is a beautiful video much love jack its just you left me i think i missed this video for 41 minutes wtf i just watched another video for slav girl she talked about depression too thats an odd coincidence day 1 of asking jacksepticeye to play the last of us a few weeks before the last of us part ii releases yeah having to deal with someone committing suicide reallyits likeyou get mixed feelings and you justfeelempty in a way it hurt me and i didnt know what to do or say and i just wanted to explode it took a tool to my depression and definitely got memore confused and mixed up with feelings all the time its scary at times but i try to get whats done and thats all its hard jack i might try to go to get boxing lessons by jake paul i felt this on a whole new level this really hit hard i relate to may on an unhealthy level edit holy shit that scissors part hit really really hard 418 sadly it seems as though that the small negative events outweigh the vast positive things weve done dont let one small thing let you down as you know you are much much greater than it first of all i love this game so much because its beautiful second the music is so pretty i can tell that its shiloh dynasty right off the bat and that got me in such a happy vibe till it all got sad i know the feeling of losing someone like that hurtful this game was amazing thank you for playing the game and letting us experience

a boss and ill see you in the next episode today is the 2 12 year anniversary of my father takkng his own life please if you are feeling depressed or suicidal a seek help or talk to someone also that speach at the end made me cry love yourself most definitely not narcissisticaly just value yourself for who you are if there is anyone out there that are going through these things its not that i can

ago and what do you know 730 thank you sen for telling us that especially after the etika incident 440am over here got school in a few hours im sure as hecc gonna be tired loved the chinese pronunciation jack thanks for making me cry such a good game jack did i mention your artstyle is beautiful everyones here for you sean if you want to vent were here to listen omg i downloaded this game yesterday i literally found out about this last night and played it wow seeing jack cry had me tearing up depression effects everyone no matter who they are dont take someones social standing as a guise of happiness best game cause off shiloh when i put a j in the search it gives me jacksepticeye right away after jack finished the game why did it look like he was about to cry i recently played it and it was beautiful who else saw this when it was 4 minutes out you should play impeached its a funny flash game where youre the president and get to pick between two funny laws depending on your choice it will effect you economy i love you videos he gets 60 k views in under an hour meanwhile i only have 2k views with all my vids combined that speech in the middle was so emotional for me thank u sean i played this game last week and its really good where was the high5 in the intro i love you sean we all love you if we ever meet expect a big aussie hug cause you are not only a person but a hero an inspiration and truly the kind of person we all should try to be sincerely an aussie who gets it 051 everyone left the chat really touching game and the creator of it did such an amazing job with it really glad i spent the entire 50 minutes into watching this video it was really beautiful to watch to anyone out there who does go through something like that i hope things turn around for you and that you can talk to someone or find some way to make your life better this world does throw a lot of bad things at you but there is also so much great things out there so much worth fighting for i know its not easy but it does get better chin up and remember there is always someone out there who will listen and help you im watching this at 238 am awesome i like the music in the background because its shiloh dynasty and she has good music jack thank you so much this game is so deep the sean even started tearing up nothing else to say just wanted to mention that i love that while jack is still being himself he kind of mellows out for this kind of video its more serious and he seems to be making a genuine effort to treat it like that the chinese mother at 1549 said too cold why not im chinese btw wow this game is so beautiful i have the same thing with art i will always draw even if it wont make a profit but the best case scenario for me is if i can make my art make a living for me i love hearing you talk about these deeper topics because its like youre a therapist d love ya jack now this is the content im here for chill games that help bring out some great advice to go off on i know its just a game but still thats sad that she commited suicide wonder why she did and what caused her to i feel like she did it cause she didnt feel loved or supposed in her decision in her writing that she loved doing that goes to show you cant always tell when someone is depressed and just wants it to end it all and needs to be told and shown that they have a purpose a reason to stay in this world being loved and supported all the way and through the pain and sadness that they felt or feel still thanks for reading this video hits so many topics that i feel this community doesnt address much i always felt that there were things that needed to be said and you did it very well jack everyone goes through this sort of thing at least once no matter the intensity i wish you luck in the comment section if youre in this dark time yourself and always remember its change with me not change for me love the art style of these games so much really know how to hit home manaheh amy is may just with the letters in a different order jack you should play dont look back its short on coolmath and has a good hidden message its hard to say at first but is good so you can make it its own video or have it in a multi game episode the song by kina though mmm i hurt myself every day with a sissors i have 35 scares suicide becomes more common by the day cause of the stress that is put on this generation we should learn from this and stick to each other cause one day or another it could end we should think of our own business and not listen to people saying what we do wrong just figure those things out yourself and dont forget to take breaks its what keeps us healthy did jack just call tumblr gayi agree before i start this vid i wanna mention that the art is absolutely beautiful her art is amazing im glad this game supports the lgbtq 3 159 i want a goth gfbut also i ball of sunshine i dont know what i want can i have a shoutout please jack your my favorite been watching you since you had that old headphone lol love you jack no homo edit ik you wont see thisbut its ok now this is epic when you realize 20 minutes of the video is jack talking this is genuinely my life a distracted gay listening to indie music and being bored as cute girls send me memes uwu 541 do i hear shiloh dynasty in the backround i reckon its pronounced angela huh 2846 that fake yawn made me yawn its literally 1236 am here and i tried not to cry bc of this why would people dislike this wonderful video about real shit may harry potter fanfiction me cheers yes another person who writes harry potter fanfiction 153 a four dimensional shape is an object that has four dimensions heightx lengthy depthz and a theoretical w axis which is inwards and outward 300 hey its ice bear did anyone else notice the bloody scissors man the art in this is beautiful aww jackaboy dont cry i nearly cried when u did dont worry all your supporters and obviously septiceye sam are your shoulder to cry on the intro ive missed it sometimes i look at the clouds they look like a dick their art style is amazing if you cultivate love joy and happiness in yourself they will be able to flourish they deal in abundance so once they are whole in yourself they will flow through you and help complete others dont feel ashamed about doing what you need to in order to encourage that balance because you being whole and complete will help others more than giving all you have just to then have no more i hope that made sense and helped your hair is not green you lied to us dad this is so sad what happen to green hair u dissapont ur fan not me tho yay a pride and trans flag i need both to wear everyday xd 108 who is excited about jacks green hair my brothers best friend tryed to commit suicide it was weird because a day before that he and my bro went to play bowling and he was very happy that day he still doesnt want to say why he did it the worst thing is that my bro was there and prevented him from commit suicide but he lost both his arms and his left leg and now he seems more sad then ever because he cant do stuff like a normal 17y old if you have any suicidal thoughts call for help or talk to somebody if you dont have anybody to talk to go to some place and ask if anybody has time to talk and help you i went to my best friend to talk about my problems and he helped me a lot and talked me out of that and im more thankful for that if you read this i hope you take it serious and also take something from this sorry if my english is not good any thanks for reading this right jack do what u love in ur intro you forgot the hand clap wow i thought you will play missed messages i played this like two days ago and it was a wild ride for sure good stuff it sucks when people say they are suicidal people ignore them and when its too late they kick them selfs this game touched me props to the creator what is it with suicide and depression in jackaboimans videos guys i am kinda not looking forward to his green hair i mean its not like its bad or something gawd forbid no its just i think his natural hair suits him more this present him is more happy and more gladiatory him you are the most inspirational youtuber ive ever known i literally just watching this video already love it i like the artstyle but i dont get why the have to shove in lgbt stuff in our facethats not how you make people tolerant im sorry but i think its pretty funny that she called it a trigger warning at the beginning this reminds me of emily goes away 429 thats fall out boy who else now wants to watch night in the woods by jackoboy again d wow this game kinda reminds me of doki doki literature club in a weird way im so in love with this art style roses are red violets r not blue hi jack i got happy wheels i hope you stay happy in the wheel o fuck gay accepted protagonist instantly clicked off where is the green hair holly shit i fucking hate the guy who made this when

okay you always seem so happy just wanted to check up on you 3 self harm can prevent suicide i know it sounds counter intuitive but physical pain releases endorphins which can over power mental painanxietydepression while there are a slew of dangers around self harm those that do it dont want to die they just want the psychological pain to stop so be careful making those who self harm feel shame for doing it feeling bad about self harm can shove them to suicide these longer more emotionally complex games are by far my favorite content on this channel im glad sen produces a variety of different kinds of videos but these will always be the ones i keep coming back to his intro is slowly getting quieter and quieter where is the old jack old jack top of the morning to ya laddies 20152018 jack top of the morning to ya laddies 2019 jack top of the morning to ya laddies where is the high five sound and the energy man i only know u old when u dont do dat these are the kind of

thats cool hello fellow early people have a good day hope you have a day filled with fun and joy and happyness nice game i love this game the art is so pretty third first third bruh jus realized may wrote my immortal i didnt excpect to relate to anything in this game but by talking to may i realised i might be depressed im in the same situation as her opening my eyes every day in the morning just to face the same old routine and rot away alone in my room with no friends to remember me if i die im seeking help now but it just hit me a bit too much i dont know why i typed this here i guess ill just erase it later but yeah if anyone is the same please get help youre important and you deserve to live happily when i playd i called the polce and my game said dont call and it took me to the sceen ware you tart i was really curious bc i couldnt find a brave enough you tuber to open the door so ty for showing me i guess i dont know how to say this without being awkward about it i played this on newgrounds i understand how may feels i feel exactly the same way ive done what shes done and i plan on fixing everything soon and everyones lives will be happier i saw this game on stream and im like this looks like a really cool game plus its free and i wasnt disappointed but once i got that missed ending my mission changed from making a new friend to saving mays life i love this game so much i knew it when she said thanks for being a great friend i knew she was gonna end her life the soundtrack is beautiful i have a friend going through this stuff and it hurts me to know shes still hurting if anyone knows how to help her than tell me ill try everything in my power survivor ending is so sad including forgive and the normal one hope is the best one soundtrack tho needed more songs but all of them were bangers i just played this game it legit hit me hard i started crying cause i could relate this game is incredible i love it very much i just dont understand why may moved out in the end of survivor hope is the best ending jesus does may always have to die edit am i tthe only one who subconsciously hates amy d i love it but next time when u play a suicidal scary bloody game try put fun music so were not as scared 3 this is a opinion not a direct attack of comments xd d i wish i could play but i cant cause i dont know how c after playing it myself i noticed that you could talk with may about relationships and that youre actually into her too bad there is no ending where they get toghether in the end survivor and hope may survived this has was me last year wait also made by junji ito flashbacks to his work okay uhm im going byeee the music in the background is papithbklosing interest shiloh in the background really ties it together i just noticed the blood game girl opens door me aww shes cute who is she o may cool owo game dont come in room me o nuuu may me open the door open the door open the dooooooooor game opens door me o nuuuuu y u gotta destroy my gay heart like that me throws phone at wall yo this game made me cry like 2000000 times jack does the voices beder only 4 endings in so sad for such great art you the ending names got me thinking missed hope survivor forgive these can be put together in many different ways two of which really sticks to me hard right now she missed her hope while her survivor asks for forgiveness she missed her hope but she forgives her surivor theres two sides to that for this one the other one that stuck with me is forgiven and hoped missed and survived the past tense is me saying may lived for the better this is a really touchy topic but i hope what i said here isnt making light of any of these this game is really beautiful and i honestly enjoyed playing it thats weird your survivor ending is different than the one i got the black window said surviving day after day or something like that what i did was i found her in the bathroom but i didnt hug her what are all the endings i know survivor missed and hope 2223 oh for mine those werent the words they showed me ine was somewhere along the line of survive the night and blah blah blah how come ur ending is she told you about the blizzard in all my endings may just writes a note to me about it she never speaks about it i unlocked missed first then hope then forgive then survivor survivor was hard i hard to try for it twice i got goth gf amy to call me a useless lesbian xd i also got the option to confess to may but shes a useless lesbian too so she didnt get my message i think i got this option when i tried for survivor also has anyone ever told you you sound like megan mccarthy and i like her voice so that means i like yours lol did anyone notice that when may told her her name she said it was amy but then it was called may this game had me fucked up after doing all the endings i had to do the best ending with may like 4 times to make me feel better 247 why is this scene darker than usual your voice is so soothing and calming i wish there was more to this i have been both of those people before description to get the highest quality playthrough play on steam httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp812810missedmessages itchio httpszephyoitchiomissedmessage a romance horror story about life death and memes a shift in perspective can change everything there are 4 endings warning contains mentions of suicide and selfharm kongregate there are 4 endings theres a part where u hangout with may that u get a new slide of her face in a zoom if u pick different options while talking to her recently my best friend his name was gregory well uhm he killed himself he seemed so happy but he kept everything inside it was a ball of sadness and anxiety inside him until one day he just ended it all of course it still bothers me but im glad hes free from his sadness i remembered when i picked up the phone to his brother telling me what happened it was the worst call ive ever received dont swear i thought it was good im just not gonna comment the truth when i saw her cutting herself it reminded me of my girlfriend i was trying to talk her out of it but i never told her how much i love her at that time now everything is getting better luckily really awesome game its killing me to find the song from the game though the one with the acoustic guitar and singing if anyone could help me find it that would be awesome just imagine someone suicide next to your room and her voice playing in your head singing a cute song for you and imagine you had the opportunity to save her thats what i like about this game a very well put together piece of art that speaks in a very sensitive topic a game like this is really helpful of how should one handle such situations and understand how the possible outcomes of different choices can have such an effect on somebody whos struggling within themselves all it takes is a listen and understanding thank you for showing us this malice but what about option c we just kill her wow me and my edgy jokes hey miss you stuff played the game before your video appeared in my notifications and secured the hope ending on my first tryreally goes to show that angela he can tackle tough subject matter in an interactive and approachable manner with her gorgeous watercolor artwork so idk why im saying this but i had a friend who cutshe would cut her arms and no one noticed that she didbut me and a couple of my friends started to notice thisbut by this time she was badshe started getting better because my friends mom got her helpthree weeks later she was found hanging on a swing set before churchi knew she was cutting but i didnt helpbut i have another friend who is cutting she lies about themshe says they are from her aunts catand i really need to help her im not crying its pepper spray may is honestly me wtf its kinda worrying relatable features we both have 1 she has nothing that she enjoys other than hanging out 2 we both write but have no hope for it 3 we both try to get a job our parents would be proud of 4 we both look out on the world and feel trapped 5 we both dream of people dieing literally every day 6 we both think of suicidal thoughts 7 we both dont have people to talk to unless they talk first 8 we both feel sick and angry when our mom talks to us 9 we were both good at everything when we were younger but now lag behind 10 both of our parents yell at us for playing games 11 we both like harry potter fanfiction 12 we both get tired in general 13 we both feel like everyday is the same but she ended to the point of cutting and committing suicide so ummmmmmm i hope thats not whats going to happen to me edit i am legit scared thinks of sayori noo why sayori that was sad i was laughing all the fricking time i didnt think i would be crying this vid but here we are in my situation it isit really is i havent seen or talked to my mom in 10 years im 13 for the sad ogs did you here losing intrest you matter you dont owe the world anything you deserve love treat yourself like a human like you would treat others you wouldnt want other people to make themselves believe horrible things about them so dont do the same to yourself thank you for being here 2010 cough cough 50 shades of grey cough bijuu what happened to your hair edit oh wait this was last year amy may coincidence i think not why do i have to be so sensitev to sad things even the song made me almost cry you making me cry what a beautiful highlighter message for everybody if you find someone who have this kind of problems talking is one of the best thing you could do ps sorry if my english is bad its not my language at the end of this video is why he is my favourite youtuber 2808 the face in the mirror youre awesome bijuu mike despite you thinking that some of the stuff you said was cheezy or whatever i am certain that this video and alot of your other ones have saved some lives the fact that so many people look up to you they listen to what you say and im really happy you are putting positive messages out there in the world everytime you do a video like this i end up tearing up during them but definitely in a good way it makes me think about what i have in my life the good and the bad and makes me realise exactly what you said that there are always more good things to look forward to then bad thanks man and keep doing what youre doing i watched this after i told myself in a failure for letting my cat run away and my mom mad and late for work and this helps me so much thank you bijuu mike anyone else see the trans and lgbt flag when mike said the the world needs you i started to cry alot yo wheres may at ill read harry potter fanfictions with her harry potters the best first of all what you said was inspirational at the end i actually cride to be honest because my old friend passed away because she just felt lonely at home because her mom hated her and called her ugly so she thought about alot of suicidal thoughts sothe person reading this if you think about suicidal thoughts just remember suicide isnt the answer this game really hit something in me its really connected with me for me i have alway listened to my mom and for the last few years ive been going through life miserably but just last year ive decided to sign up for screenwriting class and i had to fight with my mom to go and it was the biggest decision of my life and if i havent made that decision i probably wouldve died by now to be honest that time was really dark for me man or more like those five years before i signed up for screenwriting class was the darkest time of my life but now i finally learned i wanted to cry when i saw the part where may committed suicide may is the roommate right this is going to sound clich but this video itself was just very touching and it made me cry a few times especially during the end depression is more than just sadness i have a friend whos depressed and she was my best friend or so i thought her i and another friend used to hang out all the time at lunch joking and playing games but one day the other friend turned on me for no reason eventually we grew to hate each other the other friend constantly talked to my depressed friend i feel like the other friend was telling my depressed friend to be rude to me because she turned on me and so did a few other friends my depressed friend said that i followed her around everywhere and that i was so clingy but i was only doing that because i thought we were friends i guess not i feel like that other friend made a few of my friends hate me out of just being a jerk she probably never thought of me as a friend anyway i got pushed away and some days i get to sit with my this was truly an amazing gameplay i know some youtubers are afraid of doing games like these cause its too controversial but i find these gameplays really helpful i love this game i love this channel i love your other gameplays too i find it really amazing how you can actually express your feelings i really like that thank you for another amazing video i know this was months ago but games like this get to me since i think these kinds of thoughts on occasion thank you bijuu mike thank you so much for everything mike ive been in a really bad mental state recently and your little monologue at the end really hit me thank you for everything 3 im in a situation similar to this i feel all depressed and i would hurt myself because my family doesnt believe id make a living at writing ive even gotten to the point were i stopped writing even though it was literally the only thing that kept me alive i stopped because i didnt even care if i lived or not im only still around because i have good friends who love my writing and push me to stay strong and continue to write i still struggle with these problems but things are getting better for me if i can change you can too ah i love fanfictions i write them all the time about my favorite animemanga my favorite novels my favorite games favorite moviesseries but no harry potter jaja is like a spanish laugh i think bruh im really not sure youre so inspiring i love you and your channel man this made me cry tho so the person you play as is gay and transgender rainbow and transgender flag nobody notices the transgender flag anyway cool i cried at the monologue youre a better parent than my parents i cant be happy in 35 of 100 because i have big crush on one girl and asking her on date or just going out with would be bad for me because she would reject on 100 and tell everyone what i asked her so my family wants me to get good grades and im fully capable yet im constantly hidden away and not doing anything and i feel like its necessary to be perfect look perfect and act perfect nobody other than the readers of this comment know this bijuu mike is an amazing person alright he makes all these videos for us with a smile god bless you bijuu i hope youll be okay when youre not sometimes the greatest advice we can get is from a youtuber hey bijuu you should play theres this girl may singing sounds like a 9 year old girl i write about nalu fanfics harry potter but gay sniff do i smell drarry owo this hit me hard especially when i played it ive lost a dear friend called maya to suicide overdose he had various reasons his breaking point being that he lost his boyfriend in a car crash and continuous bullying for being homosexual etc he never deserved it and even though he is gone i still feel bad for even exploiting these details but there is some justification but not even the half of it i am sure that had disheartened and corrupted him by the passing years previously as it happened i partly blamed myself for not being able to message as much as he wanted me to our friendship was longdistance its unfortunate that i couldnt attend to him i was too busy to attend to him but i also have forgetfulness due to didmpd regardless i felt absurdly guilty for a long time but like he said its not any of our faults he was just sick of life being like a soccer game where as hard as he tried to strive for the goal he kept on failing and it hurt him this is kind of how me and my friend are she is like may she even likes writing i love you bijuu mike i strongly feel that you should have as much subscribe as pewdiepie you deserve much more then 2 million even though that is a great need to be at i still think you should have more lol i love hary poter bijuu mike plays you left me and missed messages me still waiting for him to play theres this girl also by angela he and is free and on android thank you bijuu mikeive been feeling extremly depressed latelyi know ur probably not gonna believe me when i say thisbutive been bullied for my entire life and childhoodits a long storyit means alot to me about what you do for us allthank you so muchi know ur probably not gonna read thisbut i just needed to thank you for your kindness and support who elses loved that the developer pit in pride flags if mike wasnt a youtuber hed probably be a therapist you only know what is best for you someone is always sad to see you go happiness is knowing im going to see you again i care ill listen im not good at talking to people because i judge myself immediately after what i said i dont like to see you cry friend maybe the only one besides school 2 let me know your plans tonight i wont let go till we both see the light i have nothing else left to say but i will listen all day friend please twentyonepilotsfriendplease i want to be there for you art style looks like theres this girl from angela ho so many people commit dedfrom the singer of linkin park to aviciito etika all i have to say is thank you mike i think youre right out those tipes of things the game have 2 more ending forgive and survivor bijuu mike i know im a month late on this but i need to explain this to you you cant simply say go against your parents in those situations because it isnt possible to do it you wouldnt understand it because you were raised by your sister but i should tell you that parents are typically very powerful even if youre an adult that doesnt mean youre free from your parents especially if youre financially dependent on them for college which is true for many i would even claim almost all college students that may not have been true years ago but it definitely is now at least in the usa if your parents pay for your college tuition then you cannot say no to anything they ever say or else your career will be ruined since they will just not pay it anymore and in fact even if youre not dependent on them they can still ruin your life relatively easily because they know you too well this is especially true with chinese parents and notice that theres this really nice game made by the same creator of missed messages called theres this girl it is a really nice game and although its short its really heartwarming im confused you look and sound like gacha mike so either youre the same person or his twin barley anyone disliked this video compared to the like which means you really connected and this video was inspiring honestly i loved the video i am going threw a hard time myself so i am glad to hear some advice to how to try to deal with it this was a nice video thanks man love the end of the video the art style in this game is pretty realistic compared to doki doki literature club the suicide scene wouldve been a thousand times more creepy if you hadnt censored the bad parts my depression wouldve skyrocketed i really cant handle these kind of things madoka magica is so good have you played the new game as soon as you said the game is free i paused the video and downloaded it for myself and started playing it i cried man that shiz hit hard and i have to say that was the most beautiful and meaningful game ive ever played tbh so play the game its free harry potter you should play a game called theres this girl i got i gently open the door vibes from the beginning of the vid 2011 is that why the harry potter fanfiction i was reading stopped updating me watching the ending im not crying u r dont cha mean monikalouge i get depressed because im very sensitive typical female ya but when that happens i cry when im being told my opinions are wrong then i realize im me is me dont need to care what others

mode 1953 i write percy jackson fanfiction lol i love the artstyle so much she is hispanic because in spanish the j make the h sound so jaja means haha i played this game on my moms pc too i didnt like it though i teared up a little cause may is way too relatable im literlay the same as may jaja is like a latino word for haha so she was laughing its always been interesting time in my life i was rather sad today and the idea mike was talking about with social media i actually deleted my youtube channel in order to stop caring so much about watching every single video cause i was actually one of the og scrubs a couple of years ago when mike started his yandere simulater videos back then if i am honest i didnt actually have a lot i had two loyal friends who are still with me today and my mother i adore but even then i wasnt satisfied i had no reputation no one to really talk to mediocre grades and i lost motivation to learn new things or get a proper job with my past traumas haunting me everyday while i was empty i thought about it i didnt need to live i mean only three people at most will mourn me for a while everyone else would make a silly post about how i meant everything and then forget about me but bijuumike helped me want to live i use to comment on every video and laugh really hard at all the sil if youre reading this im giving you a virtual hug i felt is words in my scrub heart if you want to play a game like this than please play i woke up it is a good game about one night stand thank you bijuu mike i cant possibly explain in a simple comment how much your words mean to me i want to watch the ending if this video over and over and again because its helped me so much so thank you for saying what youve said im this video this whole video had me sobbing i played this before you did haha wtf i just played this game without even knowing you were thank you for this speechi really am about to cry i actually always have thoughs thoughts and thinking that i want to commit you know what but thank you for doing this video mike you probably helped thousands of people who think about this a lot thank you 3430 i started crying so hard when you said that i airdropped a picture of monika tposing to everyone on my church bus thank you bijuu mike for all your kind and encourage words it inspires me about life more i just looked for etikas channel i feel so bad for him also for those who are depressed and feel like they cant do anything do what you love and if you have no goals in mind for an occupation maybe become a therapist since you have experience with depression or anxiety someone should make a compilation video of all of the wonderful motivational things bijuu just said i will listen to that every morning when i wake up better yet an entire channel dedicated to all of the motivational things and pma shared by our beloved youtubers just let me know when one comes around my goal be a teacher broooooo thats so funny i played this game like a month ago it was so goooooooodddddd i dont know how i feel about this video i started to feel lately like may but i shake it off most of the time i literally fainted in the middle of the supermarket and i think it has something to do with mental health when you walked into the bathroom and may was there and she was doing the naughty cuts and she turns to face you look in the mirror her reflection was interesting bijuu mike looks at sky we live in a society god this game really hit me hard i wish i couldve watched this video sooner but i just wanted to say thank you bijuu you made me cry there at the end with your kind words and advice but seriously even though you may not know it your videos have made me happy and have made me laugh i have grown as a person just by watching your channel because you made me realize that i dont have to follow my parents dream of who i should be or anyone for that matter i can be my own person and i can live doing what i love i can have a purpose so thank you bijuu you dont know how much it means to me 3 what 35 terrible people disliked this video bijuu the therapist i feel so inspired by what you said here it made the bad feelings i had disappear you reminded me of all the things i shouldve appreciated throughout the bad times you truly made my eyes tear up with your monolog and on social media these days you are the type of person to inspire others to rise up and protect those who belittle themselves when they have so much more to live for and for that you are the type of person that children like us children like me need and i thank you for that you have honestly lifted my spirit and gave me the confidence that i needed to keep trying as an mentally challenged smart and talented young woman i am to stop thinking the bad part of things and just start living life the way i want and can you have truly lit the spark my flaming soul needs and i want to thank you for that thank you bijuu mike for being there for us for me even though you may not understand all the troubles that goes on in our individual unique 720 i saw the gay and trans flag yes queen lol me and my friend pranked someone on the bus by airdropping these boys a few seats back like they were messing around and airdropping people so my friend changed her name to fly like an ostrich and started sending memes to them we were people known for being timid and shy so they expected a friend of theirs to have sent it lets say they nevee found out it was us who else watched gloomkassie play this is so cute but also so sad jaja is haha in spanish the translation probably messed up i actually remember when i was a freshman my friend was dating this guy and he had gotten my number because she called me off his phone and around the time they broke up we started talking casually and talked for a little while but the stopped talking for about a year when he called me one day and he didnt sound too good he said he was surprised i answered and said he was having a hard time and needed someone to talk to so i listened to him talk about for a couple ours mostly just listen to all of it then we started talking more and about a week later he told me he was glad he called me because he tried calling so many other people and they either ignored him and said they didnt wanna hear about it but i sat and listened even know we hadnt talked in a while he also said because of the fact no one was wanting to talk he was very close to commiting suicide and all he needed was that and he was thankful for me me and my friends legit wrote fanfictions like crazy in middle school lol naruto fanfics those got kinda weird sometimes vampire knight ouran high school host club homestuck hunger games before the movies came out magcon and i also wrote friendfictions basically fictional sinarios involving my real life friends i played this game before and thought it was yandere simlator lol hey im a couple days late but thx so much for the things you said in the video i myself am still healing from depression and suicidal thoughts and i related to may a lot but even though my depression etc will come back every now and then this video really helped me push it back farther keep doing what youre doing mr bijuu mike its really sad cuz a good friend of mine id known since middle school im 22 committed suicide and left a note similar on the door for his roommate just a couple months ago and its really not something id wish anyone else to ever feel we use to talk about stuff a lot and we both have always had issues mental health wise and i still wish there was more anyone of of could have done for him always keep an eye on your friends especially the ones that joke and smile the most mans turned into a psychiatrist on me bijuu mike if you guys dont watch madoka magica you need to go watch it me are you trying to give everyone depression hey thanks so much biju mike i really needed to hear that ive had problems in the past and what you said really encouraged me all that i want to say is thank you you really are an amazing person is it me or does that door look open inside and out at 2719 bijuu mike said jackas fbi breaks down the door it isnt easy to not listen to what your mind is telling you the voice in your head doesnt stop until it happens or someonesomething pulls you out it keeps telling you to do it whether its drowning yourself or slitting your wrists with your nails personally ive already been pushed of the cliff with no rope theres only a patch of light even then my legs are broken i love horse ridding and id love to get a job with a horses but i only started horse ridding 5 years ago and ive only been going one a week and not even every week and ive never owned a horse either and then i look at all these people who work and own horses and theyd all been around them theyre whole like and theyre all so much better then me and theyre all so healthy and im over here like a potato just wishing ill be good enough i love you mike my sister almost left us and even tho she is just my stepsister i love her and she almost left me i love her too much to lose her i cried and cried and cried for days thinking that if she went i probably would have too i know how many people love me and want me to be happy but i cant be happy without her thankfully she got out of it and is now going to a therapist thank you for being here and helping me it may not seem like you had an impact but if my sister took her life i would have taken mine and i might have even done it before she took hers if it wasnt for you you are so funny and kind and you do these speech things where you inspire everyone watching i love you thank you omg you are amazing i am dealing with a lot in my life with my family i feel may i feel you you make my day better every single day thank you bijuu mijuu for being positive and helping me i dont care what any mad mom says you are awesome i hope this comment makes you as happy as you make me thank you my favorite scrub oh no by youre not stalking you right now this is way too relatable i almost cried i missed you left me game so much and i also loved this why do i relate so much with may wait oh no any one else realized natsuki in the background so i guess she saw the 2nd person that was hanging dead is it all really in your head me being myself will probs forget that sooner or later depression feels like a cold shadow watching over you you will get times where you randomly feel like giving up but i honestly couldnt it like i dont want to stay in this world but i cant give up what i have i think i want that room i know that this was not closed 3 days ago but i just want to say that we all deal with things when i was 6 if i remember right my dadpassed from a stroke and i was really really sad bijuu mike i just want to say thank you thank you for making videos that make my day i really didnt know whether to say this or not i didnt want to waste your time and im not even sure if you will ever read this but i want to say thank you you may think that youre just being yourself and speak your mind but i really did feel like you spoke to me as cliche as that sounds i myself write fanfictions and i try my very best to hide it from people and to those who do know about it i try to make sure they dont read it because im so ashamed of it i always feel like im never good enough i constantly compare myself to others and when i do i realize that im so far behind that ill never be as good as them that i can never even dream to be on par with them no matter how much i try to climb up the rank to at least get a glimpse of what an amazing writer should feel like i always fall back to the bottom i always put myself down even up to the point that i wont believe any compliments ever given to me but then you made me realize that i should love i am sorry i cant leave me phone its the only thing can make me happy i love this video thank u im depressed and im always going to be depressed but bijuu you make my day this is are last good bye mefixes blanket bijuu mikewhat about what we seed yesterday you sound exactly like pewdiepie i just got ur messages i thought it said mystic messenger welcome to the therapist bijuu who else saw the picture behind him on the wall everyone is gonna lie to me c thx bijuu for not scaring me with the seen with dead bodies x3 may sayori she isnt but it reminds me of her life lessons with biju mike this is really heavy relatable stuff i cant live without your videos the game has four endings if depression strikes talk to someone about it it doesnt matter who it is dont keep your burdens inside you try to help yourself i cried because in the end i felt like you were talking to me now i admire you more than before youre just too kind and understanding im so glad that i found your channel i really needed this wow that message at the end you really helped me i am no longer afraid to achieve my dreams happy blush emoji why the hell do people keep playing this game i cried bc i feel the same way it goes to close to me see you later boi see you later boi maybe never im actually surprised that he opened the door especially after all that ddlc oh my i love listening to these kinds of advice from bijuu it really makes an impact on me i havent cried this hard since jorgen died in pewdiepies minecraft series im sorry for joking thats how i cope with sadness look in the mirror at 2814 why did i think of natsuki this is very inspiring we all need to thank you bijuu mike your message at the end really helped me thank you my mental health is pretty bad my mental health after the video hahahahahaha lol you know bijuu is serious when he says jackass and goncy keeps it in 0 i definitly didnt cy at bijuu mikes inspirational talk at the end thankyou for being awesome bijuu mike you are amazing thank you i really needed this video today i had the big cry this is such an emotional video especially near the end i was already about to cry before this so lets see what this is going to do i am really unhappy with many things and i have so many problems i really want to talk it out with someone but i only have 3 friends and i cant trust them even though i know them since 910 11 years i am not able to trust anyone people call me an attention seeker for this but i think ill end everything i dont have anything to live for i actually feel better about myself after watching this no im not a drama queen but after my dad abandoned my family a couple years ago i feel like im not good enough that if i was better maybe he wouldnt have left i know thats not true but its hard to believe im worth anything when my own father didnt care enough to stay and be my parent to everyone and anyone who sees this please know you are worth so much in this world and to your parents no matter how old you are you should tell them you love and appreciate them so much my mom and i have become the poles on which each other are held up and i love her so much ill stop ranting now haha but dont ever forget how amazing you are god loves you even if youre not necessarily a believer in him and thank you bijuu mike for giving me a little more happiness through my crazy dark life the big gay is me though i wanna make a comic or animation or something but i cant draw good enough and im bad at writing i even have characters made up and ready ive wanted this since i was 11 and in 18 now but i cant omg bijuu mike swore on my christan minecraft server what is the other characters name may andwho i dont know whos etrika but she sounded like a good person i can relate with may so much i feel the same as her i really do i hear stuff and see stuff that tell me constantly to do you know but if she was real or who this was based off of is okay now im not okay yet but im getting there for all you guys that are like me dont give up not yet not until you get help i hope your lives get better i love you all u u i spent wayyy too much time on that lol wow its so weird hearing him say ass bijuu mike is being really inspiring and mature and then 3644 happens my mother dreamed to be a doctor but my grandparents wont let her to so she became a translator till this day she regrets that she didnt go against them but she supports my decisions no matter how ridiculous they are i am writing anime fanfictions since 2015 and it helped me just sooo much with creating stories on my own and give myself the courage to start writing an own story my dream is to walk through bookstores in the future and see my books laying there that would be awesome just do what you like no matter what anyone says about it i was going to cry what you said is just the greatest thing ive heard ive seriously considered it when i was a teen what if but could never see myself actually go through with it thinking to what limit would i have to reach in order to contemplate suicide wholeheartedly and in the meantime scared for someone i know that might go through it wo me knowing how to help and bad at connecting with people the way this game portrays may makes it even more chilling to think about i saw gloom play this and i cried tt i saw gloom play this game and its quite sad but gives an important message hey bijuu i just want to say your the best i saw some of your cameo commissions and you make some of the best on that site you are definitely my favorite youtuber depression and suicide is a serious problem but sadly many others have it the first one and consider or already have done the second one i remember a youtuber saying that one of their viewers mother said that youtubers cant be sad and thats honestly the dumbest thing ive heard someone say being on youtube isnt like being in a shoe they may seem happy but they do have problems etika is an example of that and not only did he have problems but he also decided the best way to take them away was to take himself away bijuu made me cry pulling out the etika card this game is so well done and people are always hurting comfort is always the best and bijuu you help me through my problems if people need help give them the help they need just know that you are loved and everyone deserves love i had a few of my old friends commit to this i cried watching this cause memories pop up but its ok i miss them dearly and love them so much i wish i could have seen and or done something to help but i couldnt should have listened to the warning at the begining heres a heart for everyone who needs some happiness or anythinggg c 3454 not a cuss word donkeys arent cuss words the ad for dis vid is for a harry potter game this hit me hard on a personal level in so many ways the we bare bears meme thank you for the video i honestly havent been able to think that deeply in such a long time youre an underrated youtuber that deserves so many more fans for the amazing messages you give thank you for what you been doing i appreciated your words bijuu thanks i played this a couple days ago y e s sometimes the most extroverted and happy people can have the most to hide bijuu its the same for me but with boys and since that moment im too afraid to confess to one thank you so much for the ending talk i feel inspired more it taught me a lot i honestly agree about the phone thing but i also think that the positive outcomes of social media out weigh the negative ones social media has helped me recognize my passions and has also helped me get out of dark and sad places like you have helped me feel better so thank you even those who smile brightest are the ones that need to be helped i cried a lot but thank you i needed that i feel like too many games have to do with topics like this and it is sad because a lot of people relate to this and not enough people have someone to help them thank you for all these messages ive been in that blizzard before and was partially feeling it while watching this what you said truly hit me i was cri thank you my dad calls bijuu a loser and says that im not spending my time in a good way by watching his videos at my age now that hes too childish but it makes me happy and makes my day watching him hes funny and a lot like me and positive and kinda inspiring so even though he doesnt like me watching him and his videos i still do because i enjoy it ehehe this just got really weird 2810 the mirror thank you for this my best friend and more is like may i try to be there for her buti forget sometimes and it makes me feel like a terrible person watching this reminded me to be there for everyone and for her when she is one if the most important people in my life so thank you for bringing this game to my attention really thank you honestly this is probably the most touching video that youve made atleast in my opinion ive been going through some bad things and you and your channel is really helping me i want biju mike to be my therapist bijuu mike what you said was beautiful okay to make this not a cheesy moment ima say yee haw im sure no one will see this but thats okay im just ranting to the void at this point i just want to say that i related a lot to the points bijuu made when he talked about may and her parents i myself have been pressured into studying a career that i dont like and have no interest in i feel just like may does when she said that writing doesnt make money because that was drilled into my head when i was younger i was told that id never live well if i pursued my passions which as a person with many artistic interests it really hurt im not a science person im not a math person ill never be interested in being a doctor but its what my parents want theyre looking out for my future but all its caused present me is anxiety and misery i was really depressed for 2 years and even if its gotten better its never gone away i almost lost it last year i almost didnt make it out of 5th and 6th grade a few years ago it was rough and it still is e mesees thumbnail mikelooking concerned meya its about suicide isnt it bijuu we all just have skin and bones and poop o ma god xd your monologue made me feel a lot better thank you i highly doubt anybody is going to see this nor will anybody care but thats alright im on an alternative account to protect my identity however thats not what im here to say i really really just want to say thank you to bijuu that monologue at the end of the video was the most incredible thing i have ever heard a youtuber say to their viewers i have been feeling down lately there are so many things going on in my life that at one point i had gone blind to everything good that is around me everything that made me content i was just existing mind you i am feeling better than i was at that time so no need to worry i have my friends and my family however theres still that little ball of sadness inside of me that i cant seem to shake this isnt about me though this is about bijuu and all of his scrubs that might be feeling low right now it is astonishing that bijuu took the time in his life to talk to us and tell us that we mean some hears shiloh is that really himher ive been waiting for this i love this game so much and i hope you love it tooooooo wow amazing game bijuu mike the hit my so hard this game has so many meanings behind it it make my cry thx for making this video your a best bijuu mike bijuu mike the motivational speaker lol but your words actually inspire me a lot this episode really got me hey mike thank you for everything you do for all of your fans you are such an inspirational guy ive been needing that kind of reassurance that i can make my dreams come true and that i can always get back up after im knocked down im just an anxious selfconscious autistic teen who is embarrassed by everything and struggles with everyday situations feeling very insignificant your words about having hope are helping so much and now i feel like i can pursue my dreams when im an adult i hope you know that everyone here appreciates you and you give us hope that things will get better im very doubtful that you will see this but if you do have a lovely day and same to everyone else that comes across this bijuu react to peekaboo mv student council yandere simulator your in it oh plus you might get copyrighted sooooo ya lol i tweeted to him saying he must play a ddlc mod yesterday aka tuesday 2july and he has natsuki in the background like wtfudge its kinda like funny people they can make u laugh when youre down and lighting you up you up but they never want u to see them down and

sayori from doki doki literature club you left her hanging i have this girl who bullies me to the point of me frequently thinking about suicide shell hit me pin me to walls call me things spread rumors tell teachers on me for nothing take all my friends follow me everywhere get other people to hit me push me off of chairs in class and so on no matter what i do im afraid and i dont want to go to violence and hit her but ive had many thoughts of bringing knives to school and stabbing myself in the head in front of her so she can see what kind of monster she is and what she leads people to i also have had visions of stabbing her but i would never do that kind of thing and i know i wouldnt but i love my family so much that i dont want to leave them im crying writing this comment and i know shell target me tomorrow because its my birthday hey guys i missed your mike here i started out writing fanfiction now i write my own stories and im happy with myself surprisingly my parents support

left me and missed messages have the same lore i remember sayori for the suicide and how sad it is not even a single doki doki joke referencenot even i gently open the door but the game art looks gorgeous tough this is probably appropriate to say here i once before told you in the comments about how bad my depression was you probably dont even remember and you told me that i can get through it that made me cry a lot but in a good way because that made me really happy and as we can see im still here all because of what you said i didnt want to leave because you showed me that things can get better and you helped me with that a lot youre really the only person that makes me truly happy everyday and youre also the only one i really have left in my life wich sounds sad but i dont really feel like i need anything else youre really caring and thats what i really love about you long videos i have to save to playlist please react to this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwjo3hv0vxq i will donate

lovely words bijuu sad girl reminds me of sayori someone i really love deals with depression and you sharing this meant so much to me thank you so much truly mental health is such a serious topic if someone has depression its just give them pills medication isnt a quick fix were afraid to talk about feelings the true deep feelings no theyre not fine we need to talk this social media is in fact a antisocial media i played this game it really is an eye opener sometimes your parents dont know the best for you ive literally seen gloom and jacksepticeye play this game before but i still watch this video because i find you entertaining frick yee windows op mac is kinda racist bijuu mike just cursed holy shit this is the first time i have heard you swear bijuu 2000 oh my goodness this made me smile so much i enjoy writing fanfiction but the only people who know are my brothers and im pretty sure they think im really weird for doing it i dont think im very good at it though and i would love to learn how to improve but im too scared to show it to anyone mostly because its all angst and whatnot so this little speech really touched me because its something i really love doing im sure i speak for all the other fanfiction writers watching this video when i say thank you bijuu mike i have struggled with depression for years when it got really bad i would resort to cutting when my mom died everyone i knew would keep monitoring me in the fear that i might completely crack for me when my mom puts pressure on me i get dragged down but i go to my best friend to let it out and she ends up sending me videos or images i could laugh at or if i feel like being alone i watch videos i enjoy thats just how i cope with it since i cant go outside all the time v you say that i sometimes gotta go against my parents because theyre not always right but my parents keep telling me that its a sin to go against older people because apparently they know more thank you bijuu this was really inspiring for me and made me feel a lot better dont change cant wait for the next video thanks for saying that all of us are special you might not even see this bijuu mike but thanks my kitten was ran over this is a perfect video it includes something i would want to do to those people who killed my cat i want to get rid of them im sorry please dont bother looking at this this video is honestly so inspiring thank you mike i cried at the end im going to watch cute cat vids to cheer myself up i am earlier with playing this game than jacksepticeye and bijuu mike i am so proud of myself i finally

attention she observes yess not to be racist but most asian parents pick for their kids it is forcefully done thank you for this it really made me think of not killing myself and it makes it better i

rambling on so heres a free cookie what happened to playing angels of death this is really sad honestly putting time and effort to do something but you think its not helpful in a way really triggers

yourslots of people dont realize what happens to people off screens earlysquad you should do the star sign challenge when it tells you your info it says your star sign search up your star signs personality follow what your star sign would do in the situation see how it goes httpsyoutubes5jzrnoofs back round music link before i better have crippling depression after this after i feel bittersweet so i guess ill take it great now im in that mindset again the how do i put it sayori like mindset i think thats the best way to put it in bit life try surrendering at age 0 did anyone see the rainbow flag in the background signs maybe in related ive watched laurenzside play doki doki and not you but i watch all your doki doki modds and other doki doki vids lol am i ok i liked le part when you said i didnt even remember i likes other parts to tho omg ive been waiting for you to play this game im in love with it j a c k s e p t i c e y e u p l o a d e d the art and lesson is really beautiful if anyone is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts please get help tell someone its hard to coment on this video except by saying if u are sad tell someone any one and they can really really help u yknow there actually been times were ive wanted to slip and slideprobably not the best substitute but its the only thing i could think of but then i would think of what my mom would used to say she would say that they although she would be sad for the families why not the person that go just get help and the people did it just to get sympathywhich is just stupid of her to say so i didnt do it because didnt want my mom to see me as weakwhich is was and still am or an attention seeker ive tried to ask for help i just havent been able to oh my goodness writing this made me cry im sorry new ddlc mod reccomended beep beep here yee here yee bong bong heyyodeler its called doki doki salvation and itll sweep ys off yer feet unless youre uncomfortable with seeing a suicidal monikaaaaa then in that case ya might wanna take a step back bijuu boiii not gonna lie the game seems kinda cringe but theres also some good memes im struggling with why zoomers are so depressed im depressed i knew lots of depressed people in hs my ex girlfriend was depressed it might have to do with the removal of the religious underpinnings weve had for centuries similarly it could be the decline in social cohesion it might also be the seemingly addictive capacity of phones and computers especially with videogames being as drawing as they are it might also be some things that im not going to bring up because they arent politically correct and people dont take too kindly to such concepts which probably compounds the problem if someone doesnt figure it out were gonna have a real bad time you should play theres this girl its realllyyyy good and im pretty sure they have the same creator the characters look super similar and the dog plush may holds on to is in theres this girl to i find his channel very offensive and i reported it i do not want my 12 year old girl watching this get rid of your youtube channel or become kid friendly you do this only for my money you are very greedy and deserve to be shut down my friend works for youtube and will shut you down you are terrible i appreciate the fact that the game said big gay i dont mean that in rude way i just mean they made her so open about it plz dont attack me omg i have played this game to the 14 dislikes are just amy on different accounts being triggered that you left her for may dang i love that game no one me is your lip ok 1642 it breaks my heart that so many people dont think theyre loved my moms bff committed suicide when he was in 11th grade as his grandpa owned a gun store and he took one of the guns and shot himself in the head my mom was friends with him for 10 years but he felt like he had no one he felt that he couldnt change the person that he had become so he committed suicide and it breaks my heart i wouldve loved to meet him he also had a picture of my mom buried in his grave with him react to the video insanity by dolvando please their profile picture just had to be grizz

bookshelf 3and last shove all the anime and manga novels that you can fit in therethe more the merrier people i want to write stories but im just starting out with gacha now because its awesome to mess with well i would like my problem to be not that bad but then i realize my life has been shrouded by death i wish i didnt think about it but i have suicide thoughts about everyday and this point i have a plan but i saved it for a day i cant do it anymore i really wish i was different but when i was 10 2014 my mother died of cancer then my greatgrandmother died who i was close too and finally my grandfather died last year my step father left us a few months before my mother died and my biological father died in prison all these deaths have made me fell numb and antisocial ive tried dozens of antidepressants and therapist but nothing works at this point im at my lowest and i dont know what to do anymore i guess im subconsciously crying for help to no evale thanks if you read this all i dont have any phone numbers and no friends thats why i have depression mays parents are the stereotypical chinese parents aka mr and mrs know it all bijuu mike your amazing i couldnt think of anything to say madoka magical is like the second anime ive ever seen intact its on netflix mike go against your parents bit life mom intensifies hey ive played missed messages before just yesterday actually why did u die your hair just aunt to know at is so i agree madoka magica is good just watched it yesterday and homura can definitely relate to monika on some levels and the demented aspects also fit funnily enough i stared watching it because of a game called battle cats that did a collab lol i once wanted to kill myself bechauce i bullied a girl who wanted to commit suicide i wanted to kill myself after i realised how stupid and messed up it was and this video marked me think about it and it maked med sad omg congrats on 2m subscribers bijuu mike thank you so much thank you for showcasing this game for me and everyone here this really means a lot to me advice for the people right before i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes i thought i was depressed love yall scrubs but uhhh dont be depressed check if you have diabetes before being yknow bad thoughts after my sister saw this video her writing book was an my desk so i looked in today i felt happy when watching a youtubers video it was not preston it was bijuu mike he understood how youtubers make you feel happy and that when life gets you down it will get you back off singing off her name i love the videos where you share your advice and deep monologues youre really inspiring and you are seriously my favorite youtube we love you too bijuu mike youve really helped me if any of you out there are feeling like may talk to someone please i know like how may said she didnt want to bother anyone but i talked to my friend and my parents found out and i talked to them i felt better somehow i just felt better just one talk and my bad thoughts basically went away i dont know how long it took but eventually and soon they went away if you feel that way please oh please talk to someone you know will help you in a way shame on the 12 people who disliked this video does anyone keep hearing phone calls in the background it keeps confusing me xd motivational speaking it was harry potter if harry was evil gay and promiscuous we found her everyone we found the author of my immortal tara gillisbe was just a pen name ive actually seen this game played before and i knew exactly what was gonna happen i didnt feel it as much though i think its because you read it really fast lmao but one thing that you didnt mention which i personally think the game was trying to help get across is to read the signs in this game the main characters roommate was acting strangely but the players first instinct is to ignore that and go explore the rest of the game which leads to the roommates suicide theres this weird thing that often happens with people right before they go to commit suicide they get really happy i forgot the exact reason why maybe it because the end of their turmoil is fast approaching but psychologist warn people to look out for this sign in people that are depressed i think overall something similar to that was really well reflected in this game my point is the game isnt just trying to make a statement about mental illness its telling the player that if you pay att 111 i relize she he is gey and transgender your speech at the end was so beautiful biju thank you so much you are such a strong person and you make me feel strong when im feeling down i struggle a lot with sadness and there are nights that i cant sleep because i feel so sad broken and lonely but a way i can cheer myself up is watching one of your videos because i can hear someone elses voice besides mine and you can always make me laugh and smile thank you biju i feel that to my bones that right there got me wheezing xd thank you for playing this game bijuu mike maybe you wont read my comment but this game gave me hope and not only that you inspire many people here and you also inspired me thank you for always being there for your fans and that you always keep them happy this is the most reliable video on youtube i just want to shoutout to everybody who feels that way suicidal i have been there and i am really glad that i held on because life did get better for me its important to find your friends or someone who will support you or cheer you up it really helps this has been a recent endeavor for me and in hindsight im glad i stayed you will be too this video went so deep and really is amazing to see remember that no matter what you are loved it is amazing to see people grow and change it is hard to keep up with your old friends but in the end they sill be there for you not your cooler more awesome friend you need to be there for you friends too i know first hand that your friends can be tough like i said it is hard but it is even more hard to see them suffer and hurt you need to do everything in your power to support that friend and keep them feeling important i would be heart broken if my friend was to die i know you would be too so please take time out of your day to help that one friend who needs you the most you might save a life being truthful im always on the internet and my fantasy so much i forget about reality not sure if this any way depressing or not but theres more i just dont want to share 3451 davids mom is quaking brothis is so relatibleim only 14 but i have gone

and i have done nothing so far but then i remember that im still young and have so much life to live i just hope i can make a difference before its too late actually this exact thing happened to one of my friends she always dreamed of being a game maker her mom didnt really except that she would get mad anytime she would even mention games one day i asked if she wanted to come to my house to hang out when she came we sat outside and talked for hours then she told me all of those thing her mom would do i loved that she could trust me with it but felt bad inside for her i told her that her mom couldnt control her life and what she does she told me how hurt she also felt when her little brother almost always had to go to his room not knowing what is happening outside the room i told her that i cant do much but offer her to stay anytime she wanted then i got up and hugged her soon after she started spend the night almost any night i was free when i wasnt she would stay at her aunts we started to get really close and we would tell almost anything to each other then she told me her feeling about me told her mine then i aske i love the lgbt representation in the game saw a trans flag and a rainbow one finally a game ive already played i feel so happyand sad cause that game made me cry i hope i wasent the only one to see the gay and trans flags in the room thank you may is the new sayori hey can you please do a complation of angry mom emails like so he actually does it plz bro what you said was really touching man its so true and relatable and just really speaks to me and a lot of other people wow you actually cursed in all seriousness thank you for taking the time to talk about this i have two things that happened to me at my school we have to try out for choir every year and when i tried out last year i was sick and didnt make it and my choir teacher didnt want me in choir anyway because i apparently didnt sing good enough but this year i had the chance to be a real singer and be successful i bet my choir teacher felt dumb and i found out i was a contortionist 2 years ago and no one i knew thought i could be a good contortionist and be able to do a lot of contortion because im self taught and now i can do almost every trick so i proved them wrong 2002 omg harry potter fanfiction me too well i wrote when i was 10 ehuehuehuehuehue bijuu mike talks about something deep seconds later we are all skins bones and poop continues to talk about something deep oh yes i was waiting for this bijuu if youre hiding your depression please dont kill yourself we love you 2808 look in the mirror just look i read this as mystic messenger the best people are always the ones who hurt the most yo mike what happened to your lip manit looks busted this reminds me of ddlc im so hyped justsayori lol my friend was in a verh deep depression to a point where she was harming herself she just started i think but i would not keep my arms crossed and let her do this to herself i went to the nurse and they talked to the councelersorry if its spelled wrong in which they later talked to her it was so hard to talk to them because i was afraid of loosing her as a friend but i would rather loose her while she is alive then loosing her forever no matter how afraid you are or how small you feel in someones life you are wortg it and if you are trying to help a friend out go ahead you can be the one setting them free from the heavy chains they are tied to thanks for reading this and sorry for the terrible grammar okay but really though bijuu mike would be an awesome father edit sorry lol that sounded creepier than intended theres 4 endings but one is a headache to get oh madoka magica emidietly looks at screen madoka puella magi madoka magica is my fave anime twt i remember when my best friends stopped being my friends they made me so happy and always wanting to get out of the house and see them it was their energy that made feel good we were a trio i called it the three amigos which was fine i was being naive and made a statement that i thought was nothing but one of the three started to hate me along with the other one i remember when the three of us would always hang out at lunch but i was alone and hurt they never wanted to see me or be in the same room with me we went from the three amigos to dos compadres i named myself a lone wolf because i am always alone looking at the spots where we all sat now i am not a person who crys but that they were a core to my feelings and emotions i wish i could go back in time and undo my mistake and be the best friends we were then your peptalks are so inspiring thanks you gently open the door this youtube video made me hug my phone i understand what may is going through even though i sometimes i try to end my life i just think is it really worth it am i going to show this act of weakness to the world i can show everyone that i can be better just have to let it go madoka magica is basically one one deaths smh gasp he cussed thank you bijuu i am a scrub that is well not always happy 229 jaja who says that people who know spanish as a first language that was so beautiful and deep i appreciate the censorship especially considering that i almost downloaded the game yesterday and 1000 wouldve been triggered that last minuteandahalf was so touching never stop what you do bijuu we love you that art tho i can relate ive been struggling with depression before the time in which my mom died a few weeks ago after that i realized that the reasons why i attempted were stupid and didnt know what to do now if i succeeded i would have missed out on indicoso aka the best week of my lifeim also trying to do what my mom would want me to do im not going to share all of the details but she was the best person that has ever walked this earth next to jesus i miss her so much your videos are amazing i really enjoy them and appreciate your words about this issue you are probably my favorite youtuber thx damn bijuu you made me cry at the end jaja is supposed to be haha just for you to know depression is not a good thing i gently open the door you are so inspirational i look up to you so much thank you for some reason this game is giving me strong doki doki literature club vibes how did sayori get in a different game i played that game but i tf was pretty boring and the even the beginning was too sad that game is sad to me because i see the scissors in the bathroom because she hurt herself im crying out loud because i always am sad when something like that happens me sees gay flags oh my god this is gonna be good yeeeeeeeeeeeeee what did you use to write about harry potter fanfiction me as big hp fan i love this girl like what may well if he was evil gay me i love her even more omg we have to save this women and we did my friend wrote a fanfic about two of her friends and the guy read it and had to go to therapy for two months she still feels really bad and says shed have a mental breakdown if she read it again it was that scaring even tho people look happy they could go through something that they do show and if u have a friend that starts acting weird maybe you should talk with them and have fun moments just know you are amazing no matter what ppl tell u the message at the end hits me hard but ive never felt those feelings but i have many friends who dohave and now i can show them something that can possibly help them thanks angela he the creator of this also made a mobile visual novel thing called theres this girl and its so cool the pride flags bijuu says gay rights all of my friends movedthat being one person so im lonely now at around 30 minutes into the video i had to take a break honestly this game is amazing but it really hits you like a brick in the heart i cried for a bit as i can relate to may a lot mike you really do make me feel better your videos make me laugh and smile i just love them i always watch them when im feeling down and i always feel better when watching your videos just please know i love you i love you so much never stop what youre doing the first thing i noticed is that his lips were bleeding okay who was cutting onions i always feel like my day is the same as yesterday omg im close to crying this warms my heart i ship may and the girl if i were the depressed roommate i would not like the choices bijuu made to talk about he chose the worse options every time no hate i knew you had the best intentions besides its just a game but dont choose those options in real life my eyes literally watered at the end monologue thats why you can watch thomas sanders intrusive thoughts video seriously tho watch it jaja is like haha but in spanish i know this because my mom is spanish and she texts a lot in spanish the more you know yes finally some else without an i phone all my friends have i phones el james wrote fanfiction and look how that turned out this made me cry so hardlike im dieing this video made me feel so much better about myself and so happy thank you 3 wow i can really relate to may in a way but listening to the way you think and talk about this it really makes a difference in the way i think and feel this game is very relatable to the way people think i love how you give your views and thoughts on topics like this it really helps people such as myself so i know this might sound cheesy but i really appreciate you being real in your vids as well as hilarious your words really help a lot of people they really brighten my day because honestly life is hard but even a small thing can change the way a person thinks and for me honestly your videos really and truly help me just getting through the day but anyway scrubsquad thats going way way back ive had depression since 2006 my parents got a divorce and i lived with an abusive mom tried killing myself in 2009 and again 2 years ago i am 26 years old born may 11th 1993 now i am on depression meds and i have been depression the free for 2 years this game made me recognize struggles in my life ive been crying for the past week i played missed messages about a week ago and fell in love with visual novels altogether love that you read each morning to get inspired i do bible devotions in the morning talking and praying with god is such an important thing for my soul my spirit my mind and heart for anyone struggling you are truly not alone god hold you in this time you have given me more life advice than my parents have and i listen to your advice more than the advice my parents do give me ive been basically raised by a random guy on the internet who has no clue who i am please notice me scrubpai i saw a trans and gay flag in her room in the first scene did not mend to say that hey youre sed a s mike opens the door ah shit here we go again also i suggest you make a new series where you discuss a certain topic topics like depression or addictions or other problems and whatever is happening around i am greek and theres a greekcypriot youtuber who does this kind of series uhaul is company that helps you move mike what happened to your lip did you get hurt im actually gonna kick the people who disliked this vid v this game slightly freaks me out dont ask why xd i relate to may alotive had suicidal thoughts and ive self harmed but ive gotten way betteri figured out school is the thing making me feel that way but i dont know what to do wow bijuu the end was super deep i never expected a charismatic and fun youtuber like you to get this deep thats pretty cool plus he said jackass mijuu bijuu youre an amazing youtuber and we appreciate you a lot thanks for being an inspiration to everyone we love you back i have been in the same boat i suffer from depression tried killing myself two years ago when i was 24 years old four weeks my family was arguing everyone was angry at me but i have been depression free now is the main character trans i saw the flag in her room the art style is ugh im crying when i played this game for the first time i got the good ending where may lives but they dont stay together and may moves out this game is really deep i love it a lot and i got all the endings this game is a sooooooo good and the art is sooooooo good tooooo i am really inspired by angela he right now bijuu mike made me cry lol it was so relatable damn this game hit way to close to home which i know isnt great and not that anyone cares but im trying to get help and support sorry i just had to get it off my chest early idk anymore just monika before you even said the creator of missed messages was also the creator of you left me i thought of that gamewhen you showed us the title screen i immediately thought of you left me3 if someone ever tells you they have thoughts of suicide never say you understand 1 it could make their mind think that their problems dont matter on top of other reasons just dont do it i really needed to hear that thanks this is why i watch your videos when im depressedbecause i dont have the guts to tell my mom about my depressionbut you give me a reason why i should stay another day i just wanted to say thank you aww your always so inspirational i saw the tittle and image and already started crying goncy played this then jack then mike im always interested in seeing what people say about these things jaja stands for lol in spanish the door felt heavier than usual oh no great game i play this game can i please be scrub of the day you inspired me thank you bijuu mike completely off topic but when are you going to make another tribute to your twin brother hey i write harry potter fan fic sooo can i get that jobbbbb can i be scrub of the day omg im so glad you played this game sry for this serious comment by i know people who are like this and i always make sure im there when i can bc even though they might say theyre ok ik sometimes they arent thank you for playing this thank you for the message at the end i really appreciate it your own mind is your biggest enemy it was very sobering for me to watch this video because ive been in a similar position that may was in and at the time there was no one there to reach out to me and comfort me and i just couldnt bring myself to ask for help i was not kind to myself its been a long hard road but im here 6 years later after it became almost inevitable that i had to reach out for help still while im not always alright i have to remember i am not broken gain the courage to speak up and ask for help even if it takes awhile but please if you are suffering too hold on i cant promise anything will get better immediately but eventually it will mike is right the world needs you you are special and theres a place in this world made just for you and only you i actually started watching you with yanjerry sim i loved your personality so i kept watching every time you give advice or something it feels like your not talking in video its like your on a stage especially because you put yourself in a place like your just one of us wich makes it even more like your talking to us its not just saying it you mean it i love your videos i hope i see more i read the description thats so nice descriptionsquad gethelptoday whwn i played the game thw first time i ignored the goth girl xd i didnt know this happened until i watched glooms video is it bad that i almost started crying when he said its not as bad as it seems honestly bijuu mike is so amazing he always makes me laugh smile and just be happy in general hes so positive and he has great advice mike if you read this thank you so so so so so so much play her other games theyre amazing this game made me smile and cry this is absolutely beautiful i played this game a couple of days ago and i won it was really sad but fun sees how you gonna get the door hmmmmmm lemme guess a sayori sees dont open the door ah poop it did and btw in the bathroom may did the le hurty on the arms i saw a smolders bit of blood coming from her hand ahh you finally played it i love missed messages sksksk hey ive been watching your channel for about 1 or 2 years and this year ive been kinda depressed but your videos always make me smile or laugh and when im sad i just watch your videos i love this game so much this game reminds me of doki doki a lot but luckily there is a good ending in this game sayori you know yuri the you know natsuki an adult figure that is supposed to be an influencer just bringing you down mc you are oblivious about who is suffering in the beginning when you send take u break i literally started singing take u break from hamilton jaja means i think when your laughing or you just want something to stop its a spanish word this was made by angela he right i love her games so much the artwork is so beautiful this game reminds me of how stupid i wasdame lol i been watching pewdiepie minecraft and the pewdiepie part was so funny slow it down and go to 103 1542 1649 2216 2336 words of a wise man with a bendy shirt gay is ok so is straight too i just wanna say i love you i have a macbook air and thats like so weird aww i want this for ios also have a great day c but i enjoy watching your videos and i watch them on my phone 2726 go watchplay danganronpa if you want something similar to ddlc ahhhhh the character has my flags in her book shelf i helped save my friends life from listening to him and supporting him through what he was going through i read the title as mysticmessenger somehow and i was like holy wow the last part meant a lot to me and changed the way one how i look on life and how i look about myself and i feel really inspired and i feel a lot better i hope it can stay this way this actually sorta hit home for me too because i recently realized that i am lesbian and my parents are really traditional so im scared to come out because i dont know if they would accept me or not i really love the art style and themes in this game and i feel that i can relate to may in my life but i am recovering and am better thanks for the advice bijuu mike hi bijuu mike this feels like the right video to make this comment on ive been following you for over a year now and your videos make me happy a lot when i first found your channel i was actually in a really dark place of my life i was in the process of coming out to my family and a lot of life stuff happened and your videos became this really great light in my life you became one of the reasons i woke up in the morning every day id make sure to wake up and log on just to watch your videos its a bit cliche but in some way you actually helped save my life youre so funny and you have so many great things to say and you just really helped me during that time and i know its weird but honestly you and your videos have a special part in my life and im always so happy when you post a video and im really glad you make videos and that youre always there ive been getting help so dont worry of course i just thought youd like to know that youre one of as soon as you started about etika i may or may not have cried i recognize some of the background music that was playing my actually devices help me it helps me vent my toxic environment i live in is my main source but for some people i can see that being the root yo did you bite by you by your lips i see some blood are you okay the description is correct youre not alone youwillbefound i can sorta relate to mays life exepct my parents would let me choose my own path anywayi sorta relate to may cause i like reading fanfictions and i even been trying to make them also cause i cant really find anything else that im interested in but i do need to find something cause i dont think i can keep making fanfictions for the rest of my life one like

digital art and getting inspiration for writing stuff im less hard on myself 2348 my life in one sentencejust kinda bored of doing the same thing everydayi want something newsomething i didnt know somebody could do in life i had censored word in game a year ago but i made a yt channel and new friends and they made it all better your arm is not a paper so dont cut it your body is not a book so dont judge it your neck is not a hanger so dont hang it your life is not a movie so dont end it this comment is clich but its true 2003 1010 would read the fanfictions she writes haters back off p who else watched this with jacksepticeye before the last part made me cry it means a lot thanks you erika really needed helpi wish i was a fan but its just sad i just want to say how much your videos mean to me this video you gave us a message and it hit me really hard but it made everything im going through seem less horrible ive been a scrub for a long time and i comment but this video and the message you conveyed it struck a cord in me and may have saved me from myself thank you mike so much for all your hard work and the amazing things you do its incredible this vid struck my heart thank you mikewe love you tooxx this is such a heavy topic and all i have to say is think of your memories as rocks and your mind a backpack if you hold all that in itll be impossible to climb the rock of life right why show sayori but not her i dont cry a lot whilst watching youtube videos but this video made me ball especially at the ending thank you bijuu mike thank you so much anyone else notice the trans gay flags in the background this video was so heart touching mike love ya dude you are so awesome i have dreams that still lie in the ground i have goals that is still collecting dust fur i have so much knowledge that is being held in confinement depression anxiety ptsd praying for a broken bone sharp objects blind me daily loud dubstep sound of negativity deafens me this is my daily routine friends more like eff you people they are more acquaintances to me i push people away and i just stay home going out is a struggle and i have no faith in humanity family members i cut out half because they dont get it and they wont listen my only friend is my imagination and it has been there for me ever since i was a child who do i turn to my own devil that consoles me like nobody else 500 clicks off video i write fanfiction but i dont wanna publish it because it would get copyrighted what you said at the end about suicide stopped me from it thank you so much im now trying to get help but also thank you for making videos i watch them whenever im sad and it always cheers me up no matter what im going through you are amazing bijuu thanks for helping me cheer up 1044 that killed me the monologue literally assaulted my feels i am currently crying in the fetal position cry cry httpsmyoutubecomwatchvqv5hascliw you make me laugh so much and you seem like a really good nice person and so i made this for you you dont have to post it 2102 i died there 1930 a bit off topic but look at that thing thats tied around her neck who you callin pinhead ill be honest here i dont think ive encountered a single youtuber who has played this who hasnt had an inspirational speech at the end of the video i know that depression is an important subject but with youtubers it often gets overlooked or youre just supposed to just get on with it i love this game because of the impacts it can make just by being a game about depression messages are often better understood in the form of a game that dives head first into the whole narrative of being depressed and not to mention the game developer already made another game that also touches on heartache and depression so that helps to i gentally open the door thank you bijuu mike for his video it really helped me because i have been going through things similar to may and ive been so unhappy and this video it just it just helped thank you may whyre you so relatable tt especially during hope hhhhhh i love it its just a blank background with a natsuki poster slapped on it fun fact antidepressants just give you energy not get rid of the depression lots of suicides actually happen because it gives you the energy to get up and ya im not sure why i shared i just read it in some comment section i suck sorry ill leave why does this remind me of you left me he has boo boo on lip yeah thats my life i have to deal with my parents everyday and its getting to a point of not loving themim 25 years old and im still living with my parents and im becoming miserable jaja is like haha in spanish just for further reference im in a really dark place and while you were playing the game i couldnt help but think about myself i have severe depression yes i had it diagnosed by a professional in that field i didnt self diagnose and these 6 years that i have had it have made my life a literal heck and i cant tell you how many days i have contemplated suicide and this makes a lot of sense sometimes the people who are going through something like this are often the people you would never expect to have depression so maybe one of your friends who seems the happiest may have depression or contemplate suicide or they are actually really happy in which case thats awesome mrmike i noticed how much yhu knowand i wanted to know if yhu could give me advice on somethingi dont wanna say it in this commentif yhu do see this pleasehelp me aand if yhu know someone that could help please tell me thank you actually when people write spanish they dont write h they actually write j so when the text said jaja they were saying haha in spanish i relate to may so badly no one has saved me i give up i really love the message at the end of the video thanks bijuu omg i love harry potter im obsessed with it now im crying 2728 are you hecking kidding me madoka magica is my favorite anime of all at a point in life i felt like may lost and felt like nothing until my friend came and helped what phone do you have mike tbh your message at the end made me cry idk something about it touched me any way love what you do im so thankful that your here in this world god bless you forever wuuuuuut you never played missed messages psshh im not supposed to give my opinion but it might make you sad just try it out yourself and its free so thats a great price if the world needs methen why dose it torture me to be real your the only reason why i am alive mike other that my family thank you very much this was out for awhile i played it myself why just upload it now my grandmas going to make me do something instead of use mybphone all day the first thing i noticed was the trans and pride flag lol why must you break my tiny heart whyz damn this is content if youve already seen jacksepticeye play this were on the same page so depressing and a lot of talking about life two of the worst things i was shipping them the entire time its really cliche but proceeds to tell me something i never heard before who is the dislike i havent finished the vid yet but i have a feeling if you dont go out with the other girl that shell commit instead did angela he make this it looks like her art style maybe im just confused edit oh wow i recognized her art style i guessed i knew she was talented glad she could pull off something as deep as this thank you for your incredible and inspirational words it really hit me in the middle a lot it put me in tears but i felt lighter so thank you the music is so chill i love it to be totally honest bijuu is very inspiring he may seem like just a funny guy who plays games if youve only seen a few of his videos but there are several out there that have him giving great advice that has really made me feel better about my life i open the door ah salad here we go again thank you im the one who said to play this d this game was masterful and its message was strong thanks mike for walking through it with us noice art style boi yesss this is my favorite game thank god hes playing ittttt try not to cry i just played that this morning wth im not crying theres just ninjas cutting up onions next to me i can show you the world 426 she pulled a sayori on us what roung with being gay pride month just ended birdbox dies if you go outside and look at the beauty irl gets peacefull and sometimes helps

please take my advice and react to the gatcha life mini movie living with vampire brothers episodes 1 2 3 4 and 5 you will love the charecter leo and also instail amino it is a great app and there is doki servers and it is a way to talk to fans im crying im actually fucking crying were you talking about in the game you didnt have and iphone or real life if real life what kind of phone do you have that shirt reminded me that yesterday i made some pg bendy fan art we love that pg fan art for me i dont have social media and some of my friends say there jealous of me to not be into that big whole of social media is a blessing for me thats what my friends sayi dont know social media just sucks form what ive heard about it reallyshowing how someone is at disney land while youre at home too poor for thatits stupid i just dont get the point is social media and i will never do it till im forced which apparently im going to be cause to get a good chance at getting a job i gotta have social media stupidest thing ever but hey i cant change that instead of being a romance visual novel this game focused on helping a friend with depression and im happy is this related to me ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh after screaming for while oh this is a nice story that intro tho dat chocolate hair tho these are the kind of vids im subbed for its so sad heck yeah frick apple dang this game is awesome i love the

you never notice how big a change everything you do makes you could die because you ate ice cream last tuesday or you could win a million dollars depression is the one thing that no matter what you do it could be caused you could have the best day of your life but it could give saddness everyone tells me that im good enough and that im amazingbut it goes in one ear and comes out the other life feels like a never ending tv show as a distraction from the inescapable death depression makes you feel worthlessyou blame everything on yourself and you think youre existence is pointless the more scars i leave on my wrist the deeper my depression goesjust like my cuts i cry for help but im not heard when youve fallen in a forestbut theres nobody around do you ever really crash or even make a

missed messages i am first first ayyyyyyyy im crying rn love youuu third yay first finnaly please like also millecutefox0 wants you to react to a video i was just playing missed messages i got this and clicked so fast 4th d early early finally another vid i got first comment endings 1 834 2 3624 3 4056 4 4305 i dont recommend viewing them using this method but i understand that a 46 minute video from some random dude on the internet isnt exactly appealing to most so i tried to link to a point where i think it covers the most vital bits of each ending thanks for checking out missed messages with me as i mentioned in the description games like this can be a bit tricky to cover as i can never know what any one individual is going through and if something like this will end up igniting something good or bad so if you just want to voice your thoughts or feelings feel free to do so here im not exactly the emotional support type myself but i do have eyeballs and im capable of reading and understanding anyone who responds to any individual negatively rudely or attempts to make them feel ashamed for sharing will have to answer to me and from what ive heard thats not very fun there are of course more profess whoever disliked this can get yeeted i can relate with may thinking of what would happen if i took a knife and plugged it into myself what would happen would anyone care and would i regret my decision but i know that there is someone who cares but theres still the thought i dont know if i should talk to someone im scared to i know i should its just so scary to talk about shheez you read this text like you are in that game or the narrator thank you no one ever opens the door i wanted to know idk why but i need this game honestly the artwork and the lighting were all very nice and cozy and the music is something i can imagine myself jamming to yes but lets be real those things dont matter all that matters is that sfm shrek is in the game as always great video waiting for more thanks for this video ive had a hard time especially this month i tried to prepare myself for today but ended up breaking down and decided to stay in i felt like i had failed today as it meant i missed my appointment and uni watching your vid is the only good thing thats happened today so in a weird twisted way im glad i stayed in so thank you cant wait for the next game you play whether its like this or something else like a horror awesome game i was in position of may maybe still im nothing makes me really happy just wating till the death my life used to be so pointles so empty im glad i meet one great person that changed everything she show me what also could life be how she saw life and now i just living for her i dont care if im happy or feeling pain the important thing is that she is happy if i could not be happy i try my best to make sure that she will she give me a reason to live now i living only for her if she dies that me too no other reason to be there we die anyway so why wait im still sad from the world around me but she makes it better she is more like me i dont feel that lonely again i know many thing like really a lot i spend my life behind pc screen colececting informations thinking about life i never had normal childhood i never played with others never wanna be with humans at all i just wanted to know what is life why im whats the point beying here in this thoroughly enjoyed the game in case anyone needs the name of the track its just another day this is the best audio in a game ever theres a subreddit dedicated to the game posting memes and talking about shit rmissedmessages to whoever that is reading this i hope your dreams will come true and i wish you a happy life take care just insane game i really felt something special i was defenitly not ready never seen befor thanks for this game and his songs shilohs songs always are the best they look like james and jessie from team rocket the song is losing interest and you can get the whole soundtrack just by typing missed messages soundtrack i remember finding out about this game and instantly falling in love i deal with depression and i have constant panic attacks and being able to hear the calming music from a game that hits so close to home always calms me down omg this is so relaxxxxxxxxxiiiiinnnnngggg i love it and the game of course too one of my favorite music its full of feeling morphine drip flow this song feels so suffocating but in a good way this is really bringing out nostalgia vibes rn i gently opened the door i love this this actually helps me relax when im sad andor frustrated i love this so mush thank you for making it thanks so much lol ive been looking for this soundtrack everywhere this song is probably losing interest could i use this music for a video that im thinking of making dude once i opened up the game and felt this fucking lofi gust into my ears i knew i was gonna fucking love it doesnt help that may is the most beautiful person in every panel she shows up in like damn okay i really wanted to save her but couldnt this song is so amazing thanks i subscribed btw remind me of a song but i cant remember it i went into this

call 911 or your local emergency number its hard to deal with but i believe in you i love you so much and relate to may your channel is fantastic im young and scared my parents will just did what they

so beautifull and i love when you talki really love youidk about what i said but i really gratefull for watch you video now i subbed btw billie eilish is best thank you for being understanding you probably dont know how much people you are helping you are so caring and amazing love your personality and everything about you definitely got yourself a new sub seems fitting to watch this today a few days ago my friend tried to commit suicide with pills and didnt tell me until now and apparently she had been self harming herself and i hope she gets better shes always so happy and we always have so much fun together i didnt expect her to be so depressed you look very beautiful today too jess angela he is my favorite game developer artist this video made me cry because may is exactly like me thats why i tell my friends if they need someone to listen them that i got two ears two eyes and plenty of time on my hands weather im busy or not this is so beautiful this game looks really interesting just wanted to say you are beautiful jess hello is this an app if it is whats the name this is so call why are your videos turning out as private videos i would love it if you tried lovestruck i love ur vids btw i absolutely adore this game when i first saw it especially since i understand chinese mandarin truly a wonderful made game crafted with love and care ps for another awesome video hope monetization goes well wait so where is your second channel cant find it this hit different yeah i found this game some time ago too amazing abhi you should play the letter its a horror visual novel and i think its perfect for this chanel the story is broken into 7 chapters this game contains suicide attempts and graphic images have fun playing it what will gonna do with your second channel in which channel you will upload choices video or other story games video vintage game but love the visual glad your back is this an app or something else you should play murder mystery yeahhhhh im out its looking great abhirio is the game really worth itcompared to choices or story scape yo abhirio catch up with choices soon man missing your videos you should do a variety of story games mostly aaa i feel like that will work play choices waiting for them thats great man thumbs up the shiloh dynasty in the background really sets the mood imo hope is the best ending paying attention to save someone and the charatar called me rembers everthing best game ever this was a really powerful game may reminds me so much of sayori from ddlc whats the difference between survivor and hope like how do you change it where did u find this game this relationship reminds me of chloe and maxs relationbecause of the contrast of personality each otherand the style is really good by the way just wanted to leave this here in case anyone was wondering if this was a real life scenario then i would have picked the move on choice this is because the short haired girl threw her interests away and moved away from the relationship first if youre considering going back to a relationship then please try to put your feelings aside and look at the relationship rationally before doing anything and think about why you split in the first place the whole getting back together and living happily ever after is extremely rare and almost exclusively exists and works in fiction so please think about it before you step into a situation that could very likely just lead to more emotional pain for the both of you stay safe and take care of yourselves guys 3 omgthank you so much i really enyojed it this game really touches me im very depressed but my best friend ella helped me out on everything anybody wants a hug somebody to talk to people say i am a good listener and i am happy to help heart emoji have you ever played or heard of valiant hearts wow goodness some parts of this were really close to home for me this was a really good video i dont think im the only one laughing by you saying meme 1029 i gently open the door anyone else find the art style so aesthetically pleasing it almost makes you angry like i find this so nice to look at but with f o r c e beautiful game very meaningfuldeepi can relate to it on so many levels lyrics are losing interest you wont find no better than this i swear if you leave just let me know so i wont look dumb when you move on the vocals in the background are by shiloh dynasty shes basically the girl who created this whole loft hiphope trend youd be supersized how many of her simple vines or 5 second video have been sampled a turned into to amazing tracks an example aof her stuff is here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlyotmlvm0olistrdmmt7k0pz9tgi4index10 closest version to this song on apple music is losing interest feat shiloh dynasty by unclenathannn i had this game for ages but never played it man it ripped me apart when i did cant stop listening to this track aswell god angelas art style is so beautiful and aesthetically pleasing this song speaks to my soul ways nothingnobody else can this is just an edited version of shiloh losing interest lyrics losing interest you wont find no better than this i swear girl if you leave just let me know so i wont look dumb when you move on whats the name of this song what about the jazz music its not just music its complete art and the game is awesome its just beautiful thanks for posting this music 3 the game is so good i now realised after a google search that the protagonist is her o beautiful music beautiful art beautiful game if someone here for some reason has not played this game please do one playthrough takes about 10 minutes 30 if you go for all endings its absolutely worth every single second of your time is there a way to loop videos bc i wanna listen to this over and over again no seriously xd i wonder if everyone has gotten missed the first time they played this from the style you could say its like nirvana but without the sad questioning of life itself very very beutiful copyright this guy rightaway gaining views for others content i just noticed that may also has cuts on her legs oh my lord i need this music in 8d what music genre would you say this is god angela he is such an aesthetic person i knew it was an xxxtentacion song when i played the game i wish in the game we could be friends with both of them but gosh angelas art is very aesthetic make this game the best game of the lifetime please the original song is called losing interest for anybody that wants to know never give up hope in life i love this game so much who tf is one person that disliked this can we get a 1hour version please the music sounds so much like climax by young thug its actually shiloh d version ktvsky who came from jacks video i knew losing interest was in the back the music is as pretty as the art i feel like angela he did an amazing job on this game truely amazed because i reflected on this game and it showed me alls you need is a friend that shows that they love you and would be there to give you a comforting hug and help you however long it takes love this song may is so cute and beautiful oml 3 i never noticed the scissors or the fact that they are sat in blood i need a extended version for cry i hope for a new game i wanna hear more this music ja so nice and the game was so breathtaking does this song have a name because i need it on my spotify give hope and forgive the missed survivor that song is from xxxtentacion i think that its shiloh dynasty losing interest i love this game like i think its just so life related and this music is making me chill so much thank you for posting this your 6th sub the original is called losing interest by shiloh but this is a remix and its edited thanks a lot for posting this angela hes art style if aesthetically pleasing lmao so aesthetic me and charms love to play this game title of the song lost interest beautiful 3 i think everyone here have same thoughts i love that game it reminds me of doki doki literature club and its just amazing in general that game is so exceptional this song speaks to my soul in ways i cant great music what is the song playinng when the game starts i cant find music anywhere everytime i see someone play this game i break down crying ive dealt with selfharm and depression for a long time and in high school i lost a friend to suicide so this game strikes a nerve but it feels like i need to constantly come back to this game to help heal myself the game has sad and sweet endings but your voice make my eyes watery oh boy the

this game is you always find the most intriguing games bethany excellent video bethany meyer love these positive vibes u spread you have a magic in your eyes you are so creative the one i appreciate on this planet this game did not pull any punches with its choices there were a lot of times when i was worried that choosing a certain option would cut the conversation short and prevent us from helping may and im not just talking about the obvious ones the game was definitely very wellwritten and wellpresented i feel like theres more i could say but honestly the game does a good enough job of speaking for itself that i dont really need to say anything more wow most of the problems may expressed hit pretty damn close to home this was a really cute and heartwarming if also a bit depressing short game i also really really love the art style for those who do harbor any of the thoughts expressed by may throughout this experience theres always someone who will listen either someone close or possibly a professional i watched jacksepticeye ay this first and its amazing omg what i saw this game on steam and i loved the artwork so i decided to download it im so glad i found

thank you for such an amazing piece of art i love my anime wifeu youprobablywontreadthis but id like to share my thoughts on a new game people would also adore how about a mix of i woke up next to you

reaally liked your art style it was gorgeous af the story while sad still had its moments of true beauty it was lifelike and the characters were very human and alive i even recommended it to my friends i look forward to more of your works again thanks for making this game and hope you have a great day btw may is very waifu material would protecc her 1010 im here because i saw that madoka magica poster and i was sold i really need to know all the songs used in this game i love all of them i wanna play this now i love the music in this game so much i need a game in spanish please i need this song cant seem to find it anywhere just played this and im obsessed with this art style loved the story and really just hope theres ever going to be a game like this but much longer was a really interesting simple and beautifully designed game the game was really touching and it reminded me of my crush who survived from this kind of situation and i love all of your arts and games please keep up the work 3 i played it and just wanted to say it was beautiful you did such a good job and it felt super real and personal to me even if i was only 2 minutes in this looks absolutely beautiful fantastic work whats the song used i absolutely love your games i cant wait to play this one i am so happy this looks so good this will be on android or pc this looks great amazing i wonder if youll show more about the psychopath experiment it was a very interesting trailer thank you so much for making another game with beautiful i think i know what ill be drawing today how many of these did you make your games and art always amaze me ill play as soon as i have time is there any chance i can play it on mobile i dont have access to any computers wow the art is even more amazing than ever am i that early haha 1st and it looks incredible this game is amazing i love this game its amazing i relate alot to it 3 also i see you there park jimin thanks i needed to know this 3 thanks a lot for this video i couldnt get the survivor ending but with the help of your video getting it was a breeze i hope nobody ever does self harm and if u do stop and get help easy as that 144 what the i just played this game and thought there would be quite a bit of videos of this game but suddenly realised there wouldnt be much because suicide is a very touchy subject sometimes whenever i see games like this based off of friend groups i see simalarities of me with the suicidal character sommetimes i wonder if i will be the one ending it in my freind group since all the pain has gotten to me enough keep your mental state from bieng bored stall it with useless information until you come to the realization self harm isnt a option positiveness is love ur vids remember meh when ur famous i can relate to shrugging someone off 3153 the word you are looking for is resilient good game anyway too short but probably took ages to make if it was me i would have made it more episodes with lot more distractions than just amy i can relate to a lot of the things in this video but i care more about helping other people be happy than helping myself be happy making other people happy whether they are close friends or random strangers its the only thing that really brings me happiness its these type of videos that i like to watch but i shouldnt watch them if anyone needs help or just someone to be there to listen im here for anyone nobody has to be alone in this world people will only remember what you wore for a second well unless youre lady gaga ha ha im not trying to be rude i recently just found this game on steam and its really sad none of the people in my friend group seem suicidal and i say seem because one day they seem happy then the next you hear that they hug themself you know sometimes it gets me wondering if it would be me that would commit suicide thanks for sharing this i had no experience with this topic whatsoever so it was really interesting what you said also dont worry about us getting your daily uploads when theres an exam you should be learning for is it stx the creators of this game youtube history happy birthday song earrape so sometimes when i see a knife or something else dangerous i picture very clearly in my hand ways i could kill myself or accidentally die then i get really stressed and snap out of it cuz i dont wont to die so that good luck with your exams shiloh in the background nice thank you so much ddd nice edits nice walkthrough nice commentary keep it up continue the game plzzz woah dude i have no idea how this only has 42 views it deserves a lot more you rly did a good job loved the review 3 when they slow down the song during that bathroom scene its pretty good for anyone who wants to know it takes 33 minutes to get every ending great video man i couldnt find out how to get this ending so im glad you did and posted it what happen to the stream man you havent changed a bit over the years i remember when i watched your fnaf fan game videos when i was 9 now im turning 14 this year and now i feel old and now and about to enter high school this year but im so happy that you are still on youtube to this day 530 hahha am i the only one that laughed at his detective work 1118 nooo i knew it but why no its left alone i think you played you left me i havent watched you since fnac the memoriez i havent watched you in a while im gonna start doing that and i have a question even though you have ads does youtube still pay your rent 23k views is 23 dollars i am ready to enlist to defeat the ccp risk with a tang top kinda turns me on no homo so they added bts jokes in this game man is been a good 4 years since i last saw one of your videos glad you still make great content god dammt another visual novelwelp gonna wait for the next video im just disappointed at this pointso many great things are being ruined these kind of creations hurt me a bit having suffered from severe depression and suicidal relapses for most of my life at least there is serious attention made in the indie community hopefully it doesnt further the social stigma of mental illness to those who truly dont understand i also liked how risk made much of the right choices the second play through almost instinctively so yeah risk here is a challenge for you every video show your intros from oldest to newest love ur vids 302 awwwww the days of being a care free teen again so adventurouslyintriguingly mysterious especially when you dont let school run your life another good game that was so good its sad to see it put to an end glad to see you play it again bro love ya bro risk will u come to scotland if you do you will be the first youtuber to come to scotland so risk is secretly a lesbian i really like the good ending be cautious there will always be someone to support you in difficult times dont be afraid and ask for help free hug cool game waiting for the next apex video riskrim this reminds me of the game dont take this risk that game is awesome that game is deep mannnn also buritos for breakfast its risk hours fellas i always like how your videos are uploaded at exactly 12 midnight in my country can you play fanf i miss the old days ok ok ok ill click on the notification its not like i wasnt gonna do it anyways bbaka me first yo dog my emotion bones r hurting really deep i just finished playing the game i saved may i loved the gamevery emotional im your 77th sub 3 too much talking fucking hell im the 50th subscriber d subscribed good vid and i subbed am here cuz jacksepticeye didnt open the door you are the first person i saw ever open the door after watching like 10 people this game is beautifully sad the multiple endings show this brilliantly this is a good introduction to your channel i cant waut ti watch mote of your content im your 18th sub lol yes girl i love you could use more smash that like button also i forgot i was on youtube because you didnt ask me to click bell icon at least 12 times all jokes aside good video db great video it actually made my day better aww i love this game its very good and it has a meaning also im with you may i love harry potter thank you thank you so much i didnt know how badly i needed to see this and hear your words thank you brian angelas new game omg ive been waiting someone to play this im so excited i love the art style in this game ill need to process the story for a while but im happy whenever mental health is brought up its so important that we destigmatize it in society and the more we talk about it the easier thatll be on a completely different note you keep mentioning itchio so i finally checked it out omg youve shown me the path to wonderland oo you dunno how much this means right now having risked a lot to pursue a carreer in music i honestly dont know where or how id be right now if i hadnt i am nothing without my passions and its what helped me get over a really bad depression so if i had never tried to pursue them i dont know what would have been of me its really hard to find something you like when youre depressed but if you can find it hold on to that for dear life and dont let anyone stop you see if tomorrow is your tomorrow so well said this game spot on man you really hit depression on the head so many youtubers try talking about it try to know about it and say all the uninformed things i really appreciate that it means a lot in a world where no one knows the reality i have it and had for a long time you got it down to an art thank you those unexpected yet meaningful connections can be the catalyst to finding that spark of hope within the darkness i downloaded this game some days before your uploading and found my way to the best ending on my first play throughangela he has truly outdone herself with her distinct take on the jams theme im also a pretty big magical girl fan though nowadays im more into heartwarming fantasy series pocos udon world among others got started with

perfect track for the game tho makes me feel lonely but happy at the same time i really appreciate that this game is in steam i cried while playing because it was just so touching and relatable and the whole story didnt seem scripted but more of what a real scenario would look like and the music made the atmosphere even better 3 oh i know this song the way it sounds in game tho that ending tho man i was like not prepared for losing i love this song so much this game made me cry so much i like how they slowed it down cause of copyright and it sounds better because of it everyone deserves to

really inspiring gah some of these indie games make my eyes watery this was really inspiring and i believe that this video will help a lot of people struggling with these thoughts this is a serious matter and there are so many people struggling with depression i admire you for doing this xx nice coffee mug you got there this game always makes me really sad but i still love it xx omg the bts meme i absolutely love absolutely amazing this game is so deep on so many levels great vid dude hey dude keep up the good work you are doing great this game wrenched my soul from my body when i played it but its also so god damn pretty to look the artist did such a phenomenal job and i recommend anyone watching to play for yourself can you please play more i would like to see the other endings and i would love to see your reaction to it i called it as soon as she said goodbye when protagonist asked see you later im so so glad youve played this ive played this a billion times and am in total love with it please please play this again so you can get the other endings there is 4 different endings you guys should totally play them such a pretty game there are multiple endings and there are also multiple beginnings if you start the game after having gotten an ending i know it happens with the missed ending but idk about other endings it starts differently ill avoid saying the beginning though if you want to find out for yourself its nothing major but its an extra scene i picked up on how she was talking to the player as if she was never gonna see her again that and the warnings but i probably wouldve picked it up anyway since im kinda sensitive to warnings like those didnt matter though still hit me def saw that coming please play again maybe dont go out with goth gf or dont have such a long date i forgot about the trigger warning as well but i just knew by the way may was talking that she was losing her hold you could sense something was very wrong please play the rest of the endings holy shit that ending gave me a pit in my stomach so short but gave me so many emotions lol i dont have apple products so at first i was very confused and worried i had just finished this game a few hours ago so excited to see you guys playing this is this by angela he i hope yall might play the game again if their is multiple endings i just love yall vids yeah i picked up on the suicidal clues when you were leaving to go out and she started talking to you about how you are a great friend and etc im very sensitive to suicide clues because ive been around it constantly both because of my attempts and because of others around me over the years so i knew shit was going down with the first few words she uttered its been my experience we dont want to kill ourselves and we dont want others to feel guilty when we do so we usually tell those we care about in our way to not feel guilty and that we need help please stop us before hand so if your paying attention you might be able to catch the clue something isnt kosher with us and stop and ask us how we are feeling and stuff but if you havent been around that kind of pain your average person doesnt really pick up on it and the attempt goes on unaware hugs every life is precious and unique and the loss of that life is a tragedy beyond measure i may not know you but i know you thats a nice room also you can see the trans pride flag in the players room trans lesbian right baby definitely playing this for myself love your channel not my cup of tea that is for sure bro thx for the help like honestly i couldnt find another ending and i had the game thx bro appreciate it im going to cheak it out oo whats that music right at the start face cam kar tosko rawknee na raid kiya hai 626 i slowly opened the door ddlc intensifies love ur vids remember meh when ur famous you forgot the survivor ending mars what happened to may idk if u see but the main screen you can see someone dead and can see bloody scicors made me think of ddlc there are five of you check the description she added one more 2032 deja vu i already seen this place before this was still touching i love this game but it was different from all of the others this game literally made me cry like one thousand times you missed an ending i know the games description says there are only three but i think both versions of the ending where may kills herself are considered as just one ending if you either befriend her but dont hug her in the bathroom or you hug her in the bathroom but didnt become good friends with her from hanging out together for the latter one you can pass time by working on your laptop repeatedly until around 400 pm then going to the bathroom you get a middle ending where you stay friendly but not great friends for several months until she moves out its implied that you supported her enough to keep her from killing herself at least for now although its less clear how good shes going to be in the long term great video i was wondering if you already made a video on how to make thumbnails and if not are you still planning on making a video on the subject thanks looks cool yes i want a part 2 i love your video lucyan and missed messages is my favorite game because i love blood but i ask if you can try to make a yandere high school minecraft roleplay please and thankyou your biggest fan maylea can you play rock and war are you gonna next back some more sift heads reborn unity games brings me back that voice sopretty 037 037 i just need to hear this beautifull voice hey hey wanna stop by and say good job on the video my name is curtis i am loving your voice and your voice and i wanted you to know that you sound so young and someone that i could get to know and possible be close friends with you can add me on social media aka facebook snapchat and thats it facebook httpswwwfacebookcomcurtisbass58760 snapchat hispaniclover09 i know its a weird name but ha ha im sorry i had to leave important heres a few things that id like to mention 1 the exact reason why i decided to play this game was because its almost if not entirely storybased my goal or one of my goals at least for this channel is to introduce new games genres and concepts to people to encourage them to broaden their horizons when it comes to video games as well as to get fans of different game genres to come together and discuss with each other kind of like a little sanctuary for those gamers with an openexperimental mind and a fuckedup sense of humor aka you guys hopefully so anyways i figured that now would be the best time to start experimenting since my channel is still new and fresh untainted by youtubes bullshit haha 2 originally i made this video agerestricted however i chose to take that decision back why i guess i just figured that if some kid unintentionally came across my vids it shouldnt really be my problem but theirs so why should i bother myst messages i havent heard of this spinoff how dare you not play myst just kidding this game 100 reminds me of life is strange same type of choices but more to make thanks for playing so the message im getting here is even when youre not playing myst youre playing missed only a couple minutes in watching takes more concentration when its a game im not familiar with but those are finite so not complaining p im never going to stop watching this video again i really like your voice is that a weird thing to say i dont know but i just think your voice is really cute hey lu its me flaze d keep up the great work im i the only one who noticed their was a trans flag with her gay flag i need a link to the discord server ohhhhh wait so part 1 was just a dream of when mia died confuseddddd but then i cried a little bc i had a dream of someone hanging themselves when there in college and it was me i woke up scared and cried stressed out no joke true story yyou should do mmore im crying because i had no one to talk to i cry in my sleep or i cry inside everyday i have to act happy to show people theres nothing wrong but there is but anyways i love your videos you are kind sweet and have the right words to make me happy i love the ending i love the art style so much this is sad this shows both the old and updated versions of the game so there are bits of differences in the gameplay ralimis oot segassem ym tuo sehcaer eno on alternate gameplay missed 001 forgive 833 survivor 1403 hope 2213 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2mpncfc16ow react to this plz i can relate to a lot of the things in this video but i care more about helping other people be happy than helping myself be happy making other people happy whether they are close friends or random strangers its the only thing that really brings me happiness its these type of videos that i like to watch but i shouldnt watch them if anyone needs help or just someone to be there to listen im here for anyone nobody has to be alone in this world can you react to markiplier 5050 challenge with his mum im very sorry im sure this video is good and this game is good but the last time i saw a depression based game when the darkness comes it gave me a massive anxiety attack afterwards so i wont really watch this video again really sorry jack played this earlier and it got really emotional but im happy youre back i watched jack play this its a deep game you on pc now congrats on 2 k bro hey bro its

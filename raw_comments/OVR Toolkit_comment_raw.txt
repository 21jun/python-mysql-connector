mine is just stuck on the purple start up screen how to i get off of it can you interact with the desktop or is it viewing only nice overview how do you use obs to record ovrtoolkit i just have the game itself selected for streaming but it doesnt capture the steam overlay or ovrtoolkit cpu or gpu overhead forgive my ignorance but shouldnt this be free oculus has a way to view multiple screens while in vr or is this different in some way could you really read text when the window was as small as it is in this video or were you just setting it at a random size for the video also is there a limit to the number of windows why why does valve not build in something like oculus desktop that thing is perfect and well implemented too also where are all the big vr games valve promised almost years ago i think it was 3 games they announced i am starting to think they are just a bunch of lazy fucks d quote from gm in this video you have the option to mirror yourwindows but arent windows meant to be see thru p kind of an off topic question but how come youve gone to a fanatec from a direct drive wheel you probably have already answered i just dont know where the mic on the index is insane still crying that mine was doa never going to listen to anymore of your stupid reviews as kartkraft is shit show us your bindings etc as looks like shit and plays like shit did you get paid by them this is build in with wmr headsets for free but it hase a bit less features tho the oculus window viewer thing is very hit or miss for example if i play elite dangerous with a window open to watch say a youtube video while im playing all i can see in the mirror is the gameplay itself and it cant be minimized or covered up well it can but its extremely finicky and has to be done in a weird way i prefer ovrdrop you can fine tune 5 million things about the window aswell tune performance and so on too i use it to overlay a virtual dashboard to my racing for example and i race at 90fps without reprojection stream gm 3 i promise i wont trolldonate maybe under some circumstances that is hehe thats pretty cool n all but how about those streams 2x 2d screens in limitless mirror mode to showcase 3d vr usability i guess it all makes sense somewhere or is gm uploading the video to the multiyouversetube indexmic aroused this is awesome o been faithful to ovrdrop but it seems to be losing compatibility will try this thanks cool i have to try multitasking with this thats all very good as per usual but stream now pleaselll make you a cuppa ill make it believe me oculus dash is also great if you have rift but you cant move the windows while being in the vr app this video would be very useful but i cant decide which of the top 5 usb ports to plug my vr in with so its actually not useful at all cant wait till my rift comes in im paring this with with nature trek to watch videos in the ocean ive been interested in this for some time now but im not sure if it will be able to do what i mainly need often times when i launch a steam game in vr it will load but i can not move the mouse or type within the vr window in my headset until i am able to minimize the steamvr app that has a small window on my desktop normally i have to hit control alt delete to see behind my vr screen then move my mouse over the minimize line on the steamvr app to minimize it but often even that does not work because my mouse pointer will dissappear when it gets to the steamvr app window and the oculus window sometimes the pointer just dissapears behind the window and sometimes i am actually able to minimize the steamvr app window once i do that i can then move my mouse pointer within my vr appgame to select the option i need such as multiplayer settings etc will this app allow me to bring my desktop window up within my vr headset and allow me to use my mouse and pointer to mini amazing piece of vr software worth every penny wish i could switch to nordic keyboard with letters though i love this but could you implement a feature that lets you putt customizable makro buttons on your hand like when you press the button it presses the keys ctr5 or so how is the msc mp mod going incorporation in to my pip boy time can you crop a window or app awesome stuff great for streaming can you attach twitch chat under your hand like you can in ovrdrop because that is a make or break also thats cool how it was uploaded on my birthday hey curtis ive just picked this up and it looks like it solves one of my problems wont know until i get home from work tonight i still have one issue im trying to find an answer for that i cant get replies tohow can i get my oculus or steamvr main screens to show up in a stream in streamlabs obs i think thats what youre doing here so far i can only specific apps to work but when i back out of those my screen goes black and viewers cant see what im doing any help from you or anyone else who sees this would be awesome thank you thank you for this i bought the toolkit yesterday and i can already tell theres no way i can live without it im salivating at ideas like pinning desktop windows to vrchat computer monitors airplay mirrors to models of ipads etc can i convince you to add a humble vrc streamer in game so we can chat and nerd out there sometime my name is the same there except no space cheese n ricethe shakiness of the camera this kind of stuff gets me really excited for vr eventually replacing monitors excellent work not sure if you know a fix but the pc spotify application just shows a white screen if set as hotkey and programs just shows an extremely zoomed in minimizemaximizex can still navigate spotify through desktop view though hey dev looks really cool i was wondering if my use case is supported by the app i play a few sims where the menus arent in vr but the game is i was wondering if i can have screens that only show when i am not in a vr game session for example if i could see the menu window when i am in steam home then enter the vr session and have them not shown then have them still shownautomatically shown when i leave the session and reenter steam home in my rig i have access to mousekeyboard but not to touch controls so having this happen automatically is important thanks any plans to support hand tracking modules does this have valve index support this gives me an idea for a project i use autohotkey a lot so having a small overlay attached to your wrist which would launch autohotkey scripts would be pretty sweet of course if you want to add something like application launch buttons to this overlay thatd be cool too can you play regular games on this in vr is it possible to change openin edit mode from the grip buttons to somethin else took 30 tries for it to open have ahd the vive for week now but would still curious if button mappin elsewhere possible everytime i open twitch chat it brings up the chrome window on the desktop and gets in the way of the stream does this happen to anyone else or do i have to mess with the settings looks good so could i start and stop obs recording with this document viewers for use in the vr cockpit vary significantly in their usability we review a small collection of what is available in the market today my choice goes to xplane and the excellent avitab plugin a usable suite of features for the vr pilot drop me a comment below if you have tried out something not covered here but you found it practical and useful i am always searching for the best vr document viewer for flight simmers great video however i came to see if there is a way to bring the panels inside the cockpit glass and not outside where i cannot click on it leaningclipping through the window in vr to manipulate for example the garmin 2d display or a2a panels really breaks the immersion for me hi mark admittedly i didnt understand a lot of what you said but i enjoyed it all the same carol x hi mark even though im not of the vr fraternity as yet i feel compelled to keep an eye out for any informative videos and advice for when i do make the leap good video as always this is a particular issue i have been pondering when considering vr well presented and honestly appraised keep up the good work 1130 if they integrate voiceattack software to the notescratch kneepad that could be an awesome feature improvement 1130 the roundwheel input interface looks familiar much like the input wheel shown in dcsworld to communicate with the rio backseat radarinterceptofficer in the f14 which they make bypassable using voice attack and its awesome also dcs allows voice attack integration for communicating instructions with ground crew personnel and issuing orders to wingmen ai hey mark great channel i subbed for sure its kyle from canada hi mark great to see another extremely well made and professional video from your good self your green screen is superb by the way the only two i havent used is the gtn 750 as i only found out about that the other day and daily vr which i think has only just come out the problem for me is as always and as discussed before between ourselves i believe is the gtx 1070 card that i have it tends to make x plane a bit clunky or unstable if i start to bring in all these windows into the cockpit of course oculus has its own method of allowing you to import windows into any vr application not just a flight sim but a lot of people find that you have to mess around with the hdmi cable that goes into the graphics card from your monitor to get it to work properly i like flyinside flight simulator but as you say there doesnt seem to be a way of importing documents into the program unless you have an oculus my solution may be to wait and see how the new htc vive cosmos performs as links to the top 20 steamvr game list of 2019 can be found in the description above did your favorite virtual reality game make the list comment below

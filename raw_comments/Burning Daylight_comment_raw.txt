director of the game here thanks for playing it in 2550 when i go through the door i cant move wait so the weather report of the outside world was a lie thats deep it kinda reminds me of 1984 by george orwell very cool aww man why so short the atmosphere in this game is amazing you guys nailed it you have more game i collect maby you see in my chanel great scot where are this mans pantaloon that was woah so many social commentary in there also the protagonist was doing a donald duck for almost half of the game before getting new pants on haha the opening part reminds me a lot of soylent green i liked the concept that this more of a movie rather then a game with a distant interaction with the audience also thank for making it free to play more people would enjoy it the game is good but why involved religions in the game the lifestyle that i see in the game is the style of atheist eating drinking sexing sleeping until you die with no true target that have benefits after death like if whatever you do is benefit less then why would you live life is cruel and boring why would you live it atheism encourages suicide if you think deeply anyway that have noting to do with the game its a good game sorry for my bad english did anyone pick the chair option curious if its any different it is free on steam hey love this reminds me of abes odd world ps1 days cant forget where we came from is that game on steam that was fucking dope i get a very big inside feel from it so much so that when i first saw the thumbnail i thought this was the next game that the studio was working on love it interesting i am not going to try this crap i dont find it surprising since thats what people do in slaughterhouses i think you became god i dunno if the story is on cycle but that heavenly place thingy means you became new god or administrator to that cyber world dystopian we saw probably because you are the only one that did not get into temptation of that head gear i guess like going back to that sexy place and probably those people around you think that the world they live is real without them knowing that they are simulated but you the mc here kinda dont think the same and searched for the truth and then saw that pumping machine and probably accidentallly destroyed it and found a place where the administrator are probably there is a message on the game about people likes to live with technologies and stuff rather than surrounded by beautiful trees and animals or fish so the admin probably preserved those and made simulation for people who destroys nature and then they get punished and became that nutriman thingy if they break a law or something i dunno thats not real your commentary is great cju but sometimes its better to say nothing at all after finding the library all the observing and speculating kind of took away from the experience since you were mostly repeating yourself still i love your stuff and im just saying this to hopefully help you improve though im sure youre aware of it already i guess theres the constant pressure to fill the air with something it must have been murder trying to come up with something interesting to say that would heighten the viewing experience with so little information to go on xd cju im sure we can all be mature about this me hahahaha dont be redickulous i cant belive this is free a i with haley joel osment and jude law 2001 great great movie i need more info concerning the end what is next after the helmet is placed on his head this so reminds me of abes oddysee ooooh a game by the animation workshop from the city im currently living in its probably made by a group of students then well this seem appropriate i am eating salami slices and watching the human meat grinding factory wow this reminds me of abe oddworld and ghost in the shell mixed together but more cinematographic beautiful i love this concept i wish there was more i like how it is left for us to figure out what happened in a way 1836 game where hebrew is written backwards number 49376 it says a weird shape a weird shape of matter called a crystal you went off screen then as for the game in short phones and consumerism bad nature good old days polio good we live in a society i have a linkedin again number 52051 i wonder if you can choose to eat an apple instead of getting into the machine apples often symbolize knowledge or forbidden knowledge so maybe by choosing the apples you can learn what really going on what a surprise for my eyes went from darkness to light in the end really reminded me of little nightmares this game reminds me of inside i love these kinds of games any chance of looking at loco parentis so tired of screaming reviewers cju great videos as usual but i am still going to wait for your playthrough for a journey through rule of rose and little misfortune how very soylent green only 477 thousand subscribers too go easy peasy lemon squeezy nice nudity man loved the environment atmosphere and the graphics of this game it was quite a pleasant surprise the library reminded me of the monterey bay aquarium and the coin thing like pacman odd mix but successful you do know your fish d all jokes aside yeah deep game sending all sorts of messages got you and me thinking all along whoaaaa the visuals truly are incredible one heck of an experience and for free thank you for playing the sounds visuals from that were positively cinematic i gotta say this game is a fantastic piece of work this game delivers great messages of our problems in society nowadays the last part of game is where i feel sad mostly and it is also a fear of mine if human keeps destroying planet with the current pace indeed if even cow chicken and all animal become extinct human could be farmed for food or meat harvest its the worst scenario again its a beautiful game and i always love your content thanks for playing this game reminds me a lot of the old game another world this looks great toy story has already confirmed that the claw is the only true religion the wow count was high for this game beautifully simple and yet complex at the same time i was mesmerised watching this they did not have to make the p9 that big a great find and its appreciated that you shared it with us i doubt id even find that game on my own watching you play and enjoying the game is a joy unto itself too oh not sure if youll see this or if someone else said it but at the end you can choose the apples or the chair hmm hard to believe this is a free game it was beautiful disturbing and thought provoking i feel like the message was that we all need to unplug instead of looking at life through the eyes of technology as often as we do great video run away from the thing thats gonna kill you cju life hacks 2019 i read an article that was scourced and said that cannibalism may be the future to a substainable green planet ive also read that livable pods might be our future for a substainable green planet if thats what they have in store for us in the future is this game really that dystopian a quick google search will yield hundreds of results like the example ive given whoever is writing the narrative certainly wants us to accept this as our future this game is a masterpiece this game reminds me of the oddworld series and its protagonist abe especially at the start of the game when you are trying to escape the machine and helping your fellow humans pretty amazing none the less especially the ending absolutely gorgeous and to think some of the utterly atrocious games charge of course you have to keep fit no one wants fatgristle in their delicious nutritious nutriman products that was so good this was incredible i cant believe its a free game impressed by the game not veryimpressed by the storymaybe because the dystopian futuresthey can think about arealways so similar to each otheri liked what i saw however especially the library part because it triggered a bit my phobia and i like when that happens via images i didnt hear any dick jokes the game didnt put you at ease enough to make dick jokes its unacceptablechris we can all be adultsme grumbling speak for yourself this game is great to me it looks like you were a kind of keeper of knowledge after passing some kind of tests or temptations or diatractions rather like if you learn about something forbidden its your right to keep it safe that sort of thing o visuals are beautiful too first thing that popped into my head at the beginning was soylent green really interesting and beautiful at the end visuals vibes of a lot of gamesmovies here i think the grungy dystopian world is below and the beautiful garden and genetic library is above ground not below thanks for playing this chris that was very good i really dont understand how youre not a more successful youtuber youre honestly the best video game channel in my opinion i try to get the word out about this channel when i can but hopefully youll go viral and get the subscribers you deserve sometime is that a button or just my dick sorryhad to say that this reminds of me of little nightmares dick jokes to a minimal ahh i seen what you did there chris hahahaha just some sort of dump site a mass grave leeds great content brotha youre the best cjugames love these sort of games very weird but great at same time unfortunatly i dont have anything to play them on but one day will give them a try amazing gameplay this was very deep and very beautiful surprised its free but every once in awhile you get a great quality game at no expense you also did a great job on the commentary keep it up that thumbnail looks hot wait is that a penis oh god keep it away from the machinery this is just my thought the world is at the time that human have exhausted all life on earth all that left is just the dna storage that we saw at the end this may not even be earth and just a facility or vessel in space looking for another planet to take over and destroy again hence people resort to clone themselves into a lower class for food and other purposes the place that we saw in the end is the last haven that stores hope to one day repopulate the animals and the like its not easy because unlike stubborn human most other species die out very quickly under unfavorable conditions look how struggle we are currently with preserving the red list species one of the caretakers or even the only caretaker also clones himself he somehow stores the information in the clones and trigger one of them to wake up and take over his place when needed pretty sure this place is only known to a few thats why its hidden under the machine though im not unsure about the corpse starch rations from warhammer 40k in a nutshell naming fish with chris educational i feel like this game is a commentary on materialism our tendency to give in to vices and our reliance on technology compared to looking at the world around us and nature itself and appreciating that beauty it is a rather typical story line but i do like how pretty and expansive they made the world for this game especially since it is free i hope this developer continues to make games as i can only see their design capability going stronger waiting for sunday to end sothat i can watch my favorite channel amd theres a new video you just made my weekend cheers this game reminds me of the movie aeonsame premise lots of elements from that story if anyone has ever seen the giver this is exactly like that especially at the end where the younger version comes to take the new seat while everyone is seemingly happy and know no pain or suffering the giver must know it all good film though it played like inside it also reminded me of we happy few total oblivion of the people and little nightmares where the children were grinned up for food i kept thinking get some pants on so that claw thing wont rip off your pecker somehow the story sort of reminded me of a strange animated video called lucky day forever httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4duks98yw5y absolutely amazing game especially for free yeah more walking than playing but the story and visuals are more than worth the watching inside vibes definitely how do you control a postapocalyptic population forced to live for an undetermined unimaginably long time inside a fullymechanized cyclopean structure mind control propaganda drugs sex worship of technology and an endless supply of food and resources furnished byyou and your neighbors soylent green anyone and our protagonist may be the new keeper of the secretthat the seeds of new life on earth are waiting deep inside the machine for when we finally can return to the planet surface and good googly moogly chris never keep your dick jokes to a minimum i think after the old man died you had 2 choices either take his machine and become the next watcher of the dystopian society or take the apples and embrace the natural world choice of nature and machine the hierarchy of this worlds society reminds me of snow piercer i do not know how to officially recommend games for your channel but one of the first horror games i played was distraint and i highly recommend it if you have not played it yet the library reminds me of the svalbard seed library its the largest with over a million crops though those are only plants this game is impossibly beautiful and how in the hell is this game free this game has more going for it than lets say anthem he said minx im watching full video amazing visuals for a free game enjoyed it a lot 40 minutes and almost 0 game not a fan of walking simulators but i guess people buy them i really fond with gamemovie about dystopian like this 2240 tryin to see how much of the korean i can read lol this game seems to have a very deep story i think we were the chosen one to break down the machines and probably wake up all the people who lived in a constant lie the guy in the chair was responsible for collecting every sample of every creature worldwide to maybe create a new world now the machines or gods are down his time was over and we are his successor at least that is what i think happened in the game in just a few words i know there was a lot more to mention about it but ive terrible headaches and im a little bit lazyits sunday d it was really good and that it is free is simply amazing very very nice what an incredible gem of a game what an experience youre the best love your videos what if this was just another part of insides facility i really like it yes caught your video just before bed again 3 the art style is very pretty missed opportunity to make a dick joke about not making dick jokes ill keep them to a minimum shouldve been ill keep them short soylent green is people there will be some nudity so i trust that we all be adults when i heard that i was like aww cman man dont be that guy but then you saved it right after with ill try n keep my dick jokes to a minimum lol ps well fucking done developer of this game also that opening title sequence was slick as fuck lol your so good to us cj you keep bringing the videos and we will watch them every single damn time its an addiction the plot reminds me a lot of the movie snowpeircer 2013 basically they are preserving humanity in a make shift arc he wakes up in a slaughter house where they are turning old people into food for the younger people in the movie the conductor is the only one who knows the horrible truth and keeps the system of preservation going he is at the end of his time and has to choose a successor at the end of the game sitting in the chair represents accepting this roll and eating the apple represents choosing freedom this makes me think of the game abzu you played it before with the deep sea diving robot thanks to you and the sub that suggested it that was a treat to watch mrkravin hey everybody i look like im every dad at a grill me yes dad you totally do the chinese words mean the prophet a lot of signboards also write which is a direct translation to he will provide interesting game amazing environment inspirations scream ghost in the shellmatrix and wall e when those people were all plugged in digging this shit there was even a girl with a dong lmao wow this game looks so good lol at trying to keep the video safe for youtube the music in this game is epic alternative title one mans quest to get dressed the visuals and atmosphere were good particularly for a free game its a pity there wasnt more meat to the gameplay though particularly with the augmented reality concept i feel like you could work in a whole host of cool mechanics there as it was this was mostly just walking to the right still a decent experience and hopefully their next project will be more ambitious with regards to the core mechanics my guy and back hurt so much ugh good video mister lemme see that pingas so we went from porn to a cult sounds like a typical tuesday to me ai our glorious tower me being snide sighs ill show you a glorious tower think word you were looking for around 3050 to 3060 is maybe an archive its weird when i played this game there was no voices so i didnt know the vr headset talked or that you were supposed to punch the cherries lmao i also got glitched into the door of the elevator and had to restart too haha do you plan on making more dev interviews because i think you should do it with this game here for the peen wheres the peen grill dad i want hot dogs please the problem i have with videos like that is i immediatly want to play this myself but i also want to keep on watching kravins reactions thank good he is also playing a lot of trash there i can relax and enjoy the video have you played unravel this game is beautiful and really good this is video popped up in my recommended and im just like wooah so this game was made by some of my school mates for their bachelor project at the animation workshop these guys are insanely talented and professional and sweet i remember us all having a pitching class together and i legit have a lifedrawing sketch i made of them as they pitched this game in a sketchbook somewhere and now its in a lets play on youtube im so proud of them 3 i like it when a game makes me feel something doesnt have to be pleasant feelings at all kravin you are such a daddy lol also really like your videos is it just me or does the headset sound like a slightly more pleasant claptrap i dont know if they took inspiration from this or not but one of the first cyberpunk stories ever is called burning chrome chrome is an underworld figure two guys are going to hack and steal her money in that type of heist you have to burn your victims defenses to the ground so that cant retaliate and the other mob people will wipe them out the more relevant part is probably that one of chromes main sources of income is prostitution the prostitutes have a cut out chip that switches them into vr while they work so they have no memory working and instead have memories of a happy dream like state in later stories in the same world you find out these chips have defects and dont always work as intended this reminds me of black the fall which is one of those insidetype games you played a couple of years ago this is very well made oo about the only thing i saw you missed that i found was in that room towards the end with the rows of people you can flush for better of a word the person who looks like you after interacting with it once i didnt see a change to what happened so idk what that means this game is about the survival of humanity in a world where the resources were too few and the vast amount of people were being sacrificed by the robot hand in order to keep a few humans surviving feeding so many is hard so the fat people are religiously sacrificed to the hand in order to keep people from being selfish and over indulging in a world where resources are scarce the animals are kept in order to ensure that nothing goes extinct the man at the end was the one who will provide he keeps the facility afloat makes sure everything is running smoothly and no one takes things for granted or step out of line thats why the cameras always follow the protagonist the vr section of the game was to show the the normal people keep busy and entertained even when they are confined by turning their lives into games refer to the show black mirror episode 2 its basically a post apocalyptic game that aims at keeping humanity alive the language you thought was russian was spanish shes saying its the 5th time dont know what the 5th time means but yeah besides a abes odyssey feel to it to me good game this is booty beautifully done i liked your theory of the whole thing being a life raft and humans being used as an energy source snowpiercer anyone but then why did that weather report say acid rain when the weather looks fine from the top of the tower life raft would be make sense if the outside world was no longer inhabitable ie acid rain but that looks like it might be a lie unless the top of the tower is above the acid rain clouds the only bit i could understand from the couple arguing when you tried to catch what language they were speaking in was the woman saying this is the fifth time in spanish its like 9 meets inside meets feed meets walle meets titan ae with a little soylent green and we happy few in there for good measure also i think the word you were looking for was ark its an ark it is free because it is really short but he should charge at least 1 to 7 dollars he earned it ahah awsome work if it was 9 times the length he could have a full game that really stands on its own this was really awesome even the old man penis at the end hm little nightmares then again a message on how humans are to mush into there tech a message to the future the other side of the movie mindwarp me before school looking for my pants 1736 woah your shirt is topnotch amazing this is like what our future will look like live in a shipping container consume product wear headsets to hide the grey techno hell you live in get excited for next product stay in line or youll be cast away man good thing he put shoes on otherwise id be offended that he was completely naked no shirts no shoes no service they didnt say a thing about pants for sure inspired by odd world this reminds me of oddworld a little bit im wondering if the fat people they were sacrificing to the machinesflattening in the slaughter houses were pregnant women maybe theyve restricted reproduction to cloning only and convinced everyone else to go along with it 040 you look so handsome lately 3 the im in comment made it seem like the player character planned in advance to take over the apple choice did seem garden of edenish to me also love the shirt you look goodits a nice color love the shirt grillin daylight my tacky lesbian fashion sense really appreciates ur grill dad energy at first i saw it as some sort of museumexhibit like the sara was keeping everyone bound to really basic pleasure stimuli showing off humans true nature while also keeping them in check like when it tried to keep the mc out of the culty area by tempting him w sexy stuff the different areas almost felt like exhibits minus the slauterhouse i honestly like the whole life vessel theory better though kinda makes for a walle situation but more graphic with the details lmao the huge atmospheric shift at the end there was really effective in getting across the idea that all of the raw ugly and explicit stuff in the vr world wasnt natural it was being enforced to keep the people controllable and dependant aka consumerism you look like the it person of a dinosaur theme park its oddworld mixed with titan ae ahhh man love watching u play so funny moments when guy was on the chairs ur like ewwww i hear it you look like a fucking dlc dream daddy character with that shirt and im loving it this an amazing game but even with the graphics it was disturbing in all kinds of ways when mrkravin see a naked man in a gamegame of the year d this game is real at first i thought it was just an ai apocalypse but yours make more sense porky the pig from looney toons i dont think he wears pants you may be getting to that age but youre looking beautiful in that shirt i feel like this is supposed to be a message about consumerism we are exposed to so things like the advertisements ar headsets voice assistance that are designed to manipulate us into thinking a certain way each and every day we sacrifice ourselves and our fellow man to abstract beings that have absolute power over us like corporations that have none of our well beings in mind similar message to ready player one but this was executed much better the book falls flat on actually reinforcing its themes and setting and ends up just glorifying the things that were previously established as bad or flawed this kind of dystopia is likely to happen if we continue on the path we are on we are destroying the planet and it may become uninhabitable with acid rain if the people in power continue to only focus on greed and power and repeat the status quo this was amazing also thanks for putting a dog on the grill for me this reminds me of odd world loved that gamethis was so cool as always love ya kravinator so eat from the tree of life or obey the almighty power im with eve on this one who knows life could have been much worse if we stayed in eden 1129 he didnt but also squidward all the looney tunes character and many more how is this free awesome game going to download it myself will be looking out for further stuff from this dev also grill dad mike is awesome rocking the shirt love it this was a stunning game the art direction was crazily well done going from disturbing to light and airy that is amazing its free 2138 missed a coin there kravin tsk tsk lol you grabbed one to the back right but forgot the back left one youre porky piggin it best intro yet peen appears kravin immediately can we turn the brightness up i love you never change big gay grill dad im about it i really love the cyberpunk aesthetic i wish i could play more like this i havent played this yet but seriously cyberpunk is so interesting it kind of has an oddworld abes odyssey feel look to it dling now and excited to try it cant go wrong with free lol nice review ive started to get bored of some games so watching this gives me another game to play other than fortnite and apex as you mentioned the game has some glitches but the world is intriguing and beautiful id love to see a sequel just so i can explore more of the world hey man thanks for the review means a lot to see people liking it remember when jesses videos didnt have hilarious sound fx coz i dont i dont know what the other people are saying about the editing but i like it very much props to the editors it reminds me of unhhhh cutting away so much from the video ruins the atmosphere and experience of the game the constant memes and floating text is annoying jarring and cheapens the jokes i would never be interested in watching this sort of heavily edited content if i didnt know for a fact that i like jesse if i were new here i definitely wouldnt interested in subscribing i only made it about 3 minutes in and i certainly have zero interest in playing the game im sorry fire the new editor on these ruining the pacing and atmosphere of what looks like an atmosphere heavy game with moronic cutaways and jumpcuts okay this editing is just to much i could not make it past 10 min some of the locations remind me of dreamfall and dreamfall chapters too cool a little editing is fine but dont need a cut away every 5 seconds why is there all this weird cutting to other things weird memes and stuff i want to see the game not some weird imagery 2138 the ark of the covenant on the right hand side jiggle physics ftw hey thanks for this tease i tried the game and it is very entertaining the editing is on point my dude keep up the good work shows the title of the game still says it wrong 1340 thats hebrew in the background but all the words are in reverse p thats what happens when you type in hebrew but you stay in lefttoright typing mode instead of righttoleft mode this kind of lets play is not my thing but im more of a knights of victory type i know nothing about what makes money today im glad jesse is having fun good for him but im not 9 minutes and im done this game gives me huge inside vibes and i love it id certainly get rid of all the whole jump cuts to memes etc just ruins the entire immersion of enjoying the video with you jesse some of these edits are too much better than days gone for sure i think personally i hate the ones that take you out of the game completely with some random soundbyte and a full screen image its like younger vlogers these days and their childish over edited humour and i dont watch you for that your humour is definitly childish sure but in an adult way thats best i can describe it xd so yeah please less hyperactive zipping around random fastcutscene and more you know play the game play not whatever this is now supposed to be thats just really not pleasant to watch or listen to i personally dont find this episode enjoyable there are so many edits that i dont know whats going on the editing in this video is fucking hilarious i really dislike the editing the cut ins distract from the actual game i cant stand it if this keeps on i will not be continuing with this series for long how to improve remove all cut in clips and after that it is already a lot better the very reason i follow you is that most of your videos arent like this yes i thought this was hilarious there is still a bit of a balance to be found i agree with the other comments but its pretty okay a little more of the gameplay though the editor commentary is really funny stuff that highlights what youre saying bc your commentary is already hilarious but not so much that it takes away from the video and ofc from you the sound at 2155 is 100 dory from finding nemo speaking whale wwwwweeeee neeeeeeeed tooooooo fiiiiiind hiiiiis sooooon better than days gone video but still too much its mostly the cutaway jokes that i cant stand it breaks the flow of the gameplay thankfully it was mostly in the first part of the video if this was a series where you where just goofing around it would be fine but wasnt the idea to showcase cool games the text jokes are fine when used sparingly but tone down on the meme cutaways it feels too much like a channel awesome video from 8 years ago thats one way to blow up megaton the format is good but i agree with those saying that the editing is still pretty jarring and makes it harder for me to keep up with its okay to have peaks and valleys of actionexcitement rather than trying to maintain a constant peak its okay though keep up the improvements it didnt land right but not everything will half this video is the dude donald ducking it through a post apocalyptic nightmare im literally dying from the great editing xd i need to watch the other tease videos if theyre all like this you make this game so hilarious it reminds me of the editing in bon appetits its alive series similar as with days gone not as aggressive but still too much unnecessary additional content and editing not really what i used to love about this channel i like content as sexual intercourse as raw and hilarious youre an amazing entertainer without addons would be amazing if you would just put that in the foreground im not gonna lie when jesse said is that a hung person i thought he was talking about the main character for a moment this game is like a cross between inside and headlander id would have liked it to be longer the editing has improved but still needs a little work i liked a couple of the edits but the majority feel like theyre trying too hard to make jesse funny as opposed to supplementing his humor because remember were all watching having been used to normal jesse videos with so very little editing meaning we stayed for jesse its not a shitcluster like days gone but the memey inserts work poorly on jesse videos because jesse himself is funny whats fun about watching jesse is jesse so the added nonsense just breaks that up and acts as an annoyant the chinese on the wall says he will provide edge my cox more better although ill also say the jokes that dont stop the flow of the video are the ones that generally work this game looks like it was inspired by inside really cool visuals i sang myself the elevator song maybe have a second channel with uncut gameplay i have to say i loved watching stuff like pony island and the hex but i couldnt suffer through your playthrough picking flowers in the witcher 3 or horizon zero dawn the first two dont need cuts the later two do mystery game like this one is in the first group i just witness what too much editing actually is year of 1000000 baby you deserve it jesse one of the major things besides jesse ofc i liked about this channel was that it wasnt adhdhypereditedmeme central like 99 of all youtube channels honestly the editor in this is the best jesse legitimately talked about this in an announcement video guys this is the content now his main focus is now twitch youtube has hurt its creators for too long this is better i guess maybe one day theyll actually be good again really hoping this isnt what his goal is always loved that this channel wasnt a memefest why in the world is this happening please go back to just doing your thing without the jump cuts memes and text overlays i believe that there are a few too many cut aways really used to love your videos when it was just your commentary jesse the constant memes and animations really interrupts your flow if you will it looks like im not alone either holly fuck 254 omg is that a hung person yes yes jesse youve already done plenty of commentary about how gifted the main character is xd jesses dead space episodes are pretty cool you should check it out okay i love the editor comments more bahahaha still too heavy on the edits but this is better than the days gone video like you didnt need to use the soylent green scene more than once and if you do you can show just a fraction of it and move on rapidly you dont need to make that many cuts to memes either i liked it ive been enjoying your videos since the wow days and youve only gotten funnier keep it up i love the editing in this one coxtease is quickly becoming my favorite series projared has ms editor the beard bros have christompat i get it thats how things are going in the lets play world and just like jared having a single person speaking can drag on a bit it just feels like too much too intense this memes are not like no one can tell the difference or chris face popping up when they say his name theres a huge separation between jesse and the meme its not like a conversation but more like watching two different shows at the same time the pants bit was actionreaction jesse and the editor working off each other the soylent green one was jarring i dont know i didnt last four minutes into the video not for me the editing in these is just the best thing in the world the edits are still distracting tryhard and cringe all the girls say hes pretty spry with the slide fly 445 everyones already saying everything about the cuts and memes what i wanna know is why is jesse narrating every tiny little thing he sees in the game dx i dig the progress i would prefer if the video didnt have cutaway jokes that stop the pacing of what is happening altogether i think a safe rule could be less audio edits while gameplay is on screen and any video cutaways should be minimal basically more subtlety thats just me though i might be super wrong please play shapes and beats again oof jessie the humor in this is rough man youre a funny guy you dont need this crappy edited in memes just made me cringe more than i enjoyed this feels like a love death and robots episode china in 50 years i love the narrator text editing and stuff i do feel like the massive amount of cuts is too much i like them in moderation but if i were you i would pull back on them a little balance is key still cant find this format appealing unfortunately its much better than the last one and i made it to almost 6 minutes in instead of two so i guess thats an improvement im really hoping you find a sweet spot with this stuff man but its still really rough i love the editing i love when the editor gets to flex a little skip the editing so irritating to an otherwise great youtuber much better i really liked this style of editing the you died from dark souls got me bravo oooo this game reminds me of inside oooooh hoh whoho burning daylight ooooooooh oh whoho burning daylight but another nope on the editing distracts from jesses own humor the map pop up was frickin hilarious wait are these heavily edited videos going to be jesse playing and then kristen editing them with extreme awareness and fourth wall breaking because im hella down for that eh this is basically chinas future realistically though in this scenario people would have the augmented virtual reality with various avatars including furries those 2 people banging each other should have been furries lol hey jesse i enjoy the editors commentary and the editing is a lot better than the previous so that will improve the inserted vids are not always that enjoyable tho jesse your videos are becoming unwatchable fast do we really need so many gif images overlayed all over the entire video whats with all the gifs all over the video is twitch binding with youtube now 1341 i think that is supposed to say weird shape in hebrew but it is spelled backwards i dont like how these videos turned entirely into jokes one of the best thing about jesses videos are how he can be engaged in the story and the art and stay serious sometimes the jokes on jesses videos are funny because it is in contrast to the rest of the gameplay constant memes cuts slowmos and weird editing get old really fast this is the reason i liked jesses videos in the first place too many youtube channels are turning into this please rethink this change this is much better than the days gone one but it could do with even less i think one or two cuts to memes and jokes can work but jesse can be funny on his own and this feels like way too much better than the last in terms of the abundance of cuts still not a huge fan of all the memes and heavy editing in the new approach but still an improvement the editor comments about genital blurring hell and laughing at jesse are good though more of that less distractingjarring kind of funny plz the edits and memes are pretty bad and not you anime butt billboards thats enough for me to give in to robot overlords your new editor i like them they do fun stuff very different to your usual content which i enjoyed muchly and a bit heavy on the references and cuts but still not a fan at all of the cuts to memes and other videos i watch you jesse because i think you are funny i could seriously watch you browse through a telephone catalog and make your silly jokes this i dont like jessy too much editing please i think the editing is good wanst overused to me it seems like this is how things are going the ruins contained knowledge we paid for it with our souls altars made of concrete fed with blood and bone wendigo attack this is the type of game i would never play but i would love to watch jesse play god the forced editing is so rough kinda reminds me of the skits on tgwtg reviews as in not funny and detracts from the video these cox tease videos are still too edit heavy if youre supposed to be making people want to play the game theres just way too much stuff that isnt the game in here now see 2035 is the you died part of the game or more of the overused joke editing yeah this style still doesnt do it for me hey really dont like the edited in audio not funny added nothing wish this was just you looking at it cracking jokes and letting the game speak for itself keep iterating on your idea for this series if there is one person one youtubbe who doesnt need help from edits to be entertaining its jesse cox too over the top with the editing imo less jarring but personally dont like the movie clips however better either way love the editing i couldnt stop laughing from all the jumpcuts well this sure is different jesse is a funny guy and i really enjoy journeying through a video with his commentary as he plays maybe occasional editor added content could enhance that but there is so much it is overbearing and becomes annoying its not at all that the work is bad it is just far too frequent for my taste well i lasted 25 minutes this time the fan friday format was alot better jesse youre funny and interesting enough without all this this just turns me away sadly these freakin cuts to random memes and stuff is so incredibly unnecessary i hope this isnt the new direction youre going in because it just does not work you are entertaining and funny on your own the random cuts are actually ruining a perfectly fine video jesse i watch your vids because i like you i enjoy your gameplay and commentary and once again this video showcases neither i dont want a student project edit i dont want totally sick video with awesome memes i just want gameplay and commentary your putting in more work and resulting in a worse product and i honestly havent been able to finish the last two videos because it was not at all what im interested in i wish you the best as youve provided me with a tremendous amount of entertainment over the years but if this is the direction you intend to take things then i think itll be just the sgs and doogs vids for me then new deus ex is looking pretty good jesse its way better than days gone but still a bit too much editing for me like i could not tell if some sounds were edited in or were part of a game for example 1647 i understand your situation i understand you want something new and that you have to change because of how youtube works now i am with you since terraria with tb 551 was good moment not forced subtle and i had a good giggle hope this helps you somehow ps editor comments were very good this is something you should keep in atleast for me i really like jesses editor whoever they may be great job very funny xd thoughts first of all i dont watch much gaming content anymore so take with a big ol grain of salt im not sure what this series is trying to accomplish youve stated it is to give people a taste of a game but the videos so far have been focused on your jokes and personality which is detrimental to the presentation of the game and the jump cuts disrupt the narrative the editing also feels all over the place it is not focused to one style suggestions the intro looked great and i think if you kept in that style it would focus the video more for example a vhs pause effect followed by some exposition from jesse gives a great opportunity for jokesmemes educating the viewer on the game and a good place for those jesse cartoons all without drawing from the gameplay and vhs fastforward effects work great for cutting forward while naturally preserving continuity and some narrative conclusions in my opinion coxtease doesnt have a clear focus or objective especia 2200 nice use of dorie this is soo much better then days gone coxtease im only partly in but right now im really enjoying it i think you are on the right track with this one jesse jokes made me laugh i wasnt lost or confused by jump cuts either what a tease reminds me a bit of some oldschool adventures like oddworld definitely better than the days gone vid but please just drop the meme edits wow production quality has gone up a bit at the cox house huh its a bit heavy on the editing for my taste though but jesse as per your outro pants were outlawed this is an improvement on the days gone video but its still quite disjointed and doesnt flow very well for me at least its supposed to get me interested in the game right i dont have enough time to get interested because it jumps to random shit far too often edit some of the editing is quite poor in this too the memey editing is pretty offputting i think youre plenty funny on your own as many others have said i had to stop watching sorry that said i respect that youre trying new things and not just stagnating thats important i have no problem continuing to support you as you hammer out the kinks i have mixed feelings about the amount of editing that went on in this video its like too much of a good thing can be a bad thing you know holy shit yes first of all this game looks dope as hell secondly please continue with the sass jesses editor i love you much better im loving this compared to the last video please jesse been subbed for years the editing direction is not cool i agree with some here the over the top cut aways are a bit much meow im fancy and a cat meow my heart broke more and more as the video went on knowing jesse wont be finishing it for us ill rephrase what i said on the days gone episode your editor is like the kid who discovered how to make 3d effects in word two days ago editing took the right turn on this one compered to your previous vid still bit too much but at least i could watch and enjoy it cheers is this like a vault but they make humans into meat for gods sake dont give vault tec any more ideas jesse you are super funny on your own without the jump cuts and over the top editing this just makes it seem like videos for children i hope this is not what you meant by time for a change i think youre on the right track good job again way too many cuts to bs come jesse wtf is this catering to fucking adhd hey jesse the director of the game here thank you for playing our game a bit too many repetitive jokes but honestly id say this is a clear improvement from days gone and probably some of the best videos youve made in years people might seem negative jesse but this really brings out the absolute best in your style of humor with some time to settle in with this new style of yours i think everyone will be really appreciating and i hope you enjoy doing it as well with regards a subscriber since the omfgcata days i still remember searching for cataclysm videos and stumbling upon your video on the day deathwing came that aquarium part straight up took an audio bite from finding nemo little nightmares and insides lovechild looks great jesse is now picking up the tog school of video editing nah sorry jesse but i think your channel just isnt for me anymore if this is the direction its going the constant high energy talking the memes the cutaways and edits it feels like youre trying to appeal to younger kids and it all feels so forced and calculated loved your channel for many years but this is probably it for me has jesse given up on sekiro the editor notes were hilarious on this not a fan of the editing if the coxtease series is going to go in this direction ill be skipping them as this style of video i dont find enjoyable hey man you are awesome like always but not a fan of the edits and memes am i the only one who likes the editing well this is an improvement over the days gone edit massacre good to see positive movement editing wise still has some annoying cutaway goofs that are a bit too much overkill but it is better the editing here is better than the days gone vid but i still feel that it doesnt highlight jesses humour and more like the edits are trying to stand on their own maybe only have text as edits to emphasize whats going on and jesses reaction still hiring that 14yo editor shame i came here to get away from that jumpcut memefest kinda thing oh well much much better than the days gone video this feels like a good compromise between noeditsatall and gettingwhiplash and it was enjoyable to watch this was much better the pacing is good and the jokes land personally i think the funniest editing jokes were when there was a sort of dialogue between you and the editor or when the editor went on a rant to much unnecessary edits mediocre content cox chinese social credit system in the future these videos are really long for the type of editing your trying to do maybe you should cut these down to 10 minutes untill you get fairly good at it i know most people like long videos but this format is not suited to it unless your very experienced this seems cool jesse so ill just pause the video play it myself and then come back and watch you play it also i can see som gentlemens hentai club influences in the editing here xd that editedin bullshit is retarded mate also im pretty sure this 333 is from fallout bethesda is going to love this please no cuts memes or tone it down to like 3 max jessie we love you as you are one of the reasons i watch your channel is because you keep it organic and relatable memes and cuts lessen the feel of the game your personality is the only thing we wana vibe on love you always tho bruhhh that kung pow reference at the end though always welcome dont let you dingle dangle dangle in the sand pick it up and put in your hand i think the editing could work but you need to tone it down about 90 and just pick the best few take a look at angory toms early cities skylines vids that had the perfect balance just a few jokes with the editing i dont want editor commentary i dont want family guy style cuts to jokes i want to watch jesse play a game cutting out slow parts is fine but i hated this it feels like the editor is an overenthusiastic fan of yours trying to get you to like them by constantly trying to be funny and inserting themselves in the video every 5 seconds someone is trying desperately to be soviet womble lol but honestly the editing far superior than your last cluster fudge odd game but that fall was hilarious in retrospect the game is like limbo patched in with cyberpunk style to it im alright with that jesse basically admitted hed betray everyone in a reaper situation without a second thought i really hate the cutting forwards particularly in a game like this it ruins the flow the edits of memes are not too annoying but they still feel wrong in some way i would still rather a full uncut version on a 2nd channel edit the one thing i really love though is the text on screen that i like particularly myself do like some of the cuts for pacing though i do feel like they should build up to being faster to give you a feeling of the game before speeding it up a danish game heretic i actually like this one youre showcasing a narrative i can follow without breaking my neck and your reactions and timings are spot on easy viewing good job what the shit is this shit have to be up in 3 hours see jesse made a new videomakes coffee and watches with a smile i like the edits that are just stuff going over the gameplay but theres definitely way too many and the ones that cut away for a meme detract from just getting a feel for the game 2051 2d animated lightning and explosion in an indie game nice 300 if you replace evrything with robots why bother taking signs like this down sometimes it feels like the edition overemphasizes the joke sometimes it just nails it and im sure given time it will improve to complement jesses humor perectly i like the editor commentary throughout loved hewill this is definitely much better editing than the days gone video but it could still use some fine tuning oddworld abe anyone yea not so keen on the editing was way too much you honestly dont need them your funny enough on your own hey i like this one a lot more than the days one change is hard but i would love to watch content like this if that is what you want to make i love the editing in these coxtease videos the jokes added by the editing are really great but the constant cuts messes with the pacing of the game and sort of makes the video feel frantic maybe you should leave in some of the slow parts of the game so it feels less like jokejokeplotjokeplotjoke everyone bangs except jesse and me apparently omg is that a hung person how was this not dick joke jesse of all the things this wasnt about dicks i really enjoy the editing on this one more subtle than days gone hopefully your editor is getting into their groove the editing seems to flow better on thos video and i enjoy the commentary and memes they were very related and adds an extra feeling of interaction its fun and entertaining with you on your own there is no need to have all the editing fire your editor and just play the game on your own sorry jesse i couldnt watch more than 2 minutes im glad others are enjoying it because this wasnt for me i usually enjoy these types of edit gameplays like funhaus but i didnt find this funny sorry im not helpful because even i dont know why it feels this way i loved the editing and want more of it dont understand all these complaints we just want jesse on a channel where over half of his videos feature more than just jesse i think jesse might be broken if he thinks this is what tease means your editor mustve had a lot of fun with your video it saddens me that you are going this direction i could not even finish your days gone and now this i miss old jesse vids i have to say the editing of this was amazing and i hope this is a sign to come for future videos three minutes was all i could take i dont know why you needed all those edits but it definitely wasnt for me too much meme too little game this game was a student project i think very impressive considering i appreciate you cutting back on the memes the less rapid cuts are also better that is a format i can actually enjoy thank you for that jesse im fine with coxtease just being a highlight show but there are to many meme edits in this it just doesnt feel like im watching a jesse cox vid still too much for my tastes just my 2 cents but please stop with all the meme and texttospeech cuts or at least cut back on the amount of them to me it feels like the editor is trying to shoehorn their personality on top of the video and it detracts from the viewing experience we come here for you and your humour jesse not memes and shitposts i know youre trying to change things up with the channel and i completely respect that but i dont think this is the way to go with the title i was hoping for sexy vampires i was both disappointed and not at the same time the memes feel very unnecessary and kinda out of place tbh but the editor comments are great i think memes can work in this context if there isnt a cut like the bowsette hologram bit i know the comments are yelling every which way but i think were definitely on the right track here after the days gone video maybe still a bit cut and editheavy but the editor commentary and little things like slowing down that falling apose so that we could see it are wonderful touches that make these videos good im sure youll find that sweet spot here soon or else well adapt one or the other its all good once again with the cutting and the highlights to a game that doesnt need it also how is this a coxtease when the game is obviously super short lol i enjoyed this a good amount more than the previous tease it might be the style of game is a better fit for the format or the team is just getting more used to it kudos i liked all the editing aside from the text to speech clips jesse we dont need memes to laugh along we just enjoy your comedy style ease up on the cuts to memes and videos images popping up in the scene are more tolerable but the wholesale cut aways to memes is a little overwrought i just wanna watch a video of you playing a game with commentary without so much bipolar editing so uhis there any gameplay besides walking and occasionally interacting dont like this new segment no elevator song i mean i know it was a lift but still same close enough we all know why hell play the game and its not for the violence much this was definitely better well done man i will say the editing on this one was a lot better than the days gone episode still a little choppy and a little overabundant on the references and cuts but overall im into it this editing is great keep it up since it seems like the viewership is torn on the edits ill put my opinion here too i like the edits a lot it makes the videos a lot more digestible now that i dont have as much time to watch full playthroughs please keep it up i agree with what others are saying about the editing feeling a bit excessive it distracted me from what was going on in the actual game editing is better this time i could follow the story much easier still i would much rather watch an uncut edition but i understand you probably wont post that since its a coxtease with game plays though please please post uncut versions somewhere i have been watching you since you played rage and id hate to look elsewhere for a youtuber that is a careful looter and cares about the story i love your videoshumor though keep up the good work the edits and memes made me laugh i like it i personally love the new edits makes me have to watch then just listen making it more engaging perfect amount of editing and cut aways thank you for listening to us from the days gone coxtease awesome work cox liked you went easier with the edits couple of them had me in stitches you are funny on your own jesse cutting to highlights is fine but the cuts to memes and references arent necessary way too much editing almost like the editor is using this as a demo reel to get seen by game grumps love this edit jesse thank you for easing up on the editing but i still dont like the cuts id really just like to see you experience the game as it unfolds and i feel like the viewers have a hard time following it as is there are way too many cuts and edits i think the thing about the editing is that jesse is funny just by himself everything else is too much and adding all the effects kinda feels a bit childish i guess maybe not childish but its like bang bang after every joke animation after the next after the next i think itd be better in moderation but thats just my two cents love listening to you talk regardless 325 theres a daycare eek hate to be the parents of a bad kid this gives me major inside vibes jesse its called burning daylight not light you silly fucking idiot billy hard to watch with the heavy editing a lot of us would like it more if it was raw or lightly edited thank you for censoring it makes it less awkward fullscreening this on a tv with my brother behind the editing on this was hilarious i personally dont care much for the cuts i would rather just watch jesse play and experience the game as he does incredible video earned audible laughter i dont know what it is but i like the amount of work youre putting into editing the video there is something very off about this format thank you for cutting back on the editing jesse your days gone coxtease was all over the place beans bitch seems like decent game havent watched anything other than seeing nudity part lenny face 1st tease that was quite a journey very imaginative the conveyor belt into the grinder area at around 230 had my framerate in 4k chugging around 19fps i have a 1080ti and a ryzen 2700x but it seems any area with heavy bloom and volumetrics in this game causing some frame drops understandable though for limited production size cool game great visuals and direction sees stripclub and tries to get in dammit game dev whoathat was a brilliant allegory the visuals were very provocative well done i want to play but when i get into the room at 221 it freezes on a frame of the crushers and i cant move hehe im the director of this game thanks for sharing my work man ive chosen the chair and get a dark ending wanting to play some high end pc games on geforce now this one looks quite fun its a bit like beneath a steel sky pointclic the orphan 25d indie game wow cloning and biblical messages galory wtf does the ending mean get the game from httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp1052070burningdaylight i got the third ending i jumped out the dome and got stuck its a shame ultimately it doesnt matter which one you choose as nothings happening after either one also the whole game makes you ask way more questions than how many it answers in a bad way pretty good video bro very white hey wow i have actual things to say about your vids right now havent done that in a while firstly i just wanted to say the game looks interesting but your title and thumbnail wasnt very enticing to click on if im correct you still cant make custom thumbnails right now though but a more exciting title would get more views idk and i was just wondering if you have a job of some sort yet or are you living off pennies you found under the couch lol hello fixxxer im reaching out to you to see if youd like to use my newly released game in your indie itch series its 2d minimalistic platformer frog which can be downloaded for free at httpstarkisitchiofrog the game can be beaten in a half hour or so if youre interested let me know thank you for your time rupture farms is people love it wow didnt expect such a big detailed world beautiful i think the people at the beginning are turned fat and then mashed into hamburger theres also a sign in the city that goes nutriman do not question the coins are probably a wink to the gamification stuff anyway the camera work and the framing is really nice loved it thanks fixxxer damn this really says a lot about are society whats dystopian about that seems ordinary 930 gotta love that transition to not have to animate putting the jacket on edit and then the pants get teleported on huh looks kinda like inside aside from all the scary redness and apparently being a walking simulator you can see the guys doodle 5 stars incredibly good but also astoundingly disjointed id love to see something maybe 3 or 4 times as long that really nails the pacing and fully fleshes out the world this is extremely impressive this one was an unexpected surprise this was actually made by 12 students the art style is amazing i am getting flashbacks to the final fantasy 7 cut scenes thank you for posting this trailer dude i just found this channel because this video was recommended to me on the steam burning daylight page you are fucking hilarious man i cant stop laughing at this shit just subbed awesome

off never have i seen a domeless man so happy to see a dick my dick is like a video game the jews chopped it up and sold the rest as dlc hopefully once they see the amount of support this game has they actually make a full version of this game full as in longer and it goes more in depth on the story too bad its over already this game could probably become something big if the devs would make a whole game out of it the end of this kinda feels like a cliffhanger 2050 it was at this moment that he realizes that his video will be removed from youtube and he is fucked stop steering my girls okay rero rero this thumbnail besto cool try the game for yourself its free httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp1052070burningdaylight nice video i subscribed and i also gave it a thumbs up since i helped you out can you view my latest video and give it a thumbs up ill appreciate it i heard this was a good this game reminds me of some of the underworlds in movies that are set in the future where all the rich people live on the surface and the poor outcasts and revels live below like demolition man man this game has an eerie feeling it looks great and i love the background sound effects what platform is this on btw i love that elevator music too just dropping by to check your channel out figured id start at the beginning this game was interesting as hell lol ok so the only difference between endings that the color of the credits background i f you choose to eat the apple the background is going to be white that could have a symbolic meaning or could mean nothinglike the whole game you can find a lots of symbolic meanings if you wanted or just nothing at all nice gameanyway i was hoping that by full frontal nudity it meant jeffs full frontal nudity for being a free game damn that was good people took time to make every detail of this game which isnt easy to do i would say it would cost 12 but since its free i bet this isnt just the full game 1005 scp096 wait are you playing scp secret

animals there in the game anyways loved the quality of your video sonokets commentary on this game is mostly like listening to a whining rendition of the three wise monkeys i dont wanna see that i

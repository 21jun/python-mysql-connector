this is a shitty game no thanks but thanks for sharing requirments this gaame for pc ive been waiting something more sofisticated stealth is good nothing more at all old original version is not worse its just matter of money profit i hope new se will be better my favourite is se 3 aproximately for its atmosphere se 4 is good but resistance nothing for me in this cause i like enemy front simple not very sofisticated but its theme is hit very good it will be difficult to make another part of se though rebellion could do something for their profit isnt it so these games are made at the same base finally do you guys know that u can shoot him in the testicles and show how the bullet penetrates the testicle its so awesome lol i played this game so many times i love it what are the changes of this v2 remastered care to share someone i cantt see a difference this game and the original version just the head model the gun sound and the tag system the best game 2012 hi gamezine id like to ask advice of what computer specs you have on your pc im planning to upgrade mine so that i could play heavy games thanks man hope you can help me out gamezine it reads buy sniper elite v2 remastered

title reads buy sniper elite v2 remastered special promotion offer ends july 9 price for this one is 2624 just dont want to make a mistake this is on steam still remember my noob style in 2012 version

zombie army remasterd i am waiting to see when this game comes out love this game why other remastering the awful v2 version which was nothing like the original when they could have remastered the wonderful original check out my gameplay of schoneberg convoy i played the mission on pc with sniper elite difficulty and no focus httpsyoutubekpbghuwq4cu cant believe idiots actually buy remastered games better graphics and they charge you the same as a new game fucking lazy money hungry developers and companies but the game is cracked so the ship will burn this game for mobil no this game play in 4k why you play 1080 p same game 2012 in 1980 jesus get a keyboard and a mouse and disable music its painful to watch you play with controller cant wait to get this game hopefully friday i want the cd not download the point is the original of this game had very good graphics as standard without any upgrade best part of the game 1247 whats with the crazy legs he looks like gomer pyle dancing good game but theres too much snipping youve closed the best moment at the end yikes they still left in that really bizarre hip movement when youre sneaking around its so distracting no offence but this doesnt have that good or a look compared to 3 and 4 are u sure this is the remastered look pc has amazing hd and 4k graphics capabilities i was expecting the remastered with se4 engine buuut nothing change but graphics fair enough for next gen consoles but for pc nah it looks like nothing changed though tbh but fair enough for next gen consoles oml that in game music is so irritant i remembet when my uncle bought me this game i was so much happy and it was first game that was running on high details i mean that 2012 version we have the ps3 versiongood enough stillwhy waste 30 on this we have sniper elite 34zombie army after playing sniper elite 4 i thought the xray kill in se2 remastered would be like se4 but nah i was wrong its just graphically upgraded but its not worth still feel happy to play se4 and 3 best series so far for what i can see it looks the same for me maybe the graphics are better but is that it why not use the tag system from se3 instead its the same lets hope for the best 145 how he playing lol it comes on 145 what can i play now on my ps4 it looks beautiful wow the only thing they had remastered is a visuals still no crouch sprint no improved expression of organs muscles and bones same shitty covering system no melee combat no switching shoulder viewsame level design of no chance of doing silent shotin this first missionthe industry need to stop calling them remastered and put a full price tagagainon a slightly modified sameold gamenot even that old imo this vid gave me enough reason to refund my remastered upgrade nicely done im going to get this game on ps4 good game but i beat it twice if you never played the dlc its worth it otherwise id just play se 3 or 4 again this is more of a shooting gallery as less opportunities for stealth and strategy as the areas are more open with many enemies ps2 games on the switch so its the remastered version of the remastered version i still play this masterpiece on my xbox 360 and one no need to upgradebtwit should be played without help of any kind so is this assassins creed wwii lol i bet these dumb developers still havent learned how to add a fov slider fuck these developers it worth 10

losers that cannot play without cheating should not play sniper elites steam needs a program that runs your system through it and deletes any player that has altered their system to play with bots and cheats great game but with too many cheaters it isnt fun if your playing multiplayer all the sniper elite games are full of cheaters now hell let loose has a lot of cheaters also why wont the scope work for me its not worth buying they didnt much at all that was painful to watch man they remastered it thanks for the gameplay dont waste your money this new version is almost the same as the old version not worth it the graphics are marginally better at best thats it oh sheet the nostalgia great game can complete in few hours tetraninja it reads only available for customers who previously

game a really great watch bro it was crazy when that tank came crashing through the wall firing at you i thought you were a goner for sure big like buddy really awesome video bro play totalwar three kingdoms i always find it funny how people think the only change they made was the saturation when they changed out the ai models and made the rubble more realistic wait even the pigeons did the salute narrator as my channel grows i continue to gain confidence that this could be my future job to entertain the people years later narrator now i have successfully have a viewer base but little did i know my job was not done yet tetraninja who the hell is talking wait they killed the dog why the fucking dog man narrator as i slowly watch the dog perish due to the hands of these video game characters i realised my last mission is defeat every game that hurts innocent animals and while on that quest i will acquire the skills to complete my mission what a memories with this game wow when the companies run out of ideas they start to remaster those headshots though should have shot the fuel tanks on trucks are you going to be continuing black flag when i was a kid i played this game but i didnt know what the difficulties were so i just chose the name of the game this was a bully i like the idea of this game but it just seems like a phone game gruesome and tedious im covering this game too evening buddy nice one mate cheers for sharing atb andy i played the hell out of this game on the wiiu they released it on nintendo switch i had no idea bro you miss one gold brick behind the buildin where you face the nazi sniper an snipe them while you go prone to cross the street do a walkthrough of warframe developers so how should we remaster one of the most popular sniper gamer ever some guy sitting in back lets turn up the saturation loved this game you should do a playthrough of zombie army trilogy who the fuck disliked this within 35 minutes of posting play more pls i watched

brothers subscribe war gaming channel if you like httpswwwyoutubecomchannelucddmzh4t45rgde1vuxarbowviewassubscriber tell me software for game recording one of my favorite games right here 54 th like 4th comment i love your videos the idea that you could destroy a tiger by hitting a fuel cap what utter bs your upload of this game is clearer than anyone else must have been at a higher bit rate i wish id seen your review because steam had this game on sale for 599 and i passed it up thinking the graphics dont appear to be great after watching your video i like it damn im pretty sure cojones is spanish 30 or 60fps better than 99 of games made today blitz i think they might need a tad more than ibuprofen maybe a grave yeah that would deffinately make him feel a bit better did rebellion pay you for that title there are 10 missions on that game and you need to find 10 gold bars on each mission to find 100 gold bars and they are 37 juice bottle you got to shoot down too find them all if you need help i will show you where are all the gold bars are my friend this game is and forever will be a scrotum sniper simulator im french and i find that funny that x ray zoom remindes me of mortal combat thats cool remember subscribing to this guy when he had 8k subscribers you not very good with this game otherwise nice video i loved this game when it first came out i played it for months till i could almost win it in my sleep great game please more i used to be a ww2 sniper in a previous life i found out after playing day of defeat as a sniper and getting flash backs and being rather good at the game oddly someone mentioned i should get regressed and find out more i was sceptical but stunned by the outcome good game but the remastered is shit 139th comment hi is the game at 60fps for pc or need 4k nice i loved playing this game true stealth gameplay as a single thread to the german army in mission 2 839 you can sneak and melee the first german then get behind the truck and do a double kill as they will line up correctly setting explosives on the truck at 1810 you can also set dynamite in different locations to take out the target with one explosive shot this is arguably my favorite game i love sniper elite 4 as well se3 seems clumsy to me im so grateful that they remastered this it was precisely what it needed now i can play it another hundred times thanks for the video consider me subbed the og sniper elite was the best all that cover in the buildings and you go down the street lol nice one i didnt realize red caps on air filters caused tanks to explode cojones is spanish love the 2 rifles actually showing on his back looks like the damn witcher of wwii how did we get the same name lol played this on xbox years ago loved it can you get this on steam this is fuckin joke where is sfastick on national nazi flag its disaster i remember at 850 you can get a stealth kill then the following two at 9 min if you wait at the motorcycle with the sidecar you can get a double headshot cause your round will travel through your first target miss the shot no problem leave that place controls in this game is very bad to bad they wont give first person view still waiting sniper elite 1 remastered but i want to play russian and japanese campaign when are you going to release both it is entertainment but no such a thing as combined arms in which the sniper plays are more modest role n a for graphics a zero for tactics funny speech it suits you to play the babysitter sleep baby sleep i think an improvement in the look of the bullet would have been nice was always one of the best games anyone who said this wasnt are fools bit disappointed that you dont take your time to do multi kills by using a grenade belt kill or laying traps like a true sniper i dont think its a game to rush through becomethesniper if you played it thru as many times as i have then you get to know where the enemy is and you can get them b4 they see you which is the idea of being a sniper game looks good but its still the same game and ive completed it fully on hardest level with all the bonus trophies lol you dont know how small a head is until you try to shoot it v2 the best hell no its too linear v1 was the best this is the only game which i played twice you could use the second planted explosive when the tank arrived why no swastika on the flags the game that nobody asked for is here for nobody to buy why are you calling all the germans hans hans is a swedish name why they remasterd this game when there are part 3 and 4 both on ps4 was it necessary not impressed after sniper elite 4 biggest beef is the controls elite 4 has far better controls so im only interested in an elite 5 release lol do you play this game with pad i miss this game so much can u still but landmine down and put dynamite on top of it or if you hold the aim button youll get acrosshire when youre using a sniper and you can shoot around the corner or any cover rata did you call you call the spring field a well not just subbed great video i played this game sooo much on the xbox 360 great game ill probably pick it up for my ps4 clearly you havent played sniper elite 4 just wish the kill cams were updated like 3 and 4 nope love the vids rap keep up with the vids of older gamesremasters is that realy remastered version cause the graphic wasnt clearly different with ps3 graphic naming everyone who speaks german german ok ok naming every german hans mind blown no need to update my original v2 waiting for sniper elite 5 the most ugly game of 2019 i playd it 10 min and delete it wtf that is not fuel tank on tiger but airfilters how the fuck u can blow up the tiger with airfilter hit omg they messed up the controls i havent played this game since the good old ps2 days looking forward to doing it all again soon why the game look rush like the sky and the lighting looks bad and it just looks like week and just looks bad from the lights but everything els seems ok continue with this series more please very entertaining i was highly distressed you didnt have any nasty xray testicle shots p gg bud play more dont worry i got one in se3 ive seen how they make the sound effects and now i cant stop thinking about them when a bullet goes straight through the fuel cap on the tiger is actually the filter change for the air purifier loved ur commentary in this one dude dude you never played this game before the story of one american sniper and his personal vendetta against fascists testicles o7 i just love how berlin is just littered with huge boxes of caliber 3006 ammunition 0xc000007b idk why my specs are i58400k and gtx 1070 ti 8gb ram the ch in reich is pronounced like the ch in cheese oh and its a quite educational game you learn a lot about anatomy missed the 360 noscopebut other then thatit was a nice reviewthanks for the vid mr raptor dammm the graphics are insane you couldve used that first charge you placed to take out the tank i love ww2 gameplay very2 much thanks so much raptor it is a great game i spent hours to play with it by xbox360 i want this and marz how in gods sweet creation got you time to do all this do you never sleep meta or what please remember that you got a life to dont wanna see you burn out bro is this a 60 game or 30 graphics on this game is amazing i can binge watch this series lol bots seems much smarter in my opinion but ill have to take a further look in previous version bots will register hits on players with mp409mm above 300 metre range to deny the soviets or the nazis a weapons program im confused cause you said hunt nazi generals to deny the soviets hey raptor you can ambush that whole convoy use dynamite in the middle of the road put down three for best results you didnt go for the head 100 says we hunt down german generals and rocket scientist to deny the soviets from having a weapons program not the nazis i lov e this series there is so much potential for this game vietnam korea iraq etc my question to you raptor is this game while a mostly a work of fiction based on the kinetic side of operation paperclip you forgot to shoot the gas tanks in the streets and i think if you time it right and the right position the first charge you put out you can take out the last truck of eh convoy first and with the second charge on the truck you get the armored vehicle and the second truck in the convoy means less opposition to fight against play sniper elite 4 plz more of this love the game man keep up the awesome vids if that first guy had a 3rd eye in his forehead before you gave him one then he would have seen that coming ahh 63 views and 94 likes iconic finally a better experience for shooting hitlers cherries you could also schoot their grenades on their belt i get this game in 3hrs at gamestop in seattlecant wait to play this fully this time i will as well livestreamps i love your ostriv playthrough godthis game give me such a very huge nostalgia his hips wiggle at certain points looks like hes doing some sort of dance haha that tiger looked sexy why the hell are you shooting russians because i snipe those nazi because am better then all of you will i always do steatite missions because am steathyer then all of types of gamers karl fairburne voice is amazing this was one of my first games on pc i remember when this game come out i still have it on ps3 they did a good job remastering this its a good game but i felt like the detection meter shouldve changed remastered sniper elite 1 would be perfect ok guys just some feedback from a big fan the sound and graphics are great love how you guys focused on the rifle fire sounds and updated the bullet cams along with the bullets themselves one thing that i feel you guys couldve focused on was updating the characters body mechanics sniper elite 4s body mechanics were pretty awesome with the 360 degree view and the casual walk when in a passive state but here hes still kinda stiff thats pretty much all i think couldve made the game better than it already is i think its pretty the same with the original excellent video show congratulations ill pick it up when its on sale looks great though the sniper elite games have always been awesome keep making them please sniper elite is the same game from 1 to 4 only it gets worse and its the same fuking gamesand these guys got no clue on other then repeat themselfe and steel out money with the same game just another year from 1 to 4 its about the same fuking thinghehehand now a remake to top it yeah thanks for putting all youre time into this instead of expanding 4s multiplayerreally great next sniper elite 5 vietnam war is good idea jungle sniping game looks great graphically and a big shout out to the sound guysits great in surround soundcant wait to see what sniper elite 5 is all aboutkeep making these games i love them you are a wonderful team the game has changed well and the sounds of the weapons are very good well done rebellion on pc the fps is locked to 60fps got it for the switch new to the series gotta say its pretty damn good when this was playing on my play through there was no sound at all maybe a bug wow beatiful i must buy this game id like the frist sniper elite game re mastered and improved guys please fix the bolts of the springfield kar98k mosin lee enfield mk4 and not mk3 the scope of the svt 38 and not 40 is not correctly grab on the rifle this remaster has more bugs than the original the weapons animation are bug and the magazin from the lee enfield mk 4 and not mk 3 is bug too its upside down seriously well i got the game now but not from gamestop they were only sent one physical copy and it was reserved by an employee which is kinda bs they knew that they were only gonna get one not me so why allow it to be reserved by an employee just said screw it and got digital even though i hate digital copies i hope you can finish the evil earth destroying simulator before the earth is actually destroyed rebellion how you get the red square using the scope honestly i say this as a huge fan this remaster does not look worth it unless your new to the series finally a remaster sniper elite game beings back memories since 2013 i cant to get my hands on this thank you for this beautiful remaster game 1452 did he fart by the way if anyone running the channel reads this theres a typeo in the description box saying talk your prey as opposed to what i think its meant to say stalk your prey just thought id give you a heads up man i gotta mow the lawn but then ill have the money to grab this and im looking forward to it thank you for remastering v2 how bout making a snipe elite vietnam game based on carlos white feather hathcock now that would be an awesome game last mission for nintendo switch this is weird is not in 1080p60 old version karl was better what now do sniper elite 5 in ww2 and russia killing that russian in the end would russiastarlin see that as an act of war good job team rebellion we see remastered zombies next one day you guys should consider making a game during the soviet invasion of manchuria in august 1945 it would be a few months after this where you fight both the japanese and the soviets you are trying to stop the soviets from getting japanese secrets or maybe even a sniper elite game during the korean war i would like to see karl come back as the main protagonist when will there be a sniper elite game set during the cold war ok now fixe the weapons bug actually v2 is more of a sequel to 3 and 4 the end of ww2 i remember the first time playing this memories i told you guys i would have the first part up later today i really enjoyed this game years ago this game is 40 us dollars it is a remaster of the 2012 game the graphics seem to be improved but not where its easily seeable karl the main character his face was changed a little bit the next part i will be going after the next v2 scientist look i dont think anybody cares if ur good or not and u just had to say i played on the hardest difficulty just shut up this opening was tough for me to watch cuase im russian and the world war 2 battle on stalingrad and multiple other battles i hate these games for the reasons of what my country became after ww2 and chernobyl years later allot of the scientist that developed the v2 rocket would later go on to lead what would become nasa in the united states and a few went to work for the soviets i remember when i played the very first sniper elite game which i stumbled across it at a local movie and game rental store and rented it i never beat the game but i did have fun playing it i was playing the original of this game while you were playing this they are both the same game but this has better graphics and quality but i still like them both hey man i remember in like 2012 i used to play this all the time love it its very nearly the same intro to a particular stage of moh underground do top 10 or 5 planes or helicopters what the hell happened to the swastika what kind of revisionist history bullshit game is this can people pls help me in gta 5 prison break heist set ups and heist pls cuz one one when i put auto invite on wow man great work your a great player d keep it ip hi professional i loved this game still play occasionally also is it just me who thinks the speed of the

shoot anyone in the balls is this guy who that you playing german brings back me these memories how this even called remastered after watching some of your gta streams i can picture you sitting in your chair whenever i watch a video of yours now lol also i prefer play throughs like these unlike the live streams because some of them dont include the whole stream remaster is so cool pat i love how you are very knowledgeable of our past history you probably know this pro but the remastered version allows you to equip any weapon right off the bat press r1 twice in the loading screen and you can change your loadout and use any weapon in the game im going to buy this game tomorrow what this is not a gta grind video unsubscribed jk played this its awesome co op is just brilliant i have the

break off gta 5 yo whats up pro i have this game and play it first gta san andreas walkthrough cant wait to watch moving let alone quickly was never se2s strong point 1108 smoking is definitely bad for your health i have ptsd from when i played zat solo on this map those bosses are no joke no gold and no bottle no sass just full throttle to this day this mission still gives me issues on sniper elite difficulty stringing together 8 snapshots is tough to do when theres no range and youre pretty much using kentucky windage also i get killed in one shot alot on this mission dont get me wrong this game is great i just need more practice a little rusty getting it today if amazon get their skates on so looking forward to playing it againstill one of the best sniper elite gamesstill been playing sniper elite 4 at first i disliked the mechanics of this gameim playing them backwardsfirst experience was with 4 got the ultimate edition for 3 now the remastered version of v2 i knew there were going to be some changes sure but i didnt expect karl not having the ability to heal himself mid combat didnt expect for you the player to press l1 and not see your inventory not to mention karl moonwalking and the enimies being as easy to set off even on cadet getting used to all these things now but i gotta say i love the fact that you can see entrance and exit wounds the fact that you see sparks fly and hear that tink noise when you get a headshot and the bullet goes through the helmet i noticed you guys had the sparks and tink noise when elite 4 first came out whyd you guys take it out best part of a headshot right there oh well regardless love the sniper elite series rebellion look forward to seeing where you guys take it from here is this game in 4k please make a remastered sniper elite v1 i buy v2 dont get me wrong i loved that game but v1 i stil play it and stil loving it i love his running sound soo damn awesome bullets ting ting ting ting youre going to solve the problem of modeling weapons right oh yeah one of my most favourite maps wow iplay this game its goooooooooooood a defrend sound and graphic and more good job team god the nostalgia love your work gentlemen looking forward to the next installment personally i dont know why they remastered this game but im glad they did because i love this game my fav of the series back in 2012 and still holds up very well today its been a blast playing through it again of course more changes should have been done is it a problem that my game wont automatically go to a sniper scope or is it always like that both are better i would consider buy the remaster as i dont own the original but not for the current price additionally levels looks painful familiar to zombie army trilogy dafuq is this thats laughable 2012 graphics still look like 2012 well to be totally honest i like the original version better specially after seeing this review cheers idk if its the angle or what but starting at 259 just compare the environment shadows etc why does the remaster look like dull fucking trash i didnt got the original when it was released in 2012 am glad i can get the remastered edition for my nintendo switch happy it got a remaster as i didnt play it on last gen wow what a rip off i enjoyed the remaster but the 2012 version was the best wow this is a really lazy remaster glad i didnt buy it and stuck with the original and again the original is better than the remastered my computer bad i do keep in mind that rebelion studio does not have a huge budget remembering that i do appreciate that they indeed tried to improve in some areas instead of just porting the game to next gen remaster looks more cartoon just because of the bad ao effects a little bit more would have been nice i still would rather not pay for it twice old sniper elite has that bullet trail and it has a better looking karl although the remastered one has somehow better sounds old one still wins the only thing i like is that i can play it on my ps4 but other than that it was a pointless remake sniper elite v2 is one of my favorite games so i didnt mind repurchasing but not everyone will feel that way im just a huge fan of this series i never understood these sniper elite games you have this gruesome xray kill cam that shows the kind of damage youd inflict to organs muscle tissue etc witch is pretty much one of its major selling points yet no bodily damage has been caused after the xray has ended i would love these games if they went all in and had body damage to match the gruesome xrays i want a remaster with metro exodius graphic this shouldve been a remake not a remaster remasters just seem to be lazygreedy attempts at exploiting your nostalgia ask for remakes not remasters that was the developers can fix all the issues of the original game not enouth changes to worth bothering with too many minor changes we had a skyrim re master now the funny thing is the game modded looks better and thats free lol too little improvement and i also like the shockwave from the bullet time in the original because in the remastered one is non existent solid remasterjust a little improved port for new consoles like they did with assassins creed rogue actually they could have add more like movement im just happy to have this on ps4 now rebalion changed gun sound with sniper elite 4 it doesnt good rebellion are plain and simple lazy trying to cash in on an already released game this series is a wasted potential ive said it many times before cool in the beginning but the turn off are those awful gun sound effects and the price seriously i love the series but come on total cash grab sev2 is essentially unplayable given the major gameplay enhancements and advancements there were part of sniper elite 4 italia had they remastered the game with those play mechanics id have been more inclined to grab the new version it hasnt stood the test of time on its own 050 nearly identical you are joking right like almost every remastered games on ps4xbox are worthless not a big differences easily buy sniper elite 4 looks more like a slightly edited port to me this was just a simple texture mod original is better if you ask me this is more like a demaster than a remaster old is gold this would have been more than enough had the game been a free upgrade from the original considering that upgrading costs 10 i would have hoped for a little more oh mythe picture in the background at 050 in the video is more clear in the original compared to the remastered versionand the walls they shouldve remastered sniper elite 1 lol bw for squimish people or whatever your videos are really good well done for your work and as for the game i think it should have just ported to nintendo switch i think it was unnecessary to remaster it for other systems from the thumbnail i thought the left one was the remastered remastered version looks cartoony so glad i watched this before buying it again i would rather a sniper elite 1 remake then a low effort remaster of v2 personally the remastered version looks like a con so rebellion can squeeze a little more money our of its customers there is nothing to recommend it i especially hate the games antirussian themes very racist what why a remaster of a game thats not even that old cant go back to this after playing se4 for over 300 hours id prefer more dlcs for that to keep me going until something better comes out sniper elite 4 graphics still look greater even if it was older changes nothing changed old v 2 allredy have good graphiksso im not see much changes cose im playng this game since from 2004 so from v1 v2 v3 v 4 v1 we are played allot and have allot funso when thay made v 2 v 2 haze best i thinks maps and graphiks v 3 is not really goodv 4 its best maybe if theuy mix thoghether v2 and v 4 will be soting like this naaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh not much diferntif they make somting thy need make good like this for me personally its just weist of monie does the remaster have quick savesave slots or is it checkpointbased like the original how are the controls did they use se4 movement they need zat chapter 4 i think id get the original i was thinking about getting it but i wanted to wait and see how it looked different compared to the original if they made it look like sniper elite 4 with all there textures then i would definitely get it why does the remastered version make him look like george clooney weird old is gold great review running on a 1080 and ryzen 2700x at full ultra i too noticed the nicer textures dotted around the place although id really be hard pressed to see where there have been changes made unless i played both versions like for like the biggest improvement i noticed was the more immersive sound yet this appeared buggy with incorrect volumes for off screen germans wrong directions too loud for being far away etc i got it cheaper so it wasnt a massive loss but i wish i hadnt even the dlc which i did not have before wasnt in my opinion worth the extra money thats just my opinion its not necessarily wrong and its not necessarily right just personal to me thanks for your video i like this game and i like to get platinums so im ok with this remaster they should have made a remake make it open world like se4 for me the first game is needed a remaster this is one of my favorite franchises but i see nothing here to make me even want to pay the reduced price for it only changed the characters face honestly like the bullet slowmo better in original release im not gonna buy it i have the original its better original game looks better for me and sounds better there is no remaster ahahahahhaa shameless cash grab should have been free for the existing owners of the game on steam the bullet time does not show the wave around it anymore i thought that was a cool effect i mean this isnt as bad as the ac3 remaster the light is overexaggerated in the remaster everything becomes washed out remastered in 2019 increase the brightness thanks for saving me money ill stick with the original version and wait until sniper elite 5 eventually comes out the reload in the old sniper elite 2 was very load and echoey that makes not sense cause im pretty sure reloading shouldnt make much noise and its nice that they improved the weapon sound its a little more realistic might as well go pirate the original lol what a waste of time anyone else thinks the old one is better what a fucking joke spyro is a remaster crash is a remasterthis this is a fucking insult this looks like a lazy remasterwhy do it ever ray tracing would have helped it its such a good game but this didnt do it justice a ww2 with no swastikas because someone could get offended by the historical context if anyone reading this hasnt already got the original version of this game then go for the remastered version by all means but for the rest of us avoid i love the sniper elite games but in this case remastered is just another word for refund at least on steam in the remaster they made karl fairburne look like the sniper elite 4 karl instead of v2 its just an upgrade comparing to the shitty console versions comparing to pc ultra its a joke of a remaster 141 reminding people that a trimed bush looks better in 2019 despite it is very little done i still love it very much and it is great to replay this classic sude why cant remasters be like cod mwr thats a remaster redo everything they put into the game besides the sound smh shame the game is a masterpiece but i still play the xbox 360 version on xbox one so there is no need to purchase the remastered cant see much of a difference remasters are the new black i guess everyone sem to want something for nothing looking at skyrim se it seems to be a deremaster thanks for this great video btw did developers just forget how to remaster games why dont they remaster the original one that was actually good the bullet trail was removed why that is kind of the iconic feature of this game in my opinion not much was done but at least they didnt just up the saturation and call it a day cough cough assassins creed 3 cough cough some minor improvements and thats it i mean cool but couldnt there have been more though the argument that this is a rerelease sounds like what this remaster really is a way for people on current gen consoles to experience the game release on next gen plattorm but the graphic wasnt so much different if companies wanna make a good remaster look at re2 remastered remastered win 100 another shitty remaster this game isnt even worth a remaster worse then arkham remaster imo the moders made older one look better overall another half azz lazy remaster i have never played either so i dont have a dog in this fight i prefer the original character model the remastered one looks like hes wearing a rug i also prefer the sound of the sniper rifle in the original it sounds less compressed and has more of a crack to it everything else though including the sound of the thompson id probably lean towards the remastered version switch beated original why the heck do they dont remastered the first game instead i enjoyed playing it on my old computer why dont save it till ps5 comes out should be better than the older version thanks for covering this sniper elite v2 is what got me into the series back in 2012 i personally dont like the improvements seeing as the good ones arent that dramatic and i think some like the shadows with the hard edges dont look as good but i like that they spruced it up some because like you i think this was more just a release aimed at current gen consoles i think they just need more people playing the series and releasing this in an off year is good while they work on se 5 remastered version here weak not worth it the old have better efects like the bloom in the bullets or the fire in my opinion the fire is very ugly in the two games they should have done allot more i own the original without the dlc which i got for free so purchasing this version for 699 with all dlc is a win win in my opinion this is not a remastered game they just added some textures and ok this is a game like ubisoft did with the ac iii a remastered game is like the last of us when it came to the ps4 no fucking need of this the original looks much better anyway ripoff really its just a hd port at first i looked at the steam that has mostly negative reviews i thought thats another review rig but after looking at this video i dont see that much of a difference of course im comparing the visual delta of assassins creed iii remastered and its original as a benchmark for the amount of change it was made 10 bucks for a new hair cut lol all the changes that are kinda iffy it makes it all worth it when you hear the new audio sounds much better i think the character models look very different to me the lighting in the game along with the occlusion effects are much more pronounced welp at least theres the switch version how many useless remasters are we going to see in the future thanks for the comparison im just going to wait for a price drop now back to rage 2 so remaster is remaster the shadow and remove the lightning effect why there is no sniper elite 5 world war 3 is just fighting in computers so you can be in world war 3 without getting hurt d a little detail is that they removed the original one from steam last i checked this is just a shameless cash grab ps3 to ps4 is a worthy remaster still deciding to get it tho i dont think its as bad as it looks yes visuals didnt change much but there are a few treats under the hood like hdr 1080p4k resolutions extended lods smoother performance and a 60fps modewhich should be default tbh original version had better karl model and a better looking bullet for those longshot cutscenes stick with the original they couldve remastered the original game how the hell does the 2012 player model look better the new one looks like he spent too much time sunbathing in africa or got some mad sunbed like the ultra hd pack from r6 siege only that is free and for this one you have to pay less than 5 if u own the original if not 10 on console it is def worth there are huge differences to the old versions play the original on extra hard one shoot enemy know excatly where are you i think they shouldve just released it for consoles only people would complain and demand a pc version but this is what happens even more angry people original one is pretty well done that remaster is completly unnecessary holy shitballs your channel is terribly underrated its not a remastered its a hd mod ive never tried any of the sniper elite series but they have been on my radar for a while now can anyone recommend which one i should start with which one has the most interesting narrative and level design etc and which one i should maybe skip yep i was thinking the same thing i was hard pressed to see any reason to repurchase im not going to stand around and move head in out of the suns rays just to see the god rays shift around my noggin pass how can this be called a re mastered i can say tho that alot of the sounds seem to be taken from se 4 specially the guns but meh i like it tho so im pretty 5050 about the remaster as i own the original game im able to buy it for 999 on both steam and xbox but i can see how people can be dissapointed about this remaster as it sits at 35 i think and doesnt offer that much thanks for the video nick i was going to buy the game but now i dont money saved thanks to nick the most unnecessary remaster ever i mean what was the point meh wish they had done something with the warriors instead most remasters seem to look worse than the original pc version running at 4k we should remaster bf v asap xd i recently played through the ps3 version and it was great its such a cool game but it didnt need a remaster especially not such a sloppy one this has to be one of the worse remasters ever made along side with bullet storm and hard reset dark souls remastered basically what a unnecessary remastered not a good remaster but the gameplay of se v2 is still very good the problem is the price too steep sigh looking forward to the fifth one at least they should have skipped this and instead make a remake or a remaster of the first one pathetic remaster original in the best rage 2 has major performance issues may be because it uses the same apex engine of just cause 4 it should have been optimized as an fps game could you put those controversies to an end i am waiting for your review and comparison with rage 1 50 au dollars for this if you dont own original what a fucking rip off literally no difference plus shadows dont look realistic in remastered version i agree the upgrade for those who have had this previously is completely pointless my thoughts as expressed under another comparison video my opinion not worth the upgrade note im on pc and own the original version the context of my comment is the x required to upgrade in more detail 1 lighting has indeed changed and made more dynamic does it make it better to me not really as the effect on a pc is actually quite minimal in fact it lightens the darker corners eliminating some of the shadows which always felt nice it makes the game shinier but also less gritty the single plus for me is that it does make things appear sharper and clearer in the night missions but ultimately the change is not particularly substantial 2 textures in some cases the difference is so minimal as to be completely pointless the ground is occasionally enriched with more vegetation and or debris minor touching up here and there is present is this a crucial element that i damn i need to sub to u now love ur vids and this remaster is just another cash grab ill use reshade on my original version adjust some sharpening tonemapping even better outcome why devs remaster games that dont need remaster there is only one good thing in this remaster and it is better gun textures they have ruin the ruined gamewhy good comparison but imo it lacked performance metrics was the fps for example the same across both games assuming same pc specs i just like this scenery for multiplayer original 2012 remaster 2019 wow not even 10 years and remastered i get a doom 1 remaster or crash bandicot but this game is not that old its sad to say xbox og and xbox 360 which are enhanced on xbox one x look more like remastered games than this sniper elite remastered is it only me that i think original looks better higher res better especially in the hands of people who dont know what theyre doing his hair bolt guns dont clink when they round sets off lol so many games add this clinking noise you would probably get out more by some reshade not worth buying if you have the original the old its lighting and texturework just look more cohesive the very sharp shadows on the remaster and the jarring effect changes like the over saturated flames just make the game look cheap who ask for this tho this game needed a remake with the campagen end etc etc so they gave the character and called it a day cool why did they remaster remasters these days have been dogshit this is not a remaster any difference this all started with burnout paradise remastered now companies think this is a decent way to sell a game again with minor improvements we should be able to tell the difference in an instant there should be no questions who is the original or not so the main character change his races this is why i dont want a game to be remastered old haircut and face was better people that complain about the game and say no you shouldve remastered so and so game are annoying you do realize if they remastered your favorite game it is going to be the same as original but the remaster will only look slightly different question is which title did they show more love console or pc useless and pointless remaster remaster looks worse than the original lol and that is remastered looks like cheap model swap and lightning if there are no title i dont know which one is remastered main character when walking slow is moveing his legs fast thats still funny bullet slowmo without effects dont look that relistic they should add balls shots and other hitpoints from new elits too old version is ugly so remaster is ok but good remaster i wait for update 321 after i watch sound gun comparison the old is the best one ill stick with the original which i got for free but cant remember why how do you remaster an older game that is far from perfect and fall so far from your fan bases expectations when remastering looks worse than original i bought this game in the presale i was disappointed lol whos idea was to remaster this i think theyre taking the piss meh the springfield m1903 is still using the wrong gunshot sound snipers sound better in original and automatic weapons sound better in the remaster can you do a comparison with the switch version good video turn on the brightness remaster nearly every time i prefer the original game he has less hair due his is oldernow we have se3 and 4 in which are from earlier in the warnice touch sniper elite reshade edition 30 pounds and thats it oo some games just dont need a graphics upgrade look at the arkham series that looked way better on old consoles than the new ones game is so much fun on the switch just milking an old title as far as i can see tweaked rather than remastered to be honest they could have released a texture pack and it would be still the same the most useless remaster of the century whens sniper elite 5 coming i already miss the sounds of old springfield its the same fucking game greedy bastards does no one realize that the textures in the original were actually much worse even if they were more detailed rubble doesnt look like that they looked like plastered pngs not to mention the change in the ai played the original often enough to know the vision cones and how quickly they would notice me and on veteran it was pretty easy to sneak even if they became suspicious now they notice you in half a second if you arent in shadow or prone and now bushes actually mask you from their vision not just vice versa unncessary for pc we need new versionnot rerelease its something like sleeping dogs and sleeping dogs definitive edition well the only thing i will consider to rebuy this is the fact that i will get all the dlc for free truly it is controversial and real big fans of sniper elite franchise will love it no matter if its good old or remastered and im a big fan too its my favorite game and honestly i kinds agree that the graphics havent really changed much but to me the sounds of weapons and environment are way better and also those nice benefits such as the new characters added photomode and multiplayer now up to 16 players in lobby both are perfect hands down are the missing bullet trails intentional or a bug and why hasnt that been pointed when its the most obvious difference the reason why his skin is darker and looks different is because sniper elite 3 is a prequel sniper elite 2 starts immediately after sniper elite 3 how did they manage to make it look worse what a disappointment doesnt help that they removed the original on steam and made the remaster 35 bucks if only more games committed to the full remastered treatment like halo 2 gow other than just changing color and shadows and calling it remastered meanwhile im running the unremastered version on the lowest settings possible on 20 fps i prefer the old version before looks better why just why this game is a joke very poor remaster on most of the comparisons i prefer the original version they certainly wont be getting any money from me would be great if the game actually launched reinstalling it to see if it will work a 2nd time should have at least been updated to run on the newer engine its my first time buying it but on the switch im a big fan and supporter of this series but this is one of the slightest remasters ive ever seen ill just stick to original one worst remaster ever total cash grab heres a little suggestion for a video if you even take those compare the battle royale game cuisine royale to some of the other battle royale games like call of dutys blackout or maybe pubg the game is not quite finished yet but in my opinion it looks very impressive especially if you consider that the game originally started out as an april fools joke in my opinion it beats some of the games with bigger teams and higher budgets behind them like call of duty by a lot and might be worth a look no matter if you even accept video suggestions or not i still love the content you make especially since im looking to get into video game development and therefore have some projects about it in school and thanks to your videos i know some important things about the visuals that really help making our project look a lot better i liked the new sounds but unfortunately not much has been changed and it is another cashgrab rebellion i believed you but you disappointed remaster is supposed to make the game graphic more better looking and add more things to it not removing them i think this was an unnecessary remaster they should have waited until 2022 to do this original is way better i like the original version better what is the difference beetwen remastered and remaked remastered in every game looks the same to me w t f the original overall looks and sounds better to me remaster max payne 3 a game we actually want i was expecting longer sprint and some other things that would change the gameplay kinda disappointed but still its good that they did something at least wait thats remastered the tree is a joke 142 thanks for this nice video mate i played se 3 for the first time recently and hated it so much that i couldnt get myself to even complete it this looks more ww2ish to me and the setting is better as well i might end up buying this now d like the original looks better man the rifle in the remastered version sounds like a fucking antitank rifle 404 also you can see here that in the remaster distant shadows dont disapear where it does on the original i think the original has better sound the echo sounds much more natural to me i remember having this game on the original xbox not sure if it was on playstation platform always thought it was for pc and xbox only will most probably buy at some point going to wait as with most new games they seam to go on sale not long after all the pre order sale buyers either way will get it this is what happens when dumbasses are on reddit jesus christ this remaster looks like took them 5 seconds cant be surprised though to be fair considering all their games are near carbon copies of each othernot to mention the main character doesnt look better at all it legit looks like he got trapped in a tanning bed for too long just another way to grab your money if you do a remaster do it properly ie call of duty modern warefare too little too late but yeah i agree that its probably meant as a rerelease more than anything else its still a lazy remaster though what they remastered it what a fail ahhahah normal one is much better with effects and all ahahh yikes wow w8 how many sniper elites are there now and whats the remaster of what i thought sniper elite v2 was a identical remaster of the first sniper elite and zombies where then addons to this v2 wich is remaster of the first and those three r then the sniper elite trilogy sniper elite 3 and sniper elite 4 r new games so where does this fit now s dude the protagonist looks like a different bloke i want sniper elite zombie army 4 tt wow the gun sounds are horrible in remaster i never had the dlcs for v2 so as they are included in v2 remaster it might be worth 7 depends on the quality of the dlcs wtf the orignal is so much betterrrrrrr the visuals are marginally better but the sounds are noticeably better though still an unnecessary remaster though original looks better for some reason made a 2012 game look like a 2014 game but made the shadows look like a 2005 game yes do up the shadow resolution but also soften the shadows otherwise they look like the hard stencil shadows that games have been trying to avoid for over a decade money hungry bastards wow its fuckin nothing remasters are fucking scams at this point all they do is fuckin up the contrast and edit acouple things only remaster that was good was mwr i will say the slightly darker skin makes sense somewhat given karls previous ops in africa and italy so the orginal looks better than the remaster but i like the new soundbut yeah still not going to buy it just saved me 40 bucks thank you 053 they gave my man a fresh trim i thought ubisoft is bad it remastering its the same game with some small tweaks not worth it i am the only that preferred how in v2 it would cut to behind an enemy and show the bullet hitting but with no xray i kinda wished theyd done more of that in 3 and 4 cause in those games its a lot easier to get xray kills but that means they get kinda boring after a while or 3 if you didnt want to buy the expensive total of dlc its a good option because they gift the game but dlc is fucking expensive the new gun was high poly but the lighter texture of the wooden part sucked there are missing effects of a fast flying bullets cinematics one of the most important part of the game lightning was not better soundscape of the old one was more rugged and better cant see anything better in remaster since start to end of the video oh and the super sharp unrealistic remastered shadow lol add some apparant downgrades and there u have it the infamous ramaster cool game but the nazi zombie army games are much more fun i think the originals are better as the remastered versions in the trilogy game were nerfed a bit no thanks great now with the remaster i cant buy the old version in a cheap price i have to spend more to play the same fucking game i wouldnt say remastered more like relighted why did they remaster this game and i cant really tell the difference very little done changes doesnt really seem significant maybe it would look very different for people who played it on 360 or ps3 i never got to play it on the previous gen so would be a good opportunity for me to pick it up they should remake the first sniper elite game that is a pointless remaster a lot of the stuff was better on the original if they are gonna remaster it at least put some effort into it compare ps3 with the ps4 remastered version you will find big difference pc to pc with ultra of course it would be normal difference i mean i never played this and everyone in the comments are straight booty cheeks so why just why nice rerelease rebellion sniper elite v2 remastered is a miss why developers dont remaster some old great games like halflife or dawn of war like they did with shadow warrior they gtad the game lol meh very very poor remaster simply done for a cash grab if you are going to overhaul games like sniper elite then at least do everything instead of just throwing in some shitty textures and slightly improved models i own all the sniper elite games and dlci wont be buying this sev2 2012 was thee game which hooked me back to gaming it was my first ps3 platinum its rather disappointing to see the rm version offering nothing new in fact there is no shoulder swap at all on the rm they added a few extra layers of gfx but the overall game hasnt changed it feels and looks very very rushed and karl is quite jerky in motion lets hope se v v5 is nothing in comparison of course this is not to say the new sev2 players wont actually love this game i would encourage you to play it if youre new to this game and you do get the full dlc pack with it which is only a good thing i have fond memories of comp mode and met a lot of interesting people on mic from all over the world the comp is brilliant on it though but theres still those maps where others can cross over kill your character and teleport back to their side of the map this put me of playing it za trilogy is your best bet for an interesting but intense sniper campaign and comp mode thank you people are morons for buying this trash clearly just a money grab its like the new acceptable thing all the gaming companies are doing becasue those morons buying the remake however there should be need of sniper elite 3 remastered i think they should pay attention to sniper elite 5 texturesgameplay another poor remaster it seems 2019 is a crap year for remastered games i love this game so much but the remastered is such a downgrade whos buying these games doing something more would have been risky because changing elements of the game could have ruined the experience that the original game had slight improvements could be done at se3 release it had to be more better than this yet still the old one has better textures in few places despite the level of object clearness why would they remaster this its not like anyone is playing these games for the story just buy one of the current gen sniper elite games pretty weak remaster seems useless imo i want sniper elite zombie trilogy remastered not a very significant difference i have played this game and its very much fun hiding the original looks more realistic by far texture packs are now considered remasters what a time to be alive the original still be best kind of reminds me of the bulletstorm or bioshock remasters somethings were good but overall the originals seemed way better in visuals and especially audio i was thinking about buying the remaster but now im not so sure lol people please dont buy thos obvious cash grab make them lnow they wasted their time doing nothing greedy bastards deserve it i just played remastered version this afternoon not bad they fixed ai when you want to stealth kill they should have done morefor the price they are asking from original owners you change blood effect to white black pitiful remaster it better run well on the nintendo switch what happened to just doing this and calling things hd like resident evil or mgs3 if all theyre doing is swapping some gun models and textures its not a remaster its an hd rerelease and this one in particular is pretty lazy who asked for this honestly im not sure about this one im not gonna be picking it up but more power to whoever is gonna never played the game but the older version looks more consistent and better higher quality textures dont really matter if they dont look right i knew this game is like an another assassins creed 3 remaster because of the little gameplay from the trailer why is this game being remastered lol the hair removal is silly and why did he go from a white guy to a mexican for no reason even his eyebrow got shaped differently youre essentially paying to have more complex weapon models and a racial change in the protagonist everything else is barely noticeable things they remastered smh cash grab after seeing gta vs remaster or resident evil 2s remakeremaster and that one final fantasy remake coming out later on this is disgusting lazy work it seriously went the ac3 remaster route where it somehow looks worse than the original they legit look the same just like the dark souls remaster not much of a remaster am kinda disappointed to be honest also the gun sounds were better in the original imho i feel like the remaster is mostly for consoles the 360 version of se2 looks like oatmeal the remaster is much improved this is joke d if somone have orinal and buy this remastered version is fucking idiot for sure d well it looks like im still gonna be playing my 360 copy on the xbox one then they want 10 on upgrade steam version but this is more patch than remaster that you need to pay lol your comparisons are the best on the youtube lazy and unneeded cash grab with little effort or work put in a rerelease is just a waste of money eat dick rebellion the original looks far better didnt know there was a remastered version ill get it on switch usually i get older games on my pc but if im getting graphics similar to the original ill get it on switch to play it on the go thanks you just saved me 10 i already own the old one but havent played it yetsteam backlog is nuts and was considering getting the newer more polished version but yeah looks like that polish is sparse and paper thin the remaster could at least have hdr i feel after seeing the resident evil 2 remake all remastersremakes need to model itself after that type of quality in a game personally i think the remastered version looks much better very poor effort remasters should be done like the cod 4 remaster that game was pretty much rebuilt from the ground up that is how you remaster a game damn nick you were only at around 5k when i started watching you as always keep up the good work and thanks for this comparison a rerelease rather than a remaster like you said still though those that missed out on this should pick it up its a good time burner all these rubbish remasters are making me not want mass effect anymore i can only think of two remasters substancially better than originals tlou and skyrim pass original seems better for the most part the springfield in the remaster sounds like the nossin gargant or what ever that russian sniper was called this remaster downgrade worse charakter faces better object graphics and new models defuq did they focus on look how they massacred our boy sniper elite v2 regiveusmoney they remastered a game that isnt old its safe to assume that the guys who made the original version are not the same who made this as a programmer i understand how hard it is to make a good game and mechanics involved in the gameplay that said if they could make the first game with great details with improved hardware now 7 years later they could have done better than what they came up with it could have been done so much better not worth it this game is backwards compatible on xbox so the remaster was really only for the ps4 users the games graphics werent bad to begin with i honestly would have been okay if they hadnt done a pc remaster at all its nice to be able to pick something like this up across multiple platforms can you do a comparison between v2 remastered and sniper elite 4 u will make serious sam 3 bfe vs serious sam 4 when planet badass will launch in my opinien the original sounds were way better and louder especially the shots were more pushing in the original razor and toothpaste remaster i think this is the worst remaster would prefere the old one great comparison i dont think i would consider this a remaster at all i like the older and newer for differen reasons and youtube needs to make it so blood doesent have to be sencerd thank you for always doing these videos nick you always display the best comparisons and your reviews are thorough and informative i almost always watch them before deciding to buy a game keep it up to me its barely any better but i see it this way i havnt played this game in ages since like 2012 or 2013 its 10 for me since i own the original i wanted to replay sniper elite v2 after the release of 4 but didnt yet so for 10bucks ima gonna defintely pick it up bcuz it looks a little better and i wanted to replay it anyway so definitely works out for me great video btw lol y did they make hime black old one looks a lot better to me other then the shadows who asked for this i dont see the point of buying the remaster unless its cheaper than the original at some point which version has the better performance i like the original better its not worth the remaster if its not a great improvement over the original what a poor effort the original actually looks better in many ways shameless cash grab at least it comes with all the dlcs not like far cry 3 and add something to the game like photo mode and changing the characters but the graphics i kinda like the original one than the remaster though just buy the original i was looking forward to this but im underwhelmed 12 normal version 16 remastere thats all i need i think personally its among the worst possible examples of a remastered game looks like the original with a couple of small 3rd party mods no wait the mods would be more effective and free i guess its ok for those that dont have a gaming pc and only have access to a ps4 or xbox one and didnt own a ps3 or 360 and or this game but they have done the bare minimum possible thx for the another video also have question am i the only one who dont get the idea of remastering more or less fresh games i mean that concept of remaster is a cool thing and can give a new color to a faded star take any game from 90s or earlymid 2000s but making a remastered version of a pretty new game is not that sparking imho in certain cases remaster doesnt make a huge difference slight change in audio or maybe some polished skins and it doesnt blow a fresh air into it i may sound stupid but thats what keeps me puzzled for around 23 years or so why are they charging 10 for upgrading to the remastered version when the games look almost the same gearbox gave away b1 remastered for free if you owned the original one why are you comparing the same game unnecessary remaster with very little done well saving more money for ps5 is better ok i cant be the only one who likes the original better from fire to texture to wrinkles on his forehead looks like they downgraded some of it i feel like the old is better sad enough that german games have to buy the remaster to be able to watch those gory xray finishers they are not in the original version x your comparisons are by far the best on this platform keep on going m8 every remastered game must be free i hate this shadow sharpening shadows arent sharp in real life youd have to stand directly under a lamp to cast a sharp shadow sunlight shadows are fuzzy dont the game devs ever see the real world well its okay but not a very big change i was expecting xray comparison please do a review of rage 1 nick what s the difference betwen first version of sniper elite v2 and remastered edition sniper elite ni lagi best dari call of dutyhidup sniper elite indane graphics this game was my first sniper game and the first for my xbox 360 game it was is and will my favourite sniper game good play mon amie classic and best sniper elite simply and atmospheric ai seems blind and dumb as a box is this on cadet difficulty ive been playing since installing it at 11am this morning i love this game i forgot so much about it ill be playing this until se 5 comes out i was hoping you would add in things from the later games that i liked like collectibles nonstealth melee kills and customizable loadouts oh well ill see that in sniper elite 5 im sure i started playing the game d much love to rebellion 3 why why this mission wasnt on my se v2 rem this scene is in sniper 4 neudorf outpost reminds me of the mission from the first sniper elite game quite reminds me of that mission i was buy the game i love it we need full remastered version of first sniper elite what is this the official story singlegameplay fab game any chance of letting us know if there is a new sniper elite in the pipeline and if so can you include more street battles is this a new level had this game on ps23 and cannot for the life of me recognise this area o what does a soviet tank do at a nazi base guarding her is it serious is this a single player game or just multi player is this ps4 game or computer game how can i download this is there anyone give me link you can get 4 trophies on this challenge 1 round easy how does this compare to the ps3 version over the course of watching some of these games i noticed that even though it is carried weapon few know of the true silence of the wellrod pistol be that in this game or the real world i played sniper elite 3 and 4 but i have not played v2 and why is the sniper elite 3 ultimate edition does not have the assasinate hitler lee enfield magazine is it british humor this map remind me the first sniper elite game good playing devs it reminds me of nazi zombie army 2 i bought this on the day it was released but only got to play it this morning it looks and sounds great but having played the first level im not all that enamoured im afraid it just felt like i was just being put into several small scenarios where i had to kill people and get to a point where thered be a cut scene and a predetermined boss battle of sorts very linear and restrictive i bought a ps4 just to play se4 and metal gear solid and ill buy a ps5 just to play se5 i have original version of sniper elite v2 on my steam accout so if i buy the remastered will i also get all dlc maps etc with it or will i have buy them separately new maps i live for the german accent of schwaiger great stuff all the action and no sodding commentary like other sites on here showed me just what i wanted i made gameplays of this game back in 2014 such great memories pretty loud shoes for a sniper i love this game and all sniper elite games some body must have found that springfield please sniper elite 1 remastered his boots are louder than his gun the video had heavy spoiler to the audience know perfectly which spot would spawn the npc enemy and shoot normal run plus collectable are way more than 16 minutes im having loads of fun playing this remaster fixe the bolt bug please its remastered and the original weapons are not bug animation for the reload sniperelite1 and sniperelite v2 the first was the best of all because it saves the real world of a war the new versions 3 and 4 have a lotlot of fantasy and colors too saturated the game has to keep the traditionvisual rebelionthanks by remastered 4k great great game i played this last about 4 years ago good memories d can you guys remaster alien vs predator game really needed this guide heh the russians theyre our allies just as many glitches as the original you played so well i am gr8 fan of your game playing specially this game but brother really i am surprised that why someone dislike well you are little bit faster but after all you are professional one of the best level of sniper elite v2 good playing devs some of those gut wrenching grunts when carl is pulling himself up to the next level sound like he is leaving his hemorrhoids in the dirt this game is really fun on sniper elite difficulty i figured id give it a try on this remaster sniper elite 5 cold war or japan new protagonist please make a sniper elite 5 i really enjoy playing them great thank you this game looks amazing i have never played it before i have only played sniper elite 3 and 4 i cant wait to buy this game i do have some questions though is there binocular enemy tagging is there triangulation and relocation any silencers or silent ammo booby traps i cant tell if those things are available from watching this demo or if the person playing is just going nonstealth still looks great though and im very excited for it cool gamewait sniper elite 5 im new to the genre with se4 and fell in love at that point i bought se3 but found it to be somewhat a step backthough i still played it on my ps4pro trying to decide whether or not to get the remaster or not never played it the first time round have well past 2000hrs on se4 and counting hehe you play at your game yes so your not blind and you see the bolt rifle bug the bolt animation are bug you take the weapons model from sniper elite 4 but isnt correctly in this remastered fix it pls hello rebellion i love and i have all games but i have one wishplease support the sniper elite 4 with hdr for ps4 pro sniper lite 5 in stalingrad like this game because sniper lite 3 and 4 was not very well the russians theyre our allies im waiting for your reply how you upload the gameplays video without copyrightsdid u face any problemsdude give me some tips dubsmashking21gmailcom how to download this game i want to play one of the best games i was played nice game bro its time to hack it wheres sniper elite 5 owning the original game and all dlc i expected to get this simple graphical enhancement for free because that is what other game publishersdevelopers do lets say i am somewhat disappointed optional 60 fps mode who wouldnt want 60 fps i love this better game not worth it not worth the upgrade love my 360 version so its the visual but not really the mechanics like sniper elite 4 the best sniper game i only ever played the demo of this and really enjoyed it so i might give this a go if its cheap enough game is too played out to be remastered woulnt even finish it its already on xbox one suckers needs more added to it to be even close to being worth getting when you sharp the image or video this will happened like you see in the video nothing remastered remastered call what we see in resident evil 2 why only ps4 tho if the original is on both playstation and xbox why isnt the remaster on xbox best game on the planet thanks rebellion i have to play my ps3 version again we need max payne 3 hitman absolution remastered just play sniper elite 4 lol optional 60 fps means the game is not a stable 60fps otherwise 60fps would be the default shouldve just waited for the next consoles to come out and released it on that they should remake it better trash meh not worth the price if u have the original that awkward moment when i can already play this on my xbox one since its backwards compatible so optional 60fps mode so ur not powerful enough to do 4k 60i mean im not suprized but still nothing special just change graphic thats it stunning 4k hdr visuals alright dont try it too hard kid its embarrassing wtb remastered gameplay when bullets from guns are not acting like airsoft bbs with insane droprate after you shot at more than 50 meters range so basically 360 vs pc graphics comparison they should remake ps2 game basically a pc port of se2 for consoles are the dlc free finally a remaster ubisoft should take note greatbutwhen gran turismo 3 remastered people saying this is unnecessary keep in mind they just announced halo for pc 18 years after it released did any one asked for this i think i can do this all over again yeah why not why not se v1 remake cool im still playing zombie army trilogy to death cmon rebellionmake another zombie army game graphics changes remaster any gamer girls that like anime and play these games in particular call of duty fairy fencer f socom 4 rage infamous 1 and 2 naruto storm 3 mortal kombat hyper dimension neptunia borderlands like and comment if you do and give me your gamertag remastered cool doesnt really look remastered we want medal of honor warfighter for ps4 is offline game if it is i want it im tired of playing weak games with no realistic stuff like blood and gore decapitations remastered but it doesnt have tessellation to cover these polygons 040 and doesnt have parallax mapping 042 just little better textures level of details distances shadows no better animation no tessellation no parallax mapping more physics objects nvidia physx for pc a bad remastered why sp too short mp sucked with a few exceptions it looks exactly the same bad mistakenot buying now could hardly see any difference i love sniper ghost warrior much more its barely better how about some soviet zombies if the 60fps mode is optional then that probably means its more of an uncapped framerate mode like in hitman or infamous no difference whatsoever i literally just started playing after gamestop opened i took it home just installed and played for one minute and now it goes back to the store there is only soo much they can do with remasterswhy just focus on making new games ffs im a fraid i cant tell the different soooo this is 4k huh can you remaster my 60 back when the game released nobody asked for this socom remastered when when you have to pay to turn your settings to max the same at least its a decent remaster not like ubisoft with ac3 its free right should have put more thought into the strange brigade before this the game was fun but very short so we just not gonna talk about how this 2019 game doenst have raytracing we want socom back ffs i wanted this on pc but was waiting for a sale guess i can get it now lol why waste their money on this remaster this cant compete with the shooters we have now sombody gunna get fired lol or just get the mod of it remastered original sniper elite would of benefited from a remaster this is a great game but the remaster looks meh personally i find the original sniper elite v2 just fine on its own and it doesnt really need a remastered version lolremaster weapons useless remastered not of any use it was as same as before do this for zombie army trilogy and im sold im 95 sure people want dead space remastered day one get for me but might get on switch to play on the go where is draftabyss007 the best player that game is coop 505 games yo we need some money what should we do game designer lets put some other texture with new lightset in sniper elite 2 505 games awesome remaster black please thats what all we need i never got the game so maybe or i just get it on last gen hmmmm ok now when resistance fall of man remastered this isnt socom 2 remastered im confused this game doesnt need a remaster such a great game played every single one of them i really enjoyed playing sniper elite 24 great games remastered creativity did they even try to remaster it honestly 60fps for a remastered title probably should be a baseline and not an option but at least its better than what ubisoft is offering better off waiting for next gen who asked for this so a ps2 game that was remastered for ps3 gets a remaster for ps4 a classic in its day but cmon probably buy it though when a bargain zombie army remastered certainly looks better thats the point with my xbox one i can play the 360 version and its 12 years ago i dont need remastered games for the games i already got and for the hater yes i got all playstations too just for exclusive games but i am xbox gamer so next remaster the ps3 free online function the remastered version looks like sniper elite v2 with full settings on a pc i think the original is from a console they should show every remaster like this remastered again why not make something new i have ps nowso this isunnecessary lol this visual upgrade should be free upgrade just like borderlands completely unnecessary in my opinion this hardly even looks better you want to see a game that actually got remastered take a look at grim fandango remastered or modern warfare remastered any of the halo anniversarys those are remastered games this is just slapping on some slightly better textures to old models bumping up the resolution and calling it a day this is essentially just the pc version on max i finished it on pc years ago can anyone tell to ubisoft to watch this video so they know what remastered mean is i prefer older games fun and easy to play modern games tend to be complex and more of a cinematic experiences im surprised this isnt on the switch all they do is remasters you guys should remaster black ops 2 it will do really well we all live in the age of remasters that looks the same as the originals with even more bugs than the original and even more brightness than the original but even less detailed than the original too lol a better looking version of the same game for what the same price i hope not only remasters ive seen done right are shadow of the colossus modern warfare remastered and resident evil 2 please i really loved se v2 but its dont need remastered people take it only if its gonna be for free theres not that much difference and plus after 4 i wouldnt play one of theese again nothing has changed very nicebut wheres the new sniper elite game huh this remaster will be 10 by next month original for ps3 because this remaster is pretty much pc on ultra settings the game was ugly back then and even remastered still ugly not talking about graphics only but a lot of other aspects like animations etc i hope they will anaunch sniper ghost warriors 4 maybe for ps4 and xbox onenintendo switch pc if not then ps5 and xbox 2 4ds what would have made this a big sell for me is if they had included the xray tech from sniper elite 4 looks like actual effort was put into this very cool really add funny missions 107 seriously yall just scammers now sniper elite v2 is best original or remastered still awesome im thinking of getting this now since i heard it has 60 frames perseconds please remaster the sniper elite 1 because it is the best of all sniper elite parts is this a joke the game looks the same a remaster which nobody even care about lol it looks equal xd woah so much looking cooler childs game sniper elite are actually awesome games so the draw distance and texture quality of the pc version what a time to be alive friends what once was called a port now is called remastered changing cocepts to sell at least you can actually see the difference sniper elite v2 remastered released in 2012 but exclusively on pc the original one is on low graphics another game to the who asked for this list i think this is only a cash grab to those people who never bought the original game so many remastered games these days who asked for this also looks marginally better but definitely not worth a rebuy a remaster that is actually an improvement if only all remasters would do that shut up and take my money hey look its another quick money grab they kinda look the same tbh ac should learn remaster stubb the zombie perfect is it free this probably didnt need a remaster when will this stupid fad end anybody else sick of these remastered games at this point shame they didnt remaster the animations as well still looks stiff as a plank this and a plague tale innocence on the same day great early bday present from me to me a better remaster than ac3 no one asked for this if its not too expensive ill buy it thanks to 4k resolution the game looks better hahah remastered weapons lol a new jurassic world evolution i love the original game this is going to be awesome so the building at the beginning i love the movie enemy at the gates about the historic sniper vasili in stalingrad i recognize the inside of that building as begin similar to the one in the eatg during the scene where vasili and the two other russian snipers are taking cover under a downed aircraft so i looked out into the courtyard and sure enough theres an airplane there at about about the same spot as i saw in the movie absolutely loved that why sniper elite 1 the creators gave you a semiatumatica pistol with suppressor and a more updated game v2 and lll give you the welrod that does not give you any advantage seems co2 pistol better would have added a sprig would have more range hahaha i wanna play as german sniper kill churchil and stalin lol would you mind to add audio in new missions beacause karl himself is silent through out the new missions you made sniper elie 5 in russia and stalingrad ww2 this is best snipe elite challenge stages is very hard to get that trophies ich kann es nicht tun ich bitte um hilfe was this a dlc on the original i dont remember it is this included in the console version lee enfield magazine is fucked up like do something duh clear after a couple minutes sorry jumped the gun very blurry on my screen at 1080p hd hmmmm looks like you are not so much experienced in snipping so please act like a sniper not a rookie pro sniper always aim headshot please upload all the parts of this game hello please vietnam warfare game upload please gotta watch this with a popcorn i think besides karl the original looked better looks the same thx for the vid saved my money and to be honest i think the original looks better most the time karl looks better in the original thank you for the movie because it was useful wow one of the first times when remaster is more realistic the original and they called it remasteredoriginal was way batter why this exists its just like the graphics are in ultra really a few extra bricks a couple of shadows that are still pretty bad and a bit of extra foliage and i do mean a bit here and there and they call it a remaster rather than just a rerelease sneaky cheeky bastards this should have been a patch for owners of the original surely wow what a shit remaster a few years back this was not the definition of remaster yall dumb af have you ever played either of the actual games reworked lighting textures and even controls and this doesnt qualify as a remaster stop watching the garbage cutscenes and just play the game and or quit your bitching protagonists hair looks worse on remaster this remaster is full of useles details its time to split its downgrademaster this game didnt need a remaster at all i cant call this a remaster tho this is bullshit this is not a remaster cod mw was remastered orignal is best texture mode reshade remaster cuz thats how it looks to me a minor resolution support upgrade and literally unnoticeable shadow intensification and extremely minor texture upgrades are not enough for it to be called a remaster lmfao this is garbage literally that license plate is enought take my money xd come one man thats not a remastered its a big shit come one is very very similar only to spend more money thats practices must be illegal crows funding generation for sniper elite 5 und why the fuck original looks better except a bush and 12 rocks looks like texture pack from nexusmods the first time i see game original is better for remaster is most be free game in this month priginal is more real remaster is cartoon graphics at least dont crashes often like the original in the original if you mark with the binoculars the game crashes wow holy shit it looks the exact same this is better than ps4 vs ps4 pro i am exited to get thison the switch but it looks almost indeticle steam donated sniper elite v2 for me but i never play it at all now i want the remaster version of it of course for free u think im spoiled who they want to fool how tf is the original better speaking shortly the same shitremaster as previous ac 3 era of a good game remasters has been officially deceased after cod mw i dont care put me down for 1 i havent played this in years ps4 totally pointless and unnecessary this version from me there is no money for something like that lol a boring remaster of a boring game the original is better should i say wow thats it doesnt help they took down the original on steam well if supporting this game gives them more capital to put into sniper elite 5 then take my money going to be really honest here what an awful job here in some aspects of the game the original version looks far superior in many places of the game especially the colour stands out a lot more it looks like nothing as changed only the screen is far more brighter with dull images on the remastered version of the game and with a bit more background images thrown in but nothing to warrant buying this title again something wrong here better textures and shadows but color and contrast were destroyed not worth it unless buying on switch another joke called remuhstered some places looks downgraded the textures are a lot better but what have they done with the lightning everything is way too bright now no one no one ever developers ok we will give you a remaster worst remaster ever made even mods from community achieve to make old games to look 3 times better than this dissapointment does the remaster come with a lee harvey oswold skin as a pre order bonus pretty bad it doesnt add anything special i dont think this game really needed a remaster lol original looks more remastered than remaster version this is a remaster hey man we remastered the nintendo 64 texture you used on that jeep we were gonna roll out a patch but we decided to call the patch a remaster and sale it instead we are the smart pause at 028 added a little grass here and there downgraded the detail on the hat and made the backround blurrier downgrade scam remaster waste of i could tell be the trailer a graphics mod is better than this nothing is change not mutch of difference remastered is white picture and original little black sorry my english i from russia looking for the hipsters saying how the original is better why would they remaster it anyway lol it had great graphics and its also short campaign totally useless i have already seen it somewhere ac 3 remaster worse than the original only studios with creative impotence make money this way but the most interesting thing is that there will be people who will buy this shit well that was disappointing nothing reshade cant fix did you guys even watch the damn video its like you dont know the difference between a remake and a remaster this is a remaster its not going to have crazy good graphics looks like some minor changes brightness up only thats a joke right dof effect is miserable barely any tesselation was added textures are barely better shadows are better but for real not much of a visual difference skin tones are looking bad some of the lighting seems wrong the contrast seems boosted not sure if it has hdr or not this is only for fans imo i would like to see crysis truly remastered the game until today gain so much from higher resolution alone the maximum mod allows no lod and no pop in which makes the game really outstading a new lighiting new textures would do wonders in crysis what a fucking shit this same game for money this is not even remastercrapthis is not mod this is nothing even the fire looks better on the original looks the same looks like a test for their new game which will possibly include ray tracing so they just added a texture pack and some grass it is not a remaster this is govno ebanoe in some cases original looks better imho should we stop buying fakerasteredgame if you dont want to buy remastered version then dont but atleast they remastering old games for us with quality why the fuck do you guys keep tagging mortal kombat how much did they pay you produces the same thing and still calls it a remaster wtf sniper elite v2 is still good looking game that dont needs to be remastered its the best example how to try sell game two times the remaster looks a bit washed out if im honest some of the textures are nice but the black seems a bit grey put some volumetric light here some stones rune and grass here and maybe a tree here remaster this should be a free update 034 everything is good except for the glowing characters i dont understand why developers love to make characters glow with their remastered version just like dark souls remastered lighting is so much worse now call of duty 4 remastered is what remastered should look vs the original not a fucking downgrade like this wtf looks more like a resolution update than a remaster so the protagonist became a different person when nobody was looking v2 remastered has a good sound quality also karls haircut i hate it v2 original has a details and i like karls haircut also i choose v2 remastered i choose that because i need a sound quality yep the original looks better for me the original is better the remaster not good very very well done comparison its just a re publish to gain more budget for sniper elite 5 though they did bad it doesnt worth it still the last one is better this remastered is a tomadura de hair 023 face downgrade and walls behind them its not a remaster so it looks more washed out and theres some better textures lmao would be much more fair to consider it as a porting the first part with the cityim confused which is remaster thextures on the right are better but the detalis on the leftshadows on the left oo i would hardly consider this a remaster the remaster looks undersaturated and overall worse can we now all agree that remasters are generally a bad idea original better then remaster textures are so shiny its like a comic book come to life with every detail perfect in remastered great memories with this game for once i wanna believe that hdr makes a difference but i just cant cuz there is no difference another remaster that didnt really need remastering thank you i know copied this video and mailed it to ubisoft and explained that this is how a remaster should look like hint ac3 remaster never played this when it came out looking forward to playing this next month there is such little difference its not worth buying cant see no difference lol wheres the testicles bursting in 4k glory wheres the hd testicles the remaster no one asked for how much is this game something like 10 better to remaster the original sniper elite but idc about this i have it on pc so pointless buying it pc what way better graphics if u played it there then no need to buy it again now thats a game the best sniper elite game also sniper elite 1 the legend for sniper games i would like if it was available on new consoles look at ubisoft see how make remastered ac3 remaster sucks btw what of the psvr thing they was working on first i think its trailer of movie hats off to graphics i love this is gema goodyear please do not ask gta questions here i have a gta video coming out tomorrow please only talk about the review or any other games you want me to review i really did enjoy this game i am currently number 5 in the world on survival it is challenging and very fun the x ray kill cam and the unique story make it a great buy but for players wo have already played sniper elite v2 i would hold off until its on sale they probably detected you because you have the difficulty cranked up high once you go passed normal difficulty the ai gets more hyper aware of the player pretty much xray vision great review and brilliant accuracy i was really hoping this would have added sniper4s animations at the very least please someone tell me if i can change keybindings as if i cant im not buying it he just graduated from college i thought he was in like middle school as a player whos played all of the games in the series and had v2 and 3 on both consoles id personally recommend if you want an extremely engaging experience get sniper elite 4 im not saying this game is bad for new players but dont expect what youd get for a ps4 standard as its a port true fans would get sev2 twice as i did myself long story short its a great purchase if you want to get into the series i bought sniper elite 4 italia at walmart for 10 bucks in the clearance section can i be your friend in ps4 please id bought for pc the other day the hell let loose a wwii sim for 30 where a match of 50vs50 can last from 20mins to 2h i think that for 40 its not a fair price for the sev2 in this day and age what did you study in college may i ask i have recently bought a vehicle warehouse in gta were you sell cars did you think i made a good choice isnt this the beginning of enemy at the gate love that movie if you havent seen it and love sniper movies its a must hey the professional ur not tht professional keeping a channel alive doesnt worth it if you already played it great game tho for last generation console owners looking to try this game out for cheap most game stores that carry this game sell used copies of it used for less than 5 usd in almost perfect condition you should try the last of us just go on steamunlockednet it will be free like many other pc games like bo3 incl all dlcs no its not i play sniperelite3 please put back your intro it was really good its one of the only intros i actually enjoy listening to you make these games look really easy congratulations on finishing college pro very informative review ill have to give the game a try i dont really think its worth the 40 because it only has 11 parts to the storymode excluding other sniper elite games so id rather wait for it to be on sale theprofessional is a god of knowledge and knows everything about all games that he has played the professional please read this ik you dont like gta5 comments but this is important and i want you to hear it im a huge fan and yeah was reading comments from a video a year ago on what happens if your bunker gets raided and people kept accusing you of modding and it just got me so upset because i know how much you worked for that and how much 500k really means to you they are just bad at the game ik you have a life hope you hit 1 billion i will be watching the stream to see it just a little info the collectables wine bottles gold bars exist in the old version too they are not new in the remastered version keep up your great work greetings from germany proyou should try resident evil 2 hey the professional i know this is a gta 5 thing related but its a very important question is megalodon shark card worth it when theres a bonus for an example theres a deal where if you buy the megalodon card you will get 6m more within 74 hours the offer ends in june 21 you can see it on the gta 5 loading screen youre done with college thats awesome i hope you continue your youtube career though it was my first sniper elite and loved the game i think its worth the money i want to say if youre into shooters and you have a switch i recommend it incredible game for a portable device if you get it on pc or console its best if youve never played it but if you like sniping then you may also enjoy it as well on those devices have you played games like the witcher 3 i feel like you would enjoy it coming from a fan of the franchise dont bother the games graphics havent aged enough to warrant a remaster at all it really doesnt look all that different from the original they had the opportunity to fix the biggest issues of the original which were clunky movement and cover system and seemingly rng based stealth system enemies can have their backs turned on you and still somehow spot you when youre approaching for instance it would literally just require copy pasting what they had in newer installments but they didnt even bother to do that they didnt bring in the more advanced fancier xray killcam improvements from the newer games where you could see alot more body parts being damaged story like in every other se game is residual and is not exactly the selling point something that every se game is guilty of yet somehow i feel it the most in this one is the bullet drop i get it that they had to implement it somehow but it feels like youre shooting a is there 60 fps on the base ps4 oh yes nice remaster the gameplay never gets old cant wait for se5 one of the most immersive addictive and entertaining game franchises i will never tire of should i buy the original one to understand the story if you own it on steam already its 10 upgrade really sounds like a bummer for those of us that already spent money on all the dlc but want to play with friends that just got the remastered i liked cod ww2 story i dont know how it is in america but here in germany where i live you can just upgrade sniper elite v2 to sniper elite v2 remastered for 999 euros 1121 usd and if you ask me i would say you can uprage it in the us too but as i said i do not know ok i know you said not to ask any gta questions but bro i need people so i can do my heists im getting board with gta nowi need a new gamegta needs some new stuff because its died months ago like my comment first probably i love your channel good luck in the future preciate your videos the professional is the man with all the information the go to guy thanks a lot pro is the best gamer ever your the best pro im waiting for the copied and pasted comments yo bro keep doing you you tha goat hey im the first love your reviews your the best pro they still havent fixed the gewehr 43 magazine count seriously 505 seriously rebellion i think im gonna pass on this game they shouldve fixed this issue this game shouldve been remade with sniper elite 4s engine the original is more louder the remaster it has a good gunshot sounds old broke mosins bolt remastered still original was way better downgraded to hell disappointing cheeky cash grab you forgot to compare the mp44 stg44 the blyskawica webley mk4 and the tt33 overall sounds have been improved imo but ppsh my god what happened to ppsh this no the have us m1dgranad 762x51mmnato in sniperelite v2 remastered wtf they ruined the game in remastered they could have at least added v4s gunplay but even that they didnt do wtf did they downgrade the hair why does the lighting look worse in the remastered version the pistols are even bigger than his hand everyone waiting rubbing their hands for the m1 garand to show up could you compare v2 remastereds weapons with iiis and 4s next uhh the pistol is oversize which one is remastered old version remastered the future is nowold man 008 im sure that hurts it looks so awesome this game is so pretty in 4k keep em coming yet to try it out i understand that you are the owner of the game you will play it as you like but entering an ultrafortified military base shooting everyone who appears in front of you is not the best strategy you are a sniper not rambo are you gonna play the new modern warfare game that came out lol man your the best thanks man and nice video y 20mins in only got 5 more hours mwr is the best remaster ever also resident evil 2 remake in some details the

remastered please remastered minecraft pls what about next sniper elite make mao lol hi i can not use the lunette with the rifle how could i use it thanks so every game now has to have a girl as a playable character same graphic can you turn off the xray sniper elite 1 remastered is what we need explosions in this game are not neat i played this game on my playstation 2 before many years and loved it we want soul reaver remaster minesweeper remastered next remaster san andreas i want metal gear solid 4 remastered i just need a port for bf3 onto ps4 this isnt a remaster it still looks like trash medal of honor 2010 remaster anyone this game is awful compared to sniper elite 3 why tf would anybody buy it to be clear i bought it and i hate it the graphics on switch are horrendous you run out of breath every 2 seconds whether its getting shot or running for 5 seconds they seriously need to rework this game if they going to pull 30 dollars out of my pocket for this trash remaster mafia 2 as well please bad disappointment rebellion should be ashamed cant upgrade to newer weapons movement and tactical movements is like playing 2002 technology fales advisement just horrible upcoming textures dlc now we need max payne 3 remastered and battlefield 3 remastered please sony been playin this with backwards compatibility on xbox the next remaster should be def jam fight for ny when

hard to play now if i wanna play this on ps4 ill just play the newer ones theyre all exactly the same please reveal xiii gameplay in e3 at least modern warfare remastered looked tons better than the original they improved on everything this game still looks like it came out 56 years ago even on remastered graphics it looks awesome that basically sniper elite 2 i bigger resolution it must cost next to nothing to release a remaster like this if they make any money its still a plus by btw i love this game please remastered killzone 2 or dead space lol having console players rebuy a game worth about 3 now what a cash grab want to see a remaster look at the new crash bandicoot and spyro midnight club 3 dub edtion remastered plz you should remasterd mafia 1 the next remaster should be dragon ball budokai tenkaichi 3 the next remaster should be super mario 8bits playstation can yall please redo grand theft auto san andreas sony please remasterize kill zone 2 its an excellent game 138 i am the hitle still question is who asked for this my question is why people in the comments rather have a remaster than a whole brand new game please the resistance trilogy with chimera on ps4 going to

there are silent rifles there no such a one in sniper elite 3 and i couldnt get the platinum finally subscribe in my chanel watching from the next remaster should be mafia 2 24th veiw heck yeah i love sniper elite but with both sniper elite 3 and 4 on ps4 and owning both im not quite sure what the point is of going back to number 2 se isnt known for its deep stories its known for its levels and gameplay and to me 3 topped 2 in every gameplay department 2 was great in its time but they bettered it with their own future games making it obsolete to play in 2019 i have fond memories of playing this back in the day on xbox 360ps3 obviously looks a heck of a lot prettier than it did in 2012 but some jankiness and simplistic ai persists that said it didnt take long for the pure joy of headnutshotting to set in ill happily shoot adolf again for the right rrp question any idea the trophy can be done in coop mode looks like a fallout 3 visually its ok but not like sniper elite 4 great sniper elite one of the best stealth sharpshooter games everi play every part and the german zensur is awfull the graphics do look a lot sharper now i am big fan of sniper elite games expecially of remastered can i play now on ps4 first for a remastered this game doesnt look all that good or remastered for that matter pleas rebellion fix the mag of lee enfield can you remaster the sniper elite ps2 for ps4 the sniper elite on ps2 is great and should be remastered for ps4 rebellion please make your games longer on switch its a shit game tbh 14 missions utterly tragic to see the fuhrer go out like that he deserved better wow a developer playing its own game amazing i could kill the bastard a 1000 times if there will be a sniper elite 5 i hope it will be set in japan and have a dlc where you can kill hirohito the 3rd worlds evilest man hitler was the 2nd and starlin was the 1st because he was worse than hitler the ai of enemy are still like before the remastered how do i get the dlc for this game i looked on playstation store and can not find it love the seriesdid buy thisits just a remaster from ps3 days nothing new to get excited about just same game with upgraded graphics but good fun need to add a bit of reflection of light everything looks dull oh right lol i thought that there were new campaigns on the game am waiting on 5 and hopefully rebellion will remaster sniper elite 1 on the xbox cover i can see 4 more campaign thay are not in the game just gonna say if you want to kill him easier just shoot his foot when hes behind the truck every time i watch this video i will always think about downfall movie parodies hitler rants to his generals great work devs plzstop with this gameit is the worst in the series at 302 did anyone else notice that the magazine was backwards can you do a remastered for sniper elite 1 and add some more features to it like climbing pipes and increase more mission like your games by the way please do for sniper elite 1 thank you sniper elite 5 hopefully soon how do you pick your character i think you should review sniper elite one where everything started thanks bro nice one mark seen some pretty sniffy reviews about this but am a fan of the series playing backwards from 4 for some reason and just want a laugh this has convinced me to buy cheers looking forward to sniper elite vr on psvr the original was way better than this remastered one the main issue is one that truly disappointed me when your able to get into the killing of hitler you want to smoke him in the most painful way possible in the original one you could shoot hitler in the balls that was a real challenge for all of us playing in the new one you cant shoot anyone in the balls let alone hitler the buttons dont always work and you have to push them sometimes more then twice to start the game and sometimes just to shoot i played the original and still have the xbox to play it i might just hook it back up and play that one the original in many ways is a much more satisfying game the remake isnt garbage but compared to the original its a 5 maybe 4 how can someone be a fan of elite 4it was such utter shit ai was so god damn dumb se through vision and so on one of the best games ive played and when u complete it play again with only ball shots only its so much fun shooting a guy from 250yords in the nuts lmfao when i first played sniper elite v2 i thought its bullshit but now while i play sniper elite v2 remastered i see that game only needed better graphics but i cant believe im playing 2019 game on my low end pc instead of making a completely different chapter and taking us into the harrowing jungles fierce cities and depths of the vietnam war or even ww1 in the trenches and rat infested villages or maybe even poland or russia in ww2 nooo they remake an older version trying to cash in developer laziness this whole franchise is waste of potential we could be seeing so much more i wont be buying this i played the original one and it was fantastic se africa was the biggest pile of crap and very disappointing and se italia was only alright good review buddy im going to get it again i played the old game on ps2ps3i cant remember which one years ago and i can just remember some of it should be good again the scope was originally like the others for the controller left trigger after many complaints the original controller layout is back in the game select it in the option menu i agree about the shoulder and aim buttons they should have been the opposite or given a switch setting i played it on the xbox personally i love 4 the best remastered sure its pretty much the same as ps3 version rebellion should focus on new game and let the history be history this games invironment are at least believable compared to 3rd africa and 4th italy its the only reason to recommend this remastered version i have the old one in my ready to install i wonder what really is different other than better graphics i mean its like paying another 30 dollars for graphics no new missions or maps idk seems a waste if ya allready have the old version thanks for the review and great job on it but i have one question i played 4 absolutely loved it does this one have the internal bullet shot cam though breaking bones shattering skulls and testicles didnt see it oh and a bonus thanks for reminding me about 3 because i dont think i played it and i was actually looking for a game hence why i watched your review so if 3 isnt in the playstation store v2 will probably be my pick edit big bonus thanks for reminding me of 3 been looking for a new game but everything looked blah downloading the ultimate edition now if you were in america id buy you a beerand a shotand another shotthen a cement mixer to see if you throw up lol i just did my own remaster of the original in 5k httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgdj8dp3ys4 great video ive played 3 and 4 for hours and never had an issue but for some reason i cant get the scope to come up on the rifle it has the same aim cross hairs as the machine gun or welrod did you have any problems can you shoot the balls though super my frind my sniper httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistpljic5xgxrkib7f1n4zhu5mf17encfu0x thank you a new sniper elite game this isnt a new game its a remaster of an older one is anyone else finding the controls difficult on the ps4 im hoping i can map them like the se4seems like an obvious improvement they could have included a solid detailed review great to hear another gamer who appreciates the franchise like myself i also love the series since the original xbox opening game v2 is the most challenging by far with few ways to escape once detected anxious to get this one as i have the complete xbox 360 silver star edition which has all the dlc great review manbut man do i really hope that sniper elite 5 takes place on the pacific theatre just like many others have wished for a long time now aswellits just the fact that weve been sniping off nazis since the inception of the franchise way back in 2005 and i wish for rather something different nowalso even betterimagine if they go into the full open world setting in which you could drive vehicles such as tanksjeepsairplanes with dogfightinggyrocopters and what notalsoimagine being able to climb palm trees and pick off targets from there or even equipping scuba diving gear and swimming around the islands for more exploration with each new game in the series becoming bigger and much more expansivei really think its only a matter of time until we see a full blown open world sniper elite gamethe possibilities for such title are nearly endless mate thanks for watching guys i hope you enjoy the review and please leave a like as it really helps this small channel great review as always i recently got s gaming pc so i may end up picking it up on there excellent game give this a go into war games bigtime and another superb game review mate playing a game i think youd appreciate lovecrafts untold stories really think youd dig it also as youre scottish check out a scottish zombie movie anna and the apocalypsel its so good i never seen a good remastered game lol what about the first sniper elite that one was the best make ps plus free please sniper elite v please why this remastered graphics are less accurate than se4 this doesnt look remastered ill pass anyways sniper elite was a good game but after the first playthrough i wouldnt recommend replaying the entire game again doesnt this game have nazi zombies remastered metal of honor loool 015 how tf is he aiming 026 same they fix those glitches in sp3 and sp4 was so many cheaters and glitches and they do nothing only capcom nows how to remake a game im going to buy it just because of the xray killcam thats dope we need remastered ps 1 console to play gta 1 lol why not remastered sniper elite love it original moderate light no wet ground remastered low lightcontrast wet ground if we are going to remaster games nowadays we should remaster ps2 games like mafia lost heaven max payn 12 these are the games that worth remastering wth the graphics looks like they dropped from ps2 the russians looks good is this game really that good a game which is garbage after remastered so its all sniping would play cod instead i hope you will be free to playstation 4 subscribers wow there are 4 games of this and i dont even play one of them i need it in my pc the end russia wins can anybody tell me what game is this i like it very much killing them softly you play like a bitch coward this is game on handphone or on pc patt se head shot nice game dont upload videos until you trained in playing this sniper elite video game fuck off you bastard worst gameplay specially sniper aiming was very worst in this even a kid could be play better than you actually a snipers specialty is that he kill enemy in a single shot but he never let die himself by any enemy and you killed by enemies two times and almost killed in the third time when you want to escape from war zone great play bro please make pubg pc video playback when did this get remastered to kill 30 easily then follow these tips in pubg mobile httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnxtplqerei0 1st comment amazing play always military based gameplay this is what i want great gameplay bro keep it up im definitely not a sniper elite but hopefully by the time i finish i am lol woah sniper elite v2 part 1 thats brand new i love it i cant get my game to work i loved this game back in the day but a vietnam game would be nice havent had one of those in a long time or maybe cold war tired of ww2 ww1 middle east stuff or future stuff getting old hello all guys i want to suy you don t buy that game on ps4 i have that game on 4k tv with hdr and game looks veryyyyyyyyyyy bad cool i have just one question trophy related can sev2 rm be coop played in the main campign on the hardest difficulty and earn the se gold trophy for both players in the ps3 version only soloing the main campign would earn you this very challenging trophy im hoping the changed that both se3 se4 have it it makes sense to add it imho much more fun too just ban dirtracer32 and progolfer1974 in advance and make it 8 reasons i love all series and i cant wait to play again and streaming this is great for the people that never played iti wont be getting it since i already have it better graphics is not a hook for me or any picture taking i dont play multiplayer eitheryou throw in a few brand new missions aka dlc for free and ill sign up right away i cant wait this franchise is my favorite hidden gem when are they going to make a game where the graphics actually impress another ww2 game with zombies really it was the best sniper video game zombie army trilogy was badassps4 so ill buy this until sekiro drops in price so theyre bringing the multiplayer back on remasterednice no thanks ill be buying it pc version is still there with mouse shooting so why cant wait for the game to come out i preorder it i hope the multiplayer is still the same from the original because i didnt like how they made the elite mode aka hard mode in se3 and 4 sorry sony as much as i love ps4 but going to get from steam perfect remember the days when multiplayer modes were being shoehorned into the games now its the opposite is already happening wait so are you a soviet or american sniper the only thing that matters is the testicles vr support they need to move to another erawar like having sniper elite afghanistan year 2000 mean of lol this is my favorite one out of all if them hands down i played this game on the oil map till death 1010 would do it again sniper elite 2 remastered reasons to downgrade the only reason to buy this game is exactly this never playing it nice game playstation 1 reason not to buy it over priced for a remaster just like the recent borderlands never played this game and heard about it i want to buy this on steam but maybe ill give it a shot on ps4 multiplayer looked like a joke maps are too small so it ends up like cod run n gun imagine gta with only snipers allowed make arma 4 for consoles so basically only 3 reasons because 2 are only for people with a ps4 pro and the others are pretty pointless is it cheap a case when the developers do not want to do anything new but they want to receive money for what they have done ill buy it in 2020 when its dirt cheap for ps5 since its backwards compatible i hope it includes xray trap kills loved those in 4 are enemy testicles exploding censored already preordered i love the sniper elite series wwii is played out infamous collection ps4 sly cooper collection ps4 improved visuals nah ill still wait for a ps plus bargain thou ratchet and clank ps2 collection remastered pls sony so its the pc version with the ps5 being backward compatible with ps4 we wont get these kind of remasters anymore hopefully this game have zombie mod no thanks but thanks anyway a must buy for me loved the last gen original on xbox 360 best reason to play xray vision nut shots or has that been censored now i cant wait i already preordered why they keep remastered are they out of idea to make money only games i would want remastered are eas james bond games completely impossible it will ever happen but still battlefield 3 battlefield 3 battlefield 3 battlefield 3 battlefield 3 battlefield 3 battlefield 3 battlefield 3 battlefield 3 release killzone in 60 fps already preordered will be nice to play it again so many remastered versions these days just give it to the gamers that already have bought the game a free update just like borderlands and yet still no killzone collection fully remastered and 60fps i hate how you cant share this and i got one reason just one reason to not buy this at its price it released 7 years ago the ps3 version costs 30 whereas this remaster costs 35 i have no need to buy this at its price plus i got it for free a few years back thanks to steam ill keep it in my wishlist so i can see when it goes on sale and play this with my online buddies on ps4 i never played the dlcs from the game so i buy it day one since gamer bros are tired of politics in games they should boycott all war games animations look so stiff cant wait for this game should be 7 reasons why sony neeeds to release killzone 2 and 3 in hd ps4 is anyone playing this on ps4 who is trying to platinum the game does anyone play this online nowas i cant get on multiplayer sniper elite 5 this one that going to make a cold war map all types of cold war maps lol please clip it next time to highlights only question would u really consider me buying this and is there enough players on here just wondering thanks bro if you can rebellion build sniper elite5 in russia or stalingrad did he rip his throat out or snap his neck either one is impressive i have the sniper elite 34 and they are just to much fun to play good vid imagined this really happened in reallife do you need a code to get the dlc the part when he using train sound to make enemies cannot hear gunshot makes me remember of stalingard mission in cod waw back when you could actually use the sniper rifle in 4 if you shoot an unsuppressed weapon you gotta wait 20 mins for everyone to chill out before you can shoot it again sniper ghost warrior 3 is way better nintendo in 1993 removes christian crosses out of games nintendo in 2019 a game about killing hitler himself is released on their system umm are you stupid i have samsung tablet so shut up u didnt check his ball here we meet the most popular general form germany xd i have 1 question is this game also set in google play on android rip my guy you did nothing wrong and u dont give no fucks your friend beside you dead man down instead of screaming for backup its impressive how stupid these games are in every game helmets are useless you can on shot kill these soldiers with a pencil i still say they should remaster the first sniper elite wow the graphics look amazing in your pc why kill uncle a thats dumb i still play the original and its still good and the same 030 this was brutal 335 world record good game and gameplay im good xbox youll make money off of me when breakpoint comes out and not this love the updates wtf only three minutes and age restrict heres part 1 of my sniper elite v2 remastered walkthrough please like share subscribe for more content and click that notification bell to know when i post videos please support me on patreon or on paypal if you can its completely optional httpswwwpatreoncombaytuh or httpswwwpaypalmebaytuh i actually like these games in the original the hair is more cool people that say they cant see a difference clearly have no eye for detail or have visual issues i randomly paused at 16 seconds and can point out at least 15 spots right away where you can clearly see differences not only in textures but also in objects some newly added and detail look at the fire in the distance look at the detail on the window shutters the details on the poster look at the more defined detail on the broken walls on the left in the distance look that the added grass or whatever that green shit is i can go on for a while also the lighting is improved look at the character weapons are more detailed due to better lighting the lighting overal looks more natural i paused again a few times and i see big but subtle differences everywhere is it all perfect no 234 you can see that the bullet trail effect is a lot less which is a shame i kinda liked that but the added detail on the rest in that image is quite remarkable especially when you add textures have a bit more detail but nothing to write home about certainly not enough to make me want to pay 7 for it or play it again id rather buy more dlc for se4 than buy this rehash i cant see any difference lol i really dont see any enhancements on the lighting or the shadows love the new update does it support for keyboard and mouse take my money tekken 7 xbox one x enhance patch please new playable characters i could not tell you the name of the guy i played as originally its not free cost currently playing 4 on games pass love it for the 1st time in 6 years xbox are too embarrassed to put up the gwg video the games got that bad major nelson got roasted on twitter wheres ultimate spiderman and spy vs spy are they finally going to bring zombie army to console please god of war related games makes xbox thats for xbox360 to it looks exactly the same games play best on xbox one x i would buy it for 10 to 15 maxxxxx it would be awesome if microsoft adds rebellion studios to xbox game studios because rebellion makes some awesome games gta 4 need to be remastered xbox live free play days plz i love this game cant wait reason 8 gonna be on xbox pass it has the multiplayer on top of the story mode day 1 buy for me now thats great reasons to not upgrade pc mods exist for this game does the xbox one s all digital does it have the same performance as the xbox one s brill game 010 not enough testicle shots i already preorder itnow its my duty to spread this amazing game upon the rest of me friends i cant wait one of my favorite games on xbox 360 higher graphices even than sniper elite 4 reason 4 when i was throwing stone the stone stoped in the air then hits to ground hahaha i remember it played into my ps3 it suffered from glitche did anyone ask for this game to be remastered 8 1000 g easy i didnt have a copy of the original v2 so i couldnt do a direct comparison in the video but i highly recommend checking out this video if you want to see just how much has changed in this remaster httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi4ok6sjdf08 i wonder who is here from his steam review on the game thanks for the goodclear review i guess well have to wait for the next actual nonrerelease sniper elite version can someone please tell me if i can remap the keybindings every remastered game should contains the original game as well in it so we can see how poorly done the remastered has 001 7 years im getting old as fuck man i dislike how they removed the store page for the original its like they knew the remaster isnt worth it if people can buy the original i hate cash grabs just sell a good product and i will buy it seems like an excuse to sell the same product but bump the price back up becausereasons judging from this video i can not really tell the difference from the original pretty solid review as usual gotta love these niche game reviews i enjoyed the game this looks boring this looks tight been wanting this game to be ported in mobile devices it s the same wii u game switch isnt sbout the graphics well why dont you support wii u o right because you all that want its a tablet not a wii u gamepad gosh wii u was a great console with bad and nasty reviews sev2 without wii u gamepad its like pizza without cheese game does not look that bad peoples can play multiplayer thanks for the video have just preordered this did anyone know nintendo switch versions it will physical or only digital the game looks ugly than normal wtf looks like it hasnt even been remastered looks exactly the same as the original this is handheld right any motion controls option switch is the best console its not all about the graphics these graphics look like a big oof sniper 3 is bloody fantastic man please can you get on with it you really talk to much you really do eshop sale brought me here 1749 is a steal the ps2 version is rlly bad i want sleeping dogs on the switch i find the blood splashes a bit too vulgar smaller puffs of blood mist wouldve been better you have to exhale your lungs to get the x ray shots i know im a bit late in this one never played sniper elite and was expecting more of an fps type of game but this still looks like it could be good ok lets be honest i really really suck at splattoon 2 on the nintendo switch as in i suck at aiming while shooting trying not to get killed in handheld mode no pro controller dont have one so my question is sniper elite v2 even worth getting at all if i suck badly on spattoon 2 since im a keyboard mouse shooter gamer only this game looks bad on the switch i think that doom or wolfenstein looks much better the switch has so much potential this is a great example of it i got the upgrade for 10 on steam i may pick up the switch version as well i reserved this at gamestop i get to pick it up tommorrow night at 9 pm really excited that this is coming to switch great console great game thanks for the good video nice to see the switch get a version but anyone wanting a xbox 360 experience you all have done it already so save your money only versions that go further apart from the original is ps4 xone and pc with 4k hdr 60fpsbaring in mind i was doing 4k on the original version at 60fps just fine so ill still be skipping this its well done and dusted this one hardest modes and all it wouldnt be cost effective getting it again the challenge is over for melike i said im happy the switch gets included at all with these sort of games some developers just cant be bothered doing different versions its too much cost and development time when they can make one good version and port across allso well done to them looks like a good port but i hate using the switchs sticks for aiming this game requires quite a bit of precision so im not sure im sold on this yet does this game have any other modes beside campaign hey spawnwavemedia can you tell me if i need 2 copies and 2 switches to play locally thanks should i get this or wait for sniper elite 3 dead space trilogy would be awesome is this version portable hows the fps just one decent online multiplayer shooter is all i ask for otherwise my switch will sit on the shelf for cod mobile tbh the textures look more similar to a mobile game is the game just old or is it because of the switch limitations sniper elite v2 remastered might be the excuse i need to buy a switch cool i want multiplayer how does it play with joycons tho huh i wasnt aware you actually moved throughout the levels thought it was just a stay in this one point and pick them off type of thing shows how little i researched lol this interests me a whole lot more cant wait for call of duty remastered battlefield gta star wars battlefront bad company far cry blood dragon watch dog division destiny overwatch borderlands for switch verison is this handheld looks great getting it this will have coop a remaster that looks like a ps2 game when the original released on ps3 wow this game looks really really cool i might end up checking it on switch physical release gamestop havent seen it other retailers yet i am getting it for switch i would die for the batman arkham series batman arkham asylum batman arkham knightbatman arkham orgins and batman arkham city to come to the the nintendo switch those are on my list of the best games i have ever played in my life and i have no problem playing them again and again and again but the idea of having on the portable console the nintendo switch is mindblowing and amazing man i just if that would happen like my life will be completed if that happened then i could rest in peace that looks really good is there physical release or only download you have to time your shot to an explosion or transfer locations after every shot why does this remaster exist nobody ask for it i think didnt they do a real bad port of sniper elite on the wii u i hate seeing your bald head in my feed so i unsubbed i see a lot of people complaining about how it looks bad but im watching this at like 720p and it looks fine to me looks great an all but ill just wait until its 20 bucks or less not saying its not worth 3599 respectively but yea not worth paying full price when theres no physical release for the switch version need tom clancys splinter cell on switch they should put the nazi zombies on the switch i can play that all day runs like crap on the switch no physical release no buy the game is trash they they putting mobile games on the switch ive never played this game when it was out on 360ps3 and i honestly thought it was only a sniper mode based game thanks for playing and showing this game off ive been wanting a sequel to ea and ios freedom fightersand while i wont hold my breath for that this looks like a great alternative minus the squad managing of the ea and io cult classic this is a day one buy for me i have all the ones on pc sniper elite 3 zombie trilogy 2 i love 4 is great its better then mgsv i beat this on the ps3 years and years ago in my opinion it was not as good as sniper elite 3 or sniper elite 4 i beat sniper elite 4 which is the best of the games over a year ago on the ps4 however it is not available on the underpowered switch at all hey john whats that clip you have attached to your pro controller i seem to remember you mentioning it somewhere but cant quite put my finger on it great video as always i suck at this game need an ace combat port also i hope they remaster zombie army trilogy and release it for the switch we need the gta collection for the switch the 2d ones can come in a package then gta3 vice city san andreas then gta4 and idk if gta5 would run on the switch but maybe the switch pro best of all it has pvp game looks better then i expected ty for the review bro 35 on the switch or play the second game on the 360 for 5 hmmm looks excellent 7th gen aaa titles are some of the finest looking games on the switch theres no excuse for sniper elite v2 not running at 60 fps on switch i really want this ty for the review urgh looks really ugly even the original was better also 30fps nah thanks a pass for me i guess its more fun on the pc anyway one day ill be able to play this when this switch is cheaper to buy wow i have soo many games to buy this month how longs the game im looking forward to this game surprisingly for me switch has become my system of choice for shooters motion aiming and hd rumble enhance the experience so much in those kind of games did it look that bad on the 360 damn ive always thought im not a graphics whore but this made me go eewwk at first does it at least play good or is it your aaa awash from that time quality lets play jonsw the sniper elite games are very fun and the switch version is gonna be dope taking sniper elite v2 on the go d keep on bringing the 3rd party ports gta 5 borderlands rdr lmao who tf would buy this i dont get it seems like just the thing to scratch my mgs itch def gonna pick this up is the physical release gamestop exclusive i cant find it for preorder from any other retailers id seriously pay 120 for a port of skate 3 why is gta5 not on switch yet looks like shit even for a last gen game i would not classify it as a remaster more like a port we know what the switch is capable of and its capable of better visual quality games than the crap most people are putting out i tried to play by one i was bored ag which version should i get digital or cartridge so did v2 not have the xray kills those are what make sniper elite worth playing pc on ultra still the best looking but cost more also but old games are still great fun you do really good impression videos its only 30 so its worth it tf happened to karls face cant wait to pick up my copy i dont consider myself a graphics whore these days but some older games especially the 360ps3 era ones more so than before that really seem to show their age more maybe its because they sort of aimed for more realism but still lacked the gpu grunt necessary the lack of ambient occlusion sticks out like a sore thumb to me it really looks bad this looks very good on switch i played this game and all the dlc i just wished they would the price point was 1999 for a game thats over 5 years old 35 is gonna a lot for this game is there good story i really like the series and will pick this up for the switch it will make a great handheld experience 30 or 60 fps too bad no zombie trilogy for switch another port from the wii u how much is this for the switch i will pick this up but wont until its on sale for 20 never played any of the sniper games thanks spawn cant wait for this and saints row you are really bad at this game you didnt use the focas shot at all but good vid can i still shoot through hitlers testicles though always a thumbs up for john keep up the good work dang no 60fps on switch thats a breaking point of me it looks absolutely disgusting is this a remastered or just a port i really want hitman on the switch borderlands 3 gameplay dropped this video was cool too spawn wave great video sniper elite v2 remastered how does it play keep up the good work on your channel that intro kept going way too long could you try saying what youd usually say during the intro while youre playing it would make for a better video in my opinion wow i even received a gmail notification the moment you released this video wow ive never been this early no comments are showing 0 views 10 likes i loved this game on the past systems so its great to be able to take it on the go now not bad another wii u port bois todays fact the word jurassic which we so often associate with dinosaurs comes from the celtic word for forest really they call this remastered just as many glitches as the ps3 version just jazzed up the graphics not impressed and the rockets red glare if you go down to the lower level they all come to you its a lot less work and nobody attacks you from behind then when you hear the countdown run upstairs to shoot the v2 got the game today and having a couple of issuefirstly when you get next to an enemy to perform a stealth kill when you press the button nothing happens and he just stands there also the sound keeps cutting out not ideal when you are trying to mask your shot and not be heardcontrols take some getting used to after playing sniper elite 4 to death they are killing russians in some levels defend your position while the rocket fuels your position has been compromised soviets start to swarm intense firefights this gave me ptsd xd give us ultimate edition on se4 with all dlc pls i missed this game karl fairburne despite years of stress hell assuming sniper elite 4 deathstorm dlc is cannon exposure to radioactive materials is it me or is he faster than he is in 3 and 4 launch site dammit i need to hurry up if i dont want to get spoiled i just saved that scientist who karl was supposed to kill but ended up saving gonna rewatch this when i catch up 1999 and ill bite game play station now this month where is there zombies i honestly got tired of snipe elite 4 so theres no way im upgrading reason 8 who doesnt love the censorship of swastica 1 because is a amazing game2 because you will relieve the war as neverand 3 you must play this again wow its perfect i almost got impressed until it came at the middle where he should have shot first the sniper above before the infantry not a smart move soldier fantastic broo when ur enemies doesnt hear the sound of a friend getting shot at point blank range just behind him lol stupid and dirty player he knows every position from the enemy nobody wondering this amazing sniper skills walking in the middle of the street you must be a new recruit boring as shit this game is very interesting im very enjoy what war does this game try to replicate oh fuck in real life you were dead in two seconds never walk in the middle of the street and you always kill the sniper first please i want link to download this game on my pc what is the name of this game stupid player please show all d parts of this game what is the name of that game which game 1050 in real life this sniper will kill you before free fire exe indonesia hello we have a tanks game want you to promote are you interested shoot the brain and the body dies nice boss the way u play why youre play old boring this gamee theres a clash down floor but in upstairs the enemy is smoking and your next guy is shot dead but you still dont know what happened and stay still that makes russian video games no efect kill remote detonation shoot grenade problably the best gam ever even pak are situated in strategic points well done why is a gi killing soviet soldiers is that berlin if so why is there an american floating around killing our allies im confused by this alternate dimension history welrod is so loud lol what is the difference with remastered and original enjoying your channel thank you for sharing your channel share the link are you russian almost all your game played in pykkn language game is super first please heart mee hopefully sniper elite 5 takes place in britain franceor japan if its remaster onlyit should be 30 or less right take my money now oh wait they are taking preorders for this right now another rebellion game getting the redux treatment now for the judge dredd game omygod fairburne my man we meet again they have to include the zombie version of this game if yall dont know its called zombie army trilogy amazing standalone dlc you guys have to bring that back remastered wish they would do a modern sniper elite with a updated engine from 4 why no sniper elite 1 remastered great game but it isnt that old so dont think it needs a remaster should do more games from 90s and early 2000s which will benefit from modern graphics a lot more well i loved the first when i originally played it so will love this fun coincidence i finally finished the original v2 today this was the best sniper elite game so excited now i just hope scarface the world is yours will get a remaster one day graphics look better but still look like trash will it include zombies cool i dont know what they could do to improve sniper elite v2 it already feels on par with sniper elite 4 except for game play i would love to see the stealth elements from 4 brought to v2 the graphics are fine though please dont port over what is probably the worst anti aliasing in the history of gaming when people say did anyone want ac3 remastered but say yes i support this about sniper elite v2 rdr1 remastered with rdr2 rage whoosh king of open world games might become king of remastered open world games hopefully sniper elite 5 jumps to the pacific or maybe forwards to the cold war wtf hard pass enough this series for me it feels like this game was released yesterday remaster games that need remastering stop re releasing forgettable turds from 4 years ago with upscaled textures and resolution at full price every two days hopefully this time nintendo gamers dont get screwed over like they did with the wii u port of sniper elite v2 i wonder wheres sniper elite 5 is gonna be maybe finland or france or something uh can yall make avp again or remaster 2010 y tho is mr sark company gonna journey into hell and kill all the nazis again the worst game in the seriesprefer a remaster for the 1st one lets not forget this a remake of a remake sniper elite v2 is a remake of sniper elite also 4k resolution isnt a selling point the game can already run in 4k still looks satisfying as ever why not release 2 and 3 nice love this series sniper elite 3 was really that enjoyable but remember only playing the demo of v2 and play the hell out of it we really need mafia 2 remastered id preorder it i never pre order anything are these sniper games all stealth seems like lots of people like them i have not played one i have the 4th oneits been a long time since i played sniper elite does this game really need to be remastered this is the only game i never got to play im so hyped tbh the graphics dont look that much better shouldve shown a comparison how about remastering gudge dredd rebellion what about the first game no love can people who got original sniper elite v2 can get remastered version for free um its been playable in 4k for years its kind of funny watching people get excited for mods i love the series and rebellion and i understand the business reasonsconsole players not smart but dang we need to move on from this so now both sniper elite 2 and 3 are coming to switch what a coincidence ive actually been replaying the original v2 big fan of the franchise and zombie army trilogy definitely going to give this remastered a try want loved the last game but never played the original ill get the switchs version legit felt like this game came out last year though haha jk who asked for this v2 was the best in the series great the remaster weve all been waiting for when is coming out when sniper 5 still wouldnt mind the saboteur remake or remastered already played it twice on pc and ps3 anyway its a great game the lazy developer dont make new game but remastered again i played the demo of this 100 times when i was little never got the game though im definitely getting this defiently picking this up on switch ill wait to get it for free on psplus like cod4 patience we need to start ww3 so the devs can start working on sniper elite 5 why not i guess i never asked for this zombie army needs another game will probably get on switch why tho this is one game that didnt need a rerelease in my opinion i quite like this series of games they can be a blast but it doesnt seem necessary i can understand remasters and remakes from the 1st gen xbox and ps2 era maybe early 360ps3 but this seems a bit too new i think its 201213 this game originally released look at these dated graphics of this remastered game nut busting now in new gen experience who wanted this the graphics dont even look that much better i need mass effect trilogy framebyframe photo mode is it really what i think it is going to photo mode and being able to go back in like 10 seconds of footage so you never miss a shot again but what about sniper elite v1 funhaus adam kovic where are you love these games please stop adding on useless multiplayer thats dead in 2 weeks and attaching achievements to it hahah resident evil has showned how the remakes should be done these deys this is pathetic dont really like these games who asked for this still waiting for sniper elite 5 pacific front though i only recently replayed it on psnow im curious if they updated the melee takedowns so they are like elite 4 with the cinematic knife takedowns rebellion remastering v2 to get more funds for sniper elite 5 because lets face it number 5 is going to be extremely ambitious i will support you rebellion yeah i think nobody asked for a remaster of this but sure whatever cod bo2 please day 1 for switch ready for some remastered exploding head gore this game is really showing its age 114 can we get a f for our lord and saviour im glad that we keep getting remastered versions of last gen games so they get a new life nobody asked for this lmao finally i love these games why the frick you comparing nintendo switch with ps4 is already very different am i the only one who prefers the depth of field on the switch version switch 2 x 1 ps4 i bought the pc version of this game for like 5 a few months ago seems that the main switch downgrades are framebuffer resolution apparently maxing out at a vertical pixel count of 918 but in reality closer to 700800 texture resolution substantial downgrade ambient occlusion none and shadow resolution substantial downgrade still a good looking game on the switch despite these downgrades as it was on the ps3360 in its day ps4 has an advantage of course but switch is firmly enchanted surprised ps4 isnt at 60 fps kind of surprised ps4 is 30fps good port more good games on the go sold on switch the game will be 30 fps at maximum 720p in portable mode or 918 docked while the ps4 and xbox one base versions will turn into 30 fps 1080p however the ps4 pro and xbox one x will offer an option to choose between a combo 1080p 60 fps on one side or 4k 30 fps on the other the difference is really minimal between the switch version and the version of ps4 and xbox one classic switch and ps4 resolution please whats the resolution is very difficult to discover the difference maybe only the kill cam is better on ps4 im watching on mobile but i seriously didnt notice a difference until he stood in front of the poster and it seemed like the ps4 one was very slightly sharper with a solid frame rate im very glad i preordered this on the eshop a while ago cant wait to play this later today ok but can you take your ps4 on the go ok ps4 is better but the switch is doing a good job thanks for the comparison i need the redout framerate test good comparison good comparison sniper elite 3 or v2 for switch what kind of games are these guys good at im curious you guys must have one of the best jobs going getting paid to play games wha yes please and thisbis why the british couldnt assassinate hitler in ww2 yes they did try use a mouse and keyboard next time target acquisition is much easier i love you guys but honestly this is nearly unwatchable how does rob sit through this im glad that i refunded this i see no change other than graphics y not kill those 1st 3 quickly by shooting their heads then kill sniper why is rob in the background wheres the friday feature with rob this is sniper stupid elite where is robs friday feature ye so bad at sniper elite cause youre british and not american or russians true heroes of ww2 golly dave you are not good at this lol remastered a game that came out like a decade ago jesus will we ever a get a video featuring domino or getting dominos favorite game i know its hard guys but you can try mouse and keyboard ive only played zombie army trilogy but might give this a blast hopefully that frame skipping is just my imagination is this dads army the game can you put somebody who can actually play the gameor at least play some of it before streambecause this was executed very unprofessionallyboth the gameplay and the way you guys handled the streamhorrible presentation best one imo but come on wheres the killzone 23 remakes or the 1st metal gear on ps4 would be amazing so many others to name that id prefer drop a like if agree easter snake in the background lol 43234331 stealth at its finest indeed what the hell are you doing thats the first time ive been angry watching someone else play a game is rage quitting a stream a thing i think its a thing now this is why the british begged the ussr for help in ww2 smfh watched five minutes then skipped the next 30 minutes hopefully to a point daves not so terrible always an excuse for your lack of skill at games eh dave damn i wanted a new sniper elite i have mastered all the series so far why should i get this one again well for those who never played it this is indeed a great version d just missed this being in tasmania but watching post live wondered why nath wasnt playing you should have domino come in sometime to introduce him to everyone in the flesh so to speak maybe even have him play something while one of the regulars mods the live stream oh dear dave allowing hitler to escape is inexcusable for shame dave for shame this was more painful to watch than metal gear stupid i know it is a cheek to post here but we have tried all the other social media platforms please watch the video on my channel to prove im not doing it for the views im going to delete it when we reach our goal goto options and look at controls the guy who killed hitler is my hero i saw kill hitler i click boring the frames looked terribad when the bullet cam started up wait for sale for me methinks anyone wanna help me get zombie army trilogy platinum i need help with the coop trophies my psn is samsalsa411 and i have a mic just put zombie army trilogy in the description for the request so bad its funny xd you cant speak ill of the dead from chicago illinois love you guys dont leave me out here plz friends from ps4 dave and nate give me some love friend love your channel please i love this franchise rebellion always brings out quality games played the original on 360 this looks immaculate they remastered this trash lol watch this new one that actually final release comparison httpsyoutubeyafzlrxs9jk original is better eh se2 remastered 2019 but looks worse than se4 2017 cash grab to be honest this game is well done and dusted and if im honest it wasnt a booming success in its original release window so cant see it being a must buy when there are newer fresh titles coming or are already available for me i can run the original in 4k at 60fps and looks good enough to me so it doesnt merit spending money to re do the same game i finished 3 times before on hardest difficulty ah rebellion the guys that made rogue trooper redux and i dont think theyll make patches too cause everyone thinks that remasters dont need patches cause theyll think it will turn out perfect well btch theyre wrong i think the effects in the original look better than the remaster that might just be me though wish survival mode lasted longer ii dont get it i have v2 on pc mine on max settings and 4k 144hz looks 100 better than the remaster i get the remaster is supposed to bring life to an old game but just reshading it and selling it for 2999 bullsht then saying people who own v2 get it cheap dont bother play the original all you are doing is buying rose tinted beer goggles should be free for those who purchased the first version but it wont be not paying for this one dont need my question why was it called sniper elite v2 on pc the difference will be negligible we will wait for digital foundry httpsyoutube3aoledfqova sorry but there is something graphically wrong with this video the result of another money grabbing plan nothing the main character did more rough facial features click baitttttteeerrr biat my ass what comparisonthen use same scenes well i hope i dont have to buy the remastered version hope its free for every one who bought the 2012 with all the dlc if not i aint buying it again because its a shit game now hope we got more stuff to blow up hopefully i get the remaster for free because i have the base game ooh yeees they didnt improve any expression of skeletal structures and muscles actually there is no mustles i enjoyed sniper elite 34 im very interested in this too i only played se4 and it got me into the series im loving this remaster system for the game ive not played before will be able to play now with greater graphics my next in play list is ac 3 how about the first of sniper elite ps2 where is world at war remastered jeez its gone so quick felt like it was only the other day i was playing sniper elite v2 back in 2012 ill wait till its on the gamepass one of my favorite games hope they get extra maps all dlc with all upgraded when does this remastered version hit the markets low effort remaster when it release why the didnt put it on ps3 in sniper elite v2 remastered karl fairbune face is more better than the original loved this game lets use sweet effects and reshade and call it a remaster remastered has better light effects love it after mastering both se3 and se4 i had to try this sev2 remastered game sorry to say but it is very disappointing have to wait for a se5 version call me old fashioned i would use a bolt action too beautiful scenario before the nazi zombie army thank you ive played this game thru at least 15 times with hd textures i bought every one of your games but i will never buy this title again as much as i love it i mean i already own it just release sniper 5 already lol this is awesome he should have ducked behind a table leg yes cant wait for more please do a ply through that would be fun lmaoo this was epic now this is one gaming studio that can truly deliver a surprise like this to all of us most gaming studios are huge disappointments nice maybe i buy ps4 later for this what about the owners of ps3 sniper elite v2 will they get a free copy like on pc i preordered on steam also like it trailer soundtrack is there anyone who knows what is the trailer soundtrack name 027 114 the moment every one clapped so the game comes

we getting sniper elite 5 i played sniper elite 4 on ps4 many years ago even sniper elite 3 and 2 but sniper elite 5 i hope i think its fake nothing happen about sniper 5 i dont think so i dont know

graphic dont need to be remastered oh yea time to snipe hitler in the nuts killzone remastered collection hitler caput all dlc included new playable characters i love how the comments are just people asking for other remasters cool i guess in all honesty i think it would be more suitable to change the game from the ground up to have more of the level layout that 3 and 4 has done when demons souls remaster nobody asked for this remaster 100 hatwig splitting at its finest does it need to be remastered spc ops the line remastered great series cant wait to pick this up hey play station can u allow cross play for smite literally every other company agreed except you dont be as holes i just wanna play the game with my friends online fps players the videogame 2 luckily i havent buy yet now is the time why not remaking the ps2 one onstead i was right i really wish if they could portremaster all of the three serious sam games to the ps4 lul how many hitlers are there i killed one in every sniper elite well time to nut shot him again why not also include the original unless im mistaken 3 and 4 are on the ps4 so remastering 2 without 1 would seem a little annoying i want black ps2 remastered gta 4 is the remaster we all waiting for why no one plays sniper elite anymore i need too farcry 2 remastered i knew this happen sooner or later jlquestion is tho is it for xbox too who asked for this i dont know whats the deal with this remastering thing why dont you just make a new one i only played v2 when i was very young and i dont remember that much but why is it that in every sniper elite game you assassinate hitler story wise its confusing to me yes what date give me freedom fighters and i buy 2x copy just when i was thinking how i would like to play some sneaker game nice please change that ost in the title screen main menu more paid dlc for hitler ooh i remember that church one question about ps2 or ps3 games at ps store they renew it after a period of time i mean they delete some video games and they add some else or they add continuity never actually played this willing to giver a go if the price is right did this game really need to be remastered all the sniper elite look the same i dont undersntand why they do a remake weird flex but okay this is the only one i havent played im so hyped imo the graphics dont look much different from the original why is this

game still one of my fav to this day if anyone remember it from the ps2 great chance to play this was there a sniper elite v1 i thought sniper elite 4 was the last game i know that the 360 game has

been a long time since i heard anything so boring no vr support no money my 360 died and my dad always asks when im getting a new one just because he loves this game so much now hell be able to play it on my ps4 rdr1 remasters please v2 doesnt really need a remaster i would love a mafia 2 remaster sly cooper remaster collection for ps4 stop ignoring series cant wait a nice franchise with all the sniper elite games was this remaster really necessary cool if they dont add gameplay mechanics that were in later sniper elite titles i will probably just pass on this one the character spasms in this and sniper elite 3 were too much sometimes and i feel that was improved upon in iv what about black ps2 remaster this is what the community wants mw2 remastered ps4 pleeeeeeeeeeeeeaseo who asked for this they should remastered gta san andreas or gta iv when is the release date gonna add this to ma collection niet a great game but who actually asked for this give me my mass effect 2 remastered and then well talk remasters are getting a bit ridiculous now primal ps2 remastered please oh how much i do enjoy killing hitler all we want is mass effect trilogy just give us full backwards compatibility for ps4 and ps5 so there will barely be any need for remasters anymore i wouldve bought all lego star wars games by now if ps4 had bc but it doesnt now we have that one moron who trashed backwards compatibility at a very high position at playstation so im losing hope i want to play the old cod games on my ps4 but i cant a surprise to be sure but a welcome one you gonna censor the american version now its like i am playing the pc version when they fk up the franchise doing remasters im waiting for mass effect trilogy now max payne 2 remastered for ps4 please no one asked for this ok now this is epic really bro v2 is my fave sniper elite game why though sniper elite v1 remaster when excellent but would a remaster of sniper elite 1 be possible 2 12 minutes of preamble was that necessary big fan of rebellion many thanks for remastered version like to see number one completely redonei have 2 copies if you need one to comparelol italian gameplay on my channel d great game thank you love you rebellion rebellion you are the best ilove sniper elite game play on the pc not xbox rebellion why is the audio out of synch with the visual the visual is lagging behind this game taught me a lot about biology and where many of the organs are located in the human body who says video games cant be educational glad they remastered it and added all dlcs and new characters this was the first game i ever played when i was 5 my dad would play the challange mode an little 5yr old me would get to blow up the final thank to win the math good memeries im now 12 love you rebellion you are better thank rockstar and littery everyone else keep it up when is the switch version releasing in the us i waiting to go home to play i love rebellion and i have all games 4341 is a nice comparison love this game cant wait to check out the remaster first gaming company ive been a fan of every rebellion game ive picked up so far i loved keep it up rebellion its nice to see the devs get excited about playing this they do a live stream to talk about their game but get more involved in the actual gameplay this is cool 1211am pacific time i need to go to sleep so i can get up early and pick up my v2 copy at 10am im so ready to play v2 remastered super excited great games great franchise and great developers thank you rebellion im so hyped that photo mode looks damn amazing only luke would say sorry after committing a war crime if you guys dont make a shirt with a wheel of cheese wearing a helmet and night vision goggles tactical cheese im gonna be sad wait they remastered it war is hell and giggly apparently you got it done good job lacking a lot fo stealth i say that because thats what snipers do that is more or less the point of this game but you had fun and you finish it good on you if you need help in stealth i know jane and andy are good at it 1235 i used to be a soldier like you then i took a bullet in the knee you guys should definitely play zombie army trilogy its the same game but with zombies to the outside crew the geneva conventions still apply in video games i used to be an enemy sniper but then i took a bullet to the knee yes in the thigh thats totally where you shot him weve all played sniper elite we know exactly where you hit him please stop apologizing to the nazis asfgjj the zoom in and the wink were hilarious so many war crimes committed in this video me happily making tacos while listening ellen tactical cheese3 me damn i wish i had grated cheese i feel like my stomach is misunderstanding the concept of this videogame luke is the most british sniper i have ever heard of incapacitates soldier with two shotssorry about thisshoots same enemy soldier after already incapacitating him sorry thats war hey guys love your channel why dont you play alice the madness returns ive never heard or saw you guys even mention it except on game stop its a great game and has so many weird creepy and fantasy aspects that arent even noticed and should be on the top 7 of something that you guys cover i think of it almost every time i watch a video and go alice should be on there technically the guy on the chair wasnt sitting he was draped over the chair luke a game that youre meant to be stealthy in taking people by surprise luke ellen run around firing their smgs and sniper rifles and ignoring their silenced pistols or handtohand takedowns yup outside xtra at its best that poor piano a war crimes tribunal will be speaking to you two shortly an interesting mix for a sniper coop game no offense luke and ellen but i admire the laughs spills and hilarity of the gameplay from you both these 2 will singlehandedly win the war luke master tactician i suspect that the enemies are somewhere brilliant yes luke you keep telling yourself that it was his thigh you shot i was a sniper once but then i took a bullet to the knee sniper elite v2 remastered winking simulator tactically cheese it we need a shirt outta that i thought it was an enemy but it was a leaf sounds like something a cat would say sniper elite 2 with ellen and luke war has never been so giggly mmmtactical cheese drool gotta aim for the head continues aiming at body more please cheesefiltrate i appreciate that both oxbox and oxboxtra used the catchphrase send it chef they almost both referred to tactically cheezing it too p the sniper games need to work more like hitman it becomes way to easy when you realize you just need to kill everyone this whole video ellen never figured out that this game had bullet drop off what is tactical cheese possibly gouda fetta or maybe swiss is your tactical cheese in slices or a block i laughed till my stummy hurt at the dead guy on the chair ellen are we the baddies i know this was a borderline advertisement but i would definitely watch an oxtra lets play of this whole game the mixture of ww2 horror and oxtra cheerfulness is oddly pleasing winky winky its like giving a child immense power and they choose to do the most benign thing with it ellen is quite the sniper more than once i thought she overshot only to get a solid head shot luke on the other handtried his best luke and ellen as ww2 soldier crouch and uncrouch intensifies i am reasonably sure that luke and ellen could make an entertaining half hour video about messing around in microsoft paint hes technically sat on the chair and the orphans were technically in the orphanage luke tactical luke is so much more of a liability than tactical ellen i did not see that coming luke would be the kindest sniper ever first kill them then say sorry to the dead guy xd bathroom is clear bathroom is clear is this how luke moves around the oxbox office unbeleafable luke almost killed innocent foliage tactical cheese is a great expression here are some more video game based cheese puns chheadar shot environemmental kill cheese for opening locked doors brieching charge using a horse as cover mascarpone cheese based battle royale game roquefortnite cheese for luring a bear out of hiding to attack your enemies as in far cry 5 camembert escaping through an underwater section blue cheesing it if you have been made while moving backwardsretreating you have been edam and if a game is too hard you need to git gouda 46 seconds in im cryin i wonder what would andy and jane say to this lets play i wish i had friends to play co op with luke sorry about this sorry this is war kills an unarmed injured man im not sure thats war so much as a war crime luke luke and ellen missed the war they were in the brig for unauthorized winkinghaha does the visual fidelity on the switch seem less than it was one whatever platform jane and andy played on ellen it is not hello it is peek a boo i was right ellen needed saving first poll but also nice the slightly anoyed ellen luke where have you gone when luke needed to be saved like she knows that calamity always arises for luke when he strays to far from ellen 2325 ellen sounded just like mcgonagall telling neville and seamus to blow up the bridge shouldnt this be called rambo elite v2with sponsored tips by mike if team oxtra were in the original predator movie theyd take get to the chopper as a bonus mission to blow it up ellen is so sweet if that had been me id have popped a shot or two off at luke to trick him into thinking there were enemies watching him crawl yeah its not blood ellen just got nervous with a jam toastie so are there any actual be stealthy missions on this i wonder how it costs to sponser outsidexboxoxtra to play a game if we pool our money me could get them to play anything out of all guns i like tactical shotguns the best it would seem luigi has taught luke well sniper luigi is disappointed in you 645 that was quite the moving headshot luke it certainly moved me they should have had a nintendo exclusive outfit of luigi like how minecraft had the mario mashup pack luke and ellen clearly enjoying their own fun more than the gameplay ellen having her usual charming giggle about blowing peoples heads off is slightly jarring downer fact my grandfather was with the marines at guadalcanal one thing he volunteered to do during one skirmish was to stand up from cover to attract fire so the other marines could pinpoint the hidden attackers so yeah actually happens the piano doesnt make the right sound when you shoot it this game is not elite enough i like sniper elite i just wish it was more stealthy luke is the over eager little brother who needs saving by big sister ellen playing in the backgroundkeystone cops music hears tactical cheese brain imagines camouflage cheese camouflage fromage can someone make a compilation of ellens glorious laughter already its almost as if sniper elite wasnt really meant to be played with switch controllers 1636 i always sit on a chair like that when i am eating breakfast or when i want to read the news real quick its so relaxing at 1520 that guy did the james bond turn i was expecting the sniper equivalent of overcooked dont know why ellen youre turning into a real lyudmila pavlichenko brava 344 another secondary weapon wouldnt that be a tertiary weapon luck and ellen are scary darn ellen i didnt know you had some of jane dna in you jane and andy seriously approaches game with professional enthusiasm ellen and luke gleefully approaches the game with childlike enthusiasm between the two i kind of like the second approach makers of sniper elite lets get outside xtra to do a vid to show off our cool tactical coop shooter luke ellen wahey look were winking is anyone else surprised there where no highcaliber sniper rounds involved in the winking ellen has been spending too much time with jane and now had a bloodlust of her own andy and jane playing sniper elite coldblooded killers luke and ellen playing sniper elite who let the puppies have guns i wish i had friends like this to play games with haha luke i wonder if i can blow up this blimp i wonder the same thing about the hot air balloons every time i play the miami level of hitman 2 have yet to try sniper luigi the game happiness is a full magazine and a target rich environment tactical cheese is a thing httpswwwbepreparedcomcheesespreadmremealsreadytoeataccessorypack i know its a playstation exclusive but you all would love detroit become human if you havent already played it jane and andy playing this game stealth and tactics luke and ellen playing ahhhhhhh and lets try to put this guy in the chair watching 714 on 25 speed is both strange and hilarious thought sniper elit is a game everyone dumps on ellen not even two minutes in and youve disproved our expectations 1642 jesus we cant take harry anywhere ah the quality sniper elite content im here for admiring art destroying kitchenware falling from high getting lost shooting crotches making dead bodies installations lots of shouting and of course the budding romance in the thick of war i refuse to play a sniper game with a controller oh you think i mean use mouse and keyboard no anything less than the full silent scope setup is unacceptable sets two explosive charges in the environment only shoots one somewhere mike is raging tactical cheese so swiss cheese cause its got holes ill see myself out yall make this game look so much fun and almost convinced me to buy it especially paired with the oxbox content earlier but alas i suck at fps and it would just sit on my switch and never get played but you almost had me therefore the oxboxtra team is the best advertiser so many war crimes luke i thought it was an enemy but it was a leaf ellen the luke westaway story well i dont know about you but id read that sounds like it has an interesting plot line anyway thanks for another great video as always have a nice day everyone lukes first shot caused an explosion probably bc he hit a grenade rubble is clear gets shot at not clear not clear i always think of mike when i see explosive barrels as his playstyle raises an interesting philosophical question if an explosion kills the enemies and theres no survivors to raise the alarmis it therefore a stealth kill i thought it was an enemy but it was a leaf luke getting in on the i am really a kitten racket that ellens been running so successfully so many commend to make on this video so one more with all i have left to say last one i promise luke the numbers are called meters also luke you have an amazing ability to always find a dino in a game even in wwii setting sniper shoter just amazing d and you better not killsteal from ellen or you may find a meat grinder one day p saying im so sorry to a guy sniping you after you snipe him is so british tactical cheese is the best kind of cheese you want cheese eat it tactical yeah not a commercial for any real or unreal cheese p so will putting corpses onto chairs be the next christmas challenge points for accuracy and the most placed jane to andy i am going to shoot this guy in his medulla oblongata luke to ellen so there is nothing left of his hand bones i am not sure who is more scarier i suspect the enemies are somewhere well youre not wrong outsidexbox playthrough stealth stealth stealth outsidextra anything but these games your bullets actually drop like irl right winky winky a sniper story the only way to play this old game is in coop with ellen and luke never play alone ellen even got a pickup friend on the way wait did that sounded weird naah probable not d i dont think you quite understood the objective of a stealthy tactical shooter d inner monologue of ellens kill at 2353 did anyone catch the license plate on that bullet that one guy hit in the knee will later on become a guard in winterfell he was adventuring on the wrong side of the battlefield p i cant believe luke did a kill steal and then a later loot steal from ellen im not angry just disappointed luke hitting someone in the groin sorry sorry thats war they say that war war never changes and i guess it is true after all p nothing more wholesome than sniping nazis in the kidneys together ellens adorable battle cry needs to get into the game any game you still got time to do that borderlands 3 devs just saying d i used to be a soldier like you then i took a bullet to the knee poll first to need reviving luke 85 ellen 15 ellen is downed with 2 minutes from the start of the video maybe just maybe we should cut luke some slack using the scope of the sniper rifle to admire in detail a painting of a guy with a tiny t rex skull whilst discussing the inner thoughts of each of the paintings subjects is exactly the top tier gaming content that keeps me coming back sorry about this sorry thats war luke westaway 2019 right after lukes attempted rendition of that hey ya song when ellen said snipe snipe snipe i expected one of them to give a warbased rendition of shake your booty maybe something like snipe snipe snipe snipe snipe snipe snipe that booty snipe that booty tactical cheese sounds like something a contractor would sell to the government at an exorbitant markup 5 per slice please the biggest difference between this and other gaming channels other youtubers perfect stealth and sniping technique oxtra lets play with the corpses luke and ellen the most british snipers ever pew sorry pew sorry luke at 1143 you take the one on the right ill take the one on the left luke then proceeding to shoot the guy on the right while ellen shoots the one on the left i mean if it works ppsh is typically pronounced pepesha but that works too ellen most people pronounce ppsh pepesha luke i thought it was an enemy but it was just a leaf luke walks outside during autumn fall for any american viewers theres enemies everywhere save me ellen the oxbox team are so bad at video games and yet so entertaining and lovable thats what you get for trying to help someone little too relatable that one lol at 12min 31sec i used to be an adventurer like you but then i took a sniper bullet to the knee luke failed to stealth so fast that he could give mike a run for his money much like jane and andys stealth under the cover of sound for their playthroughso did luke and ellen as he proudly announced rooms clear wow two sniper elite v2 videos in two days across two channels and in both videos you guys managed to utter the phrase i can do this all day its official oxbox and oxtra are just a bunch of wannabe captain americas if this xmas doesnt feature a corpse tossing into a chair event i will be most disappointed the tank is still burning our enemies lie around us dead the sky fills with smoke the world will remember our message woohoo why do germans carry 303 british rounds when their rifles used 792x57 luke shoots a downed soldier between the legs sorry thats war i think that was the moment the world knew not to go to war with the oxbox team i love ellenluke gameplay videos theyre the best turns out that ellen is a very good sniper 028 luke ellen youve just started the video and i already know that youre somehow responsible for the burning building right behind you lukeellen save me from the war not just a component of the war or a specific enemy but from the concept of war please more references to hey ya hes still shooting me like a jerk this video is basically a long list of funny quotes to reference waiting for mike to play one of these again i thought it was an enemy but it was a leaf lol oh boy so every time ellen stops to admire a feature fireplace or a picture someone tries to shoot her i knew the london housing market was cut throat but this is ridiculous 827 how much is that sniper in the window woof woof its so surreal to see this level carry on past where the demo ends andy and jane carefully timed shots to ambient noise and surveyed potential future battle areas with a lot of cover while luke and ellen dump bodies so they drape weirdly over chairs lmao 115 no luke dont name them it only makes it harder breach and clear yells luke charging into a wide open space i mean you cant fault his enthusiasm i have a game you guys can check out cry of fear its a free psychological horror game on steam that started out as a mod for halflife its pretty cool and it has a very unique plot twist that im not gonna spoil please reply soon outside xtra i know you can handle long comments ellen is using a proper english rifle whats your excuse luke 1140 luke calls the targets and both he and ellen shoot the opposite ones target stands still luke lead the target 431 why do all the houses in wwii games use the same wallpaper title save me ellen poll first to get revived well i cant say for sure but i think its going to be luke ellen and luke are the victims of a prank snipe here snipe apologizing to sniped enemies i expected nothing less from this duo ive never played the sniper elite games are they generally recommend you shouldnt tell i failed to stealth im getting shot you should tell now ive miked run jane and andy we must carefully time our shots so that their sound is masked by the environment luke and ellen shoot the piano see if it makes a noise he is shooting at me like a jerk not at all like when you were deliberately targeting incapacitated people or their friends trying too help them the geneva convention exists for a reason luke thank you so much oxboxstra for everything you do i had a family member i live with pass away 2 days ago and you guys always warm my heart a little i want to eat a juicy double cheese burger so badly right now with fries and wash it all down with a large cup of diabetes i hope luke was wearing his sniper luigi outfit during this playthrough otherwise thats a wasted opportunity luke and ellen play peekaboo with the binoculars here on outsidextra even when we are exploding skulls at long range we like to have fun is zombie army trilogy coming to the switch too tactically cheese it or tactical cheese would be good shirt designs just for notification of this video thinking yt is up to somethin latesquad nice to see you guys playing together again i would gladly let ellen shoot me in the goddamn face just saying ellenjustshootme itsok ellensniperedition luke so long ellen two seconds later luke save me ellen its been a while since ellen and luke did a full lets play together im always glad to watch one why x1 version hasnt achievements ps has i love

fuel tank caps cant you rebs just make se 1 remastered for real fans of se not this fatass american hero defeating wehrmacht solo bullsht for kids on nonexistent battlefields i love sniper elite since ps2 but se 2 3 just awful and simple asf everyone who beat the first game on se mode will understand me i love this game i love this game of all times ai of this game is a disaster its pigeon shooting the sniper elite 1 is a masterpiece compared to that one damn son karls voice is epic tom clarke hill did an amazing job i want it but 30 for an old game like thisno waylove the series thoughwait till its under 20 i remember this mission and i will never forget the faces of the soviet snipers in thr last part charging and shooting at you in every place you go hahaha cant wait for destroying that rocket its epic first i am from indonesia 019 whats wrong with his mp40 magazine definetly going to buy it this game was so cool is this the one coming to psvr i wish sniper elite move out from ww2 time to the next wars in the last century wars such as korean war nobody ask for it 111 thats all i needed to see thank you for including that i just want to see a nut shot remastered luckily i havent buy yet now is the time this is the only one i havent played im so hyped why they dont just remastered the very first sniper elite thats a game that glady want to seet in 4k something changes except graphic we find changes in story or mechanics when premiere how much we must pay for it lots of questions no answer fashion for good games remaster i am happy sniper elite 1 they should remaster o remake remastered edition again these games are so bad cant wait to hear german farts remastered i am like hey who ordered this remaster too the only sniper elite i played completely assassinate the fhrer ah wow 4k and hdr its been a long time since i heard anything so boring no vr support no money nice one i played the first 4 missions on sniper elite 3 devitt invouny devitt devitt besssharanim what oh im so happy description read can you please play some bf1 i really enjoy that game im a so flat earth to technically you shot him in the ball singular great vid but there is one tiny error hitler is well known for only having one ball sniper elite v2 is my favourite sniper game great video didnt u know that u can zoom in and out when u sniping yeah that ball shot is worth it though i actually did it two attempts in a row because fraps wasnt recording the first time 5 nazis disliked this video loots german soldiers gets springfield and welrod ammo the description has been read d glad you are doing this one was starting to wonder what to watch after your anno 1800 vids as mentioned by someone else can you do the campaign as well to bad to kill stuff you almost have to aim for the head but besides that these games are super fun lol not a stealth guy i see thats a lot of pun times read description man those critical shots unleashing a full flesh fatality are priceless o7 how do these xrays compare to sniper elite 4 read the description love that game great channel shhhhhhhhhsleep raptor will sing you a sweet lullaby great video i really enjoy this game and keep up the good work meanwhile in germany no one raptor isbedtime thanks for watching my internet was down all day and i finally realized i could use my mobile hot spot to make a few changes to complete the upload and make this live for you all thanks for watching and let me know if you want to see more of sniper elite v2 remastered pretty fun so far just bought this game with 50 off on eshop and i am having a blast on my switch if it doesnt have bullet drop physics its not real sniping skills it is more complete on ps4 nothing more but nice would love to hear your thoughts on sniper elite v1 lol i loved v2 but i uninstalled v3 in the first mission ai was just too dumb nice keep up the good work god bless you just downloaded my preorder on switch earlier today as you said i never liked sniping that much either however sniper elite does it so well with the bullet animation and interesting enough story and settings ive only played about an hour or two but ill definitely be playing this a lot more terrific review i cant believe this came out in 2012 and i still havent played it well i will remedy that before i dive into parts 3 and 4 that will likely make its faults less noticeable by playing them in natural order i love your channel btw great work qotd doom because i was used to call of duty campaigns that provided a linear experience i was put off by the games complex level design in comparison but after looking at a walkthrough and then giving the game a shot i ended up enjoying it that goyte song was everywhere for a few years now hes somebody that we used to know i can sneak and snipe in mgsv qotd i wrote off ace combat until my friend got me hooked on 4 and love the series well just forget about assault horizon i also wrote off monster hunter until part 3 came out and its now one of my favorite game series i didnt like zelda ive played a few games and they didnt catch me but then breath of the wild happened and i absolutely adore this game i have been playing lego batman with my kid and it is much better than i expected really need to get into this series one of these days curse you backlog for holding so many gems qotd is a tough one i have some singular games that this is happened to but i cant think of many full game franchises the closest i think would be farcry i really dont care for the first one or its weird console cousins but fell in love with farcry 2 and have liked all the games since with caveat that i havent played new dawn yet i was silent hill fan didnt liked resident evilnow when silent hill is dead resi is one of my favourite survival horror game seriesneed to beat just few re games to finish them all loved sniper elite 34 is in my backlogi like stealth and sniping in 3will bought v2 on sale when i beat 4th game no voice on the end card well anyway a series i wrote off but later came to enjoy is final fantasy i used to hate how derivative it seemed and how popular it was but then i played more games in the franchise and was surprised in the 4th i shot hitler in the arse as he was trying to escape by speedboat some things only games can provide i enjoyed v2 a lot back in 2012 but you are right about sniper elite 3 and 4 being better games the series gets better as it goes on im looking forward to sniper elite 5 i think you forgot the audio in the endcard i couldnt have scripted a better ending even if i tried lol rgt i think this is one of the best games on the switch by far i had these games on the ps4 but couldnt really feel it but man those games rock on the ns controls are spot on i like to play on high sensitivity no problemo the graphics are nice and on the v2 awesome i bought them because of the discount till16012020 no regrets for people like me who love to sneak like in mgs this game is for you looks and feels awesome this game shows how much power and potential the ns has play and talk at the same time multitasking which is better 2 or 3 17 now a steal best switch war shooter mouahahaha there is no war shooter on switch except sniper elite well i think this is a great gametnx for the review man is this console worth it for 3rd party games im not really into the nintendo exclusives how long is this game buy it and indeed is very fun does this game have a physical edtition i love linear open games kick in my ocd i have to check every corner of every map thank god for linear games i love this game and sniper elite 4 i would like the zombie army trilogy to be on here best war shooter that happens to be on switch i want fallout new vegas on switch a drifting joycon like mine is definitely not an ally in these type of games does the switch version require any downloads rgt85 could you tell me if local play requires 2 switches and 2 copies hitman needs to come to the switch can you review saints row the third the full package on the switch i love this game pooped my pant thumbnail picture 1010 as always if i can get a physical copy its a buy for me on the switch in the first sniper elite you get to kill hitler multiple ways you could shoot them in the head or shoot him in his ball sack im not sure to get sniper elite v2 or wait for sniper 3 ultimate only interested in one first as i am not too familiar with the series its the only war shooter left 4 dead and dead rising for nintendo switch one of my favorite series played v2 just a few weeks ago on steam its amazing and still holds up today definitly not dated imo pure classic cant wait for the zombie game though i love that game i played it on the wii u i actually physical i use the carcano rifle cause of the huge size of the bullet it shatters skulls like lee harvey oswald did i just wanna shoot testicles i already pre ordered it and your video makes me wanna play it right now i dont want to wait anymore a game like this just goes to show that graphics arent everything sure the textures are lacking the models are basic and the movement isnt the most fluid but a fun gameplay loop is all we really need ill be picking this up on switch for sure currently playing through mgs v phantom pain and while there are fundamental differences to the two watching your gameplay reminds me of pp sniper elite v2 recycled edition i like the switch but whats up with all of these recycled games this games great but sadly the first sniper elite on xbox and pc is still much better than any of the newer sniper games se 3 and later games got better imo does it need any download or is everything in the cartridge man you are trash at this game am in a plan to bring sega back to the market as a manufacturer i need 5 opinion formers to work together with me to initiate a joint request for the return of sega the sonic movie showed us the strength of the community any questions just ask we are from the group best friends of segas fans ill pass thanks for showing it early its like mortal kombat and fallout combined i played the demo so many time those headshot are awesome lol definitely picking up for the switch great game but you can get it for seven dollars on ebay for every other system you could play it on the ps3 or xbox 360 for like 5 dollars its really not that good of a game i would not spend 35 dollars on this sniper elite 4 is the best one but it is not available on the switch because the switch does not have the horsepower to support it reminds me of hells highway bia you would die easily if your careless now that would rock on the switch i probably wont be getting it since i own the wiiu version the game is very underrated though its lots of fun this actually looks pretty cool is this handheld or docked played sniper elite v2 from beginning to end on the wii u and i dont play a whole lot of shooters but the game had its hooks in me out of all 4 games this one is the best and the switch should run it well since the source was a ps3xbox360 game btw gonna get the pc version since it is only 10 as a special price for owners of the original yall keep settling for crap like this smfh switch has a lack of games in this genre so its welcomed im surprised that you didnt play this game on the nintendo wii u rgt 85 is this a nintendo switch only channel this game is a multiplat heres hoping they port over zombie army trilogy you shoot for the balls persona should be on the switch you deserve your ending because youre so confident in almost every single one of your videos i dont hate you but i really wish you would change your tone on click bait and yelling at your fans because we want to see videos not you being angry all the time and thinking sega is the greatest company in ive played the original on pc its a fun game i love setting up the booby traps in stair cases and hearing them go off when the ai comes after you im glad there are people in the world like this guy he shows so much passion for gaming in all the videos he loves his job and loves gaming the passion for it shows on each video hes not doing these just for the money he needs way more subs nobody should sleep good at night if they hate this man hes so energetic you gotta like him you can tell hes a good person i feel he over hypes re released games because he got them free this is a dumb down version and no achievements of a game that wasnt great on other platforms i wouldnt even play this if i got it free i will only by first party games on my switch if idumbt one of those please dont make a switch video and come out with some fresh content i can go to 10 other youtubers before i click on one of your videos great vid it looks pretty good shooting hitlers testicles on the go put that on the damn box i always test games early and fill out my reportbeen doing it for yearsfree games with work involvedalso just finished it again on ps now last week no different then the silver star edition for ps3360graphics are actually the same with a good display and i have the two best displays for gamingjust a rerelease which is cool nonetheless finished it pretty quick i cant play shooters on switch im not used to aiming with console i bought wolfenstein nd i cant play it now though the game is amazing this reminds me of metal gear 5 zombie army trilogy is awesome will likely like this game too 3999 for a game from 2012 no thanksi can buy a copy on ps3 for 5 your opinion dnt mean sh no more thanks man ive been waiting for something like thismy next game for sure dude day 1 buy for me cant wait question do you think army zombie trilogy is coming to the switch lol spotted right away terrible remaster that doesnt even look as good as the ps3 version wtf its the pc version of v2 basically isnt it the only switch war shooter omg 20 fps gameplay pubg mobile is better than this and the gameplay you should be riffle man not sniper lol is gyro supported on this game coz i see you have difficulty in aiming or its just me great lets plsy rgt 85 sniper elite v2 is solid good fun title but wait until you play sniper elite 3 ultimate guys d damn this game looks a lot better than i thought thats fair as a fan of the sniper elite series im looking forward to the remaster i played the original on console and will probably buy the ps4 version this time around ive held off buying a switch but playing sniper elite v2 remastered on the move does appeal thanks for posting i assume you are playing the game docked he must have a word of the calendar and methodical has got to be todays word i remember when you had almost no subs now your over 200k noice its funny how he says hes always loved the sniper elite series yet only played part 1 lol this was on wiiu hardly any remaster not my type of game but looks good consoles are literally moving to a next generation and nintendo is busy with remaking trust me nintendos principles have switched from pure entertainment to income 4 is awesome its a better metal solid game then mgs5 was theres stealth and sniping if you want absolutely love this franchise unfortunately the pc release had a really bad crashing bug they never fixed i wanna see zombie army trilogy come to switch it was great on xbox id buy it again if it did come to nintendo i love blowing the testicles off those enemies great game i found all the hidden items i even sniped hitlers testicles clean off how can this be the best war shooter on switch when modern combat exists its really cheap for the original pc version why pay extra for the switch im getting this for the playstation 4 4khdr i guess this is as close to call of duty the switch will ever see arr gee tee eighty five another switch video next can you 360 no scope in that game where is the physical release for this amazon doesnt show anything neither does gamestop edit gamestop shows it but nothing on amazon i was gonna try to grab this for xbox one but this looks good and having it portable is very appealing i have this for the ps3 but havent beaten it i cant even tell ifwhen im watching a sponsored video anymore on youtube love the gamebutplayed it so many years ago no need to play againsorry switch im really exciteed to get it ive been wanting it because i didnt play the original rgt85 great video as always thanks for some reason your videos are no longer showing in my recommend feed as it usually is just an fyi i had to look for ya thanks again 360p what is this the early 2000s ill be getting it asapmultiplayer is why the highest my smartphone will render this is 360pjust took the remaster right out of it forget about hd this is lower than sd lol if modern warfare 2 gets remastered it should be on switch damn dog gonna have to dislike the video for the yankee fitted yea im that petty go mets lol i have it for the xbox and it is a fun game cant wait to try it on the switch im so happy this game is coming to switch id like to see unreal tournament 2004 come to the switch stinky game remastered visuals is a lie game looks the exact same and will be useless nice but do not care about that at that time women could not fight on the battlefield why x1 version hasnt achievements ps has played only the demo back on the 360 sure the sniping was great but ai and sortof level design were from hell dont need this remaster why wouldnt you remaster sniper elite 1 then 2 anyone interested in sniper elite 2 remaster has likely already played it given it released 2012 sniper elite 1 however released in 2005 tenth comment bois yos sniper elite series and zombie army trilogy are so much fun cant wait i refunded it since i watched some footages i think it really is an unnecessary remastered while most of changes could have been released as an update its iconic xray killcam also nerfed imo i like the se4 rifle shot sound but overall visual effects and detailed are gone you can see those bullet trails follows like a distortion in v2 but not in remastered why is the scope view button changed from left trigger to left bumper all other sniper elites use the left trigger while i still find no reason to play this in 2019 when i have both sniper 3 and 4 on my pro still a great review i have the remastered and i cant wait to try it out its shit how short the game is killing that russian in the end would russiastarlin see that as an act of war can i play this on the nintendo lite do u have to download this i pray for a clean break thats what i personally voted for great video subscribed i had an absolute blast playing this on a handheld system i loved it was a good laugh watching this looks a lot better than the wii something version i bought ages back hows online playabilty use the binoculars lmao beat this game on sniper elite difficulty today had no idea you could edit your load out lol good game though its 999 on steam fyis looking closer at the steam page 999 is the price to upgrade to the remastered version if a person already owns the nonremastered version its just as much fun as watching alex numble through mud in a truck 3 n i n t e n d o f r i e n d l y lol this was hilarious wonder if well get zombie army trilogy on switch oh man im so on this sniping with gyro in crisp hd on the handheld must have now can confirm coop is amazing played the whole campaign on pc with a friend do you has been tested the multiplayer mode youre terrible at this nintendolife hello do you know if coop and multiplayer for offline play require 2 switches and 2 copies of the game thank you picks german officer maybe they wont notice im an enemy the one of few levels you shoot communists in looks really fun yeah im sorry this port looks a bit rubbish game looks so slow and boring watch out for those sneaky backstabbting frenchmen it seem like youre not really a real shooter type person anyone can hear an explosion you play too much mario getting it tomorrow teammmmmmmmmmmmm switch how much does it cost thinking of buying includes paid promotion so if it was crap you wouldnt tell us hmmmm you know you can mark them so you know where they are yeah your

like to see the remaster of smiper elite 1 i had forgotten how loud carls boot clopping was in this version not the most quietest of snipers with those cart horse boots onyou can hear him coming a mile awaypicking this up tomorrow beautiful berlin best from the series love your sniper series please remaster the first one i have it on the wii and i know lots of people would like to see that one redone i asked for a steam refund im disappointed that rebellion chose to exploit its loyal fanbase by doing a quick cash grab releasing what is just a texture repack with some new shaders check out the steam reviews im far from the only one who feels this way i think it looks fantastic and it is a most welcome addition to a console which sometimes lacks on the shootie shootie bang bag department itll never cease to amaze me the magnitude and the quality of the games that we can now play on the go thanks to nintendo thank you guys for the great content and the give away greetings from chile i dont think this game fits the nintendo switch i dont know why i feel like this maybe its because i havent played it yet but i feel like it needs a km to proper play it grate visuals grate gameplay perfect free copy seems like a game i would want to wait for a really good deal on but it does look smooth nerver got around to play this so perfect oppertunity to do so now ok lets be honest i really really suck at splattoon 2 on the nintendo switch as in i suck at aiming while shooting trying not to get killed in handheld mode no pro controller dont have one so my question is sniper elite v2 even worth getting at all if i suck badly on spattoon 2 since im a keyboard mouse shooter gamer only i have never played these sniper games at all seems like it might be fun i would love to have sniper elite v2 remastered nintendo switch because i really enjoy playing sniper elite but it coming to nintendo switch is amazing it really good what is better shooter payday2 or sniper elite 2 i dont know what to get for my switch it sounds ands looks amazing looks fun for sure i think it will be a good addition to the switch its certainly different to other shooters on the switch gameplay isnt great but its a 7 year old port on a handheld overall looks good another great port for switch looks cool in portable mod looks so satisfying to get those slow mo shots looks like great fun ports like this are what give a console longevity waffles i want this game this channel should do more reviews more often almost really want this game now thank you so much needing this review to finally decide on getting this or not just snipe him you take slot of time just shoot i can snipe on the go awsome but i only play in hand held mode like a ps vita if i had a switch nice vid zach n gabe sniper elite v2 remastered is a great game on the switch but wait n till you play sniper elite 3 ultimate that is a really fantastic game handheld gamers will be able too play the sniper elite games no sweat im not a really a handheld gamer so i try too play in table top if i can or docked of course is the main way too play i think you guys definitely hyped me up for this game i would love to get the give away good luck to everyone but if i dont i definitely will be picking it up on launch i think ill pick this game up later want to see assassins creed 3 before i buy it i was subbed for a long time and i got a switch a month ago and i really like this games fps and graphics and i really want a copy because i spent all my money on a switch it would be appreciated if i could have a copy this nearly identical to the xbox360 version i had back in the day 7 years ago what is remastered about this can we get more new and current third party games that dont look like they came from two console generations ago im super excited for all these ports coming to switch especially older titles that a lot of people didnt get the chance to play game looks great cant wait to play it on switch i really was worried about it not running very well but i am relived now its so impressive that you can play it on the switch i always loved the snipe elite games i have 3 and 4 and i really enjoy the gameplay of them i love that its just a well done port overall i love shooters i agree with you all this one slows down the game play and makes you think before you shoot i am getting tired of run and gun fast pace games im also glad this one is coming out for switch because i missed it the first time so now i have a chance to enjoy it tbh i want the game but ive never really played any of the sniper games this game looks great always wanted to try this series been playing it a bit today really enjoying it looks great in handheld and runs really well the slow mo headshots looks sooooo satisfying it is a port which runs well so definitely on my wishlist i would much rather play something with less fancy lighting etc as long as it runs properly nice to have something different in the shooter genre on switch too would be great if a code came my way love the fact that it comes out physical the checkpoints without quick save is something i will probably miss too i really missed that in doom whenever i put it on hard mode and died all the time the load times were pretty long anyway i might just get this one the game is great im curious to try this out im honestly undecided but the strategy element is interesting to me the game looks pretty smooth and fun which is great but i think the price point is a little too high in my opinion i think its a nice addition to a on the go play sniping and wwii games have always been my favorite never got to finish sniper elite v2 but loved and finished sniper elite 3 and 4 i would think a lot more highly of the game if i got it for free seems pretty epic it looks excellent i havent played a sniper elite game yet and i would love to experience it by the way youre one of my favourite switch youtubers graphics look great i do not have any shooter games or sniper games would be nice to break my procontrol in with would love to play another shooter on switch doom is great but hectic something more methodical would be awesome the slowmo looks pretty cool it must be incredible play in handheld mode its nice to have a stealthier military shooter on switch game looks good good luck to everybody the game looks really great on switch and i really like the linear type of game feels old school this game looks epic gamer great video i always wanted to play this game when it releases on wii u i hope to winsorry if my english is bad as highlighted this is a nice change of pace and a welcome addition to the switch hola at me with that code bros been wanting to try this out not a big fan of brainless fast shooters so this seems more up my alley with its slower more tactical gameplay i love these games cant wait to play on the go this game was released on my birthday hahaha it really looks great i especially love that there are gyro controls for someone who doesnt like to snipe people this gane is looking great for me especially the slowmo after you releasing the trigger oh boy this is gonna be a trip down memory lane for me 2015 a 15 year old me would have a blast playing this game and i was soo hooked that it almost affected my grades back then hahathe satisfying slowmo headshots are still very satisfying and the slower pace of the game compared to its sequels helps make the game a morelike a chill game the type of game youd play after a long day at workschool and just unwind welp to conclude ill copy paste my old pc review from back then here the graphics are great shooting mechanics is solid pretty good sound the game will intermittently send you in shooting where your shooting prowess will determine your victory this is the kind of game where you need lots of patience but the game is stealth shooter the switch version just looks like a wet dream come true just imagine taking a huuuuge dump and headshotting scum on the switch love this channel perfect to keep up with switch news and makes it much easier for i remember playing this back on the 360 years ago the game looks like it holds up pretty well i smashed the like also i think its awesome i think is going to be good remaster looks good for sure i going to buy it and good price nearly bought this on the ps3 the other day then saw it was out for the switch always wanted to try this great video not bad at all for a nintendo switch more games like this enjoy when stealth is a big part of the game not a full just sniper shooter type cant wait for this i want the game it look so fun i think the game is a great addition to the switch because it will draw in more players for the switch this game looks very good and cant wait to play a good shooter again i would love to try the game gameplay looks amazing and story looks interesting love the stealth mechanic great game cant wait for other titles in the series to come to switch looks pretty good on the switch impressed by the gameplay and graphics wanted this game for long the switch hasnt been on my mind much due to gcse but this and mortal kombat im thinking gettin bk on it would love the donations yano imma cop this one i love that all of these ports are coming to the switch makes playing these games on the go way more convenient for me the port job looks amazing on this version i love sniper games and this is one of my favourites cant wait to play it on a handheld cant wait to play this i think is a different shooting game a lot more concentration and stealth is required pretty much everything discussed in this video i liked probably the handheld with gyro as well as the slow mode and satisfyng shooting no its not nice its hypocritical its port after port just like the wiiu everyone gives the switch a pass but the wiiu got crapped on when it would get a port i dont care if its remastered its the same game woohoo se2 yeah so amazing 10 out of 10 thank rebellion this and saints row the 3rd are going to make my 2019 yessssssssssss i have a switch and love it but this over acceptance for ports on switch is a bit hypocritical when wiiu got drug through the mud for receiving ports sorry had to vent i think the game is a change of pace from everything we usually get we need to keep this kind of game alive awesome looking game hope to play it soon looks pretty nice nice to see a bice mostly single player shooter to the switch that isnt doom or wolfenstein love wwii and the sniper elite series just havent gotten the time to play them yet would love to get the game gyros are awesome since joysticks arent the greatest for precision gimme that game gameplay looks solid very good port good luck on the giveaway everyone sniper elite is a good game and a great addition for the switch i would love to play it again and again without a doubt already have it pre ordered waiting for it to release any time now i would throughly enjoy playing this tactical game on my switch sniping is satisfying and relaxing hahaha ive always enjoyed this game it takes my favorite aspect of shooters and take it to the next level sniper elite looks great on switch i especially like snipers in games even tho im not that good but it seems rly fun to play on the go it looks pretty cool always wanted to try it but prefer to try it on the switch i love stealth games so being a sneaky sniper is right up my alley i really want to try this game out it makes me feel like im inside a real war hiding being stealthy and if caught i will probably die p looks very nice on the switch imo not a huga fan o the price tho i just bought a procontroller on sunday yes on mothers day but it was on sale so i had to well what i wanted to say is that you sold me on the procontroller comment if i dont win the game i will buy it myself thanks this game will be great to play on ns last time i played sniper elite on my mates ps3 and it was awesome i initially had zero interest in this game but watching this has given me a lot more interest in this game itll be one i pick up on sale sometime not day one the sniping specials are very enticing it gives of the same kind of satisfaction that fatalities in mortal kombat provide although the title makes it seem like a generic mobile sniping game it really exceeded my standards i like the mgslike gameplay where sneaking and avoiding combat is almost forced upon the player it looks and runs pretty well and is a worthy upgrade from the original im surprised gabe didnt mention how his hand cramped playing this game in handheld mode or is that just an issue with sr3 ive played sniper elite v2 since ps3 i used to play it allll dayyy im so glad its coming to switch never played before could be the best chance now my dudes this game is pretty cool love the channel guys you 2 have been a big help on picking games you have convinced me on this as well hook it up my brothers from other mothers my youth i been waiting for this one sadly its hard to get in my region physically nice review the game is great runs well it looks good i would love to try it out but dont have the money right now i think sniper elite is a really good game due to the fact that it can be played as a stealthy game i think it looks awesome i never played sniper elite v2 and this gives me a good reason looks like a worth pick up it looks good in handheld the slowmo just feels awesome playing while playing clever not just rushing doom style that also good dont get me wrong i might try this one out i think its one of the prettiest most realistic titles the switch has and ir seams that the slowmotion shots have a surprisingly rewarding tactile feel weirdly enough this game seems slightly relaxing with the slower pace of it all it is like all of my favorite missions in medal of honor back in the ps1 but now i can take it with me i think they did a great job with the graphics and i would love to try it hmm never played these games but i like mgs and hitman i think id like this i always loved the sniper elite games so im just glad the series has finally made its way on the switch i love how stealthy the game feels this game looks great on the switch ive only played the demos for the sniper elite games and i loved zombie army trilogy i will definitely buy this on switch though onthegobeatsathome havent played the original release but have always thought the bullet scenes looked great im glad that nintendo finally got the dlc for this game i had it on the wii u and i felt like i got robbed this is the version wei deserved 6 years ago it looks pretty good for an older game the combination of stealth and action make this unique id be tempted to give it a try this game looks really good i just got a nintendo switch too im not really a shooter game person but this looks like so much fun im ecstatic it can be played well in handheld mode handheld is just so much easier for me love this game favorite sniper game hands down and i would be so appreciative if i got that free copy thanks guys keep it up finally a decent online shooter its pretty good just please bring zombie army trilogy as long as i can still snipe a scrote im in good video game looks good im here for the kill cams to be fair it looks good on the switch will be playing handheld for sure ive never played this but it looks like a very good game to play the story really interests me as i love wwii themed games i also think the slow motion kill shots look awesome online co op really nice game loved it on the ps4 looks also really nice on the switch looks pretty good might have to pick this up later doesnt look too bad glad to see more 3rd person shooters coming to switch i have never played it but it looks good and i would like to enter to win thanks looks like a pretty good remaster and i love the slow gameplay of sniper elite i never played sniper elite but it looks pretty fun and you can never have too many shooters on the switch cant wait to snipe nazi balls while waiting for my dentist appointment honestly im quite shocked by how good the graphics are for switch looks pretty good from a gameplay and graphics perspective im really interested in this game 303 actually looks really great nice review guys i was actually going to rebuy the ps3 or 360 version that had the dlc but it was nice to see this being announced on modern consoles such a great series all of them are a lot of fun the game looks good gonna pick it up even if i dont get the code i loved playing sniper elite its awesome to see them get remastered looks better than expected tbh keep it up with the vids mate you doing a great job very interested played 4 on xbox and liked it but this excites me more in handheld mode more than anything perfect game on the go the game looks great i love ww2 shooters this looks good always wanted to play this series this game is so good ill cry even thought its looks fine but i would love to have a competitive shooter on switch besides paladin ofc looks like a good port i never played a sniper elite game excited to give it a shot game looks amazing and looks like it runs smooth with good detail to the environment loved the sniper elite series first played it when i was stationed in california for the xbox and loved it hope to pick this one up for the switch so i can snipe on the go well i gotta be honest i never played this game not single one of the series and i dont really know why i didnt try the game maybe it wasnt interesting enough for me and i thought it will look better on the switch but im still going to buy the game anyway because i really want to try the game even if i want to buy more assassins creed iii remastered this month for the switch im still going to buy the sniper elite v2 remastered for the switch i think i need the game i never win shit but heres to never giving up looks awesome so glad theres no running issues great vid as always this game looks awesome ive always heard about the sniper elite games but never had a chance to play one it looks very promising very great looking game glad to hear this game has come to the switch played and enjoyed the wii u versiononline co op is a nice touch too switch wanna play the game this game looks really cool on switch hope i win the game i love sniper games its the best way to test your shooting skills never played a sniper elite game before but id love to never won an internet giveaway before but id love to we can fix this guys never got a chance to play this on console pc looking forward to trying it on switch it will be nice to have this quality kind of shooter of a game on the switch slowmo reminds me of fallout which is pretty cool id like to eventually get this i enjoy the gameplay and look forward to viewing more looks pretty dope i like the stealth element would love to play it seems like a perfect shooter for the switch and indeed sniping is super satisfying espesially with gyrocontrols the graphics look great on the switch too bad saints row the third on the switch doesnt have multiplayer like this game i absolutely believe we need more games like this considering the switch has very few shooters this looks really fun im glad the switch finally has a stealth shooter the performance looks good and the graphics look decent id definitely pick it up if i had the dough i also really hope we get a splinter cell game on switch one day ive been interested in the sniper elite games ever since i saw a review for its dlc in a xbox 360 magazine years ago the game still interests me and with it coming to switch it might be the best time to get it as it looks great for switch and having it centred around snipping makes it stand out ive been waiting for this game for so long and i cant wait to play it it looks great the game looks good i think this game looks really fun just to mess around with used to own this back on the ps3 or 360 looks like a really good port i think id prefer playing this game in handheld i think the game is great i loved it on pc and i hope to play it on the switch fairly priced single player shooter hell yeah i want to try it wow surprisingly good graphics im also glad theres another shooter game on switch even if i dont buy it it means nintendo is embracing violent games more rather than aiming mostly for kids i loved this game on xbox this game looks good on the switch hope i win looks great i really hope that i can get this game the first gaming experience i had was watching my brother play the first sniper elite since then im hooked to gaming and here i am today keep up with the good work loved sniper elite on consoles im glad its coming to switch sounds like its going to be a nice switch port it looks good good remaster for a good game cant wait to get it looks great would buy the game looks super cool i realy like it i also think it is nice that it looks good on handheld its just a nice looking game i love this type of games and its looking surprisingly good for switch i love how more and more games are supporting gyro aiming because i was pc gamer before switch and gyro makes aiming feel just a bit more familiar and atleast in splatoon it feels great im loving it these are some of the best graphics for a game like this that ive seen on switch its a great looking remaster and runs well as expected unfortunately im really enjoying saints row right now and have no money for this game sniper elite look like s fun and different kind of shooter on switch it looks pretty cool i would like to play it i havent played many sniperstealth games but after your video game looks great patience is a virtue and im super excited about expanding my switch game collection with this i just love snipers i always play snipers in every shooter its so satisfying when you get that headshot kill also the graphics look cool didnt expect it to be that good for switch the sniper elite series is one of my favorite game series i love experimenting with all the cool gadgets and getting those highly precise shots just right always wanted to try a game of this saga not a huge fan of the grapichs on switch but id still give it a go cant wait to play it the game looks amazing period damn it looks good in handheld mode i remember playing the demo for this game on my ps3 never bought it but would love to get it on switch seems playable would definitely play in the near future gyro controls im in ive never got to play it and only have heard about it in passing but this looks pretty damn good not going to lie game looks great oh whats this i won the giveaway graphics are good as hell this is one the best sniper series out right now def cant wait to crack some stomachs nd livers open i have wanted to play a sniper elite game and this one seems to run well on the switch the port is pretty smooth actually all i wanted to hear is if it slows down and since you said you didnt experience it i would love to play it now the game looks pretty good on the switch it kinda reminds me of call of duty 3 and world at war but more graphically refined i also like how the added gyro i think its becoming a norm for the switch now this comment is a headshot triple kill for the giveaway this game looks good i never played it when it first came out but have been interested scenes hearing about it coming to switch so i thought i take a look at this video to see how it runs looks awesome i cant wait for a good stealth sniping game i watch your channel everyday on the way home for work keep up the great job thanks for being my go to source for upcoming switch games ive been thinking about getting it it looks interesting im interested in the online modes sounds great snipe and shoot gameplay is pretty satisfying i must say im excited with the online mode bet it would be so much fun i have been a fan of the sniper elite series since the first one on pc im am a business owner and trying to grow a successful business so i am never home having this on the switch would be fantastic this game looks really fantastic on the switch cant wait untill i can get it looks rad every shooter that i play i always pick a sniper rifle so this game seems right up my alley there isnt actually campaign coop right i think it is only special coop missions thanks for the video my friends recommended me the game on my computer while looking into it it would be something id like to get but when it comes on sale prices in australia are ridiculous i loved the game on 360 id play it on switch even if it was jank nice game this looks good i may have to pick it up it looks pretty good i like the gyro feature it fits very well for shooting with a sniper rifle looks awesome cant wait for this and re4 yup of course lol would want to play this game this game looks really good it looks realistic ive always loved fps this game looks fun 2 hours remaining until im able to play this game i pre ordered it on saturday so im getting antsy i loved it back on 360 so im excited to play it again it runs and plays worse than every other version theres your answer youre welcome played the original and loved it would love to get it for the switch and play it on my way to work every day i really like this kind of shooter games where you play as a sniper cant wait to try it myself this game is mega epic it looks good i really enjoyed the 3rd one definitely wanted to play this one on switch better than i expected it to run on switch this is one of my favorite games from last gen looking forward to play on the go game looks amazing on the switch i need the beauty in my life im disabled dont have money for every game realse after finally seeing gameplay of this its nice to know ports are running well at least i think this fills in the shooter niche on the switch quite nicely for now looks like a great game i love the slower pace shooterstrategy games and with the motion controls giving that extra element of fine tuning it should be an awesome play looks awesome and im really happy with coop cause i need more coops game looks fun might be worth picking up on sale or near a holiday i dont know much about the sniper elite series but ive seen gameplay of it on my friends xbox one s and it looks really fun i honestly had no idea this was coming to the switch but i really wanna get it now this port looks great shooting in the go is always a must looks like a fun game missed it when it came out years ago you guys are awesome great feedback never played it before all the videos ive seen have made me very interested in this and will be picking this up looks great i would love to win the digital copy never tried any of the games but always wanted to but being mostly a nintendo guy ive never got a chance to pick it up would be nice to get it free it looks interesting i like seeing more shooters on switch this one seems like a good change of pace for a shooter im glad to see this i want to see a variety of fps games on switch this game looks awesome the way that you take your shoots its absolutely insane love the way that the switch handled it on portable mode goes to check to see if theres a physical copy of the game ive been addicted to sniper elite 4 on the ps4 so i cant wait to play this on switch loved shooting the noses off nazis last time i played it enjoyed it on pc when i win i will enjoy it on switch as well hope multiplayer is good nice review i feel like the game is good after you guys review but it really depends on the community around it after beating all the levels the multiplayer will be responsible for the replayablility even though i feel the game is a good stepping stone for switch nintendo allowing gorier games but also still remaining kidfriendly is a good sign of things to come would love to play this on switch in the future looks better than expected i think the gameplay and the visuals are really good this is the next step on getting a call of duty game on the switch or even a battlefield game on mw4 be announced on the switch at e3 i never played the game it looks really cool and i was planning on getting it soon being able to snipe people on the go just sounds fun i think it holds up really well against the xbox and ps4 versions looks beautiful it looks pretty good been looking forward to this coming to switch for a while i think its awsome that a game like that will be available for switch now it can play anyway the graphics looks awsome this game is definitely a worth while game in my opinion a great game to add the the switch 3rd party selection the more the better it looks fun those slow mo shots look so satisfying never played a sniper elite game gl all i remember playing the demo on my xbox 360 when i was a kid and being amazed now i have a chance to get the entire game on my switch im sold seems very interesting and would be really fun to have a realistic shooter on the switch plus i am awful with snipers so this would help me with aim im pleasantly surprised with it the graphics are just as good as on the other consoles im honestly happy that this game is coming to the switch i would very much like to get a copy free is always good but be happy to purchase one copy when its available also like your indepth and honest review of it im stoked for a slower paced sniper fps single player on switch very cool looks like a great use of the switch liked this game is awesome i have it on pc and i would get this again to have it portable fun game the bullet time never gets old the switch always impresses me with the ports from what you guys described this game has me intrigued i seen games in this series on sale for steam but it just never had me interested however the hybrid nature of the switch gyro controls and the overall quality makes we want to give it a solid try i may even get into the rest of the series the game look awesome i cant wait to try it im new to the nintendo switch and love every minute of it i havent played a sniper elite game before but it looks pretty fun ill probably try it out soon i dont play too many shooter games but this game looks really good i really like the slower pace it has and the story sounds interesting the game looks great definitely into the game hoping to possibly win great looking forward to play the coop mode already pre ordered it i had the game on the wii u and thought it was great and taking it on the go would be awesome awesome review guys i have patiently waiting for this game to come out and for someone to give their take on it i just got the switch a few weeks ago and bought diablo 3 and breath of the wild since then ive purchased a few inexpensive games celeste and mana spark and a friend of mine let me borrow dead cells which is fantastic i like this game for many reasons i like the game mechanics being a sniper and having to survive mission after intense mission until you can start making kill shots on the enemy the graphics are amazing especially being ported to the switch after all this time so that is also a plus my favorite part is the time period ive studied wwii for quite some time now and enjoy books like the man in the high castle where it shows what happens if we lost to nazi germany and the allied forces being able to be placed in the center of the war and doing your part to take down the nazi forces would be awesome to play even if i dont win i will pro didnt think i would want this title but after watching this will buy i think it would be awesome to have this on switch like you said its a shooting game but unlike others it goes slow and its awesome stealth killing people if i won this then my brother might actually think im cool and i also dont have any other shooting games so it would be amazing if i won because ive only played it on my friends xbox 360 ps sorry if i sound snobby or whatnot i want to play this game so bad this game looks really amazing im really into third person shooters too which helps im having trouble deciding which games to buy right now since there are so many good games coming out right now im hoping to pick this one up once i get paid as i just started a jobim 15 hoping to pick up this and res 4 ac3 remastered saints row the third the full package and la noireyes i know it came out a while ago but havent had the chance to pick it up i love the ww2 aspect of the game as well the footage looks really nice as well love the day and date release i really appreciate you all doing the giveaway i really hope youd consider me thanks for supporting the community this is one of my favorite games of all time its like splinter cell mixed with call of duty i love the bullet cam kill experience its a early version of dark souls mixed with ghost recon in that sense in the fact you cant run and gun through it it makes you feel accomplished when you get through a mission its one of those games that you have to really adapt too before youre good best fps handheld game possible because the challenge plus kill cam whats not to like if i get a copy ill stream it and advertise for you for the copy honestly i love sniper games and it seens an amazing game i hope to be able to play it thanks to switch force i think it gives me some hope of cod coming to switch looks great usually remastered games dont do well but this one looks and run just fine the graphics looks updated and the gameplay is still satisfying plus the gyro feature the switch had makes aiming feels like pc and its like youre actually holding a sniper the graphics are good the story line is one of the best thingsit sounds great because you can supposedly choose your own path overall it looks pretty good i think is a really cool adittion to the switch library is something different and cool i think game rocked when it first came out looking forward to playing it on the switch i need this game switch force help me hahaha great addition i love shooter games cant wait it looks great for the switch i love your content and would love to get the game it looks amazing and would love to give it a try keep your content up never played this one before so hoping to play it soon looks like to can play it in short periods not bad would give it a try after im done drowning in a backlog of switch games lol this game looks great even in handheld whenever i played games like goldeneye or perfect dark with my brothers i was always on the sniper rifle its great to see a game devoted to my favorite play style im looking forward being the silent hand of death once again cool game my friend played this years back when i was in high school ive been wondering if i should try it out or not looks neat the game looks awesome and i think it will be a very interesting shooter havent played it would like to please rng the next best thing to slowmo shots in fallout for what it costs and the content thats there i think its price is justifiable may just put my sights on it physically why is every subsequent switch release taking into account day and date releases content parity and price point equality in the 3rd party sect a port for you guys jesus the looks really cool i definitely want to check it outrebellion are awesome devs the game looks great portability and stealthy shooting sound like a great combo good price for a good game also glad they have gyrocontrol gotta love the brutal slow motion nazi slaying it looks like a fun exciting game coming to switch i like how it has many aspects to it the game look fun to play in the toilet quick scoping and quick pooping it looks better than expected it will be a nice shooter for the switch the game looks interesting it looks very fun and the graphics look amazing for the switch played sniper elite v2 on ps3 its an amazing game very fun challenging looking forward to switch release a damn shooter not fortnite shit i played the hell out of this back on the 360 nice to see it come to switch and it looks really quite good glad to hear that load times are good would love to be able to play this on my commute to and from work so i think i might end up picking this up on the switch it looks awesome always wanted to play a sniper elite game never had the chance though as ive only ever been a 1 console person due to money so always went withnintendo so my kids could play stuff too loving that the switch is getting loads of great mature experiences too so now my kids are happy and so am i i played this on 360 one of my favorites it looks great on switch its a good game but i would not spend money on that one for those who lives in brazil that price is still a little sour it looks good and i never got to play it in the past so im pretty hyped for it it looks different and looks fun i dont think i ever played it ive always wanted to play this series looks way better than i thought it would look thinking about checking it out looks good hope there will be enough people for 4v4 multiplayer lobbies this would be my first shooter on the switch if i win too many games on switch is inpossible for me im excited for this game i do love how its a slower pace than other shooters great game to play on the switch its pretty cool i like that its not as rush in and shoot like other shooters having played this already a couple years back it will be fun to go through it again on the switch it is always good to buy these ports to let the developers know that we value the time they put in bringing these games over and that were interested reminds me of cod without the first person view it almost looks like syphon filter as well i think at the end of the day it will be a pretty solid entry to the switches library i played this at a friends house back when this came out on the ps3 ive thought about it on and off ever since and i love how every encounter feels like a puzzle i really hope to get this on the switch man handheld mode looks much better than i thought it would looks amazing really want to try it soon snipers are so fun in games really hope i win the copy been looking forward to this game another shooter i will like to enjoy on the switch it looks really interesting i do enjoy the craziness of those other shooters but i think timing and precision would be a really nice change its cooool im excited to pick this up after playing it years ago more excited for the online aspect i never played a sniper game but this one looks pretty good id love to add it to my switch collection yet to play it on former consoles look forward to it on the switch we need more shooters on switch oh yeah i love this game hey i really wanna get playing especially coop i really want to know as well is theres 4 player team deathmatches offline if you know thatd be great thanks never played this but it looks good the game seems very interesting and a great title for the switch seems to be a solid port and would love to be able to play it on the go keep sniping the game looks pretty good good job rebellion on the port i really like stealth games so this has my eye on it and the pace of the game looks like is very good for people that plays on handheld from time to time in the day i think it looks good tho u can tell its last gen it still looks really good and if u dont rennet me i was one of the callers on the first two or three calls on those questions kinda videos btw love your vids we still need alot of fps games for the switch does anyone know if they upcoming fps games the graphics look way better than i thought cant wait to get hands on good luck everyone game seems slightly difficult in a fun way though also with a laid back vibe while still keeping you involved in the gameplay the killshots are also a cool spin we have a lot of shooters on switch maybe about 6 i love stealth games and sniping and this game has both and i like that i never played sniper elite 2 i played the 3rd one though and the price is actually fair thank god i pass by this game back then and id really like to give it a go now looks cool never played it before and we need more shooters on the switch you can tell its last gen because of the brown shading that was a thing but i want to give it a try i never played it when it first came out but i cant wait to get some sniper shots in the game looks great i completely missed out on it initially but being on the switch gets me excited to jump in i love the slow motion shots and xray views i am very skeptical playing it with joy cons but i totally agree that this would be awesome in handheld paired with the pro controller looking forward to trying it out when it goes a little cheaper isnt sniper elite 4 a game why are we getting 2 the switch is the only console that they ship a 10 year old game and call it a new aaa title never played this game and always wanted to only have enough money this year to get 2 games so hopefully i can get lucky with a code so i can finally play it looks really good though and i love that its not a run and gun shooter and you actually have to use a lot of strategy to get through each checkpoint looks awesome this looks pretty decent i like the stealth aspect and the slow pace of the game no hectic fights through buildings the loading times are a great plus thanks for this short review love this game especially the slow mode efects no quick save looks good though hopefully ill win to experience this game for the first time looks cool never played it before really cool xray shots definitely going pick this one up been waiting to buy thos almost bought it on the wii u should be a good game hope i win i liked playing this game originally on the wii u but im not sure if ill want to buy it again though i might want to wait for the sequel it looks great we needed this type of game for sure yeah this game looks great its far more tactical than just run and gun im interested in this game because its strictly sniper focused not many games like this on the switch eshop honestly looks fun to play never played any game in the series before i can shoot hitler while sitting in the bus enough said i think this looks really nice especially after watching this video ive actually never played a game in this series and i think this looks like a perfect entrypoint in the series after viewing the review im definitively going to buy this asap loved it on the pc cant wait to try with the pro controller it looks like a good game might be something id like to play i love sniper elite 2 remastered and now its coming nintendo switch i played this game on the wii u when it first came out in 2012 and it was a game i always went back to the mix of stealthy silence and loud and proud shoot outs were a highlight for me i cant wait to pick this up and relive the memories all over again the graphics look better than expected and the gameplay looks buttery smooth great review guys it is definitely worth it in my view and for being at a 35 dollar price point plus all the dlc its a steal i like the gameplay es sow cool finished sniper elite 1 to 4 on steam and i think v2 is the best glad they brought the remastered on switch definitely will give this a go consider how much potential the switch has with any type of genre especially fps i would say that sniper would work out well on the switch the game looks good im always suprised what the switch can handle im glad games that look this good are making a good fit on switch sniper elite v3 is one of my favorite games ever and ive never played v2 i was actually just about to buy it the day that it went on sale but i didnt purchase it yet please pick my comment and i will love you forever pinky promise game looks like fun and graphics look pretty good i want to play it now d looks really good and its been quite some time since ive played a military game ive been thinking of picking this up but i have so many games to get through first yes quick load times i died a lot on this game back in the day will be checking this game on my switch funnily enough what you guys say about this game i feel the same with saints row on switch i love the gyro and graphics update the game still looks fun as ever it seems pretty good but ill need to get hands on with it to have a good opinion i think the game looks awesome i think the game looks amazing and i would love to play it cool game ill take one looks fun if i got the code id have a total of 3 games on switch d i think its look good and fun to play nice game i just want to show it to my father bc we used to play sniper elite in my ps2 and i want him to see how it plays on the switch prefer the zombie trilogy this game looks really cool game looks awsome would love to play it its gonna be a pick up for meadd to my switch collection looks awesome wish i had the money for it the story does seem pretty nice and also the price is fair the co op seems nice and the ability to kinda of choose your path sounds greatlooks nicer than expected but just waiting for assassins creed instead i have never played sniper elite v2 i heard that it was a great game after seeing the graphics comparison between dock and handheld mode and i gotta say for a stealth game i am willing to give this game a chance on the nintendo switch thanks switchforce for your honest opinions about sniper elite v2 remastered it looks a lot better than i was expecting it too and never played a sniper elite game before but looks like a lot of fun i really like the sniper elite series looking forward to another great switch title for on the go definitely will pick this up unless i win the code of course i hope they port sniper 4 for switch next i have seen some youtube es play this game and i wanted to play this game this new remastered looks really good and i think it would be a different experience for me since the only shooter i have on the switch is doom sounds like it should work well on switch definitely been wanting something slower less doom like but still a solid shooter and this sounds like exactly that plus ive been wanting more ww2 games in general great video zach and gabe game looks good hope i win the code i think this game is cool but im just tryna get a code because im broke it looks and runs way better than i thought it would and i cant wait to see what it looks like on handheld i can image playing this while im traveling that price point is great too looks so cool glad it has gyro controls now lets see if todays my lucky day good luck everyone always liked the game on other platforms with the xray shots and the difficulty i would love to give it another shot yes yes i know itll help my shifts fly by at work and quench my killing nazi fantasies i think it is a really original concept in a over saturated genre as someone who never got a chance to play it id love to play it on switch thanks for the video boys and the code giveaway opportunity it looks cool that sniper gameplay is niceeee graphics are amazing for switch peace out to my buddies at switch force i never played sniper elite but it really give me that itch for a tactical shooter that let me go loud or stealth that rewards you more and maybe both if i play my cards right this seams like a little fun for the switch the game looks like a lot of fun ive played and enjoyed various stealth games but ive never play a game in the sniper elite series so i dont know much about it but it seems like itd be a great time this game looks like fun kind of gives me some retro call of duty vibes while i think the textures are kind of rough in places presumably because its lastgen it looks like it runs really smoothly and still looks clean the slowmo on the sniper shots is definitely something that a sniper elite game has over retro cod ive been sort of pining for a great shooter on the switch the closest thing i have is la noire which in my opinion doesnt really count even though ive never played this it gives me nostalgia from all the classic shooters that were based on wwii stealth missions were always very satisfying in them too also coop sounds like a hoot i like that it combines the intensity of firstperson shooters when aiming down the sights with the kind of coverbased shooter thirdperson action of games like ghost recon uncharted and others thats my take to you the person reading this have a good day looks awesome cant wait to play it anywhere in handheld mode the game looks fun i skipped it the first time around so eventually im going to try this game out super pumped to get this game hopefully ill win d im surprised that the switch can run this game and thats awesome this is great the graphics are nice and smooth the gameplay looks fun and with the dlc i think this is worth 60 but its 40 so its a steal i was about to get the game but ill see if i win the giveaway and if not i will still guarantee get this game with my own money thanks for this epic review loved it on pc im sure ill love it on switch i played sniper 4 on xbox one it was fun i would love to play this on switch but i am a struggling kindergarten teacher help a guy out love this game and cant wait to play this game on the switch thanks for the upload guys i think this game looks great pretty nice looking visuals and ive been craving a shooter thats more slow paced and strategic as opposed to the run and gun style of doom or paladins on the switch please bring the zombie army trilogy to switch i think the gaame is awesome does look like its a great experience on the nx but id love to own this one played the sniper elite zombies version once loved it the game sounds exciting the stealth is the best part for me this looks right up my alley i love 3rd person shooters yeah i definitely wanna play this in handheld with gyro i really want to try out the slowpaced shooter game ive never really had one it looks really intriguing and i also enjoy playing in tabletop mode looks decent but price is a tad high my favorite game since ps3 sniping on the go sounds great to me i played this game like 2 years ago but never actually finished it its actually a really cool game making you think of every move you gonna make instead of shooting everything you come across it looks really cool on the switch too and an amazing game that everyone should play at least once i have never played these series please give me a copy im poor lol honestly ive been looking forward to this game ever since you guys mentioned it ive never played it but im loving it honestly this game looks great especially for the switch and doesnt pull a capcom on you looks good for switch it looks real fun and it looks real good on the switch i love zombie army trilogy for the slow mo shots and precise shooting having this in a game with required stealth would fix that mgs itch it looks great bruh sniper elite remastered is so good because of the gameplay and story it s looks great in handheld mode i think the game is great especially with the slow motion mechanics also its these types of games that will hopefully influence other third parties to invest in the switch lets put nintendo at the top please it looks pretty cool on the switch graphics are better than expected it looks awesome ive never played it before but id really like to this looks great i cant believe some of these games are running on such a small tablet i would love to get my hands on that giveaway code because im short on cash rn lol the game looks good on switch honestly this is a reaaally nice change of pace for shooters on switch i havnt finished the full video yet but i know this is a game is a good classic game added with motion controls and it being handheld yes also the framrate looks amazing and i would love to play this and i do hope i win this ittl be nice since i dont have many switch games and i realllllly want a mgs on switch and this right here is the best mgs type game alive on switch i doubt that i will win but might as well try ive always wanted to play this game series but never got the chance to but since its on the switch it makes me want to play it more now so even if i dont win im still getting it so wait its out looks great i would definitely get it if i wasnt too poor historic setting on handheldprimary draw to the game the game looks great keep up the making awesome videos i loved this game back on the 360 it looks very good on the switch love the review guys looks pretty good never played any sniper elite games but i may give this a shot ive not played this but everything ive seen of it so far looks pretty amazing what i like about the game is the fact that we as switch world are getting more and more hardcore games that are not in 8 or 16 bit those games are great but the switch can do more and should nice video keep up the good work its cooool i love the graphics they are great i love this series but sadly dont have enough money to add this to my switch collection after preordering mk11 and saints row the third game seems great would love to have it i think that this is a pretty good game and honestly i wish i had money to buy it lol but im going to try to get money to buy it but anyways it seems really nice and good graphics for the switch ive also never played it before on any sniper elite on any console and i have yet to play any shooter on the switch and i wanted to say congrats on growing your channel so much lol its so much bigger and it happens so fast i just wanted to say keep it up ive never played it and want to try so bad the game looks pretty good the game looks pretty cool the graphics look crazy for the switch and i really want to see how it turns out on hand held thanks looks great definitely would play it i think the game looks great i cannot wait i love how you guys review and how reliable your opinions have been so far hello my cherubs hey bsg any

that sound bo thats a freaken tiger sturmling uhhhhh im not qualified for this me boooooo you turned off the gore sturmling is so cute learnt something new while watching this video my dog thinks the audio of the distant artillery is real fireworks and is now shaking at the bottom of my bed test may have been conducted twice entertaining to watch and listen to you two play its the banter and content that is appealing good sniping btw bo im still trying to figure out how you see stuff in war thunder that the video doesnt even show until you range scope them gg theres so many bodies to loot sturmling 2019 sturmling looks so tough but his voice 1134 if you shot at the trucks fuel tank it will be a job well done instantly xd i think i would have been with sturmling looting too many rpg adventure games syndrome i certainly would have stolen any german sniper rifle and ammo for it just for the scope sturmling are they all alerted to us now offcourse because they are allvery alert now andawareas far as i have already seenmaybe they are all on acid and part of one of those voluntaryexperiments dont shoot a man in the balls its real bad for everyone evolved sighed adolf hitler im pretty sure sturmlings mission in life is to make bo flustered the circle is now complete once bo was the cowboy now he is the concerned disciplined one reigning in the cowboy the first german they encountered looked just like spock from the original star trek httpswwwgooglecomsearchqstar20trek20episode20where20spock20dressed20as20ss20officerieutf8oeutf8imgrc1cal9tr8agojpm you missed a sniper at 114 almost got that 100 kill ratio i uploaded a legendary shot on my channel stop by typycal us army soldier in 45 there is so many bodys to loot xd idiots confirmed aviation fuel usually 100ll is actually harder to detonate then say regular auto fuel like 89 octane botactical thinking and strategic awareness sturmlingamway rep with firepower together they will destroy your life and your bank account yes i grew up playing this game so happy to have seen a remaster vacuum sales were pitiful however boys gotta get those numbers up i wish cobey was there so he could endlessly rage at you for fucking around and that way ease my spirit d bo and sturmling please can we have more of this game you two are magical omg my ribs hurt from laughing thank you so much guys start to finish i was laughing 07 gents i hope you have a blessed week guys sturmling is the worst spec ops operator lol sturmling wartowar vacuum salesmannice 2 soldiers take down the whole german army with springfields and pistols in order to kill a guy with a weird mustach i bet u both played on easy hears that bo and sturmling had a new mission me to the allied commanders a fuk i cant believe you done this could you please play the isus in war thunder would love to see cobey and bismarck play this like old times lol great video regardless i used to place the charges then put the dynamite i had on me down along the street 1 shot took out every truck then i guessed hooty and the blowfish first go next episode the russian vodka deliver 29k attempt 3 love the map in this game this had a very strong red vs blue vibe to it i love these types of videos they never get old that mess needs more than a vacuum hilarious thanks guys sniper elite without cobey sadness intensifies bo give me a countdown sturmling now im glad sturmling isnt doing the ball drop in new york i do shoot him loved it well i for one would gladly watch more of your sniping shenanigans so thats one vote at least sturmling popping up in front of you while you were looking through the binocs was hilarious wait you have binoculars oh yea id like to see more of this so i am guessing helmets arent a thing i would not like to be inside sturmlings head it sounds like a very confusing place not sure the gift shop offers ears the bodies will have to do 013 liebling how this war drags on der fuhrer has gone quiet none of his daily ranting it gives me time to think of my life before the war as a carpet salesman and how i long to bite your strudel once again zee kapitan says the americans are close very close close enough to touch some days i believe him but today nothing now that is a high pressure sales technique i like how they fall back onto the ground instantly sniper elite got really good with the last game the open areas lets you actually be a stealthy sniper might as well make some side money while you play entrepreneur of the yearyou make me proud sturmling hello sir can i have directions to hitler love th vid would you say this game is worth buying for solo i know i sure as hell dont have friends with it lol your yelp review is going to suffer not a single vacuum sold bos way of interrogation wheres hitler sturmling vacuum salesmen i have played this level several times back in the day and i never figured that we could destroy the tiger with the other explosive package by the time the tiger arrived i had already used that to destroy some of the infantry sir may i have some more in which bo discovers a species of wehrmacht soldier that lacks peripheral vision sturmling doesnt comprehend the meaning of countdown and nobody finds directions to hitler im going to have to start playing this game again has sturmling become the new loot vacuum hes taking your job of loot vacuum bo i thought it said schoneberg cobey and clicked immediately oh well ill still watch why do i get the feeling bo is gonna run pvp with everyone using only the welrod again why does sturmling remind me of sheldon cooper in my head step1 bomb germany step2 go to germany step3 sell vacuums in recently bombed city step4 profit i like how theyre slowly figuring out the mission wasnt there a briefing sturmling is trying to sell vacuums for the syndicate exploding pants did they have mexican restaurants in germany at that time oh sturmling is a nut case that was great top notch security gj germans funny i was playing this a couple days ago for nostalgic reasons sturmling switched several times between beeing serious and a excited puppy and it was quiet funny d also welrod time with bo these bumbling fools were given sniper rifles god help us so sterling is a salesman who dorsnt know anything about sniping or war and bo is a pro sniper in comparison i mean hey you do you guys but uh bo ask the oss for a new partner if you can lol this brings back so many memories they really need to hire better people nonsense if they did we wouldnt get to see these hilarious shenanigans sturmling seems to be a handicap for gameplay you made my day a lot funnier thank you bo and sturmling 3 id have way too much fun playing coop games with sturmling i can already tell that much sturmling is adorable can we keep him ok so now we know how dysons became so popular it was sturmling offering them door to door during the war bo and sturling needed directions to hitler so they can sell him a vacuum cleaner there should have been a warning nobody should have to look at sturmling that close thru binocularslol i would love to see more of thus game lmao that was awesome sturmling was hilarious you 2 were great in this game get your sturmling vacuum today if you die from our door to door sells men we dont care thats a door to door sells man this was great love seeing more of this game from you other videos are hilarious will the russian with the furry hat please stand up 2 dudes just taken back the city stermling the looting vacuum cleaner salesman ahh just another day where is cobey did he drink to many beers and fell into mississippi i miss his anger and where is moe bo do you know the way to me san jose please do more of this if possible you two are hilarious hilarious as always needs more cobey rage and welrods awesome videothanks bo and sturmling you forgot to tag the enemies bo first you grab bismarcks stick and now you call sturmling beautiful you cant have both bo you need to choose one btw is sturmling a battle royale player he really loves looting bodies this game is hilarious with u two do more games like this like days of war i really wish there was a sniper game where you got to slaughter commies a tiger with red gas caps it must be one of those woodburning ones bo im sorry to tell you that there is no schoneberg in germany its schneberg or schoenberg if you dont want cant use but a great video as always so is this inglorious bastards but with more cluelessness and confusion sturmling just wants to literally clean up berlin cant blame him looks like it needs the help i want more i completely finished this game really love it omg look at how dirty these carpets imagine how good they would do with a good vacuum hell im ready with my credit card you have me sold sturmling operators are standing by you are funny as hell lol now i know why the germans lost the war i dont recall the bullets going that straight in this game why does he sound like sheldon from the big bang theory please do some old multiplayer pvp like the good ol days with cobey and bismarck this is to relevant me and my friend did this mission and all my friend did was carry the bodys alert everyone and die the germans are using aviation fuel for their trucks sturmling bo gets shot and doesnt know where it was then forgets about it after this bo sturmling you need to be more aware of your surroundings runs up to window you have binoculars yes bo is back in sniper elite and old games he used to record wooohoooo ooh so many bodies to loot this will be great for my necromancy later stealth is optional sturmlings taking the no man left behind policy a bit too far there bo you missed the opportunity to got for a double headshot you disappoint me great stuff brings back memories of some earlier vids you did on this game keep it up sturmling the oss doortodoor salesman i love it yes the dream team is back in action sturmling reminds me of jack churchill for some reason just going into battle with a vacuum instead of a longbow why murder hansel for no directions to hitler he is just a child you have binoculars imagine just smoking and patrolling and hear those two just talking shit bout fhrer was yo bo try out the otomagic for the new war thunder vid with the bois bo must finish the mission sturmling looks at a destroyed building this wall needs to be scrubbed still cant wait for that face reveal this fall looking forward to seeing the gang irl bo now thats how to raid a convoy you and the crew should play squad havent seen you play on stream thought you may like it 6th you guys would make a interesting sniper team in reality more first can i have directions to hitlerbo please do more of this if you can i love it this game is great especially if you take your time i spent 2 hours on one level trying to get through without alerting the enemies long sniper shots and traps hiding and relocating was so satisfying ill get way more than 7 hours out of single player no need to rush through harder difficulties take even longer any alert and you are in big trouble just completed recently 1010 game for me loved it if they released a zombie version of this as well on the switch itll be an instant buy for me pls also an assasssins creed 3 review gyro aiming for the win what about multiplayer good review better rating than nintendo life a poor 610 could u make a review on d latest ps vita games you got it done good job lacking a lot fo stealth i say that because thats what snipers do that is more or less the point of this game but you had fun and you finish it good on you youre shooting the nutzies in the nuts lol i would love to see team eurogamer play sniper elite zombie army trilogy 12019 ian im johnny and and the handsome disembodied voice you can here is johnny i can only assume the lack of nut shots is affecting ians mind 4451 no you are more of a xrated gamer and i think the nazi is all died before the bullet hits their nutsack so no nut shot for you maybe they were not nutsies sorry for ian the eurgamer motto awesome a exspance rpg johnny i want to see the game please sound awesome breeding bulbs bravo is it possible to turn the xray cam off cause thats the only explanation i can think of for how they only got one in the whole stream just thaught of a suggestion for late to the party ape escape on ps1 if you guys havent played it this was fun to watch even though you didnt balls it up d i probably shouldnt comment on ballistics with this game but if the rifle is zeroed at 100m or so you really ought to be able to just aim on target at anything less than 200m with 3006 303 or 8mm mauser maybe you didnt get any nut shots because on multiplayer all the bads are nazi mulans quote of the month tip of the dick then in the hips a useful phrase for many situations another victim of the sniper elite sponsor rampage nutsacks nutsacks everywhere but not a ballbag shot thanks for trying tho guys for some reason the remastered looks fucking ugly he got a new haircut in remastered one like the halflife 2 update the noticeable difference is the high quality sound effects the gunshots are more fleshed out best graphics comparison movie on yt it looks the fucking same lmao i dont think they know what remastered means whoever paid for this is on crack this remaster is a joke i prefer the old one and here i was actually thinking they would do a proper remaster perhaps even with the se4 engine and instead we got this malarkey its a quick cash grab i guess mainly focusing on the console market since they ported it to ps4 etc but what a disappointment because se v2 had the best missions and with the se4 engine and mechanics it couldve been a fantastic game im not spending a penny on this piece of aaaaand this is why they pirate pffft its like 5 better if that my opinion not worth the upgrade note im on pc and own the original version the context of my comment is the x required to upgrade in more detail 1 lighting has indeed changed and made more dynamic does it make it better to me not really as the effect on a pc is actually quite minimal in fact it lightens the darker corners eliminating some of the shadows which always felt nice it makes the game shinier but also less gritty the single plus for me is that it does make things appear sharper and clearer in the night missions but ultimately the change is not particularly substantial 2 textures in some cases the difference is so minimal as to be completely pointless the ground is occasionally enriched with more vegetation and or debris minor touching up here and there is present is this a crucial element that improves the game and justifies an owner of the nonremaster to pay 7 bucks not to me 3 textures ii some things are improved more drastical oh so its an assassins creed 3 style remaster awesome they did change the game to be 64 bit only but the rest you cant call it a remaster may be a ps3 version compare to ps4 would be more noticeable difference but in pc it just like scamming money wast of money i think the original looks better xd what the fuck originalremaster ha you guys got scammed they wont even give it for free to those that bought the original version so sad this game needed no remastering this is a quick cash grab while riding the ww2 hype train trendy woke shit kill the nazi dur hur i owned the original on pc and bought the remaster for 1450 aud 1month ago after seeing a bunch of comparison videos i decided to refund the purchase even though its been longer than 2 weeks and valve consented very happy i saved 1450 on this underwhelming remaster literally nothing changed i know what they have changed that fucking markerfirst time i played i didnt notice itknow i cant stop looking at itits like its blinking at me trying to get my attention im fucked off with that marker original is the best version it didnt need a remaster we need game mechanic from se4 apply to sev2 they wasted their time remastering this his hair looks better in the original lol even i can remaster that much remastered rifle design improved xray improved some light little fog fire improved some kubelwagen has been improved 530 have effect wind on bulllet 556 removed this was the first game i ever played when i was 5 my dad would play the challange mode an little 5yr old me would get to blow up the final thank to win the math good memeries im now 12 haha lol people getting scammed the most useless remaster of the century gotta love these modern day remasters where they just put so much effort in they completely overhaul the graphics and totally didnt just rush it out love it so much i though they gonna give it se4 gameplay this just disappointing this is another lazy remaster just to get a quick buck i wish they remastered the first game since i thought it doesnt even work on steam anymore this remaster mainly whas done because of console because the original console version looked horrible maybe you should have noted it in the video or just did a console comparison because now all the people are triggerd honestly i prefer the original remastered here i am original am i a joke to you the remastered looks worse can i have my money back rebellion i cant help but feel as if this supposed remaster was originally only planned for the consoles and that the pc was just an after thought besides sniper elite v2 was originally released on the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 both consoles ran the game at 720p30 fps if im not mistaken although correct me if im wrong the pc version already ran the best and looked the best with customizable graphics options for up to 4k and over 60 fps if your pc could handle it with that being said theres gonna be a noticeable improvement in visual fidelity on the ps4 and xbox one against their 7th gen counterparts still even for 10 this feels like a scam for pc players and a slap in the face in reality the only thing that has changed significantly are the gun sounds and maybe the lighting in some ways if sniper elite v2 had mod tools this couldve been easily done by modders for free not for 10 or the absurdly high price of 35 if you dont own the original game im diss good thing i refunded this im a big fan of sniper elite series so better lighting remodeled guns better shadows and a new haircut seems rather lazy thats the remaster we need in 2k19 looks like rebellion has nothing to do no new projects but they need money you just take something ready and change a bit wow now they can sell a game again useless remaster lost development time what is the difference its the same game it should be a free patch people commenting no changes at all i think our character got a bit more bald the originals got more hair the remaster looks like he got his hair cut after 1 week guns sound better to me cant say how i feel about the looks is it just me or is there better textures in the original for some parts so is more like fov was 50 now 100 blurring and now sharp to pc version ok with the hair change it looks like either he has a massive injury resulting in a big scar with stitch marks or it looks like a tire has skidded around his head other changes could be done with sweetfx like the more red coloured fire shadows seem improved a bit more but nothing really to justify to buy it again even if its cheaper if you own the original what in gods fuck has changed in this remaster sniper elite series is boring they are only fun for 10 minutes i love this i plan to get it on pc huhi kinda feel like the original one is better maybe ill just stick with that one it looks like they didnt change anything cant wait for infinite warfare remastered modern warfare remastered is the best remaster ive ever seen for any old gen game it just looks worse shawdows are awful 100 more bricks ign 1010 is this a parody or a joke video im legit serious i have a feeling it is added tree there its remastered now besides graphics is this game worth getting as in is the gameplay good enough and is this game worth the money you could tell from a livestream rebellion did the other day that theres differences between the original and the remaster theres a new rewritten lighting system here and they redone models and the sky so the game looks good on a 4k screen you can see theres more rubble in areas of the game as well its definitely a standard remaster instead a overhaul remaster still looks good though did u buy this in steam i dont understand these remasters of already very modern and good looking games and the people asking for them i removed my pre order after seeing this calling it a remaster is an insult this is the first time ive never seen a difference between an original remastered game the only difference i really saw was the change in the characters hair which is barely even noticeable this remaster right here is literally a cash grab this is useles than dark souls remastered i thinkwhat remaster is betterafter the middle of the video it is noticeablebut sniper elite v2 does not need a remasterlike ac3cause thate game looks normal original winfatality improving the textures of the taillights on a kubelwagen is not a fucking remaster why didnt they add the details of se 4 into this eyes guts shrapnel and the rest lame original is better tbh damm this remaster makes halo 2 anniversary look like nothing has changed who thinks original is better than remastered original effect remastered texture and addition of objects around textures are mostly the same the main differences are in lighting shadows and modelsgeometry fire and explosions also changed notably sun glare only one word to say about the difference between original and remastered just take any game republish it with a remastered at the end and thats how you win easy money thats what theyve done what the difference oh yeah there is none they should have remastered it with the sniper elite 4 engine that would have been awesome wasted money to people that bought it nothing changed best remaster of all time 1010 wtf they want 10 for just a minor bit of upgrade the only gay part is that you cant be a neon nazi sniper big difference but some colours of the original is good wtf why remastered texture look like shit the original look so good that it doesnt need a remastered this is really underwhelming like the shadows and lighting did get a slight touch up but this is the kind of stuff youd see on a free upgrade its not expensive but i cant believe you have to pay extra for this on pc when you own the original version this is a joke just brightness 115 i literally cant see any difference at all except being much lighter wtf original has more detail 415 i heard hitler ranting fegelein no noticable difference i have the og its so cool i dont even think it needed a remaster i think original is better his hair changed owo new hair so dumb jesus why they do that nicely laid ambush you can play sniper elite 3 on nintendo switch lite im thinking of buying a nintendo switch light can i get some recommendations for other fpswar games thanks in advance is their voice chat for co op open world games should all have a option with a yellow dot telling you where to go damn this game looks good where can i buy this joy con can u pls do a review for thief simulator i wanna buy a

playing online now they need to add nazi zombie army no unboxing is it rental from gamefly again yo marc adjust and adapt to motion controls a game like this need all the precision you can get im playing it right now good game indeed seeing this type of game on switch is so cool i remember sniper elite 4 having huge maps so im curious if they will bring it over as well as 3 comes out soon if i were born again id want more patience if i had more patience id want this game but it looks cool 835 did that bomb just bleed sniper elite has testicle shots vegeta plays sniper elite instant click wait was the target called dr gunther kreidel 0839 please fit that in dbza 0707 vegeta clearly went to medical school renafact 6 snipers are bitched boom right through the chest and he blows up the voice sounds a lot like eddie izzard im dying lol im amazed that the prince of all saiyans could play a game that requires stealth xd to a geologist you know who else loved rocks the nazis nazis love rocks geologist love rocks therefore all geologist are nazis guys we need vegeta to do a full play through of doom 2016 or doom eternal domo arigato what an excellent like to go out on you see player37338 im not your average sniper anymore i have risen up and become the legend the legend that you fear i am a super snipe gets sniped by freezer666 you guys dont understand he had to kill dr gunther kreidl slowly getting out getting shot at by a tank were fine were fine were fine its fine huh weird i would have thought vegeta wouldve been a pro at this being an elite warrior an all victory for vegeta alucard wow you are the worst nazi killer your play ruined my top three favourite things to kill that i have killed before vegeta shut the fxxk up you vampiric duch bag ive commited genocide in global scale alucard well apparently there werent any space nazis lol vegeta why you fxxk sucking alucard oh my how did you know i like sucking fxxk vegeta doesnt really do stealth so good i havent watched shit like this since i was 5 vegeta plays the darkness 1 2 he would have a blast playing this play the wolf among us dont feel bad i had the same problem with the sniper on the roof lol make vegeta and nappa play xenoverse 2 play the walking dead vegeta is totaly the best sniper ever 704706 it was his lung stupid thanos always go for the head and ill just sit here and recover like fucking wolverine got senzu juice in my veins amazing vid as always aahh uuuhthats a lot of nazis between i and drgunthler kaider xd danke arigato perfect line to finish on xd 032 victory for vegeta doctor who the farmer made it look easy when he dies he makes the plag sound or the sound he made when cell guy punched him oooh the classics with a better impression this would have been super good did anyone else notice the second explosive literally bled despite being explosives stop it be deadlmao anyone thinks that this is head canon to vegetas free time after the cell saga who the hell does this voice it is freaking awesome is it holloween yet mannnn i need new krillin content i can only watch outlast and every other game so many times before i can play it out in my head wait why did the c4 bleed when vegeta shot it to blow up the tank 858 so kind of like vegeta against pretty much any main villain poor germans must be so confused they expected to fight a saiyan elite a prince but after his performance they thought they where facing radditz bottom line its a good thing that the allies werent saiyans or ww2 would have ended otherwise i wonder how this game would be if alucard played it party party party god dammit stupid nazis wisdom to be passed on for the ages i love how renegade for life is literally improv but with video games and with vegeta if vegetas farts do that much damage dont let him eat taco bell veeegeeetaaa play the darksiders games i wanna see the prince of all saiyans play as a horseman of the apocalypse make it happen d sorry i just realized that the cooler 2 movie dub made a food fight refrence did that c4 package used to blow up the tank bleed when shot can i ask if tfs is gonna do the bojack movie before we do the whole buu saga what an annoying voice 90 seconds in and i cant stand it im outa here 014 move quietly or ya gonna get ur ass kicked dr gunther kreidl wishes to see u now vegeta xd vegetas farts can glass a planet yet cracking a egg will forever elude him vegeta should play never dead kaiser again or whomever it is that edits these i know kaiser has edited some of them you fucking killed it like how geats killed dr gunter kreidl 10 shooting nazis 90 doctor gunther kreidl bourbonburgergate is going to be a name i use in a dd oneshot or an npc if you had aimed for the balls you could have gotten a special cringy nutshot why is the repetition of dr gunther kreidl so goddamned funny xd 835 did vegeta put a baby in the explosive bag because it bled that bag just bled lol at 834 just had to be a little shutup about it is my favorite new idiom pretty sure that kreidel is pronounced kreedel but whatevs i actually enjoyed this one p lol i miss this old humor not that i dont enjoy vegetas videos but where the hell is the krillmaster we all want full play throughs of vegeta screaming and playing we know im holding there is more of this xd vegeta needs to react to the nut shot why did i explode because someone planted a land mine on your okay obviously youre not a corpse now its over 9000 jeets is life but i still dont know if he got the thing from dr gunter kridel thats something they dont tell you on the history channel when theyre trying to tell you about pawn shops omg i cant believe how true that is id imagine vegeta doing this for a hetap fuck your face 123 after shot gets pistoled an even further distance then sniped and almost immediately lol not a single testicle show i am disappoint huhi never considered sensu bean juice does it have the same healing effects in juice form and could you add this to make it taste better is a sensu bean shake viable sniper saiyan elite just like those guys freeza murdered in the opening of super broly i want a bourbon burger gate why would the prince of all saiyan ever need to sneak attack his enemy dont you relish the fear in your enemies eyes as they know their doom is quickly approaching goku wouldnt sneak attack his enemies imagine if alucard played this your kidneys are now smooshed vegeta youve really lost your edge smooshed are you a disney character wait what was the doctors name i didnt quite catch it surprised vegeta even entertained the idea of not going corp a corps with someone i like to think a major part of lani enjoyed playing this game im surprised that vegeta didnt make a comment about the second satchel charge bleeding when he shot it to blow the tank up 836 so the game is that hard 240 dont turn around oh oh oh ja ja der prinz is gonna clean out this town woah oh oh flailing angrily my my my vegeta doesnt that sound like someone id awfully knowperhaps you freezer voice 835 can we just talk about the bleeding satchel charge for one minute please the legendary sniper sayain he should voice vegeta in an official dub i had hoped when i talked about the history channel to make a comment like talking about aliens ha they arent even real can we for at least a minute praise the prince of all sayains for pronouncing the ei correctly lets let the slide wait what was the doctors name again i like these r4l not only for the content but it also sets up and explains what vegeta does before the buu saga instead of trainning oh thats a lotta nazis hmmm how to motivate king vegeta just pretend all the blondehaired blueeyed germans are related to the android that broke both your arms sniper elites a really good series its not for adhdhappy ritalin junkies though gotta take your sweet time with it the kill cams make it even better just dont constantly underestimate the bullet drop like i do so many soldiers with 1 testicle i swear its not intentional headshots are better victory for vegeta i literally posted a sniper video the other day i freaking adore sniper elite when killing nazis a lot of nazis is never enough nazis 837 why did the satchel charge bleed d o c t o r g u n t h e r k r i d e l 836 did the explosive bleed vegeta its going somewhere somewhere you wont like it was your meat so you hit him then how can you play sniper elite and not show a montage of killing dudes with only nutshots disappointed vegeta is the main reason why i watch this channel and i am never disappointed whoa they remastered it i love the original so much fun to play games with proper bullet drop doctor how many gunthers can you kreidl he didnt shoot anyone in the dick why didnt he shoot anyone in the dick loved the video and was just hoping id see a shot in the balls and vegeta would say shot in the dick i love the whole series of these please keep them up no nut shots im disappointed that right youre not dealing with the average sniper anymore i vegeta have finally become the legendary super sniper meat that was a lung a small request can vegeta play a mysterydetective game it would be hilarious to see that will the prince continue to play oh golly i hope tanks for the memories really really killing nazis like all good folk do videogames teaching us the morals modern america needs to learn nazis bad danke arigato brilliant dr gunter kreidal wants to know your location oh wait hes dead with smushed kidney syndrome tfs plays never fails to make a funny video what level of difficulty was vegeta playing on kind of looks like normal difficulty i feel like alucard should have made a cameo lets go have bourbon burgers by the gate time to punch somebody else in th dick only with all the bullets ahaahahahahahaaa totally missed the opportunity to shooting someone in the nuts with the sniper rifle im suprised he never tried to shot one in the dick why why doent he keep shooting in the dick so vegeta watches the history channel i hope to god at some point during dbza they can work in a victory for vegeta when u want 2 play call of duty but u start sniper elite instead i love these thank you you should do a full lets play of some old school games like kotor star wars knights of the old republic both 1 and 2 i can otally see you going full dark side on both of them hehe vegeta prince of all sith that was awesome fucking danke arigato i cant i cant fucking breath vegeta who needs dakka when i can just use my ki krillin what about your final flash incident vegeta who let you in my house krillin i think you mean bulmas house the editor here had a lot of fun with dr gunter kreidils name closing it with some german japanese was perfect feind da drben enemy over there i love the fact that our majestic prince of all sayins is screeming while he is playing a sniper danke drinking game take a shot every time he says dr gunter kreidil im beyond disappointed not a single dick shot sup proceeds to pump target full of lead got him that got me plays sniper elite storms through it like its cod as expected of the prince of all saiyans awesome please play world seeker vegeta plays an allvegeta team in fighterz when is krillin going to play layers of fear 2 foolish saiyan warrior vegeta playing video games when you should be training for majin buu can we have vegeta playing mass effect and actually be renegade just for a lil thats all i ask i wanna see him play god of war to the end yelling at the boy in what he did was hilarious 837 did that bagbleed when it was shot tanks do not stand a chance tanks for the memories bitch your kidneys are now smshed using a sniper and no 360 no scope i see new renegade for life i click so glad they keep making these videos d im vegeta the true saiyan sniper here we see the time vegeta helped in the war against millenium how is goku stronger than vegeta with them snipes vegeta should play more hitman oh come on i fight and do more damage vegeta 2019 please can someone tell me if you can remap keybindings how can anyone choose this game over sniper elite 4 as the best game no one enjoyed the italian setting at all lol basically the only thing you know about this game is out way too goes on sale since its a remake i dont think is worth 60 is best just to wait for this game to go on sale everyone cant be a sniper guys i want to know something the sniper elite games have a story high def dickshots ign 1010 i prefer separate guides because some players ive searched for when it comes to collectibles squeeze everything into one giant video and dont have time stamps for each level or collectible so if i lose my place in the video i have to start scrolling through it to find where i left off which is a nightmare hey thanks for stopping by this series will be 11 videos long and will be fully uploaded by may 14 we will then move on to a plague tale innocence and rage 2 afterwards d for the full playlist go here httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplbmi6vatfdfmmup7jlkuspxhc1zhcfhs thanks for the support everyone 3 i just bought this game on steam and its so much fun to play thank you for this game 3 really disappointed in this remaster the controls are absolute crap it seems that nothing was actually remastered other that the upgrade in graphics it plays very clunky and sluggish i picked it up on a discount for christmas but i have already deleted it as it was making me insane i am a big supporter of the sniper elite games and was excited to play this one againvery disapointeddont waste your money i just might just have well crumpled up a 20 and burned it who needs an old game in a new shell where sniper elite 5555555 im glad because support japanese i wanna play this game right now when can we expect a patch for the nintendo switch version the game has a few issues which need fixing like rending and frame rate drops when there are a lot of people on screen this is the best sniper elite by far especially for online competitive play i hope they still keep the settings the same so no compensation assist when aiming hopefully more people will play this now thsts the only reason i dont is due to no one plays it why on earth would you change the button config for the remastered version analogy if you where selling a car for 6 years that was succesful in sales and someone came back to buy another one and found that the light horn and turn signal switches where in an awkward place why why would you change a good thing and make it worse so is the sniper elite 2 love it a classic remastered d great trailer cant wait so if you change your singleplayer skin to a german soilder skin does that mean german ai wont fire at you or wishful thinking this is the best game of sniper elite saga i hope controls scheme is more like that of se 4 does the switch version look good the remake would be better than remaster these bullet shots looks bad in 2019 and i think v2 is too bad for remaster counting the hours until i can pick it up and go lay it man the new sounds are great for the rifles i hope that song rifle be the same like sniper elite v2 ps3 waiting on my steam acc for activate just now with se v2 iii iv of course wel on steam it say that the game wil launch on the 15th of may i guess that this is a writing mistake cool now i wanna see a remaster of zombie army trilogy please bought it just counting the hours to have it and play it i hope you are all well here is the sniper elite review i promised you i will now be away for the rest of the week having to work and its not for gaming so i will be back at the weekend in the meantime i will leave you in the capable hands of james jordan hope you enjoy this review and of course let me know your thoughts if you want just gameplay then there is a video here httpsyoutubev5aigxgxsty have a great week everyone the game looks great but i am really disgusted about this constant pro us anti russia propaganda its especially disgusting in a ww2 game because the red army lost way more troops than the allies to defeat the nazis i am not russian by the way i am just tired to always see the same crap in countless games why there is not only 1 game where we can shoot us soldiers in the solo campaign not even one game like this exist talk about north korea style propaganda one of the few youtubers who dont talk too slow that i have to change the video speed to 125x im getting the feeling they really taking the wii u out of existence almost every game i own on wii u is on the switch cool review juan like always almost didnt recognize u there without ur hat i did get the switch version i do like it the problem i have is im in the third area and maybe 15 like only one showed the slow motion xray kill shouldnt you see those more frequently nice one man ive been loving the online mode need to get some coop action on the go mark great channel respect your opinions i imagine performance mode would be hamstrung by the cpu 100080p it amazing the switch can run at that resolution damn juan growing that viking beard back great review btw so sure it released on all systems same time which is nice but the true treasure taken away this time is that the price is the same as ps store for the moment atleast at 3149 its a few bucks off on switch atm so that wont be forever but no 20 switch tax like ff hd remaster i am happy to see that something about this game seems interesting i knew the series existed but never played one b4 might give it a try come pay day but for now va11halla hmmmm some portable sniping im still in the fringe thanks for the review played this on wii u i hated how enemies always know where u r well im definitely getting 3 when it comes out as great as v2 was in its day and still is the true reason anyone is buying this on switch is for its competitive multiplayer excellent review looking slick there mate downloading as we speak cant wait to play it great review love hearing your perspective always a pleasure oh yeah congrats guys on finally getting more subs if any switch channel deserves them its you to this day you guys put out more switch reviews than any other i know of and in fact youre the only strictly switch channel i still follow been subbed i believe since you were around 600 so ive seen the evolution hell ive even grown to like jordan lol great vid see ya already preordered on eshop love these games never finished this one dont really have a favorite 3 is highly underrated but i do recognize more refinement to the game mechanics with each iteration i think 2 was hardest unfortunately i didnt see anything about physical until after i paid for it on eshop juan juan the nazi killing man thanks mate please keep up the great work nut shoots here we come lol nice one juan definitely picking this up buddy now this is how you do a sniper elite review properly never played it but might give it a go switchwatch hey i have a question i cannot find an answer to i was wondering if you could help me with it in elite sniper v2 remastered do offline just on the couch with buddies team deathmatches require 2 switches and 2 copies of the game thanks so much 540 i was afraid of that and it is why i dont believe in stealth in a videogame in any shooter i play where you can go in guns a blazin but are also rewarded if you can take down the enmy stealthily one headshot is always all it takes for all the rest of the enemies to suddenly magically know precisely where i am hiding its not like they just become alert or cautious no they know my exact position and then swarm me till either one of us die i love being stealthy in games as sneaking by unseen killing enemies quickly and then disappearing again gives me some kind of adrenaline rush but because of the above i hardly ever bother unless you are metal gear solid stealth in videogames is a myth im hype for this one i honestly dont know how dual stick aiming is more accurate for you i feel like ive said this so many times in the last few months and now this month but it looks like im getting this truth be told i already had it preorder but i had to act surprised so the wife didnt catch on definitely buying this on release day such a pleasant surprise that this game has actually came out on the switch i remember having fun with this game years ago is this the game ive been waiting for do you know what the definition of insanity is space stealth kill better than assasins creed 3 remastered im sorry i dont get it but whys he killing russians the worst player ever on sniper elite none thru the scope dissapointing i just want to play as the nazis for chrissakes i mean fuck the allies seriously fuck the allies europe is a shit hole because of them and america is right behind them lmfao that was just perfect that bomb didnt do anything too them and that rifle shot xd does this game have a first person view this guy is so bad lol but also funny guy does the remastered have all dlc weapons 800k subs 10k views was this channel sold or something when you want to do it woth style but keeps dying in the same checkpoint with no stealth kill xd it doesnt look any different it doesnt even have the updated bullet cam doom man whats up buddy fucking lulz we need a freaking nut shot after watching this i want to get 2 types of snipers and a normal rifle have youtube changed the whole subscriber doesnt see subbed channels or something this is the first video ive seen in my sub box in like 1 or 2 years didnt even know i was subbed to doom i have never seen anyone fail this hard at this gamejesus christ remaster my ass the only thing that changed is the bullet d played the original version of this and i played three i have four and havent beaten it these games are insane a bit high volume towards the end cant really hear what you are saying p pro player right here mlg content at its best third first and all ze vinehoonz watching holding a panzerfest to quote gen vahlen the man who dueled a tiger in kasserine i guess its not a one time thing do more of this game more potato mashers that was one

h1 you are calling it a panzer i tryed it in demo but its bad i think most of the snipers have sv 402 i think or something like that more please i know how to use a stick grenadetheres a cap at the bottom and a ball string in side you pull and throw the bomb how come in the trench warfare game he says bad words best shots are testicle shots which can be donein reality in virtually whatever is out there look really nice isnt me uhhok carries out springonion wallmt1 and johnson powder rifle can u actully speak german sniper elite v2 try shot at the head that gross you can see it what happen i love this game its by far my favorite game please play more 201 thats a referenc to saving private ryan as a german that is 100 what germans sound like make a sniper elite gameplay baron please sniper rifle was the dangerous rifle do another baron is the master of double dose can you turn off the xray in this game you made three videos today like do you not take a look outside more more wait

kubelwagen not kugelwagen oh so this video is sponsored by the rebel alliance wtf baron its a tank not a tiger lol that was a good gamewish it was longer please play more sniper elite v2 one problem

the players look like a dlc pack from minecraft virtual pool 4 has the absolute best snooker and 9 ball 8 ball on the planetscrew your tracking lines this was advertised as the most realistic snooker sim ever from looking at this its the worst ever everything about it is bloody shocking using a rest with the cue ball 3 inches from the cushion the graphics suck as much as the game play and who the hell is commentating so glad i checked this out before wasting my money buying it hes playing the safety shot here eyeing up a shot down the rail roflmfao who on earth developed this graphics from 2005 physics engine is the most unrealistic ive seen in any pool game controls look messy who pays 35 for this shit so virtual pool 4 is still the best simulator by far you are wack broo pc graphics are waaay better absolute shit we definitely need some serious tennis and snooker games for ps already noticed right of the bat something really wrong that takes you right out of the immersion that sometimes you cant even here the balls hit each other you hear him hit the cue ball or the ball go in the pocket but you dont hear the balls hit each other sorry but that is a big crapper why is selby using the rest for every shot hahaha what is this game you get better free apps on your phone graphics look like from 2002 graet frame bro keep it up this game is so retarder why dafuq would you use the rest from every positioni have the gameits kinda retarded and slow small table and big balls you cant get anything past the other balls on a real table is there is loads of room nothing goes jimmy whites snooker kills this game and when a shot is played the ball goes off camera a lot because its zoomed in 90 mins online play time is way to longshould be about 30mins40 mins on tournaments mode is finestill need to sort the sound out when the ball hits the pocket too like to see create a player and like to see sponsor on waistcoat and if you do crap you lose that sponsor and how many seasons do you get to play graphics are just bad especially player models and animation also look at selbys crotch lol physics seem to be off unrealistic accelerationdeceleration it just looks wrong shot selection of the opponent is very weird as well very disappointing imo the idear of a gd snooker game makes u wnt it a got it so hard win 1 game so far coz had gd snooker n guy foul shoot 3 times game be much better if easyer not a snooker player but like it this game makes me h8 the sport so hard even when pick easy on medium i beat selby with ross muir ive only lost 4 in 14 so far and up to 104 in the world highest break of 124 awesome video you should be a pro commentator this is the kind of game my brother and i would be playing for 10 minutes then leave the xbox on all afternoon whilst were arguing or doing other fun shit yes m8 go for it how the graphics are so crap is beyond me its not like theres alot of detail to render hey bobbyg nice video we are going to have a great 2019 for snooker fans as snooker 19 with the real world license and then soon this is snooker will be released i hope you review that one because it looks stunning and the beta of this is pool revealed how good the engine and physics are i think both games will suit different audiences do you need to shout retarded fuck whoever spent anytime developing this game needs to be shot what a disaster on all fronts looks less detailed than the old 360 version in the means of stats character creation graphics looks so sub par 15 how is it that the snooker gameplay and graphics on pure pool is 10 x better than this rubbish i feel robbed i appreciate what theyve tried to do here but for 2019 standards the graphics are pretty poor not gona lie looks like ps2 oooh and thats a bad miss is this a new game 1036 needed top spin off 2 cushions from that angle for that shot not screw can anyone explain to me why its not possible to save an offline non career mode game what is the point of giving the option of a best of 35 frames match if you cant save it is there anyone out there with the time to play 35 straight frames its utterly ludicrousinconceivable that a save function hasnt been included the inability of english people to attempt to correctly pronounce even the most basic of vaguely foreign words is always astounding 1240 channels inner john virgo wheres the cue ball going virtual pool 4 runs laps around this stupid game fifa 19 ui exist snooker 19 makers its free real estate i enjoyed the video but im seriously unimpressed with the look and ai of this game from what ive seen so far will not be buying 043 who just watching to see if its as boring as i imagine ps2 graphics i dont care about the lackluster graphics at all my main problem is with the ai in what world would selby repeatedly roll the cue ball into the reds as a safety shot and in what world would selby mess a positional shot 913 up this badly the last wsc game i played was 2005 and this honestly looks like a downgrade the snooker on pure pool is so so much better than this and runs faster than this and its only a tenner epic fail murphy won it in 2005 you are playing with the cheating lines i see graeme dot is from my home town and jonh higgins wizard of wishaw used to practise with my dad not being able to play yourself in career mode thats a no from me then why would i want to play to improve someone elses career whats the point of that that is issue takes this game from day one buy to never buy for me how do you add backspin on this game i dont know why i found this so funny nailed it ohhes missed it hope this becomes a long term series brilliant i dont watch snooker but for some weird reason this is so fun to watch were in 2019 and the player models are stiff i dont know why im here your commentary makes it so much more enjoyable to watch this is the definition of niche but i love it the fact you kept me entertained watched someone playing a friggin snooker video game is commendable fire up your down under plz tell me the power on the shot is determined by how fast you flick one of the analogue sticks up if it isnt what an absolute piece of trash with no feel of the game they should of put paul hunter in the game this game is no way new looks like a commodore game it makes me uncomfortable that ur speaking from 3rd person about yourself thats not bad bobby g can you not over head view when lining up a shot ill just stick to 8 ball thanks small detail like having no ref in the game annoys me but looks like a good game to purchase youre so funny and enthusiastic i dont even like snooker but youre entertaining httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvd5ei28m3r38 just watch it lichtenberg what the fuck is that intro why almost every other sports game on ps4 have basically the same menu as ea sports fifa tho wow looks like every other snooker game going back to 1996 really moved on didnt realise they still released ps2 games 2005 wsc final was murphystevens i think you mean 2004 the fact you cant create your own player kind of ruins the full thing for me glad the ais been fixed but online play will be a big problem because the shot clock simply isnt long enough for most shots its fine but sometimes you need time to think about the right shot and 30 seconds is nowhere near enough yess been waiting for a good snooker game nice stuff my man i am going to be doing the same on my channel but i have chosen the longer matches to give it a bit more spice and i also chose someone who i am gonna refer to as dipst face lol mega disappointed in the graphics this channel is going to blow up i dont know anything about snooker and i have never watched it but you made this very entertaining annoying commntery oh my god who taught you how to speak this looks truly awful does this game come with loot boxes kaspersky how to massacre the pronunciation of a name think this dude needs to take some snooker history lessons he thinks ronnie won the world championship in 2005 haha pretty sure shaun murphy did but thats none of my business is there any proper commentary on the game virgo and taylor yes yes been waiting for a snooker game to come out on playstation 4 whos the developer the menu interface looks kinda like fifa is it an ea game gonna buy this the commentary was class on this haha its pronounced kasperskee so you are watching wrestling 1140 dudethat all in reference is awesome got this game on xbox onetheres a 2 second delay on cue deliverythought it was just mebut watched other gameplay on xbox one and its the samesound seems to be spot on ps4they really need to sort this outreally off puttingball goes in the pocket then you hear the cue delivery can you upgrade your pro or how will you get better very irritating youre spoiling the snooker section of youtube with your videos a couple of ones is alright but not hundreds of them and they show up when searching for the last snooker games whereas normally there isnt any problem and just because you want to market your game and having hundreds accounts or even more to like yourself or asking fake questions about the game so annoying go on steve davis ii please look up the pronunciation of lichtenberg you say it so awfully when your mate is in this game d the first 2 shots by the ai in this are shots that you would never see them play in reality this game looked broken from the start of development and no amount of licencing will get me to buy it shocking good vid great gamebut online doesnt work at tge moment for me apparently theres an issue please help on this the gameplay is so difficult it killed my intrest in 30 mins im streaming live right now snooker 19 come and hang out httpswwwtwitchtvflxswitchdashboardlive can you play with greats like jimmy white stephen hendry for example can you play against your friends online youre pronouncing his name wrong this is on amateur airming aid look forward to this series terrible positional play and making life very difficult for yourself with those pots lol youll come good mr lichburg looks like a rite pile of shite poor graphics poor avatars and an annoying flashing white screen in between every shot the ai now plays proper safety shots steam pc version it got released at v105 and so i think once the console versions are patched to v105 the ai safety play will patched in to be fixed then are the ai positional play no backspin applied around the black and pink spots always trying the unrealistic heavy sidespin to make the white ball move in line with the next target object ball and also the annoying choice of playing a yellow and green long shot and ignoring the obvious nearby black pink or blue so anyway to updateai safety shots are fixed anyone know how to pot a ball along the cushion aiming the white onto the contact red ball doesnt work like you would in real life no idea how to pot do you not use the right analog stick to control cue power looks a bit dated can u play your friends online cant see an option for it 2005 world final was not ronnie osullivan not sure what year you were there lol absolutely love your content mate keep it up until they fix the dreadful ai safety never playing back to baulk career modes pretty much unplayable as a serious simulation plus does the ai ever pot balls at anything other than dead weight dont really think that mark selby would miss so much but that might be to give you a chance i literally just bought this game after watching your video i love a good snooker game havent had one for a while only got to wait a few hours for the download it better be good bobby its all on you please keep this going this is a great looking game and love the stories mate loved this and hope you give it a good go as a series am excited for this i missed you bobby g let me know what you think of the brand new series and if you want to see some more snooker 19 action its been a long time since we did something other than football manager and that will continue as normal you sound like one of the guys from did you know gaming does anyone know how many seasons you get to play because one of the achievements say set the record for most world titles well thats seven that i can think of but it only has 3 stars and does anyone know what the stars actually mean haha what a nice intro im still playing the real wsc 09 not missing anything with this crap game i like this game but how dose the points work out in the online tournaments mirroring the snooker on the tv android total snooker is the best snooker game going you are easily pleased is it just snooker or can we play 8ball game this is pool will be best what a great review also appreciate you start with a compressedshort review thank you very much ill be watching more of your videos for sure why cant you play as yourself i dont want to play as any of the pros or any of the wannabee freaks also this is a very piss poor snooker game controls are appalling and why have flashes on screen all the time ive played better years ago are we playing the same game cos i wouldnt recommend this tripe to anyone already uninstalled and wont be going back to this poor graphics on the players commentators are horrendous and its costs you 16 points for a foul wtf how about an update review this looks a lot like a snooker game i bought 12 years ago maybe for 500 bucks it would warrent a buy you would imagine that it would be easy to make a totally real looking snooker game in this day and age also it lacks imagination what about a golden option where you play as davis or white or alex as long as it plays well not really care about the bugs and glitches sorry but snooker games died with wsc 09 wsc 11 was a shameful cheap update with people being paid to give false reviews cant even play as yourself what the fuck why does everyone keep saying its realistic the graphics are appalling i know that graphics arent everything but for a sim and especially one where the location is literally a small room with just a few things in it the graphics are terrible not just terrible but lame pc version online mode does not work at all the matchmaking system does not work save your money on pc as this is totally not worth the 30 they are selling it for yea i was thinking id get it but the price was just too high and from what ive seen it seems kinda unfinished ive seen players legs going through the table the characters look very clunky and the overall texturing could be a little more refined as for what i keep reading about pop ups after every shot and badly programmed commentary etc that didnt help either if it were around 1520 id probably have got it with the hope of updates ill wait to see if they release an improved version a lot of the things you said probably they will add the only reason they dont have them is because they rushed the game for the world championship what we need is a cross between this and vpool 4 in vp4 the way you control your cue and move around the table is excellent but playing kids dressed like skateboarders is not what you want its a pool game so fair enough snooker 19 has the venues and the players but the controls look awful unless this wasnt pc and mouse the ai is mentioned a lot with this game the way the balls move on breakoff looks odd and unrealistic very heavy perhaps the cloth is a bit thick o they barely move never a red left on based on the clips ive seen here would this run on a radeon r4 graphics think ill stick with the excellent international snooker by big head games with the officially licensed michaela as the referee you can actually see the crowd and they clap too when acknowledging a good shot plus theres ooohs and argghhs when you miss a shot you can save the last five minutes of several games you can buy upgrades with ingame points the only thing you dont see is a physical opponent and there is no commentary but lets face it youre not meant to hear commentary when youre on the floor playing a game anyway graphics are realistic and physics spot on i certainly wouldnt by snooker 19 at this price point and certainly not with these shit graphics what price is it hi mike hope you are well a couple of issues i have found on the pc version are not all events have a trophy presentation having just won the riga also the steam achievements do not seem to unlock for example obtaining a 50 plus break not sure if you have experienced this hope you may be able to provide any information i do think this is still a fantastic game and has been long over due great review kind regards gav really need a replay option bigtime shit game with bad pyshics gameplay and aiming system with ps2 graphics not worth 30 pounds remember playing these games years back theyve not improved much lol what annoys me is the time spent by devs on frills work out all the important stuff then next version add frills like the game only the balls are to slow laggy this brakes the game hope for a update whats snooker 19 best on pcps4 or xbox i will buy this but when it is on sale on stream would you put that middleaged lugubrious welsh chinless paunchy bald turkeylookalike on the cover if you were marketing it thought not rubbish game and was so rushed i got it on steam and got refund as didnt like it and isnt worth 30 shame as the hype before release was promising the carrer mode is bullshit playing in on the lowest difficulty and yet the npcs plays like they are on fucking hard that makes no sence they have like 9999 no faulticy in their shots if you miss your shot you will sit like rest of the game watching the npc plop one ball in after another only 20mins online thats rubbish snooker is a game to play on a local snooker club with friends not to play on a console or pc its a no for me but nice review skipping because of no custom characters so glad i saw this no caricature and no topdown camera im out no chalking a cue thats not at all realistic a little tap area for chalking a possible miss cue if you start forgetting on the xbox version if playing against ai if you hold down the right trigger this will fast forward the ai shot not being able to create your own character together with the ridiculous 20 min time limit and zero customisation options for online games ie playing best of 3 or 5 frames and removing or extending the shot clock etc have really ruined this game for me pots look a bit wooden when they go in the pocket the pocket netting should move as it hits the back and falls into the pocket personally i think it is an ok game but not worth 30 a lot of bugs such as needing this black to win the frame and there are still 14 reds and all the colours on the table the mouse control not sure if it is just me but is akward i much prefer playing using keyboard now as i found it 100 times easier i have it installed on two pcs one a 22 inch monitor the next a 60 inch tv i find the 60 inch tv much more playable i think it is because the pocket size will be bigger however on a 22 inch monitor i am not making the same shots as i do on my tv the skill setting i find is pretty good i am on easy mode at the moment but the players are not that easy if you give them a free table they can and will clean up however they will also make mistakes the player characters are hideous to be honest despite them being scanned i cannot recognise half the players even though i am not a snooker fan but i know ronnies face the thing that i hate most is the 10 second shot tim why do the balls look like there sped up they look jittery and unnatural wcs2003 was the best snooker sim and animations were pretty good too you can walk around the table check the options the shot at 1109 is bullshit and im surprised he didnt point that out the cue ball doesnt completely change trajectory when you play with side thats such and amateurish mistake i cant see me moving away from virtual pool 4 somehow ref calls foul and a miss even when your opponent needs lots of snookers wrong cant change your mind after selecting the colour you want after snookering yourself wrong 3 consecutive fouls loses you the frame when you cant see both sides of the on ball wrong sigh digitally captured but they look shit all of us snooker fanatics have waited for a great snooker game for so long its easy to let a sub par game get our hopes up just because it has a couple of things going for it ive been watching updates on this game for a while and can say i will not be buying it it falls short in too many areas to make the couple of good things worth 30 ill wait for the next iteration unless something better comes through before i would like some legends added for quick match and online modes steve davis alex higgins henry etc maybe even a challenge like recreating the 85 final and other classic matches its crying out for features and id give a bollock to play an hour of the line up you cant get get by watching the ai kick your arse i was really looking forward to this game but its absolute garbage i hated the cue power controls the camera angles are awful the white screen flash after every shot is downright annoying and wheres the audience i was expecting a wsc real type of game with better graphics but the frankly idiotic control system and no character creation were game breakers for me and sadly my xbox version of this game is winging it way back to amazon i dont like how the players get up the second they hit it like an amateur the white flash after every shot really gets on my nerves this is nothing but a half assed revamp of the old snooker titles9 or 10 yrs ago terrible nice break off at 443 why are you reviewing the ps2 version really enjoying the game the only option i would like to see is a practice mode ie you could practice potting and positional play as the pros do with the balls lined down the table or practice without an opponent would be good have you played 2009 wts for the pc i think snooker 19 will take a lot live up to but time will tell my initial thoughts from playing it are you mentioned wrong commentary a few times but there are some really glaring bad ones i was going through the colors lining up on the pink and the commentary was this pot for snookers required snookers with only the black left on the table thats a new one for me or id miss a pot and the commentary was he missed it but it doesnt matter with 30 points left on the table and then proceeded to lose i havent heard phil yates yet i actually found myself missing some classic yates trivia while playing audience cheering and clapping was quite appropriate the game does a good job at assessing shot difficulty no practice mode you were so right to lambaste the game for the absence of a practice mode baffling truly free look mode is absolutely useless most of the time you cant even see the pockets the attention to detail and snooker love is apparent in so many places of this game but given ive played around 30 hours now on pc using a controller my highest break being a 133 in online play i think you were a little generous when it comes to the ai a few of us on steam have been discussing the possibility that it may be scripted by this what i mean is very very often you find if the ai misses a shot the white ball always ends up safe and i dont mean on a cushion i mean in open play but with no ball on for you to have a crack at it happens so often we are almost certain its scripted that way taking the random aspect of the game especially when you miss a shot you were suppose to be intending to get out of it on day one we also notices the ai safety play would mostly just involve roll ups instead of playing back into baulk but that seems to have been solved with a very quick patch i really really enjoy the gameplay aswell i especially like how the power bar works and that if you dont hit the sweet spot in the middle of the white zone its not going to be the two other things that are disappointing not mentioned in the comments thus far as i can see 1 when youre in career mode and playing a tournament you cant as far as i can tell see the draw and other results i think this feature which occurs in other sports sims adds immersion helps you to feel you are in a world and it is sadly lacking here 2 once you start career mode i cant see a way to adjust aiming or ai difficulty once youve started this is very inflexible and quite poor online needs to be at least 30 minutes or an option to not have a match countdown at all for hardcore fans any one remember playing jimmy whites cue ball on the saga mega drive lol good reviewfair point with the price point totally agree with the tv presentation comment and very hate the blinding white sweepingflash sequence after a players shotreally bugs me its the only thing that spoils it for me i very much agree with you on the top view of the table although now ive got used to not having it i dont miss it you could argue it makes it tooo easy im excited about the support the game will get and the price tag may be worth it then one major dissapointment is the online mode hasnt been working on xbox since launch and im very surprised you havnt mentioned this great video look forward to the career mode series i think its an excellent game but a few things could of been added such as replays and create your own player i would like a overhead camera but thats debatable the sound is really bad you can barely hear the cue and ball sounds and they sound muffled too theyre much cleaner in real life this is disappointing as its the main sound you hear during a match thanks for the review no invert y no buy excellent review mike with salient well thought out points the peter ebdon version isnt out till 2022 why is there only 1 skill level covering the worlds top 20 players this means ronnie plays like lisowskinonsense a working progress then its got promise think i will wait till its been fixed patched what i dont like in career mode is when you enter a tournament you get a top 16 player ive played 9 lost 9 they love playing me lol really in depth review thanks colour banding is awful and never seen a dashed baulk line before throw in the mannikins and it aint great is it great review tempted to get it for the xbox but will wait for the switch instead to be fair the price is fair its not a triple a game and with one or two updates could fix a lot of the problems too pricey but will get on sale thanks for the review few points i think need changing the free move camera can be difficult to use sometimes the white screen that pops up after every shot needs to be removed its very bright especially if playing in a dark room eg night time sometimes the commentary finishes before the shot has even been played eg it says thats a bad miss while the cue ball is still travelling towards the object ball own character creation would be good apart from that its a brilliant game imo played all evening and the patch has sorted out the safety play and nowits brilliant absolutely brilliant my palms have been sweating all night the gameplay is the key here and my goodness this is as good a sports sim ive seen in decades the physics are brilliant and the chance to play the whole season schedule is ace for a first effort this is truly brilliant i personally think when you ses games like rugby league live coming out at 60 quid this is the best priced game at 26 quid ive seen in years i think this is one if the best releases ive seen in such a long time no blinking dlc no money grabbing just the whole game well priced and well made i love this game i have to say the developers need a huge pat on the back for this yes there are cut scenes and presentation that could be added but we live in an age of great cut scenes and presentation and more and more dumbed down game play this is a sim uk fans dream brilliant ken the darling of dublin doherty love a good snooker game theres a minute microstutter when any ball moves more than a few inches is this youtube or the game maybe the game needs to run at a higher frame spot on with the after burner looks a lot better than international snooker and 3d pool in my steam library any good golf games do you know of interesting game and very fair review looks a bit too slow paced and the balls roll too long does the game have a skip to end a shot or do you need to wait until everything comes to a rest also can you set up practice shots move balls around etc like you can in virtual pool there wont be any seniors etc as stephen hendry snooker will have the seniors licence is it my eyes or is there some lag to the balls when they roll ive got the game coming tomorrow and theres me struggling to make over 10 lmao i love this game but i suck so much my biggest break is only 22 and thats after playing it over a month i just cannot do positional play whatsoever its totally random where the cueball ends up after my shot and i cannot seem to fix it brilliant maximum mate just a quick question when you moved the camera to see if the blue could pass the pink how did you do that just curious to know cheers the commentary on the 2009 game actually mentioned the 147 during the break this game nothing lifeless to get any idea of where that white is going you must play this all day every day since release got the game today have to say its the worst game ive ever played no cue ball marker how the hell are you supposed to judge where the white will go especially as each shot seems to be so different even the first aiming screen is skewed compared to the second one absolute garbage is the pro aiming aid the most difficult great 147 please make a aiming guide yes so happy got mine now146 yesterday having to do 1 pink 147 today got this for my birthday a week or 2 or ago still only won 1 frame so far any tips any tips im lining up the shot correctly and hitting the target on the power bar but i still miss this game worth buying got mine couple days ago after missing about 4 good chances1 ot 2 were so easy i actually missed last red because i adjust aim line while pressing r2 side without realising lolwas in shockso relieved to finally get 1 tho this is quality your videos have made me order the game nice one sunday i was so close with 146 and yesterday an attempt stop at 81 your commentary ive just ordered this after watching the world champs looks good got my first 147 last night great feeling i just had an amazing 147 attempt after knoking the first red i was more perfect on the pink but i said why not take the black and see how it works out and i made it to the 14th red and missed it nice 1 is it possible to speed up your opponents shots in game highest break for me is 80 but on snooker stars great 147 my highest has been 108 i struggle more with the easy shots near the pocket than the long shots at times with this game lol great job i subscribe i play also snooker 19 i cant even get 100 off break let alone a 147 can you do this in multiplayersplit screen or is it only single playercampaign wow so obvious youve done the commentary after this happened nice try at acting pal nice job i want to see someone clear the table in under 5 minutes ive been trying but had no luck hardest trophy in the game for sure where can i find this game the graphic makes it look like a foul shot every time you use the rest how come when you win a trophy you cant see a player liftting a trophy on snooker 19 game awesome break mate absolutely loving the game so far watching you i think im trying to hard applying side etc when it isnt needed thats what not playing snooker in real life does to you lol not going to get my career elliott slessor to rank 1 the way im playing so far though the bald eagle ive nicknamed him well played captain good video the balls seem to travel much faster than they do in real life ronnie is notoriously ambidextrous best in the game he wouldnt use a rest on the pink at 134 and would you dig down off the cushion on that black for a 147 this game is terrible it was always going to be i did skip to the end of the video saw two shots and they both confirmed that i couldnt play this game haha nice one amazing to watch what a player you are great commentary you finally got it congrats finally picked this game up on xbox one and im having a blast what platform are you playing on my sound effects are so out of sync its awful at times other than that love it im fine when not playing off cushions for position i struggle to judge the power when playing the white off the cushions but other than that i feel im getting used to it should of been against ebdon just for the lolz do you actually play snooker bcause your break building shot selection is really weird well played this makes me want to buy the game well done savage clearence which game well done 040 your easily pleased terrible shot great effort that fair play ive got a 115 with no aiming aid that was hard work im off to get a drink now you mean change your undies you filthy animal good maxi well played sir animations are really poor ronnie never wears a greyish outfit and the game gets boring really fast descent try this but i pass can you change the aiming aid difficulty in career mode or do you have to start a new one fantastic break congrats mate thats bloody awesome mate top stuff im glad for you mate youve been working hard lately i was gutted when my highest break was 140 only 7 off the maximum but well done captain keep it going love ya man simply lovely lovely snooker great 147 i got 140 then missed the black i know its not the real thing but bet you still get a real buzz out of making the maximum just quit to main menu if you screw a shot up come back in again and take the shot again do that as much as you like easy 147 youre welcome brilliant 147 break my highest only 43 so far lol not played much in the past week either been working or watching too much snooker my boy judd has got it all to do so far trailing 97 against ding hopefully he will come back however i am delighted both ronnie and selby are out d shame young james cahill went out last night he deserved to beat maguire and was very unlucky superb never in doubt now to do it in master ive hit 80 odd in master so its possible i think if only virgo was commentating on this brilliant clearance thought the commentators could have been a bit more enthusaistic about youre achievment though the first of many i suspect great show wouldnt it be great to see the some sort of emotion from the crowd player when the 147 happens congrats superb break and i feel every century etc has that one defining recovery shot got my first century today and later was on a maximum but was 1 inch short on the final red position so thanks for the motivation i feel your career mode series should just be one season with ronnie but the maybe start with a rising star to see how you can rise up the rankings may give it more longevity not sure why but seems much harder than pure pool taking me a while to get used to the spin and cue ball control hi nice 147 in this video iam still getting to grips with the game trying to find what amining aid would be best for me i keep doing exhibition match to see whats bestkeep the snooker 19 videos coming this makes my 31 look a bit poo lol good shooting i broke down myself on 10 reds only a matter of time tho well done my highest break is 124 hi why did you pot the blue in the corner and not place the cueball where the pink one that would have been easier great break by the way is it much more difficult aiming than amateur 944 you shouldnt have been scared of accidentally shooting even if you were to have started the power bar you can let it go past 100 and you wont shoot not so average now are you joe my highest is 65 was on a max and potted black and red was gutted very nicely done finally going to be getting the game myself tomorrow cant wait to play great break is it time to increase the aiming difficulty my highest break is 121 and that felt like hard work my closest since then is like 65 haha fair play mate see i told u i requested it nice one mate i cant even get a 50 break hahahahaha it was a great break snookernation has even better gameplay at least you have full control of where the cue ball is going to end aiming here is terribleeven using amateur aiming aid and aiming straight to the the pocket in an easy redyou can miss itoverhead camera bad to controli fell that this game could have been better feels as if it was done in a hurry ps2 snooker games were much better that this sht i think this game is the best snooker game on ps4 so far its quite easy for beginners and hard if you want it to be ive played pure pools snooker 3d billiards snooker snooker nation and this game pure pool not beginnerfriendly at all little bit boring too server is almost always down so multiplayers beware snooker nation nice graphics but it seems that the game decides where your ball ends 3d billiards snooker dont even bother this game has everything wrong with it waste of money snooker 19 nice gameplay long career mode and real life characters characters are quite rough looking and commentators speech could be much better long career mode is nice all of these games ive played id recommend this apoligies for my bad english im thinking of getting this do u think its worth getting just played snookernation 19 the graphics are great and its very realistic for such a cheap game but doesnt seem to be many playing online i got the game off playstation store and i won the riga masters in career mode with ronnie and there was no trophy presentation did you get that on purchase of the game please can someone tell me why the frame rates are better here iv got a ps4 pro with a 4k monitor and the game has poor frame rates for me why do these sort of snooker games have that after shot thing it makes it feel less realistic with pure pool you take the shot as you play it game is good but still room for big improvement 1 have ability to create your own player 2 when you win have talking like fifa on youe reaction to winning could be good player and say as eg i take every win in my stride or be bad and say i knew i win 3 locker rooms for clothes what u unlock hiya captain im playing on the pc snooker 19 and the power bar goes way to fast and lags howdo u fix this the cue ball looks odd you could just get off your arse and play real snooker i think wsc2009 is still the best snooker game i would rather play vr snooker linked to a real snooker table i dont like the rushed 20 minute online games not real snooker imo everyone saying this looks awesome i mustnt be seeing the same game it looks utter shite ps1 graphics horrible player animation terrible commentary ill be sticking with the snooker mode on pure pool a million times better pish just got the game the viewing angles are terrible for taking shots the white ball looks brown and i still cant figure out the unique game code to send for a private match still work to be done on the game thanks for this video will definitely buy it to support them but as many have said theres a lot they can improve on is it even possible to miss the pot 2019 and no online mode come on graphics look the sameworse than the ps4xbox360 version buy atleast we now have a snooker game for the gen on consoles and final thought the commentators are still annoying as fk what a great shot what a great shotwhat a great shotwhat a great shot well he has left half a chance etc all the same sht as older games but im a sucker and will buy it rip 2499 lol this game is way to easy to play i find myself getting bored at times graphics is horrible almost 7 minutes into the video and youve hit two balls as boring as watching ebdon wow this is a true next gen game the graphics blew my mind just wow for a game released in 2019 this is really poor the animations and graphics are abysmal the table seems like its made of ice balls move so unnaturally and even something simple like the commentary just seems like its completely at random there are snooker games you can get on your phone better than this at least i wont get penalized for profanities omg it is so ugly can you get this game on steam i have played snooker 2009 wts the graphics are poor on the characters 1410 hes snookered himself what an idiot hahaha 1143 this shot makes the game unrealistic in real life nobody would ever ever play these kinds of shots game has a good potential but needs quite some more work looking forward to seeing further improvements my only complain with the game is whenever i do a good safety shot the ai manages to squeeze a red in which for me 910 would go wide of the pocket i think the game needs some work but i like the concept hi there i have just across this video i bought this game on wednesday but i have not been able to even hit a ball i dont have a clue what to do not having a booklet with controls dont help could you explain please cheers had to chuckle at the what an idiot line thats not snooker that is an aimbot on a snooker table playing with the indicators takes all the fun out of the game great video thanks the commentary seems to be almost at random i know there was a patch since then but its not much improved theyre still no indication the commentary can recognize going for a safety and they think just the color after the last red is required this game is fucking shit 945 can you make that cue ball do that i dont think so xd could they not even animate picking up the rest after a shot looks awful do the balls look like they dont bounce properly off the cushions something about the mechanics doesnt seem right dont think ill be buying this one it looks like it was made for mobile in my opinion think ill skip on this looks messy and needing many patches fixes cost you 5 in 3 months time can you play online holy shit what the white screen after every shot has stopped me buying it is this game free just a shame with the commentary we will never hear those iconic words where the white ball going where the white ball going from the master john wheres the white ball going vergo 913 oh and that was a bad miss comedy fans should get the joke 650 nd the crowd go wild gameplay looks incredibly accurate but graphically the players are ps3 level just wondering is there an edit mode where you can create yourself or friends in the game ros breaking off right handed fail awful theyll never get the mechanics right the cloth is way too fast for a 2019 game very poor getting commentary to be accurate is just basic you can tell they spent much money on this it looks like snooker 2004 a pcps4 snooker game that can enhance teach real skill that improve ones real game in reality worth billion we dont need player animation the game is very nicelooks stunningly photo realistic in close up view and has very immersive and addictive controls that being said i would personally like an over the top view to see aim lines better and id like to see the table wood shine a little more the table and arenas look better in snooker nation the atmosphere feels empty aswell compared to snooker nationhardly anyone watchingalthough i love the very clever commentary and the sounds of exvitement the crowd makeits just the arena looks empty also that white light that sweeps the screen after a player has taken a shot is reeeeally annoying im sorry but this game is awful its 2019 and this is the best they can create the graphics on the players are horrendous and the commentary is dreadful you can get just as good quality snooker games on your phone why not just wait and release a much better standard of game truly terrible vp4 or virtual pool 4 is the best pool and snooker simulation ever made and its the best by a good margin too its hands down the best and a fantastic simulation and very easy to get to into as the mouse control feel intuitive and natural this game is not good not very good at all bad game play its ok in 12 years ago theyll improve on this with wsc2007 i can understand how hard it would b to replicate ai safety play but at least they actually play safe rather than potting from impossible angles or sending the cue ball off three cushions to make the pot like in the snooker games of old looks great thanks for the review ok mac rant over are we still stuck in the 90s i was not impressed with the rollup shots it looked as though it was never going to reach and lo and behold it did the table seems incredibly fast can you preset the speed of the table does ronnie play with different hands on different shots ebdon would i have the patience to wait 2 hours per shot ha ha i like the crowd noise and appropriation commentary is a bit predictable after a while though not as bad as dennis taylor in world champ snooker ugh graphics look amazing and ball motion is so silky smooth does anyone call out cmon as in real matches that would be fun does it do a respot black i hope so sixred mode is there a tenred mode hope so speed snooker 10 ball snooker the game looks great and might be addictive once you get used to the controls and subtleties i like that there is an online option nice how good is the safety play that requires real ai so not get and pc give me a break no pun intended what about mac users there are plenty of millions of us you know does any1 else not think the table and balls need some work they look awful even pure pool snooker add on looks much more realistic also the commentary played an excellent safety to clip a red and get cue ball back to cushion yet the commentator assumed i was going for the pot and assumed i wouldnt be happy i was fuckin elated ya wud think anyone reviewing a game would know its called a cue and not a stick ffs is this available on modern consoles or just the ps1 the graphics and physics are shitripstones snooker pack for pure pool is 1000 times betterthe animations are a joke as well i played it for 15 mins and have already requested a refund the player models look like something from madame tussauds house of horrors the safety shots cushion reactions spin physics contact noises clunky animations and limited commentary are all also cause for concern i remember playing the first snooker game on ps1 in 2001 or whenever it was and being infuriated by the way the ai used to roll to the pack dead weight whenever they played safe that was nearly 20 years ago cant wait to see multiplayer just pre ordered not out till midnight over here in ireland quality of games these days is extremely high why does snooker always seem so far behind players look awful and leaving williams off the front cover was a poor decision snnoker stars game in phone has greater animation than this i dont like the players animation the cueing action looks like pool and the bridge is too close to the cue ball can see me buying this on ps4 and then on switch when its out on that platform too when your taking the shot and select power have you got to stop it yourself was putting me off getting it its still got those weird ufo circles on the felt i see the frame of the players seats look like theyre collapsing a bit too 818 and 838 in the video hahaha otherwise looks fantastic and ill definitely be buying 8 ball pool is best can you create your own player for online its not just my ps4 pro that tries to fly abroad everytime you play a game then haha i bought this game for 3 reasons 1 support the gaming company and hope for a better more polished graphical experience if they make another game 2 its reasonably priced at 30 3 i love snooker cant wait to play it great video apart from some dodgy ai shot choices i thought it looked fantastic especially considering this is their first snooker game look forward to the full review tomorrow thanks for postingcould you make a video showing if sideenglish actually alters the wayangle the cue ball comes off a cushion after the object ball is potted the ai safety play by playing dead weight onto an object ball seems weirdalso shots played with side doesnt appear to alter the angle that the cue ball comes of the cushioncue ball appears to come off cush plain ball irrespective of playing the shot with side im playing peter ebdon but its stuck on the opponent is thinking screen if it doesnt have kicks im not buying it i look forward to the review was hoping an actual snooker fan would be reviewing this and looks like youre just the man this guy seems a really nice genuine chaplove your videos keep it up ive been waiting 8 years for this game and cant wait for its release that aiming aid isnt gonna work at all it needs to be like the wsc games so you know exactly where the white will end up which is obviously crucial in snooker it appears ripstone have made this exactly like there pool game which is not good news at all i loved there pool game dont get me wrong and the aiming aides wotk perfectly for a small table but when they released thete snooker dlc the aiming aid didnt change so it was almost impossible to play cause you never knew where the white would end up ive been looking forward to this game too having been a big fan of the wsc series and a fan of snooker but if its gonna play like there pool game then im not interested and thats a shame for all of us cant wait for this game to release looks amazing is there a way you can see your character all the time i mean when he takes a shot not only the cue they should run around the table and not just standing there what about the grey screen everytime they take a shot very disappointed with the game graphics looks shit i hope they patch the ai just rolling up to balls on safety shots do you or your opponent still get 16 points as a result of a foul from everything ive seen so far it looks like this is yet another rushed game released in an unfinished state the table and balls look great i can ignore the bad looking player models but the ai needs a lot of work very disappointing really interested to see how it plays without the aiming aid have you tried it joe world snooker 2005 on my ps2 genuinely seems better than this ronnie always plays the breakoff left handed i play wsc real 09 until today fuck the grafics i want to play this game game looks great to me would like to see the ai play a safety thats not a roll up though 1128 ronnie did not need the rest thanks for sharing cant wait to play it myself great first video joe looking forward to the rest of your snooker19 content cant wait to get the game myself hopefully tomorrow so many people complaining just be grateful that we got a game ball sounds arent quite right far too clean ive longed for a decent snooker game awful glitches terrible ai shot choices totally laughable safety play and some shots that are actually impossible are ruining the realism that this game could have theres no way this will all be fixed also why does there never appear to be increased shot difficulty when the cue balls tight on a cushion players still go for and regularly pot outrageous pots player graphics movement both seem like something from 10 years ago crowd also lack of cut scenes also is disappointing since you cant be yourself can anyone tell me a player i should be whos not highly ranked but has a lot of talent to improve if you guys havent already then id recommend trying out pure pool and getting the snooker add on for itboth are on the xbox store now for 959 its the best snooker game ive ever played looks really promising despite the rough edges looking forward to giving it a try theres been so much focus on how it looks that noone has really talked about the original control method which i think is a great addition im still really excited and looking forward to this great video as always mate good job joe looks good imo obvs certain things which could do with tweaks but im sure they will be addressed we have to remember this is their first attempt and with community support we may be onto a real winner here please get them to get rid of that white flash between shots im sorry but the ai safety play is complete rubbish ronnie doesnt look too bad but neil looks absolutely horrific really hope the developers continue to support the game as it has the potential to be so deep with all the players tournaments etc like others have said it would be good to be able to create your own player hopefully in an update or the next version theyll include that there will need to be a few patches to tweak the gameplay and other cosmetic things positional play definitely needs worked on with it being a small development team then they will rely on feedback from us in order to improve the game going forward hopefully if its a success then they can look to grow their team and produce better and better each year the game is fantastic and the graphics as well its probably fair to say its not fully finished and rushed for release with the world championship this week but its definitely playable and from what the devs have said on twitter they will be updating it and fine tuning it via future patches if you love snooker and can afford it 25 seems fair to invest and support the devs very promising in many ways the ai however needs a good kicking the devs cant have watched much snooker if they think some of those shots were true to life strange you didnt have the selby rest glitch which appeared in other post patch videos ive seen where he uses the rest every damn shot the player animations are dreadful just dreadful they ruin the immersion seems that your favourite phrase here captaingoodspeed is im sure it will be patched at some point or tweaked at some point from all the videos i have seen so far there seems to be alot of tweaking still to come lets just hope they do something about them all i will be reviewing the game myself on wednesday and i promise my review will be honest theyve nailed the visual graphics the table and arena look stunning aswell as the action cam but the atmosphere is absolutely dire you can just about hear the balls at times when playing a shot and each shot plays like as if youve dropped it in dead weight also whats with these silly slow shots from the ai when the balls role for an eternity it seems just horrible the gameplay needs to be massively improved imo and they need to add that sound of where the ball hits the back of the pocket its so dull currently forget about adding a player creator for now and just prioritize on the gameplay online will be great well this has me excited cant wait for wednesday during your play through did you notice anything regarding instant replays during the frames to observe good pots so whenever ai is faced with a safety he will just do roll up 1408 absolutely terrible 1147 who is ever playing that shot why is it even in the game and again the shot after it had high hopes for this but the ai needs improving drastically terrible as the computer player has been made long balls no problem but position play saftey or come out of snooker is not good but im proud of you for presenting it cannot wait for me to be able to get it looks good so far but tut tut tut hi joe cant waite to click the guy on snooker 19 too much rolling by aialso they need to slow the tables down a bit buy pure pool buy the snooker dlc u will never touch that that game has crazy realistic graphics the cloth is sooo detailed gameplay looks suspect ai only plays safe by rolling up manages to leave it touching ball everytime as well commentary is terrible probably better to turn it off character models are last gen standard at best they got rid of the black annoying screen and just replaced it with a white one ffs terrible if thats in the final release on 17th this game is a big no no from me surely you can have a continuous view of the table it is 2019 isnt it game breaker very annoying im pissed off you cant play as yourself but this looks good its crazy how fast 6months went since the announcement its only really felt like we have waited 1month 946 how is that possible wow some of the ai shot choices concern me but other than that it looks amazing are you still doing your career with ronnie i cant wait to see the start of it asap also will you have a full review out once youve got a proper feel for the game no replays i dont like the way the balls carry on rolling seems a bit weird a lot of fan noise if you are in the game bad optimalization game looks awesome yet the safety play from the ai is so unrealistic it definitely needs addressed asap i was disappointed that there is no create a player option it seems like if you select a pre existing player all their stats get wiped would much rather have been able to create my own player and rise through the rankings safety doesnt seem important either from the gameplay that i have seen the ai either pots from anywhere on the table or plays silly little roll up safety shots i only heard of this game a few days ago and have it on my wishlist on steam but the more i see the less interested i am in buying it its scheduled for the 17th of april on steam really not sure i will buy it despite waiting so long for a snooker game i was kind of hoping that if there was ever another one made it would be really in depth maybe having things like pressure and stamina playing a role so as you start out in your career and play bigger events or longer matches the aiming could be a little harder or something but as you progress youre able to handle the pressure more and mai robbo wont know what hes in for when i take him over will be lucky to get 6pts never mind 60 cracking first look at the game definitely room for improvement the ai safety play concerns me but other than that it looks pretty good hate the ai roll up dead wait safety not realistic frist time i see this kind of pool game this looks so shit im so dissapointed for this game graphics are average more like ps3 game but thats not all my ps4 console gets loud as hell so i just dont wanna start this game never again im just wondering are console manufacturers sony and game developers interested customers at all novadays im just so pissed off cause i have bought all and this is what i got unfinished game optimation and unfinished consoles iv got a question iv got a ps4 pro with this snooker 19 game and i have a 32 inch samsung 4k monitor for some reason the game seems to have terrible frame rates and are not as smooth as this any tips please this was the shittest fram of snooker ive ever seen you ready for the worlds think kyren wilson or selby will win 90 mins online play time is way to longshould be about 30mins40 mins on tournaments mode is finestill need to sort the sound out when the ball hits the pocket too ah a nice slow relaxing game of snooker perfect this could have been so good but its poor some the shots taken no pro would take the rest stays on the table after some shots and the player sometimes doesnt even turn up the cue floats on its own no custom character build makes it disappointing and the aiming aid while ok sometimes the ball goes in the wrong direction the commentary is appaling overall 410 wtf is that shot at 130 great game agree with most of what you said however the graphics need to be improved greatly to make this a truly realistic game shadow depth around the table on cues rests needs to be better as cues rests players look like they are floating most of the time which is poor for a licensed game imo players do need to look more genuine realistic asap a virtual referee would also help with realism especially if he or she comes to the table replaces potted colours on their spots apart from that i am enjoying the game so far hope to see improvements coming along on a regular basis we needed a snooker game but this isnt it purchased today and my view is it looks great but theres a few cons they need to address cons no birds eye view poor commentary cant change difficulty during career mode cant create pro no match stats i think other than those points i think its a great game and has great potential the game has serious potential as long as the developers keep the faith it could be brilliant in the next year or two at least it wasnt a full priced game the game its more like a prototype there are two other options if youre not too fussed on seeing players purepool on pc and consoles is quite a few years old now but graphically and technically it has a great snooker dlc which has its flaws but its quite fun to play especially with a mate another one which i am a big fan of at the moment is snooker nation which a year and a half ago i bought the beta version on xbox one and until recently discovered there was an update and now i have the final finished version only thing i would say is that the controls are a bit too fast moving the cue around and aiming etc but i think graphically it trumps both purepool and this snooker 19 i havent played snooker 19 yet so i dont know how good it plays all i can do is judge how it looks at the moment at the end of the day nothing will ever beat the real thing but its always fun to have a few options to play about with at home great review a 7 doesnt really reflect loving a game i reckon tweaked and patched down the line theyve had 9 fucking years where is the marker to show where your white will go i purchased this game as a snooker pool player the game is shockingly bad lol please no do not buy great review just bought the game subbed needs a few patches tho hi do you think that the two big games that come out in 2019 will cater for two different audiences i see snooker 19 with the real license and playing as ronnie etc as great then this is snooker with what will be excellent game engine physics be a great online experience are you going to review this is snooker will higgins throw a game when playing him no sense of progression as you cant improve the characters they force you to choose for a career mode as we somehow cant create our ownits actually mental to think theres no creation or progression in this game ball physics and cueing with the analog stick instead of this old fashioned method is way better in pure pool with the snooker dlc the lack of commentary between shots is disturbing after a week or so with the game i do think it is a very solid foundation and find it enjoyable however there are a few things that i find frustrating firstly the lack of create a player is very disappointing for a sports game in 2019 there is also no indication that i have seen so far in game on how to unlock different cues and attire it would be unfortunate if it was only unlockable online because i hate the fact the shot clock is 30 seconds and the match clock is 20 minutes this leads to some very unrealistic snooker lastly one of the biggest omissions here is the fact that there is no top down view when setting up a shot this was in all previous snooker games i have played overall it is a great foundation but it falls short and feels slightly empty i would expect more content from a game in 2019 but the pricing is reflective i suppose i feel like this would be a good game on the switch generally a good game the sound is out of synch though when you hit the ball or it enters the pocket the sounds are not realistic either depending on the shot after playing a shot the players are a bit wooden just standing there no movement around the table or when using a rest they just stand there like a lemon waiting for the ref to take it on the schedule i think it would be a good addition to list the winners of each tournament in a season also it doesnt update the ranking wins when someone wins a ranking event how do you play your friend online cant find that option the main problem with the gameplay is trying to leave long range snooker shots its nearly impossible to get the right power dont mess up against computer because when you do you hardly get a chance to have another go very annoying i wish there was a practice mode like 09 and 11 had a bit disappointed there looks good to me probably pick it up soon i think they should add a practice arena where you can play on your own to practice your breaks long shots and practice on your accuracy well i think the game could be improved in certain ways judging a roll up shot is difficult and on previous versions this was easy and judging the pace is hard but this is a positive because if they made it too easy we would all switch off i have made centuries on a real table and can play snooker quite well and so i understand the use of spin etc and whoever worked on this part of the game got it right this is the hardest bit to get right so moving forward keep that guy employed how would i improve it well firstly career mode needs a create a player as having your own identity online would be more fun and i would include different a simple button to change viewpoints first person perspective i dont think has ever been done properly or at all maybe this is too difficult but imagine if they did it and you could use the vr now that would be amazing and there is a vr pool game out there i heard so in future this is possible and i would like a button to switch overhead commentary is a bit off playing this today id cleared the last red and a colour then potted a tough yellow in the topleft and the cueball ended up rattling the jaws of the middleleft pocket but bounced out to line me up nicely for the brown but then steve davis pipes up on the commentary to say i fouled there was no foul and the game let me take my next shot i guess the cueball hitting the jaw triggered the piece of commentary as if it had went in disappointed you cant even create your own player why do i have to play those young rising players give as freedom to create our own legacy does anybody else keep drawing top players in the qualifiers i have played several tournament qualifiers and drawn top ten players each time im currently ranked 110 the online timer is a joke we should b able 2 pick if we want a timer or not and we defo should b able 2 wat type of line we want pro amateur etc i only play it online with a friend and not having these options have made it no fun 2 play online 4 both of us i wont b playing it online again till they patch this they better patch this or i wasted 30 quid this game has low frame rates even on xbox one x lol in game graphics are ok but the characters look like shit and no stephen hendry or alex higgins shooting controls not good either i hope they patch things up in the future the previous 360 games are better as a whole to this definetly thats a bad miss lol cant wait to play when i get the time havent played a snooker game since the ps2 and loved it after watching a video like this and others practically having a orgasm over the game i decided to purchase it as i loved wsc series i could only play 20 minutes before getting a refund the game is horrible real snooker for the ipad has better graphics and ball physics the gameplay is choppy the players are dull feel like a game made by a couple of kids in a bedroom than someone who loves the game should have built on top of the wsc games and improved the game with some animations for the players instead of the boring environment we have in this one with the level of detail and capabilities possibilities of todays games this is the worst game ive played in my opinion i love snooker ive watched it all my life but surely someone needs to just come out and admit that snooker video games just dont work i guess if they added vr to a snooker game it could work but its still pretty boring good review especially by someone who has a fair bit of experience as a snooker player one thing id really like to know is how is the cue action simulation when going back and forward to strike the ball is that smooth enough and actually simulates hitting the cue ball as real as possible like if you dont go back and then forward with the right analogue stick will that mean youve made a bad shot even to the point of miscuing i hope you know what i mean by this basically if you pull down on the right analogue stick well enough straight and then move it forward just like a real cuing action but you dont go straight and push the stick a little left or right will that cause you to make a bad shot or maybe even miss the shot great review i thought youd give it a 910 after the way you were talking though very off putting not to have your own player i like your commentary as you come across as sounding with professional and were not bad mouthing a 710 gameyoud make a great salesman id give the game a 910 based on what you said but i wouldnt buy itneeds own player mode good vid mategetting this a good starting point for a game but i encountered a dreadful glitch whilst playing selby i snookered him on the green in a very basic straight line snooker on the cushion the three balls about a foot apart he played a series of absurd shots none of which were ever going to get within half a table length of the object ball regularly aiming directly at the wrong colour and potting it each time he missed i had him retake the shot and i went from being about 80 points behind we were down to colours only to taking the frame by scoring approx 120 points in fouls no custom character well that is no buy for me then ive noticed how they roll up to the ball all the time subbed cuz amazingly said if only celeris made this title virtual pool creators the way the ball rolls and rollsand rolls is ridiculous i still play world snooker 2005 on the original xbox obviously it doesnt look as good but it has much better player animations tv style cameras are way better than this game and it has a visible referee very smart ai that you get into great safety battles with and the ball roll is spot on was so looking forward to this and it is a major disappointment for me i was alarmed that on the current generation of consoles a game could be only 8gb in size ai dont try and develop the pack when they need too they just focus on the pot was playing last night and my opponent needed snookers and yet when i made a foul a miss was called this happened 3 times until i got out of the snooker apart from that love the game great vidiogot it today 18042019as a none player i got it on a whim i must say i love itim disabeld who whill never get to play in real lifeif patchs make it even better then it will be a fantastic game far pros to us tryers who just want a bit of fun make are days a little less boaring having played this is poolsnooker which is a near finished product this game looks really badthe ball physics seem well off it is rushed out for the wc in may you cant give a game a good review based on what the devs saying they are going to do the graphics are badnothing like pure pool or the new this is pool were you sponsered to do this video so many people are saying this game is terrible in its current state good review im enjoying the game the close up sequences are photorealistic and stunning i like the controls and timing the shots and it feels immersive and addictive i also love the tv style presentation what i dont like is that white blinding sweeping replay style bit after each shotreally in your face annoyingdoes it really need to be there also comparing the table wood and grain to snookernation 450 on the dashboard its a little yesturday graphically the arenas are also a little basic and empty compared to snookernation however it does look and feel like a television presentation where you dont really notice the background and just focus om the baize and i think thats where they wanted to go with this make no mistake though the balls and physics are outstanding especially the close ups better than any snooker game one final point i cant get online with the game at the moment as there is an issue didnt hear you mention anything about that though ma i agress with all what you say and its more better then all the other snooker games what they done and with everything what they had done and i cant wait 2 see what else they will over the month and years for this snooker game after about 5 hours of play the online is where it is at for me or the most fun ive come across a couple of toxic players tho who let the timer run down on every shot just so ive got less chance of coming back can i use a mouse or joystick to perform a cue stroke the idea of power bar is only for those who know little about snooker and is not suitable for advanced players in real game cue speed back swing follow through etc are important elements in cue ball control can you get the ref to clean the cue ball to avoid kicks do you get kicks at all does the ai try to snooker you will ronnie occasionally deny a 147 on purpose one of the main things i want changed is being able to change match length and difficulty throughout career also having multiple profiles for career very annoying only being able to play one career am loving the game overallthere is a couple of gripes i av like you mentioned the ai safety play needs fixing i find the commentary not the best and annoying also i was playing career mode yesterday there was just the black left on the table i was more than 7 points in front and it just kept playing until i potted the black but it is a very good game like you atm 710 a very good starting point online mode stable how much they paying you to say that spent 45 mins trying get online yday 30 seconds isnt enough time for an online shot needs to be a minute at least or no limit if your playing your friends maybe a 30 second window of the opposition doesnt move the controller but if your adjusting spin and fine tuning the shot gunna be running out of time on a lot of shots the career lack of create a player is hugely disappointing there seems to be a massive step up from amateur aim to pro im banging in 70 breaks on amateur highest 86 but almost get excited to string four balls together on pro so far from me its promising but the lack of create a player loses two marks instantly as you say the safety play is bad for me its a 5 at the moment but hopefully in the next month a patch or three will get the game to be better if im being honest i think in the end they may have rushed to get it launched you sound very apologetic of this game after being let down by amazon i am now downloading it from the playstation store obviously the game isnt 100 per cent perfect but it looks like it plays well so looking forward to playing it nice review mate good to see a fellow geordie youtuber too purchased the game yesterday so far really enjoying it there are a few issues with the ai the unrealistic shots they take on but im greatful or id be sitting out frames after i break off the only issue i have though is on the game the miss rule applies even after the snookers required stage so that needs to be amended asap this game is a 510 at best i dont know why youre showing it so much love youre honestly being way too nice about a very average game i mean yeah they had a small team but its literally a snooker game it shouldnt take a big team to make a fantastic game thats just the brutal truth they should of called it snooker 20 and waited another year to polish it up animations are literally better on xbox 360 theres honestly no excuse for that i will be asking xbox for a refund on this one snooker nation is 450 and id argue just as good youre being way too generous imo 7 out of 10 come on the visual graphics are good the arenas and table look beautiful but the gameplay is poor theres so many glitches sometimes the rest goes through the table when the player holds the rest hes sometimes not even touching it and it looks so weird as a result the player also plays that ridiculous shot where he adds side and swings it to an impossible angle and also about 90 of the time plays these weird slow motion like pots more over the atmosphere is garbage balls sound crap and keep rolling and rolling the table plays like an ice rink theres no pocket sound of when u cleanly bang in a red or colour funnily enough in the launch trailer it was there you could hear that thud noise so perhaps it will be added which is a relief the audience are dead they should react to long pots misses fouls safety shots etc not just the odd pot i could go on but yeah it is their first game in the franchise so we should may having played on them in real life i can tell you now that the table itself is far too darkyoud thinkits using the same lights that a club in my local league uses and that hasnt changed them in 15 years and the pockets just look like even darker holes gameplay wise how does this compare to snooker nation i dont know whether anybody can answer this but has the part of the aiming aid where you can see the final white position gone completely liked playing snooker games in the past just not the great at themany answers much appreciated just a thought it might well be that the ai players leave most shots with the white close to the cushion due to the shiny cloth that is allowin the balls to roll further and longer than even a professional cloth would allow in real life so if they fix the cloth speed so now you say online will keep people playing but in previous video when i mentioned it you said people arent even buying it for ranked play i knew you were just trying to argue with me just to argue and no graphics arent ps1 bad but their definitely bad and animations are absolutely horrible couldnt agree more tbh i got the game posted in the evening and im absolutely enjoying it the presentation is spot on and makes you feel like youre watching it on tv the safety play is an issue though but once that gets patched along with character creation this would definitely beat all the old snooker games in the series hands down and what would absolutely melt my heart is if we get a dlc for exclusive john virgo commentary in the near future i would cry tears of joy why is there no crowd in career mode as dazzer169 says below i got it for pc too and the ai now plays proper safety shots steam pc version it got released at v105 great and fair review im loving the game so far i just need to master the pace of the table as my positional shots have been way off im generally good at snooker games but im struggling with this for now its not a bad thing my worst fear was that it would be too easy but thats not the case purchased snooker 19 today only store that are selling it is game i know you can get it online etc but i was craving to purchase it today and play i think its good overall im pretty crap at it so far its a lot harder compared to the old snooker games highest break so far for me has only been 25 lol but having watched this video it hash helped and i hope i will get better i think the speed of the table is lacking there have been some shots like playing a yellow in and out of baulk to come down for the reds playing it and a lot of pace and the bounce off the baulk cushion is very slow and poor hope that is something they improve its awful career mode what career mode you just pick a ai the shot power is awful you cant even change the keys setting on pc the aiming is awful just a awful game think your spot on joe with the review highlighting fault and positives not played the game as yet but watching your match ups makes the game look brilliant thanks joe that was a great review mate thanks for that i think the game is awesome apart from the ais safety bit but as you said that can be fixed with a future patch thanks developers for giving us a good snooker game great game but really hard for new players the game is so uafull its so bad bader than wsc 2004 how on earth one can get excited about this game is far from my understanding pure pool ans snooker is infinitely more enjoyable i had to leave mid way through the review to go to the toilet and pot the brown ive been playing pure pool snooker for the last 5 years and as a die hard snooker fan this game doesnt hold a candle to it an obviously rushed game to coincide with the world championships if these updates and patches work well then great too many glitches no online friend v friend option etc for the same company yes not a major company who havent a big budget ripstone this is still way behind their pure pool snooker which came out in 2014 especially for gameplay and online play yes this has career mode and all different venues etc hopefully updates can bring on this game because it has potential so can i play as jimmy white in career modehe isnt in the top 128 is he i keep seeing finger prints in the exact same place its annoying so much needs changed if there gonna add finger prints at least do better than a few in the same place brilliant game where is the play against your friends tho the crowd need some work when ever i foul they laugh and its pretty fucking annoying ai players seem to use a rest all the time great review one question how do you change the difficulty and aim assist etc once its set if you want to try it on a harder level cant seem to find any way of doing it great reviewwould love to have the overhead cam and also a 9 ball pool table would be good as wellgonna take a long while to get any good at this gameits quit unforgiving from my first go at it this morningbut thats a good thingim gonna have to adjust how i play and add in more safety shots as i was gung ho and able to slam a red in from pretty much any angle on previous versions of the gameoverall this will keep me happy and coming back for more for some time yet at last been waiting for a review cant find one anywhere disappointment straight away with the career mode not being able to make your own pro for career mode is a turn off for me the ai seem a bit stiff unrealistic shots that players in real life wouldnt risk taking on a lot of patches will be needed 30 sec for shot is suck and the 20 min for game its embarrassing i love play defance and this limited u change that or i ask my money back if i you play as ronnie do you still play him in the course of a tornament hope the answer is yes thanks guys the ai safety has been improved for the pc patch no more roll ups also they actually play for position from what i have seen instead of slow rolling them in is there an option for ronnie to take his shoes off mid match online mode i dont see it in my menus the arenas are empty in career mode too seems pointless licensing them if theyre empty got it on pc but the ps4 controller i use for tgc 2019 doesnt seem to work with it feels weird with mouse so dont want to use that i think its awful theyve missed out some of the basics cant find a practice mode cant restart career and only have referee voiceovers and not an actual referee 410 at best for me played a couple of matches today in career mode and love it finding pro level a little bit hard as highest break was only 35 tempted to change it to amateur and rank up the computer ai to hard do you think that would be wise or to hard pretty confident i can get better breaks on amateur how do u play a friend online a pretty good review but maybe more of a mention towards player likenesses and rest usage all players appearing to be 6ft 6 plus slim build and in a lot of cases barely recognisable using rests and extensions in unrealistic positions is another one and one that is very unlikely to change ball potting sounds too are very weak but at least they are patchable only had a couple of matches so far as im working nights but im impressed its not easy either on the pro aiming setting which should make it interesting online which im yet to try as i couldnt connect on the ps4 this afternoon very fair review nicely articulated as well mark selby has a glitch playing every shot with a rest he took a shot standing in the audience seats it was hilarious thanks for the review joe and the preview videos the last couple weeks even from over here across the pond in the us we are excited for the new snooker game a few thoughts that i havent seen mentioned elsewhere not sure if im just missing a few of these in the ui or they could possibly be future additions no instant replay ive hit some cracking pots and cant seem to find any place to view or even capture the action cant seem to have 2 active careers going at the same time id like to fire up a ronnie run but also start plugging away with a rising star would i lose my progress on the same psn account in career mode i cant seem to find any where to view the current tournaments bracket or draw would be nice to know who i am looking ahead to play against and perhaps track some of the other matches in the event player progression it would be nice to collect some sort of currency or xp to then progress various aspects of the players game i realize t good review yes the ai touching ball thing really needs addressing but apart from that the game is great i just wish they would get rid of the white screen after every shotnot pleasing on the eyesrather have it black like it did before the patch great video id give the gameplay a solid 810 im in the the riga masters final vs ding im 21 up first to 4 watched mcgill win 7 frames on the spin vs milkins he had a childs tantrum throwing his chalk on the floor loving the judgement day coverage cant wait to play this tomorrow i wonder will the developers allow us to create multi players and our own tournament down the road is there a practice table or something like that great kind of analysis of you mate appreciate it and really like the game so far i am sure i am going to buy it as well this game is annoying asf when glitches and bugs make you lose games i had the ai in a snooker they missed 3 timed the frame was mines and then it just continued on with the game to anyone whos played it yet can the white flash between shots be turned off or toned down thanks what a cracking review all very well summed up i agree with many of your sentiments cracking job cap well im proud of myself just made an 84 break against james cahill in the riga masters qualifiers im playing as ronnie so its only really what youd expect but im happy nonetheless great review and youtuber love this game from the few hours ive played now on xbox one the minor bugs like commentary and animation are really forgivable the only issue i have had and i would appreciate if anyone could tell me if they have had this issue is that i cannot seem to get in to online matches at all on the xbox one the game keeps telling me unable to connect to online and it is not my connection as others games work perfect may be worth letting developers know about this issue on xbox one issue cheers really insightful review will purchase it today so basically its still in beta then im enjoying the game just dont pick or play against selby as he plays every shot with the rest sound and ai needs fixing to as does the rest through cushion glitch but other than that its great really impressed with the gameplay but few sound effects and most of the commentary need improving they really shouldve used the bbc team i hope your right man i love snooker the ai now plays proper safety shots steam pc version it got released at v105 and so i think once the console versions are patched to v105 the ai safety play will patched in to be fixed then are the ai positional play no backspin applied around the black and pink spots always trying the unrealistic heavy sidespin to make the white ball move in line with the next target object ball and also the annoying choice of playing a yellow and green long shot and ignoring the obvious nearby black pink or blue so anyway to updateai safety shots are fixed great video joe probably your best ever video spoken wise 10points definite buying good review man reasonable priced too imo this game is great it just needs to be balanced out a lot they need to listen to the community and our feedback they need to fix bugs and glitches the speed of the balls the graphics of the players and there animations also this is something ive noticed and its probably no big deal but if its a licensed snooker game the table should look how they do on tv and i noticed the spots on the table havent been finished its like someone was in the middle of drawing them in and stopped go have a look at the spots on the table and you will see what i mean also my players hands started glowing bright pink its the weirdest thing ive seen in a video game especially a snooker game that needs fixed so much needs fixed if they fix everything we will have a perfect snooker game very good video im looking to get it on pc if its available i noticed on the psn store that this game only has a onestar user rating is there something wrong with the ps4 version going to buy it now thanks for the review and all your little mini matches in my opinion i think the timer online is really annoying i wish they would have different online modes for the hardcore fans who dont mind waiting a few minutes for someone to take a shot ive only played a few games online cause im finding it hard finding any and the ones i have played ive not had much time to either make a decision or finish a game before the timer is up why cant we just have a mode for the timer and a mode for pro snooker i dunno its just my thoughts i bought snooker 19 today just finish istalling it a good review on the game apart for the few fixes and it will be great game great reviewim loving it as wellits fantastic to finally have a good snooker game and hopefully with a bit of patching it will be greatjust started my career with matthew stevenshoping to get him back in the big time is there a statistic after each match like the older ones preordered on amazon expected delivery day may 29th what a joke order cancelled great review keep up the good work bro if the season of professionals in real life is over and a new one starts will the top 128 be updated in the upcoming 20192020 season good video joe personally im loving it at the moment only thing i can think needs to be added apart from the little things like safeties is creating your own player but im perfectly happy with it at the moment good opinions made decision am buying it on monday the split screen to show all the games did it for me really so much better im cant get a match online is anyone else having this problem this should have been included from the start as a practice mode has that hendry game been binned playing cricket captain 19 on my channel any recommendations to me this dlc would result in much hair pulling lol i think these could be very addictive especially since it comes on instantly on restart looks ok i enjoy the game too much still to need it at present anyway some of the challenges look sort of thing do once never again i like these challenges joe and you could do a series on them rip off inch perfect on the orange that last one you have to pot the red in bottom corner then cannon into the lower red of 3 2 of them will then plant into the middle bags i made a 147 on master plus last week been chasing it for ages that long black 225 is how steve davis saw his shot in the 85 black ball final when in reality it was over the pocket did you get the dlc free swerve the white in to the pink ball i think i am going to get it looks good wow this looks fun i cant play online is anyone else having this problem early can anybody help me i have snooker 19 and i started my career mode but i have a issue my players do not shake hands before the match anyone know how to sort it out please im so dissapointed for this game graphics are average more like ps3 game but thats not all my ps4 console gets loud as hell so i just dont wanna start this game never again im just wondering how on earth can anybody play as noisy console as ps4 pro is some games are quieter than others but you just dont know before you buy it and test it is it worth it 528 wheres the red going excellent commentary you could be a real snooker announcer wny is it when i line up the shot perfectly it misses ever freaking time how do you have such low brightness when i play the table is lt up very brightly and i cant see the aim assist does it matter what pro or rising star you use in terms of attributes is this on ps4 loads of glitches this game needs a update also online needs the game timer turned off also change to play more than 1 frame we need john virgo on commentary wheres the cue ball going shocking ronnie lost n out mark williams is the dark horse now n shocking wont let his kids say gd luck to his dad from the boss of snooker n staff etc wow that cpu safety shot really spoils the game they need too address that b4 anything else looking forward to getting this on pay day love a snooker game on console whats your highest break so far why daniel wells play like judd trump can we not create our own player worse game ive played i remember jimmy whites whirlwind snooker on amiga and u cud fast forward the cpu miss that feature what difficulty are you playing on and what aim you using do you get the win if people disconnect online i hope so as that has killed all other previous versions for me quick question ive not heard too much about this game but with career mode can you create your own character and go through career with him instead of choosing one of the pros look like a game that came out 10 year ago like really should the characters animations look this bad in2019 hi joe are you playing on hard level thanks tony is this game also 4 mac processor or is it running only 4 windows have you got any shot power tipsreally struggling with hitting everything too hard great content but im sorry to say you have zero sense about snooker use your experience from tournaments how do you walk around the table on ps4 i love your commentary wellthat was just terrible cueing decent chance to take the opening frame here lol its great i looked up the ps4 trophies for this game and having to win 50 online games record no of world championships and get a 147 sounds too difficult but im too big a snooker fan to not get this and i thought i was bad youve give me hope thanks been away for the week so time to watch all your career mode vids keep it up lad great vids mate love snooker ive hit that like and sub button hopefully il see more this game looks amazing does it include the snooker shootout tournament that could be fun how do you get the free cam at 2608 where is crack can i use a mouse or joystick to perform a cue stroke the idea of power bar is only for those who know little about snooker and is not suitable for advanced players in real game cue speed back swing follow through etc are important elements in cue ball control i might buy this game and do a career mode on it great part 1 and great review too you must be playing more snooker than some of the pros at the moment 9 years in the waiting and this snooker 19 is absolute trash nowhere near as good as previous ones released theres no create a character nothing this game is sooooooooo poor they shouldnt have bothered creating a new one or at least take it to someone who knows how to make games properly cant believe how let down i have been by this graphically its poor gameplay is poor the whole setup is poor what an absolute waste played 5 mins turned it off and wont be returning to it 9 years since last snooker release and this is the best they can come up with seriously mugged off proper cracking first career video nice to see wells giving you a good challenge but some brilliant shots played by both players lift off is certainly confirmed game looks decent enough but the ai plays some really strange shots love this mate you should do a young pro career too work your way up with wonderkid need to work on your positional shot quite bad lol brought the game based on career mode disappointed to learn that you have to use a registered player and cant make up a player to start seems a poor design choice to be honest think ill refund and await a patch that may never come world snooker must be disappointed by this offering neil w fellow geordie here i want this game but not until they fix the ai a bit great content mate so tempted to buy this tonight is the ai op in regards to never missing or do you get the occasional chance like real life snooker i made my first 147 today in the new trailer today you can hear when a player hit the ball harder it made a thud sound im very curious to know if they will patch the fact that when you play a power shot it sounds like youve played the shot dead weight lol loving the game so far though love the passion this guy has for snooker keep those vids coming dude how do we send a invite code to invite a friend to a gameplease answer fast we trying to join now online on steam please help you online great vid bite the bulletgot the game on pc and i must say its very addictive must say its the best fully official licensed snooker game todate can u pls do 147 maximum break can u try that will follow this im playing as james cahill and won my riga qualifer 21 v judd trump had to double the final black to win using amateur aim though but medium difficulty and medium match length keep it going man are they going to feature john virgos commentary in the future i miss his wheres the cue ball goin trademark phrase dennis would be good too please no ken doherty though i really wish they didnt start you out at 0 ranking trophies when you pick a player like ronnie or higgins who have 30 plus this game looks like its from 2001 the graphics look really shit your reviews are great love your geordie accent too gonna follow real closely great timing too seeing as the wcs are just around the corner keep up the great reviews i had this on pre order from amazon i looked today and it says itll arrive may 7th this looks really good delighted to see the full tournament schedule i just wish i hadnt ordered via amazon i fucking love this series got the game today got to say im enjoying it other than the pockets they seem overly tight even when the aiming aid is in the centre they need to improve on that can you compare the physics to virtual pool 4 snooker mode because the graphics are simmilar to wsc 09 and thus the physics in this game must be near to perfection if im gonna buy it choosing ronnie is nothing more that activating the cheat mode great vid looks pleasing to the eye but the physics are way off and why was your opponent using the rest from 14 way up the table gameplay seems poor better off with flash snooker on fb much more realistic action the close ups look so realistic but ai is really bad and theyre getting rest out for shots when they really dont need it i do like that comps have the proper frame distances is there anyway of changing my aiming aids after ive started my career i cant seem to find a way to do it ive started a career on medium ai difficulty can i change it to hard during a season or do i need to start a new one still no release for pc they have delayed the release they said hope too have it resolved soon might end up being tomorrow my guess lot of ppl mad on steam right now im sure this series will bang for you mate this game doesnt look like my cup of tea but youre quite the snooker buff so im sure you love it apologies if you say this in the video but what difficulty are you playing on shame you cant change difficultly atm from what ive seen i want to start on medium but then i might be wanting to play on hard after a few tournaments the ai just pots the ball doesnt actually play for positional play seems ill wait for them to sort all these things before i buy for pc he failed can you play friends the graphics are definitely at least disappointing wow looks really bad does ronnie play with both hands in this game we have to waite for pc virson is late coming out at 2pm just so you know you can press start and return to the main menu and it will save the progress of the match when you return in career mode so no need feel pressure to finish those super long matches can you change the match length during a career mode cannot wait for 2 then i can get it does career last more than 1 season how long if so nice upload jim been waiting for a quality video before buying thanks i really like the look of this game jim youre not bad either been watching you a lot on the golf slso nice i do like a bit of snooker cant wait to see some more where is referee putting the balls back even the god damn ps1 games had a referee i love the game but the tournaments is messed up 128th in qualifying you play the top players where for qualifying you should be facing lower ranked opponents like real life till you play final qualifier top 16 should auto be in the first round great vid jim would definitely watch them if you do more i know the game has many issues but for a small outfit i think theyve done a good job im sure more patches will be out what is disappointing is them getting some of the rules wrong especially considering its endorsed by world snookerim john higgins in my career and 13 wins 2 losses highest break 107 which was one ive done with regards character creation apparently its in the works what does the stars mean on the trophy cabinet can anyone tell me please i first watch you on twitch and you are grate might get this game after seeing all this content youve been doing looks like a good chill out gamebtw 1st frame if the aim was to leave as many balls over the pockets youd be world number 1 this game just looks and sounds terrible good luck with this actually makes it look more realistic if your youngster doesnt immediately jump out and win riga i would stick to amateur settings until you get to grips with the game hahahaha 899 subs 1000 wont be long chinny keep up the great content o7 from beast to car guy aka veterangamersuk well my prayers have been answered sorry i didnt catch the stream but its just as good as a video how are you finding it so far really need to get rid of white screen on every shothad to turn down my brightness it was hurting my eyes after awhile steven hallworth is actually an amateur at the moment so only qualified for 2 tournaments this season i reckon youll be able to top that chinny at least you got a frame against murphy i got to the riga masters final with judd trump after beating daniel wellsmark king mark williams ronnie in the quarters a massive 54 comeback to beat higgins in the semi an then to only get whitewashed 50 but shaun superhuman murphy in the final as he potted absolutely everything on the table from every angle possible literally never missed a pot in the 5 frames but i mean this game is brilliant cant stop playing it i was just flicking between the snooker on tv snooker 19 it switched to the top down camera angle i moved my analogue stick to line up my shot when i realised i was still watching the real life snooker oops apparently i cant control the real life mark selby with my ps4 controller one day though mark one day i love the game but do you think they will put crowds in the seats its really bugging me they should be there its nice having all the different venues but the need people in them glad you have started this series link to the patch notes here httpswwwredditcomrsnooker19commentsdy6f8vupdate114practicetableavailablenowutmmediumandroidapputmsourceshare they need to update the crowd and fill it up on the main mode also i got to my first final an realised there was no announcer for the players comin out lol they need to fix that also u can only move the white they should create a new mode called hes looking at the plant show side spin thats all just snooker no pool pfft not for me then im not sure which is better pool nation fx or this im a massive snooker fan and i couldnt wait for this game to be released i bought it and i hate it pure pool snooker is a way better game but hardly has any content the new stephen hendry game will trump this one murphy wishes he was that skinny well i watched this to see the controls which the video succeeded in doing however i would suggest you look up the rules of snooker your break needs to hit a red ball and pretty soft at that this is not 8 ball or 9 ball then when it is your turn again you hit a red then a color and repeat there are plenty of videos on youtube teaching the rules in about ten minutes you dont seem to understand the rules of snooker very well this was painful to watch wow this game is very goodi love playing billiards i might buy this game ps4 pro is supposed to look superior over one x which is a joke microsoft need to act on game devs who dont optimise properly the one x should walk itquite clearly its another sony payoff microsoft are waaay toooo tight to invest in takin the advantage and tip things in their favour hhmm so the xbox online does work after all thought there was a tournament mode added as per decieving titlethere should be by now one frame isnt enough please i need your help the time mucks it up if you had carry on good come back the timer should not be there its a joke great game been playing it for a couple of months now why never play indian open carnt get on with this games no reply 2011 wos better then this one that neet to scrap it and start again do you play on pc u do realise u needed about 8 snookers at end yeh a new rivalry for a new season haha if you liked this then think about having a gander through my social media and get yourself on my patreon httpwwwpatreoncomkimblejustice ive had one major frustration in playing this game and its that there is no ball trajectory for when you play a cue ball off the cushion rather than a ball and this is needed for when youre playing safety shots not all of us are reallife snooker experts who know exactly what part of the cushion to hit and how much side to use in order to nestle the cue ball up to the pack some of us need a bit of help 200 the toasties is actually a thing ive done that at a club while playing snooker and thought it was completely random brits can be confusing still cue club 2000 is so far best ever snooker pool game of all time a 19 years old game is still unbeatable i think the better question is does the commentator ever say wheres the cue ball going i know next to nothing about snooker but i love ronnie osullivan because hes a major jeremy corbyn supporter i also love your videos and that jazzy ace attorney remix jc4pm bernietulsi2020 amlo socialismorbarbarism so how does it play on the consoles if you know that is similar to the pc version learn to talk or get someone else to do it for you so the commentary is exactly like real life so its a decent first attempt but iill be expecting a lot more from snooker 20 you seriously dont have a voice for voice overs even the shitty computer generated voice over is a million times better than listening to you dont give up the vids but you really need to give up the talking its embarrassing or should i say in a prepubescent voice embawwasing this game looks as unfinished as your sex change i was hoping under older players you would mention way weawdon thankfully you didnt show the bbc micro version of snooker by a company called acornsoft from back in the early 1980s it was dreadful but i still used to play it my highest break on it was 28 that was some achievement believe me i am a snooker fan and i think the players are almost there but i think i saw stuart bingham in there as well a a couple of the other players and to be fair they really need to accurately portray those players theyve put on a few pounds year on year but those players looked almost slim beyond belief i used to love jimmy whites whirlwind snooker and jw2 cueball and i have played virtual snooker all on the pc but i havent played a more modern version since those i really do hope they sort out all the issues and allow us to set up our own profiles before i consider buying it great review thanks just for that intro alone is worth a sub and a like have you ever played virtual pool series from celeris in vp you can play snooker too i was hopeing to play with quinten hann so sad hes not in there d nostalgia nerd brought me here balls do not move correctly look as if under water lot of hype about the ai needs some tweaks on the pace of the balls for those people watching in black and white the green ball is behind the blue what would you say is the best ps3 snooker game kim if youd paid 30 for this instead of being given a copy itd be a different review i reckon everything about this game is 310 if that awful complete waste of money another great vid kim damn jimmy whites whirlwind snooker was so addictive i dread to think how many hours of my life that have gone on that game if you dont mind the lack of a function to change career mode settings once started the rubbish break building of the ai the lack of a save function in quick match modewhats the point of a best of 35 if you cant save the lack of a tournament draw in career mode the lack of any stats the crazy ai rest shots from inappropriate positions and the lack of a function to skip all ai shots then its worth buying its a real shame that theres so many problems because it has the potential to be an excellent game it just feels unfinished despite all the patches kiss off the pink tight up behind the brown oh wait free ball great review kim agree on all points that intro filled me with joy when the price drops i think ill grab this its a shame wsc 2005 doesnt work on windows 10 that was a high watermark in snooker games this has potential but needs more in the game to justify the 30 price tag its so unfinishedi dont see why they havent made the small add ons to make it so much better now all we need is a decent cricket game given the last decent cricket game was 2010 i was contemplating buying this but struggled to find an honest review ive now found one great review im going to purchase the price point its been released at matches the quality also its a snooker game on the current gen nostalgia nerd sent me thanks for the review nostalgia nerd sent me here really well made video if youre here after watching my video hello if youre here before watching my video hello also kim nice video the graphics look quite poor could be a great game though just weird cause for such small games compared to assassins creed for example it is weird to not have good graphics its the reason driving games look amazing thanks for the review i like a good cue game spent many many hours on cue club on the pc many years ago although cc was better for pool im going to have to invest in this one great review as a fan of snooker i think you brought up some very good points and i hope the devs take your feedback on board hi kim i really enjoy watching your videos the rise and fall of peter moyineux was particularly interesting because i still play syndicate and dungeon keeper these are really great recently i started playing the trail and i can only assume that peter molyneux has gone soft in his old age i mean there is no mayhem or carnage no humour or zaniness just a dull plod along the trail collecting items crafting trading repeat however i will persevere to the 15 km mark in hopes that it will get better after that i hope they release an update where there is a night cycle illuminated by the full moon and the camp fire and you can lay in wait behind a tree and threaten another traveler with your axe and steal all their possessions a few wererabbits and vampireraccoons wouldnt hurt either how about it peter pretty please it was you who said that evil is good its all gone back to snooker games we played in 80s and 90s with all the misgivings that fans spotted in these games at the timethe creators know thisand the game is to attract new players of these games who will demand more featuresthe creator will oblige up to the next releaseand the fans will buy the improved versionbut fans will notice things that were missed and the creator promises new features for version 3 etc etc etcand the money keeps rolling in nothing wrong with that i suppose but those of us who went through all of that and paid through all of that in the past do expect to see much more progressbut its going in reverse commentators eye now im just waiting to hear your thoughts on the sonic trailer if like cue sports virtual pool has the most accurate physics by far but you cant argue with jimmy whitessteve davis snooker i still own both of them for my amiga500 didnt know you were a snooker fan ive been a lifelong fan and play quite often at a local place great review shame about the absence of a practice mode which as you say is needed really so its not just me whosuspects there mightbe someveryinteresting things hidingunderneath martin goulds patio snooker 2005 and 2007 on the psp are better as is virtual snooker or virtual pool 3 if youre hard pressed if the balls dont pull funny faces if im idle for a minute or so im not interested p also i have a close relative whos ranked about 65 in the world so i assume hes in the game d edit 228 oh wait there he is oh and thats a bad miss not available for nintendo switch yet well have to wait until later this spring as per a recent tweet from the snooker 19 twitter page its great like and bought it on launch but the computerai can pot some insane balls that are like yea no chance wish theyd sort that but its a solid 810 for me best ever snooker game since jimmy whites whirlwind on the amiga might pick this up sounds alright the ultra sinister martin gould i really want to try this game on ps4 the one and only snooker game ive ever played is jimmy whytes whirlwind snooker it was fantastic for a halfprice title it looks impressive im sure with more resources at their disposal it would be the perfect snooker game aaaand thats a baaad missss sorry someone had to say it great video nice review great to see a new snooker game but mmm nah no custom character wtf i cant play without being my own custom john virgo complete with comedy whiteguy afro anyone know which tv programme the music at the start is from i think its a kids school programme from my youthbut aint sure no ball game has really got my attention since the superb arcade pool by team 17 kim kim kim the best pool sports game is and has been for years virtual pool 4 for pc also on steam if you havent played it you owe it to yourself to have a go if you just failed to mention it tsk tsk thirtysomething different pool games to choose from including caroms and snooker several venues campaign and hustler mode and loads more i havent tried 19 yet but i tell you this they have very big shoes to fill if they are going to surpass the mighty vp4 733 whats with the weird ball physics on the white it suddenly speeds up and then back down maybe ill consider buying it if theres a jan verhaas dlc like a lot of us fans ive been looking forward to a new snooker game for years seems like a good attempt shame the graphics for the players look at best rubbish poor animation as well if your after a new snooker game then beggars cant be choosers thanks for the review kim theres meant to be a stephen hendry fronted game out soon too do i have to play 1 through 18 to catch up with the story not gonna lie i saw this on psn the other day and thought it looked mince i think ill stick with jimmy whites whirlwind snooker on my amiga ultra sinister martin gould great review kim ive been waiting for a decent snooker game for a very long time im definitely going buy this as the last snooker game i played was world championship snooker on the ps1 the easy pink or the hard brown may pick this up on switch great review 5 slapheads werent happy the balls shine appropriately kim justice 2019 hey kim not sure if you read these but the music intro is that 4forschools its something from my childhood but i cant place it anyway peace love your content kid whilst not a licensed snooker game this is snooker is a far better polished snooker experience the graphics does matterand if you feel that the game is fine as it isthen you dont care much for progress and perfection of a game that shouldnt be too difficult to look good its only a game so put up a real good fight i dont think i have played a snooker game since championship 3d snooker on my c64 virtual pool 3 beats pretty much every snooker game hands down this looks about as good as the most recent snooker games point choose power and hitvp3 seems to be the only game that you feel like your controlling the cue be interested to see if this is any good been a while since there was a decent stand alone snooker or pool game rockstargta minigames aside which to be fair are pretty decent for what they are graphics are underwhelming though its 2019 and all this game has to do is emulate a game of snooker it should be photorealistic at this point considering that other indie games look incredible these days let alone aa aaa slightly off topic but i finally played the 360 version of table tennis game by rockstar and what a brilliant game it is too also ive always been an archer mclean fan since the amiga days when it comes to pool and snooker are u good buddies with mj and fixit i love this game i think it has so much potential hope it keeps improving think ill stick with lunar pool on the nes i ve never seen ronnie that fucked up its a good gameand looks like youre watching it on the tele as youre playing itdont like the bright white swipe effect after every shot though how do u get different clothing small table and big balls and no room to shoot anything passed anything do you know how many seasons you get this looks awful i play vp4 and still havent played a better snooker game graphic is the main point in a game i request to u guys update your graphics just not to if range am sorry still this game lacks some kind of optimation my ps4 pro gets noisy as hell nobody wants to play next to helicopter great patch nice to see that the interior of the holes are now lighten because before the patch they were pitch black it isnt only a graphics improvement but most significantly a gameplay improvement because now aiming the holes especially the middle ones have more depth and are more clear to discern my congrats to the team for supporting this excellent snooker game and making a big step forward improving the game further can you create your own player for the career yet is this ps4 bout time they added a new update thought theyd just abandened ship the ai difficulty is noticeably better now even on medium difficulty multiplayer connection is still shit anyone else have this problem 1700 didnt notice when i playedthats great lol 1420great example of improved gameplay on pro how can u say thumbs up on the update on the basis of a 10 minute game they still havent fixed the lack of a save option in quick match mode who has the time to play best of 35 the ball physics of the white remain very poor magical shots are still possible because the white is unrealistically receptive to all kinds of spin the fact this game is marketed as a simulation would be laughable if it didnt cost so much pro too easy pro too difficult the aiming aid offers no help at all on this new pro level havent played the game in a couple of weeks but the lighting change is massive game looks so much more colourful still not able to change length of match for random online games thanks for watching have a great day still playing this game of the year how do points work in the online tournament please can you help how does the points work in the online mirror championships thanks if you can help games sort of crap tbh no cue ball landing zone even on easy the ai pots everything start a young star and face top 10 every time no ref on screen at all world championship snooker 07 still best to date just sent you a friend request as i have purchased this game and would like a match at some point psn khalyhoblou good video iv played a few games how do i fresh start without uninstall it i think this game is way to hard if you want a serious challenge you have the option definitely in this game but for someone like me that has always watched snooker but never actually played the game it was way to hard and very infuriating i have already smashed a controller 2 days in great video mate am planning on buying tomorrow hope it will take me time to get used to do you have to use the power bar isnt there a setting for free hand cueing i cant stand snooker or pool games when you have to use power bars hes playing the safety here im not x1000 also could you do a vid on how to break off without messing up so everytime i come to break its shambolic im probably crap at this game but for some reason im being paired against top ten players in career mode when ive first start career on rising star mode easy difficulty should make it bit easier but doesnt feel very easy lol great video jason just bought this game after watching its really good even though im terrible at the moment lol just wish they would add player creation in career to be able to play as yourself against the pros would make this perfect hope they do i a future update guy got no cue ball controll but helpful video help me please i dont play online why how do i play 2 player with my m8 im playing ken dorothy in an exhibition pooping my pants i really enjoy playing this game but the online options are absolutely shocking i can understand a shot clock in ranking matches but surely 45 secs would have been much more sensible and the fact you cannot turn this off when playing friends is ridiculous also the 20 min time limit for a frame even in ranking matches is absolute bollox there should also be options to play best of 3 or more frames when playing friends is it any better on pc you on ps4 bro try hitting triangle that lets you go into recon mode where you can zoom around to see if certain shots go hi thanks for the video does this game have a colour blind setting great great gameiwatch in 199091 parot and hendry thinking of getting this but then found out there is no practice mode what would you suggest is the best way to practice do u still play xbox i forgot if u said i bought this game on the ps 4 and what a shame no birdseye view a lot the old ones are the best singer games this was a waste of money been waiting many years for one to come out and this is what we get shocking so am i right in thinking you cant create a new player in career mode the aiming tool is crap brought snooker 19 on xbox one release date i an very confident that the game will be patched during year my suggestions to the developers 1create player options race height weight hair colour a absolute must in career mode 2must include player stats pottingsafety play pressure and so on 3must show where the cue ball will finish will help the novice to compile breaks 4must slow down the ball movement the cue is not easy to control because of this 5must include old retired players or past matches optional steve davies alex higgins cliff thorburn kirk stephensdennis taylor is the there any performance differences between consoles you only get 20mins online thats it when comes to end they stop the game when your close to winning as well is there an overhead cam veiw for when lining up a shot if not it needs it im enjoying this but for me wsc 11 was the best snooker game released and this is so close but not exactly there the two big issues i found was the judgement of power even simple shots to get on a black for example can be hard to judge as sometimes u do 20 shot then end up on cushion with a hard aim shot to do too hard and be in top final 3rd of table the big thing they missed here on wsc 11 the actually showed u where the ball was gonna end up that was a big thing and was enjoyable to try get breaks but its more in hope now of getting a break rather than knowing u r best advice i can give is try keep shots in straight potting for slighty left or rights cuts and wider shots its pretty much pot luck good game but something simple is just holding the game back if this can be fixed in a patch then be a great game hope this helps guys the game is shite and is whats wrong with todays gaming industries unfinished alpha released game are not the way forward and the names are taken from the year 2000 2999 for early access is terrible anyone watching this ignore the negative comments about the game being poor game is well worth the asking price 2599 on amazon the game is not perfect and the table runs a little bit fast but i am sure the game with be patched during the yearthe most important gameplay element is cue ball physics and they are spot on7 out 10 nice vid i havnt been able to connect online yet are there any known issues jason for each cpu player do they have different attributes as in most sports games for example individual ratings for potting safety cue ball control etc or are the band of top players ie top 20 all the same attributewise pure pool looks graphically better and seems to have better controls than this title as tempted as i may have been now that ive seen it im not so excited anymore just going to give you a sub and like to how do you even invite a friend on this game online needs sorting 20mins for a game i can understand the shot timer with all the peter ebdons in this world but the match should go until the last black has been sunk not gonna lie mate its a broken gameive never seen so many bugs in a game before question remains why release a broken game not worth 2999 at all and i love snooker at the best of times how could this be possible a 10 year snooker game better than thisworld snooker championship is so much better could not wait for this and just begin to play it today with some simple games awesome hope we can play online with friends if it isnt psvr compatible it isnt worth chalking your cue colour banding is horrific and im watching on an oled screen the ai now plays proper safety shots steam pc version it got released at v105 and so i think once the console versions are patched to v105 the ai safety play will patched in to be fixed then are the ai positional play no backspin applied around the black and pink spots always trying the unrealistic heavy sidespin to make the white ball move in line with the next target object ball and also the annoying choice of playing a yellow and green long shot and ignoring the obvious nearby black pink or blue so anyway to updateai safety shots are fixed what the fuck is a snooker and why do you weird ass europeans always have to give normal things such goofy fucking names how can you play online keeps coining up match making unavailable a lot to remember im getting this 2morrow i have this on ps4 j so im certainly down for a few frames against you im enjoying it so far like you said a few little things need tweaking any news on truck driver man im so gutted you cant create youre own player i was really looking forward to building up attributes and really getting that starting from scratch feeling really disappointing having to do career as a real player only has anyone played online yet i will definitely be getting this on pc it be a good game to chillout and relax to after coming home from night shift wasnt even aware of this coming love snooker so ill definitely grab this one on ps4 thanks for the video jase and nice cheeky blue in the middle jason just woke up and came straight to this dont know about jimmy white more like john virgo with that trick shot to finish lol cant wait to have a match with you buzzing for this game so glad they have made it for next gen used to love playing wsc 11 i thought you were going to have a well deserved rest for a week love to see a good work ethic bless you short summary of the ai long balls too much of the good break too bad saftys just roll and come out of the snooker is not synonymous also often the wrong decision is made what the next ball would be that quite difficult shot on the blue you missed then potted only jase lmao i knew you liked playing with ur balls m8 cheers for the video jason looks good hope you stream the game on twitch soon havent played snooker on a pc since jimmy whites whirlwind snooker back in 91 looks like things havent changed much hahah i must say though played that sport bar vr pool and snooker on steam and thats fucking realistic as hell especially if you have something to lean on the same height as the table nice fluke on the blue thanks for the vid this game is amazing just need a patch to fix the ai safety play finally pocket potter has a game to match the name good video too difficult for me but ill be watching your streams on twitch nice vid m8 but im not sold on this my phone has better graphics than this game nice looks great online as you say will be a laugh any idea when its release date is for those watching in black and white buy a new tv what is your highest break so far mine is collar bone give me a hell yeah good video i think we need a new pdc darts game for ps4 darts games were sick on ps3 and ps2 my advice to you is learn how to play safe youll thank me later i have one question why is a bo25a one table setup the sound is ruined gonna be tough to come back from this position tough session joe it will need some sort of comeback could u do a cricket 19 career mode pls is it worth buying it and is it easy or does it just look easy how to you play cut shots especially with the aiming bit shame theres no pool option like the previous games would be nice to have some marker zone for where the cue ball will finish after a shot at least for amateurwerent all ronnie osullivan its out on xbox now come guys make a player creator i want to play as myself all the old games had why not now why does this look much better for ps4 then xbox onehave the cue through hand and white glare on everything been fixed if you are a snooker fan this game is the best ever period now they have fixed the safety play with the ai you can have amazing safety battles with them what an absolute peach of a gamelove it also love the channel and videos my fellow geordie captaingoodspeed is it possible to change the match length when you are already in a career because i cant find it anywhere i dislike how these days developers just rush the game out half done and then release 10 patches in the next few months the safety play looks cracking now great stuff onwards upwards i think the players lack cue power i find it really hard to move the cue ball around the table at times its like the players arent getting through the ball correctly add me as a friend ill give ya a game im living in america have to work round the time difference though brilliant good to see the devs working hard to improve the game now they need to improve the ball sounds theyre too quiet and just dont sound like the way they do in real life they also need to add pocket sound effects currently every shot sounds like youve potted it in dead weight even if you smash it in so they need to add that satisfying thud sound the atmosphere looks to have slightly improved with the audience clapping when you pot in a long red but they have to react to misses fouls safety battles etc good start though hope to see many more patches at this rate this game could be almost perfect within a month or 2 if you choose to start in the lower career level do you work up to the pro tour and can you alter skill level during a career played all evening after the patch and my goodness it has revolutionised the gameplay its terrific whatever anybody says about graphics etc this game is excellent the gameplay is great now the ai is getting sorted out what more can you say brilliant is there an opportunity to play against other humans online if so is there a leaderboard for it is there any where to report bugs in career mode played 2 qualifiers for tournaments and played same opponent then in the 1st round of comps got the same opponent again when is it released for xbox i was gonna ask what other fixes did the patch cover does the patch happen automatically or is there something i need to do to make it work the white screen flash after every shot is annoying fantastic theyve fixed that so quick good stuff ayy i use the spiderman theme on my ps4 i love it does anybody think it stutters im running a gtx 1060 6gb card yes fantastic that theyve already released another patch hopefully the issue with using the rest at times when its not needed apart from the issues im loving the game i need a lot of practice though before i even think about career mode thank god for the patch really enjoying the game now plenty of work to do still but its going the right way now picked calvin for my career im likings him lots keep the vids coming captain and thank you for the replies up aways brilliant just got my copy this morning im playing easy opponents atm so i can spend more time at the tableusing pro aiming cause i really dont want to drop down to amateur great game still potting near impossible shots tho even on medium difficulty that i play with on career mode so fucking frustrating to watch them pot from all kind of angles and positions any idea when xbox patch will be released im really enjoying the game but theres one issue im finding hard to understand they didnt pick up and thats the cue elevation its limited to 20 degrees which is just useless it should be limited to 20 degrees when the cueball is somewhere in the centre to adhere to the one foot down rule but when the cueball is on or near the rail the cue elevation should be up to around 75 degrees or so as this is realistic and true to life how can we attempt a shot like the legendary jimmy white masse if the game wont allow you to do it with more elevation ofcourse there should be massive risk of miscue and perhaps a rather fast shot slider to increase the likelyhood of messing it up but for me it needs to be there whats your view on this sweet great news gonna buy this now thanks for the info will we be getting create a player option for career mode does anyone know why in when you play an online tournament frame win say you get 16 pointsranking points for that frameif in the next matchframe if you lose you go back to 0 points the game is much better after patch 102 can you stop rambling on so much and let us listen to the in game audio the commentary the sounds of the balls when they hit etc good video captain keep steering this ship my go to channel for snooker 19 whats the loud fans running in the background lol nice vid i have a big issue thoughi cant connect online havnt been able to since launch are there any known issues balls still running on to much really could do with tweaking that a bit good patch but dude you really need to open up and give your ps4 a good clean out that thing is loud is also such a patch for the xbox one they just need to make adjustments to the ais aggressive potting and rolling in full table length pots for me to be completely happy with the ai side of the game they just take on a few too many unrealistic pots where a safety shot would be the normal shot for someone to play have the sound of the pockets on harder shots been fixed pal hoping the old xbox patch hits soon thinking of holding off on playing until then loving the game however some of the slow roll ups are killing me had one of those with ken doherty earlier on in a riga masters qualifier where he ended up giving up the frame after three fouls when he could see the ball at 811 selby still using the rest in stupid positions lol we want episode 4 of career mode i havent played this since launch have they increased the speed of the table looks like it love to see you have a crack at master plus you would appreciate how much better it makes the game give it a season and i think you would be competing well enough for some great viewing this is my latest match at master plus i always seem to be involved in last frame deciders had to play well to win this making two 100 along the way httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmpkosawpxqt3329s i think members of the audience who all ow their phones to ring during matches should be required to leave the venue for the remainder of the match there is really no excuse for leaving them on this on xbox nice win joe same problem as always 128th ranked player in the game pots every ball when they are supposed to be worst ai player on game is this an april fools players moving like meth addicts with third degree burns is this a joke why are potatoes taking the shots they should not have rushed it they should have given it another year to polish it the game animations and graphics just look unfinished beat animations of all the time takes a hell of a lot more than a little graphical polish to make a good game seriously hope they changed the gameplay from wsc real 11 far too easy to hit 147s near enough every visit using the cue ball cam with a big line heading straight to the pocket and a tiny black mark showing exactly where the cue ball would land wow i have been waiting for this for a long time it doesnt look a million miles away from jimmy whites snooker on the old commodore amiga the players look like crowd members in fifa 2000 well this looks awful from the boring commentary to terrible graphics should be ashamed looks like graphics from the dreamcast console better than 8 ball pool ronny looks displeased good but graphics seems from ps2 cant think of anything more boring when is it out for ps4 well it looks terrible but hopefully it plays well youd think the graphics would be better considering its for ps4 and were in 2019 lawn bowls 2019 next please ea it will be very hard to beat shooterspool game which is by far the best pool and snooker game now best physics and graphics any pool ever had see for yourself is this in vr or just the ps1 mode vr compatible it better be 240p in a 4k world disappointing shocking graphics april fools wsc real 09 has better graphics wow a lots changed since jimmy whites whirlwind snooker the characters getting down looks awkward as fuxk does it got any of them ranking points mate dont care about graphics if the gameplay is awesome in the words of ronnie all about the review scores mate finally ps1 graphics honestly whos buying this finally shouldve used the bbc commentary team as long as you dont get the ai doing full length of the table screw backs off the cushions ill play it horrible graphics but if the engines good and the career mode deep and realistic i certainly wont mind ronnie osullivan has left the chat cant wait for this add me on ps4 for online matches does anyone know if this is coming out on pc graphics seems unreal poor and terrible are we really in 2019 the cueist seem like robots and animations lool amateur this is the world championship snooker intro on the ps1 wheres the new snooker 19 intro i really like the look of this game and cant wait to buy it i have liked snooker titles since they first came out and we all need a proper ps4 snooker title this is the ps2 footage when will you show ps4 no it cant beat 8 ball pool thats free to play some of the worst animations ive seen graphics look rough but i can forgive that if its 60fps not that impressed cuttingedge motion capture technology from fifa 97 the last one i played was in 2009 im getting it regardless the graphics looking the same as they did back then good game in the first see releasing on mobile i dont know how they can make a profit selling games like this no offence to anyone who enjoys snooker anyone who saw ronnies 1000th century live where is the video i play on amateur aiming match difficulty easy and match length medium on career mode and its fun but still a decent challenge in my personal opinion especially considering i have to play most video games with one hand due to my cerebral palsy this game is surprisingly addictive great episode mate looking forward to this series unluck to not win that frame on the black keep up the great work glens just gone on holiday so ill just ping a comment up here a very niche game here so we dont really expect a huge response but for you fans that asked here it is happy gaming mark the game is complete trash i think this is a great gamei miss a great pool game on the switch but can get my kicks playing the 10 red quick fire game or the speed snooker this game takes me back to old snooker game i use to play on the original xbox by code masters and after getting use to the controls i think its a cracking game a big thumbs up from me the graphics are good and game play is sharp and i just got my highest break of 72 lol an the best bit i just got it on sale on the e shop so i am very happy this christmas great game its sucked up hours of my time in career mode very relaxing to play and with only a few faults that dont really dent the enjoyment if youre into snooker games its a must have bankshot billiards 2 for xbox 360 was the best that on switch would be awesome snooker loopy when it gets a discount looks decent again nice review brothers keep on gaming much love dan this is not for me but lots of different games on the console is always a good thing hopefully fans pick it up im sure it would be great for long commutes the graphics look good reminds me of when i was waiting for my dad to finish watching snooker on a sunday so i could watch my cartoons my god the hurry up comments get on my last nerve its literally every shot ride the snooker reall welldone review that being said the games a bit overcomplicated for my liking i wish there was a pool mode i think this would be harder for me to learn compared to other genre then again i were never a fan of simulator sport games because how complicated those can be im more into simple and pick up arcade style back then like nba jam great review keep it up ok but i didnt ask for this i asked for a decent golf game pleeeeeease i bet this is well hard this could be the best game ever made but i still wouldnt pick it up i have never seen the point in sports games if you want to play snooker get down the local snooker hall an play it well covered review all the same nice one i appreciate the continued reviews of niche and obscure games despite the fact that they probably wont garner much attention the dedication shows i love playing pool or billiards i tried snooker while i was in the uk but the table was just so massive either way this game looks to have some high quality visuals being from the states i always wanted to know how tf u play snooker it is similar to fifa and nba unless u love these games in real life u will get bored easily great work glen waiting ur next video cheers there was a time when you would be able to spend your earnings in career mode on different quality cues table themes and even waistcoats this game seems alright not a fan myself but the proper licensing gives it a few extra points in my eyes nice stuff glen i love how these reviews are basically video versions of console mags of old god i miss them keep up the good work will pick this game up as i love snooker you know youre getting old when you dont recognise any of the top players in a sport lol bring back ray reardon steve davis alex higgins and joe davis love the snooker had plenty of the games down years i stopped when they started trying to microtransaction different types of chalk and cues on ps3 i dunno about anyone but i dont care about real life players i just want to customize a player with silly costumes and good gameplay i dont see the point in playing this theres always a pub close enough where you can go and play the same goes for bowling or darts for example to each their own i guess good review anyway enjoy your holidays never heard of snooker but one my favorite cookies is snookerdoodle ive always loved billiards games i dont know the rules of snooker this has my interest oh nice this will be great to just chill and play with your mates local wireless mark the character models are bloody awful i remember an advert for this coming on and i watched it purely for the laughs not a big fan so ill skip this great review as always glen and marks approach to reviewing games is so different i think its what makes the channel mark has a softly softly approach to bringing up bad things about a game where as glen sounds like he couldnt care less who he might offend haha im still trying to get to know your personalities ladsim probably wrong but it just feels that way to me id rather a darts game one hundred and eightyyyyy 128 characters any chicks no motion controls no peace super mario party spoiled me lol sucks pros dont feel different guessing no trick shots like uncle phil lol i love pool games but this one isnt fun enough for me ill wait until i see something that is more unique and not so boring lol i have never heard of this game until now so thanks for teaching me something i do know that i know nothing of this real game and its history in the gaming industry but for a new sport entering the game industry they should learn what soccer football or football football or baseball games have evolved since their early days the commentary aspects should get better it seems they spent all of their development resources on the table mechanics and physics and everything else just sort of secondary the next round should see improvements in the character animations as well as the commentary but if i remember correctly even tiger woods golf commentary although they were very famous golf announcers were lacking and full of oneliners maybe its a product of the sport i do agree that a game that looks like it is a fully mental game accurate commentary based on the completely randomized table would be difficult to do the commentary would probably just happen in obvious cas i want jimmy whites whirlwind snooker and archer macleans pool dont need 150 pros and rooms sweet been looking for a good snooker game to play for ages i played this on pc when it released mainly because im a big snooker fan and it was released alongside the world championships on the tv a very good snooker game but lacking some real features i seem to remember the switch version was meant to be released a few weeks after the pc version unfortunately i played it for a few weeks after release and havent touched it since ive seen various updates come in via steam but the lack of features is still an issue for me its interesting to me that theres a 20 minute timer which is being patched because the pc version had issues online with timers all of which were extended in a later patch after release the gameplay was top notch the graphics of the table and the balls were awesome but some animations were poor the lighting was okay though they improved this in patches it lacked a create a player mode which was an issue for a lot of peopleyou only have to look at some steam reviews the lack of a practice mode annoyed s thanks for the review that being said this just isnt for me not my kinda of game but very detailed and informative review as im only a casual snooker fanplayer myself it definitely would of been nice if theyd made the game more approachable still though it looks like itd be a fun evening with a good mate and a couple of beers took so long for this to port also i recommend not using joycons with this if you have the dreaded drifting joystick its a break killer otherwise i think its a great game for any snooker fan 1 view 2 likes and only my comment this is weird ive never been this early before what are those lines after every shot in the game thanks jj this was a surprisingly interesting video where is the cue ball going is it in i hope so can you play actual regular pool on this or no ya need to make cut scene for players lifting trophy also intro scenes would be great as a updatefantastic game best snooker game to date really so hype can you play as eddie charlton simply stunningmy switch has been waiting a long time for this this is what your middleaged overweight beerdrinking father plays when youre not playing doom eternal trump was chalking his cue that animation aint in the console version but guessing it will be added in the upcoming update also finally you can move the cue ball before breaking off its really good to see the devs listening and trying to make the game immersive by consistently adding things currently its lacking when it comes to immersion and atmosphere but theyre getting there cant wait for the console update im not that good on pool i tried it on wii play but failed definitely getting this going to pre order this right now boom i dont understand why this game took so long to get onto switch compared to the ps4 and xbox one considering its release was during the world championships 3 month ago and now getting released on switch here in august it doesnt make sense i mean come on its not a massively demanding game is it nor does it look like it has had any changes im snookered if i play as ronnie o sullivan will i be able to tell the ref to get his eyes checked this is gonna confuse plenty of international viewers please tell me the commentators will say oh and thats a bad miss on missed shots i used to be a huge fan of snooker back in the 90s but ive sadly lost interest in the sport over the years this game does look pretty interesting though the camera shots are very faithful to the real thing i might just add this to my eshop watch list this is a bit of a weird but kind of interesting exclusive commentary exciting stuff is it available now im not sophisticated enough for this game and their snooker selection screen anyone wanna play a snooker flash game i love snooker and will get this once i finally buy a switch looking really good just a bit of a visual sharpness downgrade from the xbox obviously but thankfully performance looks spot on looking forward to making plenty of content on this one for my channel i might pick this up just because i never understood the rules of snooker and this could be an easy gateway the game i never asked for and never going to play nice seems like getting games for this will be a nightmare judging by these comments nintndo switch players do not like sports games and if they do theyd rather play then on a console that their friends are on with good online infrastructure i have this game on ps4 love playing online is it cross play easy to find games on ps4 but switch wont be imo to give you guys the tldr rundown on this game snooker is like pool but played on a much bigger table this video which does a good explanation about how snooker works its rule set httpsyoutubecjswutkupqo whats a snooker those player models are crap if its cheap it seems interesting but if they want full retail price no way um what is snooker everytime i click on a nintendo life video i expect hearing hello there lovely people its so weird not hearing alex eventhough its only temporarily i have never been more excited for a game in my life inb4 all the missing being called lovely comments is this an out of season april fools joke should i get this game is it hard we believe you captain the game really needs to have a call frame option if you hit the final black and where the opponent clearly cant win it just forces me to either play the black or foul on purpose assuming the foul wont allow the opponent to win if the opponent pots pink and wins the frame i just find myself doing concede frame since you obviously cant play for snookers on the black per the official rules although in theory you can if the diff is 7 points since white ball foul also maybe its just me but the ai break offs seem to be very consistent all top 16 players will play the same kind of break off shot and everyone else will play thinly off bottom red and only open out the cluster slightly slightly similar for ai getting out of snookers but it always seems to play it too hard and leaving you in an aside that thing you had with the opponent playing an obvious end of break shot happens to me so much and it makes no sense i even have many instances of the ai rea why is there no board up in the arena like in real life this early into the world championship tournament on this game frustrating missed out the little things that make a big difference would be epic to hear fake snooker noises on the other side now and again and to have board up in the middle give it the proper crucible feel in game great to see you back with a cracking hour plus video really looked forward to this cant wait to get the game dechawat poomjaeng should be in the game massive balls up excuse the pun every round of the worlds is two table set up until the semi finals big fail here by the game designers been waiting for this its hard to keep the concentration levels up on long frame matches joe they obviously did not find enough funding to polish this game a decent effort and there have been updates since its initial release i hope it has improved and that they earned enough money to keep developing and improving the game graphics are very dated and humanoid animations really are not necessary i like the two training paths and curvature line for the white ball other than that this is underwhelming virtual pool 4 steam is now old but looks better than this and it does have a comprehensive snooker feature as well as much better camera movement and options plus the physics can be finely adjusted and are reasonably good but not perfect i love the new snooker game amazing graphics this game is unacceptable and an embarrassment for the producers to release this mess with all the corners cutvery poor image to portray even if they can so called patch things up this day and age to be able to charge 25 for a product it is a joke to have so many imperfectionsif it was an item of clothing it would be classed as a reject item hard to believe this is a next gen game it looks like it was made for ps2 disappointing particularly the players sounds so enthusiastic about the exciting world of snooker 19 xd got this game on xbox onetheres a 2 second delay on cue deliverythought it was just mebut watched other gameplay on xbox one and its the samesound seems to be spot on ps4they really need to sort this outreally off puttingball goes in the pocket then you hear the cue delivery no overhad cam you have look at the table from a birds view wtf wait at 1155 he says move the camera forwards didnt see that in tutorial or in settings controls edit actually you click with left mouse to go to an almost overhead view then you can go back to the previous view with backspace talk about clunky pc port clunky free cam with holding q and wasd or arrows together on pc you cant use the mouse alone for operating in the menu often you are forced to press enter or backspace at random places no aa everything has jagged lines like its super low res graphics is outdated players lifeless and all move the same way flow is really slow and clunky with no way to skip ai moves quicker cant speed up your own turn gotta wait for those slow balls to completely stop in career cant find a way to just end it to start a new one ie if you selected a too high difficulty and wanna take it slowly by starting over i can only find skip event snooker nation championship 2016 looks much better good vid i cant connect to online any ideas still carom3d was a much better experience both for billiard and snooker snooker nation championship an indie game is far more better and accurate than this i dont give a flying fuck about the graphics if the mechanics are good ill definitely buy it this is garbagge shooters pool is better in all the ways i was disappointed that there is no create a player option it seems like if you select a pre existing player all their stats get wiped would much rather have been able to create my own player and rise through the rankings safety doesnt seem important either from the gameplay that i have seen the ai either pots from anywhere on the table or plays silly little roll up safety shots i only heard of this game a few days ago and have it on my wishlist on steam but the more i see the less interested i am in buying it its scheduled for the 17th of april on steam really not sure i will buy it despite waiting so long for a snooker game i was kind of hoping that if there was ever another one made it would be really in depth maybe having things like pressure and stamina playing a role so as you start out in your career and play bigger events or longer matches the aiming could be a little harder or something but as you progress youre able to handle the pressure more and mai i dont see where the skill in this would come from why did they not choose to use mouse speed and accuracy or joystick of course to judge how good the shot is like the golf club does it essentially this is basically just miniclips 8ball pool but for snooker anyone whose interested in this game should be looking into virtual pool 4 10x better of a game with a real skill cap aswell is it ps4 exclusive looks to much like a cartoon the snooker nation game is a better contrast of colours and only 150 on the store is bill werbeniuk in this game best snooker game is cue club that annoying screen after every shot is pretty bad lab42 hope its gone in the final build i cant play this game if thats in game its so annoying jesus people love a moan this should be a mobile game you cant walk around the table lots of comments about graphic quality here just wondering if the youtube compression has anything to do with it snookers just about the ultimate game for close detail 520 anyone else notice the rest is placed through the cushion i was kinda looking forward to this until this video i was disappointed when the developer stated they were offered numerous things in order to help with the development of the game and they flat out turned most of it down like the most basic essential is surely a real life full table in order to study every part of it in detail this is how you get the little details right and kind of pisses me off to know they turned that down because of space make the damn space rent a lot for a few days get the table built play on it feel it throw the balls around figure out how temperatures effect the table and how the balls roll differently implement it into the game its so clear heart and soul is not being put into the game when you settle for the basics and dont do it justice i imagine we can turn the commentary off but if its clearly terrible why not just leave it out entirely as a developer id rather my game be marked down on having no commentary than absolutely terrible comme player is on the black and the commentator says hes attempting a plant i think that cant be good 452 it looks wank wsc 2009 was better than this wank those graphics would be disappointing on a ps3 in 2019 theyre unforgivable oh dear thats going to be shite it looks like it was designed in 2002 finally there hasnt been one since 2011 i think im definitely buying it it was such a brilliant game to play on the playstation are there any spectators making any noise hi guys do you know if this will have crossplatform online multiplayer unsure which platform to pick it up on and would prioritise platform with most likelihood of larger online community thanks is snooker 19 gonna be available in the us because im looking to pre order it and i cant find it anywhere on ps4 i also noticed on the tweet they posted it only had euro and pound prices is it going be on xbox one is steve davis in the game looks pretty nice reminds me of the wsc 2015 which i used to play hours every day cant wait to buy this gem looks lit cant wait i think if they just put raytracing into this thing it would look mint the physics are friggin epic how much does this cost at release this looks great i can see myself playing this a lot graphics and animations looks horrible 454 what plant 648 the rest goes through the cushion alrighty then used toreally like the old wsc games ive played on those tables in real life and the lighting on the table is nowhere near good enough the way the balls come off the cushion doesnt look natural either credit to them though it looks like theyve captured thepace of the table whichis excellent and something almost every other snooker game has been unable to do i dont know about ps4 pc players but on xb1 its going to be 30overall it looks good value wheni consider i paid 40 for the wsc games butlooks terrible when i consider i paid less than 2 for snooker nation will it be available for android dear oh dear just as i feared snooker fans if you want a real snooker experience then it has to be shooters pool this looks exactly like i thought it would look dreadful shut up and take my money really excited for this not much of a progress in terms of graphics compared to wsc2009 that im still playing on my pc also i would like to see presumable position where the white ball will stop looks decent im up for a new snooker game i hope it has virtual pool 3 style mouse control its one of the games i have had installed longest about 8 years until windows 10 finally broke it how about mouse control i would really like a successor to the old dos game virtual snooker with that control scheme cheers for subscribing what are your thoughts of the game so far hey dan i am currently doing a career with kyren wilson just finding time to post videos of the career mode and some online matches is proving a bit difficult but im doing the best i can to stream everyday nice video just got the game funny on my home table i make centurys yet on this game i cant make a fifty break subbed and liked would like to see a full career are you doing one keep thinking is he going to get this 1 in surely he cant then i remembered its in the title of the vid how do you get so much back spin mate you make this game look so easy when i hit a ball aiming it straight in the pocket it doesnt always go in any tips you or someone can give me the minecraft update inspired it great break mate nothing better than getting this achievement done it once but once is enough early still looking for a 130 what button did u press using fast foward they have put this in but cant fix where the ai put the cue through the colour when you snooker them very poor sold my game again disappointing not sure if it will be possible but the ai needs reworking that 8th frame was so bizarre the obvious shot was pot the blue and cannon the reds and to make it even worse he could apparently see a red but tried to hit it by going off the cushion and gave you the frame but i still love playing the game despite the ai being a bit dumb i watch all of your snooker videos keep em coming can add stuff that should have already been in the game but cant fix the tour championship trophy oof well done joe you smashed it im impressed with the update im still loving all your content on your channel and you should be super proud of yourself havent played in months but hoped that one of these patches would finally fix the magic side phenomenonbut its still there a real pity they just cant be bothered to do it its almost like being able to place the cue ball by hand on every shot two great comebacks great match joe 1410 i like how you turned a horrible glitch in the game into a front page headline lol everybody is raving about this update but its just added things that should have been in the game from the very start theyve changed the shade of the balls to be more shiny and the white is brilliant white prefer how they were originally a small detail but sometimes the length of time it takes the ref to say the score call fouls and when players breaking off is way too long one time it was 25 secs before he called foul actually thought itd crashed lol plz could i get a shoutout plz do a long england cricket captain 20 career mode when it comes out love your channel the problem i have with the aiming aids is that they can tell you roughly where your cue ball is going when playing a straight shot but if youre trying to bank your cue ball off two cushions to get out of a tight snooker youre on your own no way to accurately judge those shots unless you have plenty of experience beforehand in either real snooker or a similar computer game it just feels like a bad oversight on the part of the developers this is the worst game ive ever played nice little video there just wanted to say as politely as possible try to cut out the amount of errrs you use each sentence edit them out or plan out what you want to say will make it much easier to listen to what you have to say do you ever change the power spin most of time i watch you leave it with what it sets you up with hi joe im playing career on hard mode but the top players dont seem to miss a ball whe you play the good players would u recommend medium level or is that to easy thanks joe so with pro aiming aid you get to see how far the cue ball will travel as well as the direction but then master takes them both away there should be a difficulty in between where you still get the direction of the cue ball but not how far it will travel so you have to judge power how can one play 2 player without going online cheers for this vid even easier to understand being a fellow geordie just wish there was a cueball landing zone like on world championship snooker i find im over running my shots which is a bit of a sod when doing safety shots subscribed i find it difficult to judge where the cue ball will finish as the white line only shows direction not distance and the power gauge doesnt seem to help much also no top down view makes lining up shots very difficult i often aim and it looks as if its bang on to pocket but wobbles in the jaws and does not drop would prefer a position indicator like snooker nationon easier level at least im going to try snooker nation championship see if its any better ill let you know if i was new to snooker this game would be absolutely useless it does not even tell you what colour youre on another snooker games in the past you would have a ball in the corner with a colour so you knew what you was on i know it should be obvious to people with common knowledge could you do a video showing how applying spin to the ball helps with position the balls stop very late which is very annoying seems as if they are playing on ice well explained there captain cracking comparison explanation just bought and played this game graphics are lush especially up close controls are fun and addictive no online working yet though so not sure if theres a private lobby hope so just one downertheres an annoying white flash as you see in the video after a player has taken a shotif they can get rid of that its great from watching videos it looks like the ai pot some ridiculous shots always same with snooker these type of games you want realism but you dont want an infuriating experience too for anyone who would like this game there is something similar on android called snooker stars ive played over 4000 matches on it the physics is on point thank you for this i played it on master at first thinking i was a g learnt quickly i am getting my hands on snooker 19 today cant waite to play it my self all day today great video love your content i was pleasantly surprised to hear the crowd reacting to when you missed hitting the blue they should be able to react like that when you miss long pots like they do in real life and if you miss an absolute sitter they should react similarly but louder would add some much needed life to the game visuals are sound just the gameplay needs improving should be getting my copy tomorrow would like the option of actually cueing the shot in firstperson view by pulling back on the analogue stick or something like the snooker nation controls hey mate just want to say a huge thanks for all this snooker content as a snooker fan ive spent ages looking for a youtuber like you that does snooker gaming as i used to be a fifa lover but that game is dead i love your upload schedule too with different games going simultaneously even though i dont watch anything else other than your snooker stuff i admire how you operate on youtube and i think youre very underrated and deserve more likes and views compared to the mgh who you might know his channel is on the down whereas you is on the up keep up the snooker content mate im gonna be around your channel for all snooker 19 videos and im glad they will be daily i love your dedication and im glad you picked to do a career with my all time favourite snooker player ronnie osullivan ive grown up watching him and im still a fan today little suggestion maybe at some point you could do a career with elliot slessor i was fascinated by the fact youve played him and hes beate is the difficulty level locked based on rankings or can you change it they really need to sort the ai shot selection out you dont realise how helpful this is can you customize the players im not a fan of that purple on ronnie another great videomany thanks i think the fan noise is kinda the games fault i have a pro as well and certain games cause it to spike division 2 beta caused it and its not as bad now same in fallout 76 in certain places the fan would sound like a jet engine something to do with memory leak i believe i think its great how they allow you to have amateur aiming aidswhile playing against hard ai my main concern is the poor safety shots by the ai especially long they just seem to try and creep it up but it always ends up giving you a shot other than that looks like a solid game thanks for sharing appreciate you uploading these for us to take a look and for your knowledgeable feedback thumbsup i love snooker i play snooker on a regular basis that safety shot the computer does at the end as mark selby ruins the game for me i been watching all your game play vids and its the same the ai is poor and u fortunately i wont be buying it although it may be good online so lol is the career one year is there a positional aid like in 2011 helped massively to learn power and get used to spin and stuff i really like the cone effect on pro and above its so much better than the old games where you only have a perfect aim or no aim at all i really like the thought thats gone into this game and cant wait to try it i look forward to seeing if its affected by using a lowly ranked player in career mode amateur online the loser will be who breaks off in a couple of weeks when players get used to it use pro loving al the content your putting out mate cant wait to get my copy tomorrow from what ive seen on your channel the ai just seem to roll up for safetys do you think thatll be patched out eventually im gonna use pro as it will be more challenging than amateur amateur for me because i can hardly see and am terrible at video games but i really like them sooo i think my favorite is amateur aid so it will be potted easier in quick match do you have to set it to the harder difficulties for the higher ranked player ill have to have on amateur mainly because im blind as a bat lol first alan mcmanus career hi mate how are u doing today i am playing my first final soon can anybody help me i have snooker 19 and i started my career mode but i have a issue my players do not shake hands before the match anyone know how to sort it out please what levels do u play on di you know how the points work on tournament leaderboard i had 30 then 0 then next game 18 whats going on please help doing my head in thanks cannot wait for the final session come on joe 5235 hahahahahahha where is that fucking ball going p your not the best at the game but that makes it more entertaining that u play it on a hard aiming aid wheres the next cricket19 episode so they have the animation of chalking the cuebut not a walk on absolutely stupid how the ai play for snookers get the snooker and then concede some of the ais decisions are ridiculous hopefully they will fix it in the future great play and great vid made what a win good comeback joe never really got into this game but when i watch your videos it makes want to start playing it again merry xmas class some positional shots in the last frame you played when i try it goes so wrong i find all these snooker videos very satisfying merry christmas a great win for you joe its the kind of comeback we would expect from ronnie directly haha now its time to push on and win the title i am not actually that scared of kyren wilson nowadays as i mentioned before the ai isnt that great now on hard what seems to matter is how you play so the less openings you leave the ai the more chance it will make a mistake and leave you in to clear the table i managed to defeat ronnie myself in the german masters qf 54 to me and defeated kyren in the sf 51 now building a decent lead against mark williams in the final which is a pretty regular thing for me actually but the ai is definitely biased towards only clearing up if you leave it a chance to do so mark selby missing reds and colours randomly plus going out of position are all the symptoms ive observed of the 115 patch and it allowed you to beat him d an amazing victory now lets get that trophy they need to introduce replays and pot stats best series on youtube this love it you really must love comebacks is it updated version or somthin snooker 19 i played last time didnt look that good graphically 10713 another chair noise i think you saw that winning post before it evan started lol took wilson for granted if you concentrate you will win easy i wish i had high end pc game is all about momentum what a session tough game ahead fighting hard great performance do you rate the online play i read you can only play one game per visit love you videos been watching since last year getting this game myself tomorrow in post after watching your vids give me a add on ps4 if you wanna game go easy on me though psn beano2007 can we choose how many frames to play online thanks i wonder if anyone has managed a 147 without guidelines yet brilliant attempt overall id never even get close i played someone online today they broke up i thought i played a good safety shot and left nothing on but my opponent could get through to a red and made a 75 break so i only had one shot i nearly made a 50 break yesterday but did human vs human im slowly getting there but miss too many blacks which cost me dearly online tournament great stuff mate so gutting you couldnt get on to the yellow keep it up sure you will get the magic 147 soon they need to add at least 10 seconds to the shot timer and maybe 10 minutes to the match countdown noooo gutted youll have to give me a lesson though 150 how do you move the camera around to have a look whats available good video man im just pissed off i cant play online on xbox i just find it ridiculous that they brought it out half broke theres no excuse for it that was bloody brilliant ughh yeah the side killed it superb mate well played so hard to do streaming too you are definitely much better than when you started keep going anyone help wont connect me to online games very unlucky bloody hello your good my highest break is 8 online line wish there were a better online community as it keeps saying finding opponent great effortits a brilliant game im gutted though because i cant connect to the online service ive heard theres a bug i see youve managed to connect though so dont understand it maybe i should reinstall it iv got a 127 in real life playing you right now lol 356 i think hes going for the snooker behind the pink ball haha good commentator its only a bloody game what is that white screen flash after each shot this is very irritating how do you play against a friend on this ps4 theres no invite options all i can do is set a code is that aiming aid amateur just had a similar decent attempt at a 147 myself got 15 reds 14 blacks bang on the last black tryd to force it up the table with a stun run through because i was too scared to play it with top and get a shit angle i potted the black but didnt get the reaction and snookered myself behind the black dont feel bad about not getting it you want to have the goal to beat your highest break every time you play if you get a 147 when the game has just come out youll get bored sooner because you wont have a goal look forward to them improving this in 2007 unlucky there mate but a fantastic effort well played great effort next time wow that was as tense as the real thing great attempt and so unlucky if only the yellow had been on its spot it would of been perfect position great effort it will happen very hard luck great effort thought the yellow was going to wriggle in somewhere i hope your opponent stayed to watch just played the ps4 version after todays patch and its like night and day ai now plays proper safety and more intelligent shots the selby playing every shot with a rest has gone as has the rest going through the cushion as far as i can see also the crowd seem a lot more involved im actually impressed with what they have done with one patch unlucky joe that was a close one unlucky mate also the dev team are looking for everyones feedback and ideas for the game so tweet them so we get a perfect snooker game i think my highest break is about 33 which aint bad for me how do you move the camera whilst on the shot 115 im on pc thoughthanks in advance console version looks a lot easier than the pc version if you can get hold of a copy of the pc game it is available on torrents if you do not want to purchase the game again and make a comparison might sound silly but is there a practise table that you can go on gutter great effort though hopefully they extend the timer for the frame and match timer for the live tournaments and get rid of it it completely for unranked games do we know yet the difference between finishing in the gold silver and bronze tiers id guess that you get more rewards for say gold compared to bronze but i havent seen them explain it at all so hopefully they will soon i believe you get 16 points for a win as i played one ranked game and my opponent disconnected so i got the win and i think im on 16 points cant confirm as i cant get back in and the patch hasnt hit xbox yet is anyone able to get into an online match it just keeps saying unable to connect connection timed out playing on xbox ok so online tournaments are just 1 frame matches and a leaderboard so if you lose you can still play more games in the same tournament is that right couple of inches made all the difference superb effort thiugh would you say this is the best snooker game youve ever played mate u are playing so well i just cant even win a frame the game is pretty hard ggs i wish i could score that well haha when you snookered yourself on the yellow and decided to belt it i was sat there like attention all pockets this could go anywhere correct me if im wrong but it look like you nearly got the yellow on a cross double on camera it looks as if played with a little less pace it could have dropped youre probably going to hate me for saying that now sorryjoe greateffort so close still at least on camera its your first century i just got one in the first frame ive played today a 130 against gary wilson great effort at least you can console yourself that it wasnt a final black ken doherty 147 failure unlucky great effort this game is absolute trash soooo bad new patch on ps4 just now ai safety fixed imagine coming home from a long day and you want to relax so you load up snooker 19 and you come up against captaingoodspeed brilliant effort just like real life the great players make it look easy you genuinely sound devastated stop beating yourself up it will happen i got a 147 on career mode wooo it was scary im in second place at the moment great break youve improved miles since losing 2 frames to wells unlucky mate very good attempt couldnt stop laughing at his escapes on that snooker lol happy new year buddy this game is so addictive isnt it every time i play williams he plays superb maybe i do something wrong happy new year its there 83 to 98 lool you dont have nothing from the greatest of all times just joking happy 2020 4516 dont know what williams was expecting to happen happy new year joe great content as usall keep it going are you doing a season 3 please reply to me and please do a season 20 close final wouldnt want it any other way happy new year joetypical williams never knows when hes beaten hello is it better to use keyboard and mouse or to use a controller great channel youve inspired me to create my own youtube channel with the way marks been playing it just feels as if the ai will not win unless you give it a chance so just put in 80 breaks and youre almost assured a victory the ai just seems like it has no idea how to play snooker any more some of the shot selections were just this is the kind of thing an amateur player whos just starting out would do not a pro player and do you think they should add a chalking system and kicks as a result of it seems marks playing like on amateur difficulty but ur playing rly well man 4218 5030 very funny20 fouls shud have put him away in that session only win 54 that could come back to bite u happy new year cant wait to see who wins this will be a great final happy new year happy new year to you it was a good year for your channel you deserve all the subs you have have a good 2020 happy new year happy new year ive had my points reset on 5 occasions now no matter how hard i try i cant beat john higgins on this fucking game anyone else no bother but not higgins shame he doesnt decide to throw a few games the match fixing cunt jeez you got lucky joe the game plays brilliantly for you the balls actually sound good and the audio is in sync also noticed that theres no rest glitches aswell really hope they sort out the xbox version its fun to play but the optimzation is piss poor great video as always one bad thing about the game before the opponent takes the shot he calls it a foul or gives it away really enjoying your videos joe looking forward to the rest of this series love your retro game vids too keep up the good work ive got the game yestetday its so hard compared to pure pool snooker well played thatll show old 94 wins hope i can play against you one day currently top 3 in the world another good series youre spoiling us joe lol a twitch stream with this mode would be class joe probably just as well terry griffiths is retired now if this was in real snooker i dont think hed be very good with a 30 second limit p nice one lookin forward to this series how much does snooker 19 cost and is it worth it pls reply captaingoodspeed theyre so quick i thought i was the first one here is there a way to see your average shot time in career mode what a fantastic finale and what level of play congratulations my friend world champion i just made my first maximum break thats great hello joe well done i knew you was going to win i sed that i am so happy for you take care peace and love xx brilliant win that mate have you any tips for the break play all the time but always just roll into the pack because i can never get it right fantastic final really enjoyed watching that have you heard anymore about stephen hendrys this is snooker if the real ronnie osullivan watched this i hope this video would inspire him to be serious and put more passion in snooker again dont play attacking snooker which not mind leaving chances to his opponents amazing match i really thought once williams saved those chances and got to 1517 that there might have been a big twist of fate but you stayed focused and deserved the win congrats classic snooker commenthit and hope and he failed to hit i settled down to watch this with a nice glass of something and was very entertained great final well played joe 330 i think not gratz was a very exciting journey to the final after the hard semi i was sure youd win the trophy 3150 red middle bag key shot and turning point well played joe williams lost it that that session due to pressure early doors form well enjoyed it mate hats off yees we are the champions i felt like i was watching the real world championship from the crucible on eurosport channels brilliant way to win the title comfortable victory against dott but then from 26 to 137 against hawkins from 811 to 1311 against selby from 1215 to 1715 against wilson then controlled the early part of the match but williams showed his class to lead by 1312 after 3 sessions and after losing 2 close frames ronnie made a classic 90 plus break to win the world title congrats cmoooon ronnie number 6 baby those missed pinks and the fluke snooker williams got i could not believe it thought you were doing a choke aka jimmy bless him exhausted watching it need lie down after that i find it strange that ros and mark williams are easily beatable compared to trump selby and a few of the others everytime i draw ronnnie or mark in a final i know its gonna be a cake walkgood win never the less what a steal to make it 1315 i think it absolutely overwhelmed williams and he didnt manage to come back actually i was sure you were going to win 1318 after that but i appreciate williams steal when he needed a snooker to live and you needed just 1 ball to become a world champion imagine him winning the title after that brrr luckily not congrats congratulations mate what an impressive performance are you moving on to master difficulty im loving all the content keep it up well played wish i had half the nerve you did with all those amazing shots one of the best finals ever a crucible classic can we get ronnie over the line of 7 world titles hell yea go on joe well played congrats well done on an amazing win it just goes to show that it does not matter if your season is generally poor you can come to the world championship with very little form and then play some of the best snooker of your life these videos of the wsc pretty much showed that you hadnt had the best of seasons but you still won the top trophy of them all onwards to season 3 eventually you did what a journey its been for your ronnie osullivan carrer mode and well this is the video ive been waiting for and your the best snooker 19 content creator congrats well done on winning the world championship congratulations i just won the world champ with fergal obrien 10345 surely screw for black147 absolutely no one captaingoodspeed and its there 2158 if the red on the right goes to the corner it would be better to play it i think you were too much in a hurry then and later lost the frame thats a nice match though good luck in the last session 11233 thirteen frames to two have you given up on this more frames in each episode please playing down the table after potting the white is a rule sometimes played in pool never in snooker i love snooker even in reality and good luck at the game thanks for watching everyone have a lovely day very little beats the gameplay of wcs2005 its still awesome the table and the physics are perfect and it is like the real thing after that even wcs from codemasters i believe started to get bloated and clunky sadly this does look a bit cartoony i think there are no shadows on the balls or they are not dynamic shadows and reflections that scan as the balls move so it looks plasticy 0947 if you look at the balls closely the shadows do not graduate down the ball there is a little one below and some light reflections almost like the balls are illuminated from the inside on the lighter coloured balls like pink and yellow and cueball of course if you know what i mean just looks weird and odd and puts me off a bit wcs2005 pc were perfectly lit if you search yt for world snooker championship 2005 147 break you will see what i mean and it looks a lot better than that video btw any chance of an xbox giveaway yet great frame there j you potted some brilliant balls the long pink was amazing i must admit i didnt think it was going to go look forward to having some more frames against you in the future nicely played jase i must say i admire your confidencepots his first red lets destroy him lol you played well here sunshine i love this gamei love it so much i even enjoy watching the opposition build a breakwhich doesnt help my statsbut what a cool and relaxing wee game thats the best ive seen you play you made some awesome pots throughout the frame great video and highest break lol absolutely great stuff on your channel mate thought this was a repeathad one titled the pistol before great review ive had this on ps4 since day release is it worth getting on the switch too when u say that controls are sensitive how hard it is to fine tune a shot i mean i played a lot of snooker games on my pc the mouse makes it super easy to aim but when i tried snooker on a ps with a gamepad well a different story moving the aim a fraction to the leftright which was crucial to me was a pain in the ass the ai as you mentioned can get a bit much one match i played ronnie osullivan me vs jimmy white cpu had jimmy aka the whirlwind thinking about a shot one red left straight shot stun for the black perfect angle to go up for the yellow the ai thought about this for so long i got up to get a snack and when i got back the commentators were mugging me off for taking too long fantastic indepth review good review fella look forward to picking this up its as expected for me good review paulif i had a switch i certainly would buy this onebetter than whats on the ipad the game is shit end of story where da funk is snookie from da jurze shore i love snookerdoodles too mmmmmm another good fair review compares well to the xbox version with just a tad rougher visuals due to the normal compromises on shadows and aliasing interestingly i am struggling more with this version that i did the xb one at launch not sure if thats switch specific or just the result of the various patches that have been applied since earlier in the year the controlls do seem just a tad harder this time around overall though ive been playing around with quick matches and 6 reds mode because that fits well into a 20 minutes break rather than a full on tournament match another good addition to the switch but now i really want this is pool to complement this one nah thanks i will wait for this is pool i dont like the look at all and prefer pool over snooker and no i am not american i have to say you are very good at the home nations series especially the welsh open its my birthday today joe in this event ronnies route for the final jamie clarke mark joyce mark king judd trump mark selby mark williams plus the final against john higgins what a hard draw this is bring back rising star i cant get enough of this gameplay by daywatch you in the evening if new videoim about sixth online xboxand highest finish in online tournament been forth nice match as usual the red around 310 never looked in but good attempt anyway thank you cap how you make 2 career modes i dont watch a lot of snooker but isnt qualifying for events like in tennis where the unseeded players go up against each other why would a number 10 player be in qualifying up against someone ranked 125 genuine question just wondered if this game is true to life in that regard unlucky on that game joe i am also finding this game a bit tougher than previous versions james cahills one of my favourite snooker players so hyped for this series keep uploading great content barry hawkins looks more like mark williams while playing do you feel like barrys ai is as difficult as it was when you played against him in the career as ronnie or is it perhaps a bit easier now when you are playing as a rising star it would suck if it was easier like him missing shots that he would normally get on the other career mode since i want to play this career mode when i finally buy this game in a few weeks love the video only thing i would recommend is to turn down the game commentary volume sometimes difficult to hear you ive got to say i love this series already you should try curv shots when your snookered i find it alot easier then going off the cushion some real life snooker on here would be really cool i think yesss been waiting for this brilliant nice video as always how many times a week will u upload rising star episode thank you for this joe i know i moaned about the ronnie o sullivan but this is more my cup of tea will definitely be watching the whole series keep up the great content does anybody else have frame rate issues when a shot plays out i play on ps4 and notice slight stuttering 2018 balls dropping in real time cant wait for this i was under the impression you could only do one career at a time would of liked to see you use someone else like oli lines or upcoming yuan sijun a question for you who do you think would win between a prime alex higgins and ronnie osullivan great idea how do i reset my career difficulty us too easy and cant find how to change it starting all kinds of seriess never clicked so fast question how do u have 2 careers at 1 time they need to add a skill gap where timing is involved to simulate a cue action its too easy to make high breaks they need to add a skill gap no firstperson view this is a quick video no its 26 minutes long thats not quick can u play 2 player with ur brother on same console on this game not sure why anyone would play a snooker video game my advice would be to actually give snooker a go its tough but well worth it the model of players sucks the graphic looks like a game from 2007 not going to buy it absolutely it sucks im not that impressed by this game to be honest there are alot of elements missing i play poolnationfx from 2016 with the snooker add on and it is far better than even this of 2019 main areas that cause me concern are glitchy animations hands disappearing through cushions etc basic animations between shots characters are lifeless empty seats etc commentary is linear and very basic even when i pot beautifully they say miss or in off the camera angles are all wrong the lack of on shot above table view is awful object ball trajectory is terrible that widening aim is not accurate or in any way useful the cue angle and ball spin controls are bad swerve shots are nearly impossible to pull off and ballspin effects are basic multiple cushion escapes from snookers are near impossible with the lack of trajectory assist this needed way more work hopefully stephen hendrys game is much better is this a remastered version of last gen looks pants and i love snooker just make it reasonably priced graphics are terrible anyone know the xbox one install size for this seen some footage of shaun murphy at the developers trying the game out and it looks pretty goodgot it on pre order so looking forward o playing itgraphically it doesnt look much different from the last one a few years ago but its snooker so its good enough for me is this on the ps2 personally i was most disappointed to hear the developers didnt grab every opportunity with both hands and go with it for example when the guy said world snooker offered them a fully built table they turned it down due to space but what kind of developers are we talking about here if they cant lease a lot for a few days in order to snatch the hands off world snooker and be able to study a real table first hand play on it get a feel for it see how different temperatures can make a difference to the way it plays does a warmer room cause more kicks etc etc and implement this into the game for added authenticity im not feeling the passion and the want to do the best job they can when they simply flat out refuse the chance to take these things its like world snooker were throwing everything at them in order to ensure they had the best they could get to make the game and the devs were like no were cool we got this this really kind of annoys me i mean look i dont make games it looks awful i play a snooker on my iphone which looks better than this shit hey guys this is just a quick video 26 minutes ps2 graphics plenty of people talking down the graphics how many shades of green do you want to see that annoying screen after every shot is pretty bad fuck the grafics i play wcs 09 until today i needed this game nice ive been waiting quite a while for a good snooker game as i can only function with one hand because of a massive stroke i had 8 years ago i was 38 when it happened anyway this looks pretty good except for the players animations which look a little blocky other than that looks ok i especially like the action cam that i think tries to show shots as if youre watching it on tv good to know former codemasters developers worked on this game so even more promising thanks for the upload just in time for the world championships too is there an official release date for the game hopefully they have a link in the main menu that allows fans to watch live snooker around the world at any time that would be a great add on last one of these i played was about 2008 or 2009 i thinkgraphis are not much better still gonna play it tho if theres isnt a ranking system in online games i will not be getting this a ranking system not an xp system like bronze silver gold platinum diamond or whatever they want to call the ranks as long as the best players are recognized as such looks like an xbox 360 game totally not good enough for this generation cant wait to not pay 50 quid for this 15 quid next year and ill pick it up snooker star have better graphics and gameplay wtf is this characters look dreadful hope its good to play i dont understand why some people want it in vr its like darts to me i have this game on xbox 360 thats very relaxing to sit down and play if i want to throw real darts i can just do that vr is something in between needs more work but ill be buying anyway because i want better and improved snooker games in the future looks pretty well but virtual pool 4 is much much much better game this is awful the app snooker stars is way better just stream it to ya telly its the absolute dogs the graphics on snooker stars is better too it doesnt look as good as pure pools snooker but ill be buying it anyway this is snooker will be a far superior game for those looking for a proper snooker sim looks like a decent ps2 game at best i seriously hope that shot taking is not just a pull back push thru thing as that is useless pure pool and snooker nation play like that and are awful as you cannot judge the power at all the wcs games were great with the button press for taking a shot having been waiting quite a number of years for a new snooker simulation game and only going by this video this is my take graphics dreadful 2019 4k advanced gaming consoles should be producing better graphics in my opinion this really looks like a beta version or at best an android game grand turismo forza fifa are just some simulation games that truly have you immersed and put you in the car or on the pitch with realism this game graphically is shocking no walkons no ref terrible commentary terrible no fans in the arena why physics dont look spot on and im pretty sure murphy wasnt being serious when he said that this game could be used as a training tool player animations are emotionless no talk of achievement awards or customising your own player numerous other negatives but i truly dont mean to bash i was so hopeful when this was announced and i just feel let down by the final product this truly should have been a near masterpiec sorry but snooker stars on android is more realistic than this will be interesting to see how this is snooker compares im sure the the core gameplay will be ok but this really looks no different to the snooker games i played back on ps2 the graphics on players really should have improved by now in this age of 4k gaming the reason no one has made snooker games in the last 9 years is because nobody buys them after seeing this game visuals look terrible and the animation is from ps2 era i dont blame them for this as they probably wouldnt have the money to create a big fifa like quality and not just that you wouldnt put the development time huge team and money when it produces such a small yield one could argue that itll sell big in china im not sure as piracy is massive there to add the ball movement does not look good to me it doesnt appear to roll but slide at a low framerate ive played those older world snooker games and this looks very similar the way you live up your shots and how the cue ball line changes its as if they got the old game and slightly improved the visuals and updated the roster 14 months in development i bet 13 months of that was acquiring licenses cant imagine the gameplay and carear mode being any fun and i dont want to mention commentary why is the switch game coming out later the snooker game on the app store has better graphics than this i thought i was watching wsc real 09 tbh this looks absolutely shit pure poolsnooker is better than this let down 1303 that alone should tell you that this game needs more work why do the balls keep on rolling and rolling i managed to play it and to speed up the shots it was rt and i think spin was holding down the rt while looking down the cue power was mapped to the right stick controls were a bit different to what other snooker games are like but it didnt seem anything too drastic what do you mean why is marco on the quick play why cant he love watching snooker and cant wait to play this i hope the game does well so we get a series that they can refine as they go the table look too clean l remember the real snooker 2009 there is a litte chalk on the table too on the live view but that version it hard to play each turn i think snooker 2004 gameplay is better 2009 graphic is better by the way im not sure it from the same company or not but i think this version is look so fun easy but realistic i want to keep looking for the more graphic 8 ball pool by miniclip the best ps4 graphics graphics look like the same as the old one on ps2 lol this is not even close to snooker everyone who ever held the cue knows it you can enjoy game with fine graphic maybe you can learn some rules and how this game works maybe will help it grow snooker as a sport but you can never ever make realistic snooker as a game this game is just beyond of known technology of making games is this for the iphone not too fussed about graphics but why are they so awful for a 2019 sports game wheres the ref respotting the balls cant believe ive only just realized the old snooker games had the refs the graphics on this look like a ps2 game bloody awful ill stick to snooker stars on android the graphics look like ps2 quality can anyone help me out wheres the best place to pre order this game with a better chance of getting it delivered early game amazon lemme kno from your past experiences thanks wowthis is fantastic news bout time we got a desent snooker game is this for xbox graphic quality world championship snooker 2004 codemasters is better need this in vr with a cue and your dinner table theyve not put much effort into rendering the table and theatre looks kinda clunky too its 2019 this looks like it was made for ps3 dodgy player graphics no career start from the bottom work your way up so online will just be ronnie vs ronnie everywhere been waiting for a snooker game for years now looks like im still waiting for 2019 the graphics are a disgrace they dont look different to world snooker 2010 but its still a snooker game its better than nothing have you seen the trailer for this is snooker its being made by creators of pure pool can all ps4 players respond so i know how many ppl i need to beat can i ask why you found marco on quick match screen funny i like the action cam on this hope the player introduction is added aswell maybe its just on career mode like most people im looking forward to the fact we have a new snooker game to play i can see the points re the graphics but the key aspect for me is the gameplay the longevity of the game is crucial for me the immersive experience is king these days so it needs that connection there does seem to be a stark difference in the quality of the graphics during the stages of the shot with the final action shot looking pretty good but the ones preceding not as much one aspect that would have been good it may be in the options is that you are actually viewing the pot from the perspective of when down on the cue rather than watching from a camera angle your character playing the shot i think thats how its viewed in pure pool snooker does anyone else feel the balls run for too long looks really nice what are those circles on the felt of the table though brilliant news loved the old games we are crying out for a decent boxing game now i live snooker but there are just some sports that you dont turn to a game such as mma its too complicated an people will always complain its not realistic enough go pick up a cue an learn it gets you out more why does it fan out looks off putting pure snooker better graphics this looks cartoonish i was looking forward to this sadly the graphics are no better than games from last gen disappointed looks awful think ill stick with this is snooker when it comes out this year will the players have different stats or just depend on your ability it would be nice there is a difference between long pots with judd or steadman what minimum system requirements for pc my next game buy snooker i knowmain focus is on table but the graphics are shyteespecially on the players been playing pure pool up until now with the snooker add on dlc but this looks good thanks for the vid where i can find original demo gameplay video this game needs more development time just little things like the player moving around the table after taking his shot instead of just standing there hopefully career is more than just game after game and has a bit of character graphics dose not look as good as i thought it was gonna be pure pool come out years ago and looks 10 times better the potting feels weirdly prerecorded hey guys we got two snooker games coning out this year the other one is called this is snooker and is endorsed by six time former world champ stephen hendry and its also got top female ref michaela tabb on it as well no sponsors in venues like dafabet or betfred anyway cant wait for this cant wait hi great video this looks fun there hasnt been a decent snooker game for ages thanks graphics are not a deal breaker the key is ball physics and a career modebuy the game so they will get a improved budget to include aaa play models im gonna own everyone online will be buying the game on april 17th on ps4 and xbox i want this to be good a lot if all the stadiums are recreated players and full tournaments it will be great a few things will make or break this game longevity of career mode will depend on how well the game plays end of if the game mechanics work and the ai player have variety this could be great i have high hopes as the ps1 and 2 games from this developer were stella efforts lets hope this is a proper release that does the ps4 justice is the aiming on snooker 19 slow and is the aiming on snooker 19 easy to control omg i was expecting so much and im so disappointed its pure rubbish looks greatalready pre ordered cant wait hi jo i cant waite for the snooker 19 game looks lush love the shot taking changes and graphics physics look pretty much spot on too am sure you will love it mate i cant wait i really hope u can create ur own snooker player for career mode i think they might have done so considering its been 8yrs since the last snooker game they must have taken a page out of wsc 11s book yes ordered this today of ps store i can see why its a reasonable price my eye sights getting worse im hoping that they have an over head view like wsc 11 as this cauld be frustrating cant wait to see multiplayer and career shame they are keeping that back lol i live how the developer says beautiful graphics but there fifa 15 at best why does the ball animate so badly in all of the snooker games is it youtube or some technical limitation been watching a few of your old match plays in preparation for this and i was hoping to see that improved i dont like the light circles on tableit looks weird and not realistic you look slightly disappointed mate 2315 this could be the end of my amazing winning streak really so much conversation they get a pass for this one as its their first attempt but future versions of this game if they happen must have a player creator there is no immersion to playing as someone else for a full career the odd exhibition match yeah but for a career mode you need to be able to play as yourself and i find it pretty unbelievable that theres not even a totally basic player creator that would have been better than none i didnt expect wwe19 levels of player creation but i did expect the game to have some kind of player creation lets hope its moddable and that you can edit the names or something in a text file to mod your own name in and pick the nearest likeness of the players to yourself but i wouldnt bank on it id just like to say to the creators of this game what on earth were you thinking as an immersive career mode is the bread and butter of any sports game it looks ok for the first time for 8 years and hope they improve year after year i will be getting the game on the 17th to support the company in the future is there such a training mode as zb at fifa where you can make lineup or practice other things or it is not included so you can train in snooker clubs as a pro does in real life too is it a ea game been waiting too long for a snooker game pure pool was good but no official rules or players now two have come along at once this game looks and sounds good interms of the sounds of the balls and balls going into the pockets i hope they bring snooker games out every year from now on it look good but they could do more shame there was no shootout gameplay dont think old snooker games had premier league tournament be interesing to know how the shot clock system works on a game happy with what i saw looks decent with some nice camera angles and challenging gameplay on the harder settings the player body positions etc look more realistic in this one no more giants with 7 foot cues and absurd stances i did notice one shot though where selby was using the rest when it wasnt needed and stood miles from the table looked a bit odd but i understand the difficulties involved in making body positioning look realistic commentary will be lacking but thats not a big problem looks like being the best snooker game to date and at only 30 quid its a must i hope that the venues will be authentic because they dont are very well reproduced on this video the game is not worth the money the graphics are not very in short the game is the exact same snooker 11 well or 09 the height of the camera is great for aiming lines on but for no aiming lines mode the camera for aiming needs to be just above the cue as if your chin is resting on the cue or that option is pretty useless im liking the ball and cushion physics and speed of the ball when slowing down is spot on would have liked to have seen the optionssettings menu to see what can be changed for player preference theres another snooker game coming out aswell apparently called this is snooker exciting times ahead the games not bad i love the action cams they look pretty realistic and the animations of the players look spot on especially with selby with the bridge and cue action the graphics of the players is a let down the commentary looks okay look forward to seeing more footage before deciding to buy i will buy it eventually why not have sponsors the guy on the right knew little to nothing about snooker it was so awkward at times been waiting years for a updated snooker gamewas really looking forward to thisbut graphics dont look much better than wsc 09 on xbox 360thought 10 years later it would look amazingthink i will stick with snooker nation championship 2019 i think it looks really great even more excited for this now did you see that there is a stephen hendry endorsed snooker game that was announced today called this is snooker im playing as jimmy white on online tournament if it lets me and righting that wrong jimmywhite for world champion crucible as long as i can play as wembo all is good master looks super tough i might start on pro and see how it goes then maybe master but probably get owned captain did you seen the questions on instagram there is not going to have a player creation on career mode perfect really big fan of the tv presentation really hyped now its going to be a long fortnight watched the live stream but really appreciate you uploading the raw footage shame no positional aid but itll definitely push me to get better at the game what seemed really weird to me was the bizarre difference in graphics between lining up shots and then actually playing them in the cinematic camera of course graphics arent important but there was a big difference in quality between the two angles for people like me who searched this to find out how you do it both edit code to the same word then both search at the same time do yo know when the next update is coming out the draws not been kind to you so far trump selby now williams you always have great thumbnails first time im actually fast to a video did you say the stars over trophy correspond to ai difficulty or aim aid brilliant match but the sound isnt close to being in line with the video hi did u say that the trophy celebrartions are in the new update that we got love the series bro lol anyone could pot any ball with guidelines show a vid without will ding receive a kiss from his good friend ronnie after the match thrilling game they have portrayed ding very well brilliant safety and cue ball control hey will you play more tennis games such as full ace thanks gorillaz its comin up its comin up its comin up capitaingoodspeed its there ai playing uplets hope it ups a level or two is it possible to change the match length during the career mode obviously no snooker 20 and no need really they have ironed out many of the in game faults to their credit perhaps an update of a tournament tree review last shot and some ai graphics improvements would complete this game its great as is but some polish will make this game superb good luck in the final joe kinda makes me wonder why the developers cant achieve this intro give up your teaching job to teach them how to do it proper absolutely loved the intro if only that could be in the game for all the comps great job your thumbnail has barry hawkins in it love the vid keep up the work dont you get annoyed about how rubbish the ai can be in this game also that intro was brilliant that is exactly what should be done each match in this game that seriously adds atmosphere well done well done on the intro that was fantastic happy new years guys love rob walkers intro merge niice one i love this series please carry it on that intro was absolutely amazing that must have taken a while to edit looking forward to this final that is a good start to the video i still dont understand why there is a match timer makes no sense i understand why there is shot timer although i think there should be penalty if you count out maybe your opponent gets 5 points i think that happens in the snooker shoot out although ive watched probably 10 mins at most not really for me that anyone know how often the leaderboard is updated im 195 and can never find myself on it and it always looks the same with the same people with the same amount of points loving this series pal would like to play you online roballion is my online name what device are you playing this on great video by the way anyone know how the scoring works for this tournament cant figure it out at all would be handy to be able to press a button to go to your position in the table great match at 945 it looked a simple shot but he was prob adjusting to get on the next color pink i dont think any one runs down clock because it could actually turn around in your favour if he misses a shot and you only need 1 point he miss then your in with less time available pot one red and they lose people tend to run down the clock when only 34 mins left like 20 30 points a head im still waiting for the match time to be abolished or to be increased to about 1 hour this should give enough time for most games and situations great video im currently 5th in the tournament what platform are you on pc cos im sure ive played you drunkanmaster is my steam name if anyone wants to add me to play some friendlys speaking of friendly games we also need to be able to adjust the amount of frames we can play in stead of just 1 hi m8 have you thought about doing a tips video something like you look at a few misses and try to explain why you think they dint go in reason im asking is cos im missing some shots and just cant see how really enjoying the online series its very tense so i stumbled across this channel by accident and i have been watching your snooker 19 stuff and im loving it honestly i love the commentary and i dont find you content boring in the slightest keep up the good work man why y not need play online para fuera help me please i look for games he gets me and when i break he takes me out benn excited for this all week hate to say it and im hope im wrong but that trailer looks prerendered guys ive got to admit im a bit gutted that you cant see the ref and im not sure if there will be player entrances or not theres one in the trailer but i didnt see one in the live stream im not sure if they turned it off for that or not i did notice selby holding the cue the way only he does in real life while taking a shot on a red tight against the cushion that attention to detail is nice either way we havent had an official snooker game since 2011 so im super hyped as long as the game mechanics are good and its not too easy ill be happy id say yes it does not look perfect but if you are a snooker fan you cant be disappointedhowever the proof is in the playing i hope the aiming line for online is not very long most snooker games players dont have to put any effort in cue ball control it gets boring clearing up or watching the other player clear up you played paul hunter thats really really cool fantastic interview really enjoyed it when you realise that a ps2 snooker game released 15 year ago in snooker 2004 had the referre retrieving the colours and respotting them and a game in 2019 on 2 generation more powerful console just has a white screen after every shot pretty shocking really is it me or does the cue just keep rolling after the object ball has been hit its like a really fast cloth also when the player has taken a shot they stand up but rather than looking at the cue to see the position of the next shot he just looks straight ahead quite poor really all they had to do was make the player track the cue ball after the shot has been taken also some of the faces on the players are appalling especially as they did 3d mapping for all the players why do it look so bad pool with hard mode im not sure who did that amazing camera workbut wow really impressive oh and the game looks good i have a question about this switch version compared to the ps4xbox ones from your footage above it seems like the camera angle when taking your shot always from the standard top of the table view whereas the ps4xbox versions have those cool tvlike angles eg side shots in front of ball et al can you confirm this is true or is it something that can be changed in settings due to the amount youve hammed the xbox and ps4 versions it probably shows up a hell of a lot more graphically i dont think its that bad at all and certainly to have it portably is brilliant if you have more than one console though and dont care for handheld then yea makes no sense to get the switch version but i still think its a great game for the switch i gave it an 85 on my channel i absolutely agree about the sensitivity of the controller feels very weird compared to xbox apparently the camera view when ai is at the table is higher up and looks better than the ones on other platforms i got mind for my new switch lite that be my first game to play for new switch lite love this game ooooh a new video holy shit son you have no idea how badly i wanted you to take the shot when you were lining the wrong line up lol dont like the shot clock and also longer format did you smash the tv after this vid lol they must have plans to make online betterlets hope so great 1 liners mate hilarious lol would be funny playing against you hahaha rory looks greatmet the guy 1 year ago in qualifiers match timer is silly no tactical play games hardly reach the colours other than that i actually love the game 901 a motivated idiot lol 439 the yellow line is where the object ball goes not the white line if you havent grasped that yet i dont know if theres much hope for u its just quick match except its ranked im baffled why they couldnt add a proper tournament and have best of 3 or something the match countdown is bullshit too so many players abusing it by taking 30 seconds on each shot to waste time ok after getting stuck in online ive a few suggestions ill mention to the devs 1 the walkround table needs to be a lot better 2 long pots need a shorter aim line as it can be all over after break off 3 chinese snookers and tight on cush shots need to have a penalty if you just chinese snookered by the pink and on a colour its just too easy to nail a long balk colour and continue break still living it though and the vidz sent a friend request no seeing anything that i need to worry about when we have our 1st match yah an actual game of snooker at last hahaha tournaments should be a knockout basis and if you lose you start again see if you can win a tournament not just a meaningless league basis this isnt a tournament this is a issue of who can play the most utter pointless the match time ruins the game for me i needed six points then game ends with him winning wasnt happy theres gold silver and bronze tiers on the leaderboard we dont really know how points and rewards work though guessing that higher tiers get more stuff they really could do with coming out and explaining it this is not good online cant enjoy it in 20mins i won 2 games went to 7th in leaderboard then when you lose games like i did you lose your points this is a good thing for those that like this sort of thing studio foam on the wall vids in the car something tells me that the mrs aint too happy hahaha enjoying the vids mate cant wait to play this hello captain goodspeed well done i think you are going too win the world championship good luck xx put him to the sword play in pro bro more centries please just starting this game out love your positional play any advice what a huge victory thats a big and important victory nice video great comeback do you think youll do 8frame length videos during the qf sf and final if you reach that far nice video but if u dont mind can i ask do u play shots with less aim sometimes if the frame is in the bag nice video dude i think now you need to start playing shots with side mate most shots you play are plain ball or screw back add some side and then youll have better position on some shots this ones right in the heart of the pocket red bounces off cushion and jaw before falling in the bag whats taking you so long please concentrate on this content and upload daily some of ur choice shots r bizarre mate very honest to concede a 41 lead to 44 lots wouldve chosen to peruse a commanding lead over being level again credit where its due i always have problem winning over kyren and luca dont know why ronnies world title here that glitch at the start happens to me all the time if i quit the match just at the logo transitional change between frames it appears the game does not save progress there any more the tell tale sign is that you see the two players with one randomly highlighted as win and a zerod scoreline so now i have to make a point of quitting out either after the transition or just when brendan is talking about who won the frame it was introduced a few patches ago iirc i want to say 112 and its not been fixed at all just more bugs introduced like the ai playing dumb break off shots like at the start of the video p big match this how do you invite someone to a game look cool videos keep it up your cool i hope you have a wonderful day buddy weve fouled more than a dog this frame xd omg against me ronnie just missed the reds completely on the breakoff new one on me unbelievable it keeps getting ever so slightly better with every patch id like to see them improve a couple more things one being how reluctant the ai seem to be to smash open the reds when break building and two it would be nice to see them miss the target ball once or twice when put in a snooker they seem to get out of it every time at the moment but still a fun game despite the issues i love the ball physics and how it plays overall absolutely loving the new patch you definitely have to rethink the way you played in the previous patch every shot is now a pressure shot because all the ai are capable of knocking decent size breaks obviously the top players will probably get more frame winning breaks than previously the way to play it now is if you wouldnt go for the shot in real life then dont on the here it has 100 got harder but that is no bad thing ithink with your commentary you shouldswitch in game commentary off i think the tweaks theyve done to the ais break building means its allowed the ai to actually make a proper break that pros would do seems so much more realistic to me even on easy difficulty ill be moving up to medium half way through my career mode once i have more of a grasp on the game still inconsistent in my break building but then again that defines marco fu lol as for the aiming aid i think they did something odd to it for when youre running a ball along the cushion at times like at 2520 you dont even see the aiming aid which is confusing because it makes it appear like youre going to miss the red completely not sure if its a bug tbh am i the only one having problems playing snooker today i cant load my match up in career any idea why not to sure you are enjoying this upgrade joe they also adjusted the pro aiming aid and that in combination with the ai playing better has made the game more difficult for me also anyway we will get used to it as a counter i restarted my career as jimmy and have much less expectation of winning god bless you jimmy white i personally think pro is better apart from cone widening too much for any type of cutthe only real problem is the dark tablesthey really need to reverse that one but as for gameplay its better now and more rewardingand btw im having same problem as youmissing alot loli can feel your tension lol im sure its a matter of timei remember pro was hard at one point what did the patch change it takes time to adapt to the whole thing me too hi captian looking for suggestions on who to pick as my player for the snooker career just got the game today so really need some advice can u do 75 break on 6 red snooker from this game why do you use the restwhen theres no need 3245 dont wanna discriminate against gender neutral people honestly man you are such a legend i know some people who are gender neutral as it happens and its crazy how few people recognise their existence but it means tons so yeah legend my biggest complaint is onlinei would like to play a friend with no time limit and best of how ever many frames i like but you cant do eitherits just 1 game 30 secs shot 12k views really go and buy the fucksake game yourself have a go you dont need to watch this bloke play it youll never get the time back ive got this comp next currently in r3 of paul hunter classic against gary wilson i have never watched the 6red championship but thats mainly because i dont realise when it is on i enjoy variants on the typical snooker format though they are all entertaining in different ways mate why am i hooked on this series joe are you enjoying the world championship also how can you not create your own pro ridiculous the commentary on this game is absolutely terrible its so bad its actually laughable what a shame they rushed this out in time for the real world championships was actually looking forward to buying this game but watching your videos as put me right off not that there is anything wrong with your videos of course i just meant the game dreadful mate i could really do with some tips im finding the game so hard any tips i need to know crucial ones youre quality can you do a lets play tiger woods pga tour 06 on a ps2 do two seperate lets play series on that game one for the full career mode and the other will be for rivals mode haha you uploaded this just as ronnie got knocked out wish they would have added a tournament bracket and as you said yourself a way to view groups would be nice to see it implemented in a future update love your videos man been watching for a while how do you keep up posting so consistently its inspiring ive got a new channel and trying to find my feet keep up the great work next time can we see your reaction like you do in other videos love the channel perfect timing to watch on my lunch break thank you cgs bloody hell chinny well done man so entertaining and nerve racking lol well done mate ive hit a 147 on amateur pro and pro difficulty holy shit dude well done mani am still trying to get mine glad u jagged a magic 147that last red was the pressure moment do youtube now have to give you 147000 well done matetime to move onto pro plusgood luck ps you used the magic side a bit too much and used audience for advice lol epic but not quite as epic as my amazing comeback to beat you 1718 in our best of 35 o i bet you had to pinch yourself today to believe that you actually did that eh well done mike was just as good watching it back just now as it was witnessing it last night enjoy the usa and come back safe to entertain us all again all the best buddy descent matethink this vid contained every emotion in human existance i did say during a live screening some time back getting the 147 potting them last 6 colours took me what felt like forever your reply back then ive not got there yet dan but if and when i do good job enjoyed watching you achieve this last night was really tense well done tournament play is where its at chinnypro plus for the winwould love to see you do some vids on that it was a pleasure to witness it live we were all going through the emotions with u nice 147 well done mate keep up the good work played well but not to be enjoyable match i think the rushed red in the middle at 21 up was your undoing and the turning point in this match if youd had taken your time youd of potted it gone 31 up and highly likely won the match 745 hahaha makes me think do you play off youtube maybe you will do a lot better im currently playing neil aswell in uk championship playing on hard and currently 30 up 1053 hendon well hes taken the lead here foulds i agree he really is the gift that keeps on giving the ai never misses when i play on hard mode especially against selby i wish it was more like this one great content as always joe keep up the uploads coming 1621 lol thats just laughable yesss been looking forward to this great vids keep them up so the shot timer game timer is fixed on whenever you play online that puts me off buying this as does no custom character nah if u win career tournament u unlock stuff for the character cant play online wont connect can anyone tell me why nice viddo you know if the ai safety play patch has released yet apparently the play station console users already have it shot clocks should be an option not a permanent thing and you should be able to completely customise the game against friends snooker isnt pool but the clock makes it that way if you had a good safety battle you would never be able to finish the frame 1 frame is a joke 20 minutes 30 second clock means potentially only time to play 40 total shots and it takes 37 to clear the table with no misses so the timer is a joke i played a game was 25 points ahead with 27 left on the table and not enough time for him to clear the colours so i wrongfully won the game not a true representation of snooker at all if there needs to be a timer then 120 seconds per shot and at least 45 minutes a frame giving time to play properly hello i allow myself to share my site where i organize tournaments on snooker 19 i would like you to register thank you very much and sorry you should drop merch with wheres the cue ball going on it this game is a messso many amateur mistakes and corners cutgutted really as i was going to buy a ps4 purely for a good snooker game but it seems my ps3 snooker game from 10 years ago is actually made better than this bought this yesterday on the ps store dont normally buy digital games but i couldnt pick this game up anywhere in my area of oldham its very disappointing as there is no online versus mode where you can play your friends this being the main reason i bought it the ai on the carer mode is nonsense as its just too hard ive yet to qualify for a tournament seemingly once you set your aim i put mine on pro you cant change it ill stick with it and hope over time they improve it but as of now im not very impressed with it 244 oh and thats a bad miss 933 did he break the law of physics dam i wanted this game but they were all out of stock game shop and argos got world war z instead not overly impressed with this game in fact ive requested a refund its all wrong these developers could learn a thing or two from poolnationfx and their snooker add on it is a far better experience some of the worst elements in this for me are besides the silly animation and commentary issues the lack of a comprehensive table top view to line shots up properly the flaring out of an object ball at certain angles is inaccuatre and all wrong there is no indication of cue ball travel on shots off cushions and on snooker escapes this is fine on pro difficulty but on easier you would expect it cue angle needs some work also why can you only tilt a cue to 20 for swerves etc silly issues that you wouldnt expect from a 2019 official title stephen hendrys upcoming offering will hopefully be better tbh this game looks absolutely awful anyone who has played hustle kings would surely agree only jimmys hair looks more real ja all fine but a little advice next time start with the settings and menue of the game before the actual gameplay they need to 1 get some individual player attributes into the game eg some players are better with the restunder pressure than others so have that factored in vs the accuracy of your shot 2 to make the game less robotic get the crowd cheering those pressureframe winning shots improve the sounds when contact is made with the object ball 3 commentary saying easy shots are tricky makes no sense does the ai ever concede the game i was playing it at midnight and opponent had a 92 break he decides to play a snooker as he cant pot the red lol will we be able to play classic old players like ray readon or john spencer sometime is the outlaw joe swail in this game id like to play as him in career mode look at this shoot 933 its totally faked white ball is on the down side of the pocket and its impossible to get this position after potting the blue ball i am really worried about this game i played a lot of billard games and i have not seen such a fail before the ai havent heard of safety position or missing a long pot can you stop talking all the way through this game looks promising i wonder when you will get a 147 2138 is my favorite moment here there are too many dead weight shots from ai and some strange shot choices but hopefully these will be sorted out in future patches animations need work hi mate ive prebought this on ps4 do you know what time it will download and be available to play midnight tonight i was gonna get this game but the ai shot selection is so unreal i dont want to play it poor terrible respot shot though from the ai cant wait for the switch version is there a training mode what level are the aim lines on its getting better but still a lot to dosafety play is terrible and why did trump go for that blue when he was on 70 odd lol can the flash to white between every shot be turned off its very annoying thanks for the info keep up the great content great video mate i cant wait to buy snooker 19 when is snooker out that was good of them to let you start playing early im installing this game tonight my game plan is career im playing with a amateur line with 120 difficultly and online pro line is this got the planned patch or not joe cause it looks and plays great as it is i cant wait to start playing this small issues aside im looking forward to starting the career mode and start to build up those stats looks great when youre on the ball good to see such a fluent break well played but the ai is letting this game down its safety play in particular is terrible and it plays too many deadweight long pots that always seem to find deadcentre of the pocket needs further patching i hope they add the satisfying hard pot sounds every shot sounds like its been dropped dead weight the rest getting brought out for almost every shot its a little annoying they got trump using the rest wrong hes one of a few lefties that uses the rest right handed the character models are ps3 like can u try a 147 from this game fantastic shot on green into pack and double on redgood play mateyour knowledge shows and makes it good to watchlooking forward to a game online one day would be great if the game had a spectator mode where you can just put two ai players to play each other and watch the game great way to just relax and watch some snooker during the summer break of the real tour was there any sight of this kind of possibility in the game d some serious peanuts being picked out of poo in the commentsif ya dont like the look of it dont buy it if the graphics are shit its not meant to be red dead 2 its a snooker gamethe physics are more important if the cpu player chooses a blue over the blackget over it cos you probably arent going to be playing the cpu anyway you will be playing a friend im all about this gamehave been since wsc2005its 30i know this game is gonna keep my ocds entertained for hour upon hour upon hour the least we can all do is hold back back from coating it before we have actually had a chance to play it great video well done ive said this before and il say it again the action cam is absolutely stunning it looks so realistic massive well done to the developers theyve nailed the visual graphics of the table and arena but unfortunately the gameplay is lacking the sound of the balls are not quite right theyre too quiet and dont even sound like the real thing they also need to improve the ai how many times did judd nestle into the reds or play a pot which looked like it was in slow motion in real life the ball would never reach the pockets has to be sorted the atmosphere really needs to be improved also the crowd need to react to misses fouls long pots and safety battles atm they do react to a long pot but its very limited commentary was actually okay in this video but could do with some work for a first game the devs have done pretty well hopefully they continue to polish the game this is a great video cant wait to play this on the 17th april your voice was a half a second out with gameplay btw 735 great shot probably the best shot ive seen u play in any snooker game jimmy white will be the player pick for the career mode why did judd take the blue glad your enjoying it its much better after todays patch i started my pro seasons career with james wattana ive already beat trump and lisowski this is going to be a winner always great to see jimmy win the commentary on the respot is something i havent heard in a previous snooker game either so many nice little touches in this game already does the game autosave after every frame like old games can you play online vs friends or is it just random some of shot selections baffling why was judd not taking the easy blacks for position lol where is the ref re spotting balls in fact where is the ref in general i need some clarification i have heard that there is no career mode is this true 2 snooker 19 videos in one day were being treated who will you be using in career mode and when will the first episode be out this looks awesome only thing i would say is on some shots the cone is a bit exagerated sure theyll patch that tho shot at 933 not physically possible this is a epileptics nightmare by playing with the rest hold trump cue in right hand not in left and graphic is terrible this is like a game for the ps1 subscribed today nice video already getting me in the mood for when the wsc starts on saturday ai safety play and long shot are rubbish otherwise looks good it makes me happy great fix they need to fix ai shot selection its ridiculous i dont hear the fan noise anymore p 2 more sleeps yisss the only thing whats really annoying me about the game is all the containing safeties from the ai and weird positional shots we all know trump wouldnt play like this in real life i guess we will only have a proper tactical game against real players online still really looking forward to it tho do i buy this game nice 50 ive watched a few videos since they started popping up on saturday it didnt look great i know there has been an update since the weekend but i also think your style of play makes the game look better the other people uploading dont really know how to build a break impressed from what ive seen from you so far when you go over a snooker band you do not know where the white ball stops when would juddor pretty much any pro roll so many long pots in the length of the table totally unrealistic all of a sudden i can see me being addicted to this like the old ones love the game and your channel but could you please stop using the quick button as it takes us out of the game its the patch 506 why not black thats what makes the game broken this must be improved for the next patch decent bit of pack luck if your playing fifa stephen hendry made the same break of against cliff thorburn in the deciding frame on the weekend i hope in the online we can see you maybe i wouldnt mind after a year there might be private tournament so you can play with friends good lord video overload i havent watched it yet obviously its only been out 2mins but im still even more hyped for the 17th im so hyped for wednesday would you say this game or the ps4 one coming out is better i bought this and its really really hard if not too dificult first view excited to see some gameplay doubling so unprofessional lol ya doing great ya doing great really well will well done will 1220 what a shot 3422 did u fart mate sounds like it ha must been all the pressure top comeback joe what a comeback ah man its hard for anyone to compete with mark when hes playing like that i dont think you even played that bad it was relatively close in terms of points he just made the crucial clearances when it mattered damn williams has got your number it seems fair play for sticking with it mate i play the same settings as you do and every missed pot or poor safety is crucial because the ai are likely to punish you if you do though i dont win as much as i would like i enjoy the challenge of playing the most lifelike brand of snooker love the videos good updates on the game with the trophy presentation just need the referee to make an appearance good luck in your new job mate your maths channel got me through my alevels and ive enjoyed your gaming content ever since that noise of ps4 in background is annoying as owt love your videos i remember subscribing to you when you made your first tennis world tour video i think you were on around 5k subs and now your on 12k keep up the great effort ur fogetting that it came out on pc u said ps4 and xobx one waiting for 12 oclock tonight the july 10th update will be the last ripstone do they had to do it so as to fall in line with the quality requirements of switch which are more stringent than for xboxps4pc i have to confess everyone else seems much better at this game than me lol im getting abit bored of it now but i still come watch your videos their very funny i was wondering this over a month ago and started doing some digging i found quite a few website adverising later on as you stated and thoughtoh well then i just forgot all about it till u brought it up again i was like yeahstill no sign as usual hopefully they dont start advertising a follow up before this even gets to switch lol it would have made more sense getting all versions out to release at same time as the actual snooker on tv oh well lets just hope its worth the wait or they just aswell have not bothered yo chinny is this how we roll now hope you ae ok and work went well can i just say the duke said in your absence that rocket league is like snooker no it is not i spent an hour wondering what the hell was going on lol and thats no offence to the duke i just thought i was tripping out roll on the 10th chinny i just won the paul hunter classic against ronnie osullivan in the final i won 30 great win didnt look like it would be possible but you finally beat your ingame rival and stopped his domination of tournaments for now d given how mark has won the majority of tournaments in this season i wonder if they have set up the system such that whoever wins the world championship of the previous season gets a flag that makes them more likely to dominate tournaments in the new season by winning them or getting to finals more regularly this was a great watch right in the heart of the pocket love the content hi joe just won the masters against ronnie osullivan 104 first well to comment keeps missing easy ballsquite annoying loving this seriesjust started watching it your commentary is great and youre playing the snooker realistically i have the game myself but since its my first snooker game im terrible at it haha i am a bit disappointed that there isnt like single player tournament not the whole career where you can just pick the tournament and playor that you can just have two cpus play against each other while you watch the match im a shaun murphy supporter any others out there what a shot in the 34th minute of the video game lacks applause for such amazing shots great video great video nice to see wells giving you a good challenge but quality always shines in the end 16 balls on the table and game ends as no time to play silly 3mins to make a come back now the game ends what a let down people take advantage of the time of shot why dose it only have 20mins online the online is silly only 20mins a game what u think of that 3 rule miss in indeed in the game higgins gave me a frame in the final in my career mode keep up the vids joe my amstrad cpc464 had better graphics than this shit great to watch looking forward to the next episodes mate how do you pot a ball tight on the cushion im having trouble doing that aiming with the white ball circle doesnt work like you would in real life great vid as always bro got the game yesterday and loving it head and shoulders above any previous snooker games you should try playing real cricket 19 theres an online mode like fut now mine always takes ages to load can i have some advice what to do pls been playing for a while now and would say that the ai definitively needs tweaking some almost impossible shots and breaks coming from lesser players that needs adjusting and their safety seems to exist of laying up next to a ball over and over again for a touching ball result and so far they have got out of every snooker i have set them with a perfect shot not realistic lots on the plus side though much better game once you actually play it rather than watch it and it can be tweaked to suit the skill of the player playing allowing any standard of player to get a fair game in is that right the pc version has had another patch already new to your channel i love your content your passion for snooker and your commentary is perfect i will continue to follow as the entertainment is there well done getting a lot of stuttering on ps4 pro wonder if i need to drop down to 1080p to fix anyone else can you save game after every frame joe this game is a totally let down can you check the other scores from the tournament to see how each player gets on also does the game retain those stats all seasoncareer whats with the opponent playing a dead weight green and losing position on numerous occasions cheers for the vids mate new subscriber watched the first two which has convinced me to part with thirty quid so thank you hope the ai safety and being able to create your player get sorted and the white screen between shots solid win everyone must be struggling at the moment as were all getting used to how the table plays and so on itll be good when online gets more stable dont know if youve been able to try online yet but unranked games currently have a match timer and shot clock dont think they should be part of unranked matches because youre usually playing with friends in those we need options for match length too as at the moment its just single frame matches the stat tracking is decent but i think its surprising that centuries and the amount of centuries you make in the different modes is something which there is no record kept for really would like to see that come in same for 147s too youve been doing great with video views and comments and ripstone did let you have a slightly early copy youre a great voice for the community and you might be in a better position to raise issues like these with them than most of us the three miss rule is in the game i got it and i was awarded the frame this will sell like hot cakes once the world championships start dont like the fact you have to time inside the blue bar thing let me just line up my shot and add spin and shoot good videos mate i bought this game today cause i love snooker and was a big fan of the wsc series but its pretty bad i have to be honest theres a plethora of graphics issues on xbox one x plus the aiming aid doesnt work off of cushions which is incredibly lame especially when trying to get out of snookers the game also constantly crashes this game could have been soooo much better but its very bare bones to say the least and has been poorly made voo foo studios are bringing out this is snooker soon im sure it will be miles better than this judging by what ive seen this snooker 19 game has all the names but thats all it has its not in the same ball park as wsc real 11 and thats an 8 year old game its such a shame its also very overpriced at 30 its more like a 15 game in my opinion still enjoy watching you play it though played around a dozen games in career mode using pro setting and made a 112 in my first frame loving it so far not had any issues with the ai safety not seen one roll up safety so far i have actually been quite impressed with it which surprised me after seeing a lot of roll ups in videos the only issue i had is i qualified for the riga masters then when the tournament came round it said i failed to qualify which was a bit strange playing on pc by the way love the game its about time they had a new snooker game i do think there could be lots of improvement as others have said the ai safety play could be improved as in my experience they roll up to the ball to much there needs to be a way to fine tune the power as it would be quicker in the long run also maybe in the pause menu some information of whats whats left on the table points wise in not as good at maths as some people do you know if you leave the game half way through it saves from that point loving the content keep it up downloaded this on pcabout 4 hours into itand i can say that the ai safety shots are actually greatno rolling up to balls whatsoeverall nice little cuts back to baulkgame play is solid well worth itthanks for the great uploadskeep them coming im loving this game yes the safety play needs work but the gameplay is good and its a real challenge too plus there is so much content as a starting point this is brilliant 3025 the physics of this shot really impressed me very realistic in that you put so much top on it that it hardly went anywhere despite 100 power almost a banana shot but not quite on another games that would have flown around the table which is unrealistic i dont even like snooker yet i watched the whole of this video already a great game potential to be the best game ever it feels like youre there playing under pressure when on a high break if only the safety play and ai shot choice was better nice video can you make your own player and do a career when is switch version out a white flash after every shot looks terrible to eyes i decided to do a career with ken doherty as i am from ireland and his niece was in my brothers primary school class the three miss rule is in the game i had jimmy cahill miss a roll up twice in a row and brendan warned him with something like if you miss this stroke youll forfeit the frame and he missed and he forfeited the frame so that was an interesting experience your positional play is great nice to watch someone try to build a break realistically rather than just going mad potting from everywhere it has a one star rating on playstation store not sure ever seen a game that low might wait till its a tener yo im literally playing you in an online match rn im neil robertson just played this pile of shit and my god its shit when a 10 year old game is better than this you no its shit ive gone straight into career mode on this with hard difficulty and long matches as jimmy having mastered previous snooker games this is a genuine challenge and im hooked already knocked out of the riga masters by fergal obrien in qualifying im now in a titanic tussle with alan macmanus at 33 ive had to really think about my play mixing safety and potting to win those 3 framed at the moment its an achievement to get 3050 breaks it feels like this game is going to have some longevity and i have to say now having played it for a good few hours im impressed anyone really finding it difficult cant judge power at all for safetys and positional shots well another great video cant wait for some more tomorrow my riga masters started against sunny akani and its 11 at the moment basically started the same as your match with him winning the first frame and me winning the second on the final black really enjoying the game at the moment any tips for safeties loving these videos finally started playing this game and im really liking it not started career mode yet just getting used to it but ill be choosing john higgins when i do my career i do like that the ai do actually miss pots unlike previous snooker games where they just pot them from everywhere the heavy breathing is very off putting fella this game could be very good if it wasnt for the non existent ai safety play loving the snooker 19 content keep up the good work out of curiosity do you live stream on yt or twitch would love to watch you play a tournament or few matches live one day damn amazoni had this on pre order and was supposed to have it delivered tomorrow now i have had an email saying they are out of stockgoing to cancel it and buy it on the playstation store insteadneed to be playing it this looks great will be getting it in game play for example does chork marks stay on table through all frames or is it gone on next frame anyone know when we are able to play friends online it wont let me thanks ai safety play is decent on the game a couple of tap ups so far in my first few tries but most of the time they play half decent attempts at safety shots i am quite confused on what setting to play the game on i went for the rising star option and picked cahill but my first match on hard in the qualifying round of that first tournament was mark selby so not sure if its supposed to work like that i got hammered but started another one on medium diffculty and got luca brucel who is ranked 14th dont really expect those in the top 16 to be qualifying for events the ai in this game makes so many terrible decisions lmao i like it first then look and then comment mr capitan 3 videos per day snooker 19 thanks yess been waiting for this first but nobody including me cares never clicked so fast one thing i think the game needs is being able to feather with your toggle stick before u hit it u can do it on tiger woods never thought about if they are right or left handed seems like such an easy thing to fix i think the trophies presentation will be in because they are in the trailer things i want 1 prize money used for unlocks ie clothing cues chalks tables even a house that you could decorate 2 crowd needs to respond to the action not just make random noises 3 agree with the commentary 4 all the tournaments 5 i hope there is a proper ranking board that updates with every tournament 6 skills that you can unlock with xp like temperament long range potting short potting aggression concentration etc 7 intro video to each tournament to get you going i read the commentary was going to be hendon and foulds i would like to see the positional aid of previous wsc games because without it for me it just seems to hard to build a high break ive tried with it turned on and off and makes for much less realistic snooker some might say it makes it too easy but then they could just turn it off better to have it there for those who like but be able to turn it off for those who dont than to not have it at all when does this game actually come they dont give an actual date one i like about wcs 09 was the ref replacing the coloured balls back on there spots but that just me httpwwwworldsnookercombackinthegame in this photo allen is left handed the photo isnt flipped either because the world snooker signs in the background are the right way round i really hope the positional circle doesnt make it into this game it made previous snooker games far too easy the necessity for a straight cue action would have been a good thing to include and add to the realism as far as online play goes it has to be exciting to a certain extent if the game is too easy its going to be a long time between each players turn no one will want to sit watching his opponent laboriously carve out a 15 minute century too late to make those changes now so just hope for the best more tournaments the better even get that 25 second shot and 10 seconds in it great tournament that was and a better ranking points prise money this cauld be the favourite sports game i wanna see a friggin release date i wanna mainly see players taking realistic shots and to getting more higher breaks as in preious games theyd struggle to get 40 and it was just too easy is it true that taylor virgo parrot and hendry wont be commentating neil folds is ok but cmon we cant play without the boys from bbc need a story mode as well something like fifa has done and release should be midnight final of world champion in may unlock legend players tables of different shapes it would be good to see improved commentary for when a player is on a possible 147 break and a more realistic reaction from the audience when the last black is potted some times pro players use there second hand i want to chalk my cue hello mate im really excited theres going to be a next gen console snooker game the 2 games i used to love playing are world snooker championship 2007 and wsc real 2011 i think you have covered all the points i would like to see but little things like chalking your cue the crowd ie not all the same few people in different attire i think that the fine tune option for taking your shot was a little fast in previous games having the balls cleaned also if you missed against ronnie osulivan in previous games he used to clear up every time so i would like that to be better im looking forward to it take care cheers commentary is a good pointits supposed to b officialhow can you not have official commentatorsdennis virgomaybe hendry or ronnie evanshame reallysaying that commentary has been so bad that i turn it off lolmaybe in future i would like pool games like befre in wsc real 11 joe you need to tweet this to the snooker19 people maybe post it on the sub reddit too its not too late for them to add things if needed and they are regularly asking for what people want cracking video mate i agree with a lot of the points made there particularly virgo and dennis hahaha even if one of the features is in there then progress has been made by ripstone i always liked the classic matches adds almost another difficulty playstyles is a must as well unrealistic to see selby taking on every single long red opportunity it needs to have a proper ranking system on the old games ranking used to be done on points accumulated during your career but it makes the game very frustrating you could have a brilliant seasons and still be outside the 16 when is the release date do you know man release date will be april may to coincide with the world championships i suspect i have no inside knowledge though one thing i really want is a statistics page where it keeps track of how many centuries you have made your winloss ratio how many times youve won each tournamentfor a sport where so much is made of the numbers ronnie chasing 1000 centuries hendrys 7 world titles it feels weird to be playing and have no record of how many centuries youve made or your lifetime earnings and things like that basically we need a cuetracker page for our own players what i really wanna see is a good online mode with tournaments and leaderboard which are updated constantly also stats to tell you your highest break and how many 147s youve got also play a friend mode is a must one thing i definitely want is realistic ai shotssome of the shots in wsc 09 are ridiculous i would love to see some real life stadiums this might already be a thing as it would be nice to play at the crucible i clicked on this as soon as i saw it very proud of you for beating your nemesis in that thrilling match well done mate 2440 why dont you use your hand haha do you actually lift the trophy or not i just watched a guy play snooker on a game online for an hour i wish they had a replay option in this game hi mate how are u today mate hope ur ok online is disappointing im not getting random players seems im playing the same players or i need to quit and change the lobby you love a screw back shot dont you 1326 i never see the long shot on this position with that act hahaha theres a lot of things that were in the trailer but isnt in the game players chalking the cue selby walking out into the arena trump and lifting the trophies ronnie strange not having it in game but hopefully can be added in with a patch nice one fairly similar to my own career mode just beat judd today in a decider from 86 down in the same tournament to win my first event haha the longer matches are good imo congrats on winning your first title beating the op selby finally no doubt you wont have to wait so long for the second i started a career with judd trump and simulated all the way to the world championship so i could experience that in game lol just finished my first minisession at 22 against noppon saengkham but i actually made a 147 break myself in the second frame couldnt believe it the tension on the final black was immense well done mate loving the series really well played mate in the next patch i hope they sort out that cut off of the audience loads of clapping then stop they shouldve addressed that when they made the hard shots sound like theyre being slammed into wooden bins congrats on your first title congrats i really want to bump my ai to hard too as currently 1920 wins on tour and mostly too easy hoping for a patch though as no way starting over fantastic win talk about a game of 2 halves first session selby never missed and 2nd he just wasnt the same maybe he can blame the new update for that lol what a comeback its pretty funny that selby always wins the tournaments looks great im almost considering buying a console just to play this game is it worth the purchase lads for ps4 and one more tip as im a snooker player myself go for more safetys early on dont risk to much look at higgins for example and selby they get chances because they force the opening love snooker and ur vids but one idea i had for that game was a more interactive feature ie walk around venue drink go to dressing room or practice in the mid session i know its complicated but that would be wicked its a shame that they dont do trophy presentations in game loving this series the progression feels very genuine i feel like the aggression makes them miss more than they ever did in my opinion we played good 3 frames yesterday trojan

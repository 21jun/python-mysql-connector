is the hallway with dont look behind you written above the door of course you have to look behind you also its a real puzzler sometimes things need to be played backwards etc most things play a part in the story just depends on when you have to play them lol great game i finished the first game i found your channel when you doing a walkthrough of darkness 2 the title of the game reminds me off the scene when shrek and donkey debating about ogre shrekogre has layers thats new level of fear i like horror games but im too scared to play so i wish u do more horror games lol so i can just watch

him to not worry about the vase next thing you know the second time round brad brings him up about the black cat deja vu brad i shouldnt be playing this at 11 at night me i shouldnt be watching this

the voice sounds similar to plague tale innocence the girl and the child good graphics good animation brad stop fucking yelling into the mic jesus chirst i love you but youre to fucking loud you should do face cam when you play horror games been here since silent hill downpour love these scary games and youre always my first to go to for these walkthroughs finally a good game i have been watching you since 2012 when you 1st uploaded resident evil 6 i found your channel back in 2015 with fallout 4 dude ur doing goodwould love to play thisi have the 1st onetoo bad its not steam codes u got i suggest you check out the first game its just as amazing if not more its like a onion its got layers ive been dying for you to do another jump scare video for quite some time now good shit man hopefully the intro will get enough likes to convince you to keep cranking these bad boys out nottheradbrad brad where is the special guest i mean the holy bible lol my body went to sleep after the manicans head fell hey i love your videos been watching since the walking dead survival instincts ok im finally getting in on a new gamelol i have about 6 or 7 of your games i have inprogress this one popped up so here i amlol so far it looks great the who am i i guess as a director or an actor on board the titanic was a movie director i think he was french but im not sure so i think we are in a titaniclike era or shipsans passengers this all fits so far i much prefer these kinds of games you play as opposed to the tired battle games this seems to be more of a terror game than a horror game jumpscares are cheap shots in games and movies terror is the suspense the unnerving much better than blasting your eardrums out on a cheap scare i hope you play more of it seeing brad scared after not playing any thrillers for a while makes me only want to watch it more please throw all the chairs brad horror game goat its chair throwing time anyone know if this game has jumpscares ive been watching since dead space love the channel i watch you play first to decide if a game is for me or not every time this looks like a good time you have to play the first one before this one for it to make sense more more more haha oh im so hyped for this game and cant wait for brad to throw his chair p i hate to do this to you but im scared and curious on how this ends im looking around at everything and listening to everything to not to get jumpscared this is so unsettling to watch btw i love the plague tale innocence walkthrough it is so good i tap on a new episode as fast as possible

the conjuring house i started watching your channel when i was like 8 and that was 5 years ago hey brad i dont remember correctly whn i found you but it sure was long ago 2013 14 ish i hope you do more layers of fear2 i found your channel when you played cod modern warfare the first game was you as a artist its more about fear than anything this gaame is really story driven if you didnt happen to know the first part and its dlc then i dont really think you would get the concept of layer of fear still great to see you playing this and hope we have enpugh likes and views that you would consider making part 2 of this much love 3 this game appears out of nowhere man these developers love their decrepit places as much as they love their stories about artist the mask kinda reminded me

played or read about the first game first one was good and you would have a better understanding of what layers of fear means for these games ive bin with you sense titan fall 2 love your videos but what rilly exites me is when you do inde games especially if its a jonra we dont se much from you something artsy ore platformy ore puzzley the first game really dissapointed me its not that bad the story was interesting enough but it doesnt really live up to the fear aspect graphics are pretty decent though edit can you play fnaf vr help wanted i liked your vr videos when you did them and it was

httpstwittercommkiceandfiremk really like that you have no commentary on this video helps really immerse the viewer thanks i love these kind of games the psychological horror type games anyone notice two girls same like in the shining so creepy as a new game developer i gotta say this game has some intense scenes on a technical level a lot of different things going on loved the first one this 1 is a mind bending experience at certain points 1st game was light years better 11gb and only 3 hours longplay wat the atmosphere is amazing and presentation us awesome great delivery i think it is a set up from the ist game in my opinion only if people knew this isnt a game do you have to play the first game to know whats happening in the second one is it one of them following on games or not cuz i gotta say the second looks a lot better then first game 2201 minutes in and im already getting huge phantom of the opera vides from the director guy not really a great game in short its boring i love the shinning references wait a minute it has different endings mine ended way different and creepy when you finally find out whats going on its sad he lost his sister and his mother thats all i can see now is she dead or was that all in his head or were we her the whole time hmm a few thousand more plays should give me the full answer when i saw rubber johnny i asked to myself a lot of questions about this game why cool a lot of gnosticism in this game i loved so much the game is pretty boring part 1 was much much better a place for refreshment btw im addicted to your plague tale keep it up those graphics wheres gambler with cards all what i need well its awesome to see some new polish games theyve managed to get tony todd and cdpred has keanu d a good time to be a gamer 1458 i literaly saw when you enter that room it was like nope fck it i try found another way i dont know why people dont like this kind of games for me its a real masterpiece even better than the first one if tony todd is not the one to read the eulogy at my funeral im not going i cant watch it every time when he opens doors or turns around my heart is beating fast as hell til the point of fear where i felt a ache anyone else thinks that this new version of layers of fear is much scarier than the one about the painter anyone else notice the se7en references 4127 instant the shining vibes here the sorrow and regrets were too much james died just as i predicted jacksepticeye wont hurry up and finish it so i came here i planed on playing it myself but im still trying to figure out how to do that so i can play it on my channel like the song that plays at 34348 im so sorry you had to play through this boring game i thought this game would be like the first its nowhere near scary full disclosure this game is way more linear than the first one first one was super dynamic with the presentation and you had your surroundings changing every time you turned your back this one felt like a point a point b experience super simple by comparison first one is worth a watch but i cant say that for this onesadly thank you for uploading the gameplay without commentary not like the other favorite popular youtubersgamers cant take this game more seriously i can sit back and enjoy it for once thats the voice of the creepy dude from the final destination series isnt it this game is like onions does the game stink ye no or does it make you cry no or if you leave it in the sun it shrivels and starts spouting little whit hairs no layers bro i just seen this game in the microsoft store and i needed to see some gameplay and i gotta say i appreciate you doe actually showing the game i seen videos of people talking over the game and all thanks bro you have my sub what a name song at time 34352 love your content mk but i cant like this one i struggled to watch up to an hour you arent the issuethis game looks pretty lame imo or maybe its better experienced than watched shrugs i realized now that you actually didnt make walkthrough of the 1st serie of layers of fear i would love to see that because of how good is to watch you play and i think layers of fear 1 was much better cheers that little tune that plays at 2542 is stuck in my head i wish it was a full song and not just that lol 11055 where i las left off so ignore its a shame really i thought this game was a masterpiece but i fear the game will be met with alot of criticism because people didnt understand what types of games these are hopefully it dosnt dissuade bloober team from continuing there work i dont know how in the hell you got to the second reel the part with the door behind you i slammed that goddamned thing closed at least a dozen times and all that ever happens is it tears through anyway and i have to restart i am afraid of ghostsshould i try it or i might get heart attack holy shit i completed the game twice and im still confused af these are some of my question 1 wtf happens to young lily 2 who and what tf director is 3 what happened to their father 4 wtf is that monster thing 5 is it just a theatre the whole time or is it real 6 wtf just happens in the ending the chest stuff 7 is the ship really sunk 8 is their mom died 9 what does the ending mean if some can answer this question please reply i like watching youre videos no mundane chatter and pretending to be scared this is how people play games at home first game was way better anyone else sick to death of british accents in games i certainly am and i am british 12610 oh hey theres a guy standing over there walks towards the guy the monster jumps out holy shit runnnnnnnnn the first game was so good i played it free with gold all im thinking about is that silent hills got cancelled t w e n t y a d s wont even stop me playing this game whack take a shot every time you have to drag open a door ive watched 2 hrs of this and i just dont understand what its supposed to be awesome video and gameplay mk the suspense in this game is wicked why the characters sounds like from a plague tale this is one big ship 00 cant wait for tfs krillin to play this a actors true dilemmagreat playthrough the narrator sounds like tony todd waittheres a second one i really enjoyed your walkthrough i can tell youre a cautious gamer lol thanks for making the video trash only 3 hour expect me to pay 50dollar no thanks maybe when its free on ps plus much better too similar to bioshock you are the best bro first parts of the game then full game then all endings to the game dame the game just came out jesus christ you already have this out youre a living legend only up to 360p i will wait for it to be atleast 720 not even subscribed yet yt recommended suggest this to me which one do you want me to watch 8 year old videos or 25 minutes ago videos this game sucks ass yo fuck this game shits way too scary lol lol why do you play so fast its a horror game man not a speed run you missed so much shit such a cool horror game layers of fear 2 is so cool great job dude you have my respect 1524 1525 the scariest part of the first 15 minutes of this playthrough is with when the game threatens to crash for a split second 15 minutes in and not a single scary moment are my standards too high what a stuttery piece of garbage please go buy a real computer if yourre doing this cool what da fuck i clicked over 70 times in the the timeline and never saw an enemy get shot are there enemies in this game shit jus like the first one i love your reaction its priceless even without voice audio 14938 ok so lily just said father will be leaving the projection room soon so that means those are the directors kids or possibly the actors or as a stretch the actor is james and his dad screened movies for some reason lol so i was playing this stoned af and got so scared i had to stop playing and watch to see all the scary things that will happen i dont know how people dont think this game is scary i liked the first game but this game is dogshit the constant chase and deaths suck okay why is this game considered a horror game im still in the first act but i have not seen no monsters no demons no nothing and even scary just nothing but nonstop every 10ft dumbass puzzles thats all the game has been so far so i hope i didnt make a mistake by buying this game thinking there was going to be some type of demons or creatures and its just going to be a whole bunch of smoke and mirrors and shadows cuz im going to be pissed cool game thanks for sharing layers of fear 1 a painter layers of fear 2 an actor so artsy good work shirrako but the game is more boring than the first one layer of fear 2 best horror team by far is this game better to play on a pc compared to ps4 at 2900 on your video i see combination paperbut on my playthrough i only see a knife why is the combination paper not showing up first one was good ive played it when it was added to game pass at first i thought it was like pt i think if find all give items we can see extended ending are you find mysterious items how many i hate first person ill have to pass as i encountered many horrific games this game actually is not really scary and it is supposed to be called layer of doorsmaybe the only part where you feel something is trying to get you scared is only the hands and bodys trying to get near you but nothing else makes differenceif you really want to get scared play outlast or outlast 2 alone in the dark with your headphones on or case animitronics or even evil dead 2019 game wondering if i should play this on my channel the first time didnt go so well this game gives me headache the first one was better than this one i cant wait to play layers of fear 2 during midnight for full immersion i dont know feels boring to me go to the next room boo did i scare you go to the next room another boo did i scare you not my style built up the scares instead i want to feel the chills not the ever thinking of okey any second now comes a jumpscare boring it didnt seem like there was much to do no you can only really move linearly while things kinda just happen to you i dont think id pay 60 dollars to play but id definitely watch a play through i see it similar to the amazing cryostasis haunted house simulator i hear noob saibots voice 003 is not scary up is down eh pirates music intensifies the first one was better looks scary but not very interesting at least entertainment wise the deeper meaning behind these games are interesting though id rather watch someone play it tbh how can we play the demo i loved the first game but wish there was some type of mechanic like outlast where youre being chased or something not just a walking simulator 226 suddenly the suspiria theme by goblin starts playing first game tormented painter second game tormented actor the way i see it layers of fear tends to focus on torment and twists of the mind of a person working in the art and creativity industry it somehow shows us the dark sides of each industry of an artist can involve in where you deal with series of haunting experiences created by your own nightmares manifested into terror and suffocates to the point where you may break layers of fear must be a franchise that stays in the gaming world for a long time must is this game related to previous one jeez man thats just as scary as the first i hate itbut i love it just as much about time cant wait to play lof 2 time for my pants to turn brown again i hope is better than the first game because it was fucking boring i know a scare is subjective but im sorry this isnt scarey and wouldnt even go into the category of horror i believe less is more and great imagary does not equal terror give me an unspoken shadow in the corner over blood guts and dazzling effects anyday just a lot of horror imagery not very interesting both lighting effect and sound effects are perfect also graphics this man balls is made of steel is that fucking tony todd already sold so another generic horror walking simulator nice graphics but not scary at all so much going on without any reason other than try to scare you it seems like looks like it has the same issues as the first one shit just happens and you just know it its gonna happen from a mile away throws the scare factor right out the window the game also constantly reminds you that whatever happens in front of you isnt really happening which makes it even less scary kinda like you know youre just sitting there and watching shit unfold without any worry of being hurt at all now this is just my opinion but the ui is kinda ruining the immersion for me always being there when you try to interact with something constantly reminding you youre just playing a game just ruins it for me i wish the game gets better and that this gameplay demo doesnt show what the rest few hours are gonna be like but if thats the case i can definitely see it getting boring fast better be better and scarier than the 1st omg i cant wait to play this marvelous gem loved the first game if you dont like what you see take your negative comments somewhere else where them jumpscares at this looks awesome theres literally nothing happening mute the video and watch it and youll realize the entire game is just walking through halls well too many scared scenes are too dense in this demo it really declines the fear and become annoying in the end using headphones was a bad choice i really want to see layer of fear dev making their own hunted house yes first game was amazing is the first game worth to buy on ps4 ive played enough horror movies to know that this will scare the living hell out of me literally im already on the toilet so i wont shit ma pants when you play a horr game you jump out your car and yell im almost sure that freaky deep voice is tony todd who did candy man never forget a voice like that old video i know but im 99 sure both bruce lee and his son died on movie sets which is both creepy and sad the voice actor is tony todd the candyman 1858 thats actually a concept for a horror movie i watched and its sooooo cooool theres a lot of subtlety to this game for example there is a pretty creepy moment jack didnt notice it tho when there is a humanoid shadow on the wall that does not belong to you and nothing to cast such a shadow in the environment its really important to notice every single detail to get maximum spoopage out of these games with you could mute jackcepticeye and just enjoy the game i think you are remembering a movie jack it came out years ago you were probably pretty young i am about ten years older than you and omgoodness was i right its a movie called the others starring nichole kidman it came out in 01 which im pretty sure you would have been around ten or eleven but the movie is soooooo so good at the time im pretty sure it was considered one of the biggest plot twists of all time i dont know if youll see this but if you do you have to look that movie up and watch it you wont be disappointed sending you lots of love and great big hug from ohio is it just me or does the deep man voice sound like tony todd tony todd has 1 of the best voices for horror whether its as candyman in final destination or in this game time is nonexistaaant ya focken slaves you create it for yourself im not sure dont quote me on that sean 2019 honestly i liked the layers of fear 1 better in my opinion im 14 and this i deep me at 100am is 14 i feel attacked sen i gave chase brody but could not find anyone line circled in red also sen laughs about reading the instructions me chase brody hmm why did you write i h b i in morse code am i the only one questioning this i liked jacks seven ages of man reference when listening to the movie reel did you know humpty dumpty was actually a canon and was actually never told whether or not he was an egg he gets a like for the hilarious puns maybe people say i wish i could because they can not get the game to play it and its not many always just simply because they dont want to put in the time thats only my opinion have a good one my fellow flippy bananas this little bastard is growing on me the movie you was talkin abt is the crow game do you remember me singing do you remember jack sings the same song at the same time as me i didnt know he would sing that same song at the same time as me but yet you gotta love jack though will you ever do another episode if anyone knows morse wtf did he say yar captain shit be fucked dead i want that painted on my wall this character stuff keeps coming up over and over againwhen it says build your character it makes you think it was an actor which i think is correct yes this guy understands me i think it is a factor he described little monsters to the t 2108 jack making face but loosens i just realized i was like this the whole time goes right back to making that face a common bloodborne theory is that you are playing as the monster and thats why everyone wants to mob up and kill you just gathering what ive noticed it seems like the main character and their sister lilly grew up on a boat it also seems that there is most likely traumatic memories associated with the boat this is supported by the creature chasing jack resembling someone in a uniform you would likely see in a ship the flashbacks and the mention in the beginning that the actor dislikes ships the whisper of i believe in you reminds me of first game when one of the letters said i believe in you and at the bottom the artist wrote i do not fear fuck everything and run please tell me there is going to be a part 4 i need closure awesome gameplay what an aesthetically impressive yet boring game what the heck is happening omfg you should make a song using the comments did your hair turn into a beard yarrr captain shit be fucked just stopping by to find followers for the cult of lordminion puns are a necessity happy people unwelcome that has to be tony todd voice acting but i think heads are supposed to stay attached t mobile add t mobile can reach new limits 145 when i first arrived at this level i thought i was on the titanic because the way the hallway looked and the water pouring in and the creaking sound if this sounds like a spoiler to you i assure you its not spoiling would mean that i gave way whats coming next or the name of the ship you know the kind of stuff that youtuber gamers would prefer to figure out on their own dont play with her she only likes to play with herself is jack a person that believes the earth is flat im gonna call it here the guy you hear is actually you was i the only one expecting anti to show up rescharcth is muddled up characters lol my frustration when playing between 10200 to 10610 what was the story about the first game did the husband take parts from his wife after she killed herself what happened to the daughter when are you going to finish this seiries 2149 id go back in the telegraph room and tap out on the wire its not a ghost but there is to my memory a horror game where instead of a human fleeing a monster youre an infant monster fleeing pursuing humans wanting to purge you i cant remember the name of the game or even if its out yet but i remember showcasing of a game like that a while back your character could glide or leap far or something and was notably smaller than the humans who were after you aye captain the boat be royally fucked come back from 2 years of not watching jacksepticeye and he look hawt as fuq boi ahahaa ur comments listenin to dat doesnt make it that scary i want to play dis but its creeppyyyyy whos here after man of medan 1846 i think you mean the movie the others haha 5843 she only likes to play with herself 0o i actually sang the phantom of the opera at the same time jack did that was great there actually is a game where you play as a ghost its not really a horror game but theres a little indie rpg game called moonlight ghost where you play as a ghost boy who scares people in order to delay them in their journeys as much as possible the graphics in this one really are something though ive never seen a sky in a game that looked so real before i know im late to the party but like anyone else think the boat looks like the queen mary haha jack looks like my uncle but anyways dude i was actually horrified and having a laughing time this video was as funny af keep doin what you do jack and remeber go all the way and speed is key we might have actually gone to brighton for those who dont know brighton has lots of gay people i do way too much lyricscombing listen to 520 with your eyes closed and just relax for ten seconds fuck i have to watch the first series first finish the game pls layers of fear but jack talks about what he wants in a game i watched this video non stop the whole time and when i saw how long it was i almost choked the fact that this studio made a sequel to this gives me hope for a sequel to the observer once i started this its 3am should i be scared 2439 i got much more excited than i should have to hear a musical reference i thought i was the only one that was like ron when someone said bloody hell lol epilepsy warning in title jack is it me or does the creppy voice sound like tony todd aka the person that played candyman in the 1st candyman movie the music when the child talked reminds me of fable bruces son brandon was killed during the filming of the crow the scene when the bad guys had come for his character and the guys wife someone had either double loaded blanks or accidentally loaded a live round cause the part of him basically being launched out the window was real i was expecting anti to appear at the endguess i was wrong xd please do another one of these jack i beg of you am i the only one who realized within the first 6 mins of the vid that the word is character games like these are more like experiences and not so much games and i adore it lets just say its not an horror game title worth it layers of fear one sucked i mean there were no scary elements and the whole game sucked me at 651am trying not to scream we call that the spinning orgy lmfao i cant lol i should be scared not laughing 812 im literally in the process of making a game with that sort of concept im still in test build category but hopefully sometime in two years ill be able to finish it and maybe jack will play it who knows man it would be a shame if someone would make that sort of game before i get to finish mine people would kill me for stealing the idea but hopefully thus comment will be a way of me proving myself 2626 he sounds like a monster and it scared me the game released 3 days ago here for free dright now im downloading it and playing it asap you should try making a game with unity take the pills shut up your voice is terrible stranger i believe in you jackjesus christ who are you big mood 5550 flashing lights warning for those sensitive to flashing lights continues intermittently for several minutes ok but like the voice actor sounds familiar and one of the voice actors sounded like the we happy few bobbies the voice sounds like tony todd 3850 made me laugh way harder than it should have ffs the chase was so intense seems like a great game ghost pops up out of nowhere jack jesus what was that jesus megoes back 5 seconds to see what the fuck that was also me oh its a ghost that wants to be a dougebag jack we dont get many murders on boats me there was the titanic 1904 it was prey 14 if only it were that easy 754 what is this passpartout xd visage or this i love how you talk about the environment and the graphics sean its so clear that you genuinely appreciate the game and not only that you give an insight in the end i absolutely love that games like these are tough to make and people put in lots of effort and it goes unappreciated its just nice to see someone talk about it also youve got a good eye on lighting yes we have 90 minutes sean because these stories are not very interactive they give off a sense that these could be scary campfire story type as the story goes along you find out what happens but instead of just hearing the story or being told it youre actually getting to visibly immersed into the story also thats why you dont get hurt you know its just a story and theres no need to panic for long layers of fear 1 is in victorian era layers of fear 2 i suggest it takes place in 1920 1930 the word is character did anyone notice that the blanks were 6 but 3 letters 639 character is a nine letter word also at the begging he said that jack had to build up character theres a goosebumps that is exactly what u described for a game idea the main character ends up being the ghost all along its groundbreaking im getting major titanic vibes from this 2445 i knew it was eric eric wad the main antagonist in the phantom of the opera maybe phantom of the opera is trying to kill me sings phantom of the opera i called it when sean picked up the mask 2619 21st night september editnevermindjack said the exact thing 15 seconds later lmao are you gonna finish this game though this is about 2 months old but you mentioned how it would be cool to have a game with the roles reversed and it reminded me of the movie the others carcer is also latin for prison have you ever seen murder she purred it was a murdermystery movie by disney i think where a cat and a dog have to solve the murder im pretty sure that he did see character but there was no act in rescharcth but im glad he noticed that it wasnt it 2414 sean finds white sparkly cracked mask on the table me omg its the phantom of the opera sean a few seconds later maybe the phantom of the opera is trying to kill me me the phantom of the opera is thereinside your mind sean the phantom of the opera is thereinside your mind me oh my gosh 1843 cough kholat cough character would have fit jack i think the letters are jumbled on the other side i love how one minute he is like i want things to be nice and happy sometimes and the next its like gasps tiny anuses i want one of those all with a straight face this man is so chaotic theres a movie like that call the other 1849 also jack you dont need a light outside your door saying recording all they need to do is walk by and hear you screaming the swingig orgy you say ill take it for 50000000000 while watching him introduce the game i started to remember the first game where the baby doll runs into something with a loud thunk and then flys backward in slow motion captions would be great please jack love it fucking mannequins sen walks up to a picture of a cute little boat ok theres a boat me its the titanic check out 7th guest then where you play as a ghost the ss friendship always sinks youre a british pirate you should know this holy moly i scared ss ulysses wouldnt look like this googled it just for fun but good to know anyway the shining reference 4830 nobody anmooring jack is that even a word game jacksepticeye is that even a word voice sleep is a poor excuse me yeah man sleep is for the weak is sean losing his accent or am i just getting used to it jack you made a comment about a game in which you find out you were the monster all along wasnt that the concept of deep sleep 5120 might be a woman might be a kid yes 2 similar figures why yall quoting jack when he says something qoutic weird guy talking what he going to do me kill ya him kill ya the fuuuk jack scary interactions this time id like that jack okay i can actually get hurt by something this timei hate this 10843 isnt it just characters but the letters are messed up we call this sculpture the swinging orgy thanks for that image jack ive been scarred its really nice to sea you again 1428 lmao you had to be there but jack n coke alright anti i got three broken bottles of champagne some random guys head and if you get me the soundtrack to braveheart well have a party 1901 jack is basically describing the film the others where is part 2 check out my play through of the first game if youre interested i cant believe ittheres a sequel jack what a menacing voice me what a sexy voi friend holds up cross did anyone else notice how jacks eyes glowed green through most of the video or is that just me i gonna be honest this game is very very boring i am sorry jack so the kids were stowaways yes 30 mins in nothing happens lost all hope to watch the entire seriesthen boom out of nowhere man this game is good oh its the google ads venom was talking to you oooo tiny anuses i want one of those jackseptic 2019 its so weird when jack doesnt get scared and just making jokes and it makes the game funnier 10219 look the face on jack scared haha i was playing this game too i got scared too i pass that part 4920 gibby the hallway at the beginning of the game reminded me of the hallway at the beginning of bendy and the ink machine i swear to god jack you and your puns i thought i was looking at a high quality bricky thumbnail that scream though 4332 so do u really think the world is flat or just messing around im 14 and this is deeeeep this part killed me yarr captain shit be fucked you have to play more visough 1907 sounds like a certain movie that youre not supposed to talk about the ending of hmmm jack have ya played monstrum thats a horror game on a boat does anyone know what the anagram on the back of the chalk board might mean rescharcth my best and only guess is scratch her the girl and her little brother narrating reminds me of amicia and hugo from the plague tales the shadow looks kinda like a mannequin so maybe youre a mannequin game u r an actor jack am i a director a storyteller a magician lots of water fire continues on unfazed jack theres a boat me titanic the game jack is asking for the kind where youre the ghost all along its been a film the others he should check it out i love phantom of the opera graphics amazing storyline and spooks were a little lame honestly hearing sean say he loves phantom makes me happy it always makes me feel like i know my favorite youtubers better when i find out we have something in common who else is here rather than studying for their exam 2502 when you look at the paper you see a penis your voice completely ruins this 4607 why no rum the great captain jack sparrow lol or in this case mr sean father william mcloughclin oh the thumbnail you look good in smokey makeup woah the wall just disappeared says as the room was suddenly 2 no jack the wall appeared the ghost thing is actually an amazing indie game idea i hope someone uses it jack you are smart as hell i had absolutely no good guesses for the hangman in front and you thought of compacted almost immediately sean i want a game in this setting where im a detective and i go around talking to characters be honest you just want connor nobody jack curses at siri by accident i dont think that was bruce lees case you see i dont think blanks are capable enough of killing someone i believe they can injure them but not kill them oh my god tiny anuses i want one of those when jack said how did we get here i yelled do you have 90 minutes the my dad came in and said wtf dude i got a horrifying brisk ad on a horrifying lets play hmm coincidence i think not the thumbnail is anti and darkipliers weird fandom lovechild i want a horror game where something is following you that fits in with your surroundings so you cant identify the enemy right away its not a game but there was a movie the others 2001 had nicole kidman in it jack i just realized that im like the entire time loosen up your face there sen youre gonna break it continues to make that face 4427 jack the code wouldnt be there if you didnt find it in the first place i think 316 elewator e r i d a n i love phantom of the opera it wasnt a blank someone snuck a real bullet on set i have to say is a cool game but im not quite understanding the storybut just part 1 i laughed way too hard at how casually he turned the music off i played it and i walked into some shit i think i wasnt supposed to lmao jack that was scary that was creepy everyone else its a horror game you lost me when you replaced portugal for spain im 14 and this is deep best line ever 1905 theres a movie like that compared to the 1st game this one is really boring rip brandon lee at 2100 jack alright jacks brain i have shit my pants its the air pressure from the gun 452 character because the player character seems to be an actor based on the first few lines of dialogue anyway very serious moment in the beginning jack every time it says layers whispers of fear jack just so you know unmooring is when a ship raises all but one anchor so you are on a ship worlds quietest boat not with you on it ive been watching his videos so much recently that i cant help but repeat his intro apparently i said it in my sleep yaarr captain shit be fucked jacksepticeye quote of the day oh wow this looks cool game do you remember me jack is either gonna sing michael jackson or quote the lion king jack sings september meooooo so close lol i wonder if the game would have done anything if you typed in sos in morse 4842 that looks like the shining the carpet the trike and the music edit jack thought the same thing and mentioned it right after 4940 just something i noticed i guess twelfth night is a play pretty sure its shakespeare simply put its a love triangle orsino is in love with olivia olivia is in love with a woman named viola dressed as a man and viola is in love with orsino i read a bit of it for english hey jacksepticeye house auntie at 919 you can hear anit laughing omg jack play the silent age its a puzzle with beautiful art and has that time travel aspect exactly like what you mention where the protagonist has a device that travels back and forth time luv that game as well as the storyline and i think you would too build the character is literally building the word character letterbyletter jack thats alotta bottles me oh he must be irish im pretty sure thats a reference to the shining with the tricycle and the exact carpet thats in the hotel it takes place jackstop with the loudness mesays someone who has known for his loudness that moment when everyones videos of layers of fear are being viewed but yours lol nice the whole comment section is full of quotes 4832 not only is that dannys trike from the shining but the carpet is the same as well i feel like horror games should be based on studies of what scares people most game im going to freak you out jackscreams 5 seconds later ooo i like that hi broany sutterlags in gamei gtx user and suttering like helli cant fix this 1657 jack oh look at these boots me what boots anyone else thought the screen was a little dark why did jack never finish observer on the part where he talked about the kid from the shining isnt the carpet in the game the same as the movie jack scares me more than the game when he screams v i wunna look at the sun with my bare eyes jack spedicie 2k19 jack notices that face is scrunched loosen up your face there sean youre going to break it few seconds later jack scrunches faces back up one flintlock pistol 264 pounds of gunpowder 500 rounds of ammunition 100 enemies a 50 caliber flintlock uses 110 grains in a max load this is enough gunpowder for 16800 loads this has been your fun fact for the day jack have you played gone home if not i recommend it all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts william shakespeare as you like it act 2 scene 7 jack yells yar captain sht be fed right when my parents walk in me when i see a shark that does not look like a fish that looks like a nightmare hello jack jack stop the loudness me says you of all people when it comes out u have to play the new blair witch game it looks great jacks voice really like the voice in final fantasy xii tell felix to play this soooo all artists are insane is what i gather from this series lmao layers of fear takes place in the 1920s and layers of fear 2 takes place in 1913 thats the first time ive got more scared of this game than ever before and for that reason im always into classic horror and art of acting so thats incredible amazing well done tara dragoknight this is subnautica as a horror game above water my god his accent is soo hot siri randomly turned on in his letsplay of the first game too wtf did jack literally say the earth is flat youre one of those people i love watching seans long gaming sooo cozy jacksepticeye yes it was brandon lee a terrible tragedy yeah it was brandon lee who was killed during the filming of the crow when jack said come on im not that ugly for some reason i remembered that picture with him where it said upgrade and bitch you cannot upgrade perfection anyone got an 8 minutes ad thats a long ad youtube when he mentions observer sad react u didnt finish it what is everyone doing when watching this ok but inspector gadget vibes from the voice at 2530 still waiting for observer lets play the creepy voice that you hear as the director is the voice acting of tony todd also know ascandyman i knew it was him the second i heard it in this video you cant miss his voice 4121 yeah it was bruce lees son brandon lee at 2526 it sounded too much like tony todd loosen up your face there sean youre gonna break it goes back to the same exact face what happened to we happy few the series great video jack did not expect jack to mention cryostasis sleep of reason thats one of my favorite games navigate back over after jack says i dont like this creepy music sees guy jumpscares so hard i threw my keyboard off my desk at work its a bluetooth cause my office is fancy like that i think the first game was centered in the mid or late 1800s this one might be in the 1920s or earlier 10136 close the door me closing a goddamn door no oops wrong fandom i will say layers of fear 1 has been and always will be the best game ive ever played and im excited to play this tonight just to see the changed and added detail siri responding to the fire joke like an adorable child and sean responding like an adorable dad 3 5904 there is an actual game like that its called murdered soul suspect yes they did that pun on purpose but its setting is very similar to this and i think you may enjoy it just as much also ryan reynolds was born to play deadpool that horror game concept where youre the ghost is a movie but i have forgotten the title method acting can be dangerous for those with unstable minds heath ledger is a good example he was already depressed as it was so maybe spending literal hours laughing at a blank hotel room wall wasnt the best medicine 1842 i dont know about a game but there was a movie like that a while back it had nicole kidman in it also i feel like both bruce lee and his son died in their movies 3rd edit 5348 since its hypothesized that jacks character is a woman i feel like creepy narrator voice is mr hardy and his sister lily died possibly in some game of playacting gone wrong maybe they really did stow away on a ship and now this director is hiring all these women to perfectly replay the past possibly in a way he director narrator would have preferred obviously the devs have never heard of cursor lock its one line of code this game is set in 1929 to 1938 ghostjumps out at sean sean wow this is so cool i love the visuals holy shitrelax yay so excited because jack is the first person im going to watch play layers of fear 2 lets hope this game is as good as the first 10617 they are not real rats they are reel rats i will see myself out jack bescuse me me bok game grumps are we a joke to you sean i didnt really like og layers of fear from a gaming standpoint game devs hold my beer this kind of reminds me of the movie ghost ship this whole gag sound like the mind of jhin the virtuoso the map you saw kinda close to the beginning that is a map of the middle passage it is a slave trade passage and there was also other goods but it was mainly used for slave trading 2015 i had just gotten an add about chicken sandwiches jack i played the original nooot that long agomaybe like 37 years ago unmoor verb gerund or present participle unmooring release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him other youtube playing scary games prepared to get scared jack praise the lighting and the ambient am i the only one who thinks sean looks like a less buff khal drogo 2623 jack sounds like a live action tranformer i know they had a hand in it but i think it was some different developers who took it on and made this one but im not sure dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 sorry jack somehow they made this game even more terrifying omg did anyone else get a bendy and the ink machine vibe from this and also collecting the pieces to make the letters was also kinda in layers of fear when you had to collect the pieces on every level to add to the collection 330 the guy talking is tony todd the legend also mostly known as candyman he watches murder she wrote omfg me and my mom watch that show together as part of our together time i call it the mothermemurdermystery and he likes phantom of the opera my favorite musical man is this guy cool or what mystery man do you remember me remember who you are simba uhnot to be rude but does jacks face look pudgy or did he get teeth taken out or somethingmaybe its his beard lol something on his face looks different watch the others movie with similar concept to the role reversal rarr captain shit be fucked jack is the best pirate just cuz its true doesnt mean that its right jse 2019 actors are the saddest people of all confirmed jacksepticeye 2019 where is da jumpscare list i can hide in the comments let my sister watch tv in my room i came in and she was watching this im proud i feel like jack is wearing eyeliner or shadow or something in the thumbnail and is actually pulling it off somehow has the irish man forgotten his own characters anyone else upset jack didnt go up to that painting in the dark at 4937 it bothered me alot after seeing it glow as soon as he turned alright bloodborne 2 i see you were on a ship now 3117 dont you mean i cant go all the way keep on a dancing the voice kind of sounds like venom omg thats tony todds voice narration candyman deep voice man sounds like ulysses from fallout new vegas lars of fr 2 1709 your final destination is ssbu i guess the part with lights and mirrors was just a bit of selfreflection layers of fear inheritance you should play this one as well it about the daughter and how she i dealing with her parents honestly this is so hard to watch with the amount of ads throughout the video its so jarring such a badass preview picture can i have it o anyone else loving when he sang old town road he means a game like the movie the others with nicole kidman commenting before the video but damn that thumbnail he looks dothraki dont mind me just hiding in the comments section and waiting for glitch boi the entire puzzle on the back of the black board is paidactor jack oo tiny anuses i want one of those mejack why dont you the backwards man the backwards man no one can walk as fast as i can no one can walk as fast as i can nobody literally no one jack bagels are tiny anuses a boat makes a better horror theme than a big house why cause your in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight watching a horror film is one thing but watching a horror video game is so much better i love feeling submerged in the atmosphere and the story sleep is a poor excuse and so are you haha sounds like my anxiety kicking in to moor a boat is to tie it to the docks at a port so the unmooring would be the boat leaving the docks and port its the beginning of the journey jack you fucking dumbass thats a spotlight not mounted binoculars aww a sad puppet man tickle tickle awwwww jacks so precious jackaboy be lookin like a far cry villain in the thumbnail i bet you the rest of the hangman thin on the back will say character uhh hey im the one who fixed that vase and i would happily take you up on those drinks in the first game u couldent crouch and run in this one u can xd yea its realated the last game the artist said when i finishd the painting i almost had it this time a women said u almost had it so yeah with the fake sun reminds me of the pirates of the caribbean ride at disney wait disney dont have the real sun what the hell disney i feel ive been lied to this whole time ahhh sometimes you have to make your own fun normal people sleep is a poor excuse jack a intellectual sleep is for the weak sos in morse code is and repeat 1841 i was thinking the same thing earlier like you can only see them if they made a load noise or something really you havent even finished observer where do you get off from playing layers of fear 2 i bought the first game because of you and i am still to scared to completely finish it playing it with a friend who didnt know the story line was worse because i kept scaring her with spoilers of impending doom and ended up scaring myself as well the first game was way better tbh gasp ohh tiny anuses i want one of those better lay off that horse dildo bud the guy speaking over the intercom in the beginning sounded kinda like noob saibot from mortal kombat return of the obra dinn is kind of a detective game in a shape setting but has a very different pointalismlike artstyle its by the same guy that made papers please if i recall correctly i enjoyed it although kind of short that mans voice in the house is actor tony todd remember him playing candyman or ben in the 1990s night of the living dead its sad about brandon lee unmooring means kinda like unbind so its saying the unbinding essentially sorry if this is not helpful anyone know where his playthroughs are for the first layer of fear 3628 does anyone know what the title of the song playing in the background is jacksepticeye you are my favorite youtuberi subscribe to your channel after this i now have a fear of mannequins the mouse sensitivity really is too fast and also the characters walking speed and because of that you have missed things in this part 553 its stanislavskis method of creating a character there are 7 questions jack little nightmares are game where u are monster and bad and everyone want to kill u accidentally just skipped a minute and a half into the vid and he hasnt clicked on strait game your hair is no green ok so tiny ass holes me i am bi dose that mean jack in mind i want to fuck it the resident evil vibes im getting from this tho just cause its true doesnt mean that its right i feel blessed jack just sang a bit of straight white man heck yi unmoor cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the thumbnail made sean look like a pirate because jack sparrow had like black makeup around his eyes which kinda sean had in the thumbnail this is one of the few games that give me goosebumps kewl i think tony todd was doing the voice as he awoke at the beginning jack wearing eyeliner in the thumbnail oh lawd 1900 i dont know if theres been a game like that but i know for sure theres a really good mystery movie called the others with an extremely similar scenario it would be a great idea but it would seem as if you were to copy the ideal am i the only one that saw a person at 4036 jack says he finds nothing really scary anymore because he played a lot of horror games when something jump scares him jack oh fucking jesus boy these graphics sure are good look at these tiny details wait why am i noticing tiny details it must be because im really fucking bored with the game 1003 jack stop calling me out some people just want to be talented without the effort xd jack u look like dad of boi with extra hair thank you for the awesome videos you make 0920 hahahaha 5555 dont think i like this game too silent not atmospheric for its environment loose conversation audios that make no sense theres barely any gameplay elements in this 5840 she likes to play with herself 5910 definitely would be more fun than this 904 that would be a game called off why did the chicken cross the road hoodini turn up the game volume ya potato was lof 1 the one with the pigs or whatever i dont remember or like the artist who used weird things in a painting jack i played the original about a year ago subscribers its been 3 years sean first it was an artist now its actors mayday mayday i would like a chicken sandwich and four loaves of bread honestly big mood is no one going to mention the weird coloring from jacks neck to his head or his time is all over the place to me in the beginning i had to turn on captions because i cant hear over the sound of me eating jack reads description of what sounds suspiciously similar to a casket 4000 also jack am i a magician when did bandit from r6s start a youtube channel that man must be an onion at 658 im gonna turn this boat to a helicopter wait what is it just me or does this second game suck 3118 to fucking victory town did anyones video glitch out too or is that a just me thing dude you look like a metal head in the thumbnail i love it ive never seen a video of his but jack looks like jason momoa in the thumbnail so just wanted to let yall know ok back to scrolling through my recommended for like 12 hours bye jacks comment section it always amazes me how fast is jack to adapt his voice to match the character 1858 theres a movie and its called the others i literally started singing do you remember right before jack and it freaked me out a playthrough love it seems a forgotton art now the little boy voice and the girl is like amicia and hugo from the the plague tale jack plays scary game and instead of being scared goes where am i hears mysterious creepy voice and instead of being scared wonders whos talkin to me wall vagina jack why is that your first thought more like say the line bart the thumbnail looks like brickyorchid i got lucky managed to do the chase segment in one go i also closed all the doors it actually slows it down not for long but long enough yarr captain shit be fucked i cant breathe seanwhat would you do in this situation mei dont even know what situation im even in first layers of fear took place in the 1920s the dlc inheritance took place in the 1960s thisi have no idea lol is it just me or is the first lof waaay more interesting and fun i think its really ironic that i got an irish spring body wash commercial theres a boat jack jack wake up jack rose titanic actually you said a h in morse code xd me and jack think alike im 14 but i like old tv shows me and jack both said this gives a murder she wrote vine and it does actually murder she wrote is a old tv show it still shows right now yes it was brandon lee bruce lees son jack sees bagels first thought oh food nice what comes out of his mouth t i n y a n u s e s you were thinking of brandon lee bruce lees son he died while filming the crow apparently a live 44 cal bullet was found inside his body during the autopsy so theres a lot of mystery surrounding his death when he spun the wheel around and said im gonna turn this boat into a helicopter that made me laugh harder then ive laughed in god knows how long 5600 dont play with strangers that actually answered a lot of questions i made the other choice and i got different dialogue deep sleep is a game where spoiler alert the player turns out to be the monster i made sure to play thru the game first before watching others i am so glad someone else was disturbed by the metronome at the start there are a lot more secret stuff in this game in particular try looking out the telescope in your cabin for 42 seconds dont move while doing so so i think the tricycle is actually a direct nod at the shining because the carpet matches the carpet from the hallway scene if you look closely 2105 the smolder it says it layers of fear 1 xd i know im late but jack if you want a game where you find out youre the monster at the end of the horror fun try the deep sleep by scriptwelder flash game find it on armorgames or wherever when jack picked up the walking cane and the dialogue read he was broken disfigured it reminded me of darkiplier while i was watching this several tiny spiders kept crawling up onto the wall next to my face and scared the crap out of me especially since the lighting in the room at the moment is dim and sort of ominous and theres a thunderstorm outside hundreds of years ago the lowest level of mankind the earth is flat thats why we walk straight 2018 earth is round and a sphere 2019 the highest level so far the fukn ert iz flut 2550 omg its the ghost of our beloved alan rickman snape himself haunts the boat 10552 jack are you sure thats a sailor if he is this then the servise on that boat is not really nice and you should totally get a refund thats actually a story we read the splay in english this year when will you ever finish observer youtube well let you know if anyone youve subscribed to uploads a new video my internet you get to know when i decide you get to already watched dazblack played thisso now im prepared for the spooks that demon voice guy sounds like the guy from the candyman movies sorry sean but we have had murder horror themes on boats resident evil revelations and resident evil 7 it looks like the titanic a little bit the eyeliner in the thumbnail makes you like like a pirate haha yes youre right jack it was bruce lees son brandon who was shot on the movie set 831 when jack realized the corridor changed like the previous game ah shit here we go again jacksepticeye 2019 this thumbnail is captivating just lost all my respect time is the enemy startling games can be scary games if you are like me and get startled by everything its so bad i have told my bf that if he can to warn me before he sneezes while i am driving i am very embarrassed by being startled by everything but my bf finds it hilarious while i am playing horror games game the door sen fuck siri i dont understand what you are saying no they didnt talk like that they usually were quite intelligent groups of people so sorry but you look so good in the thumbnail wtf idk how but that dark circle under your eye made you look good lmao i mean i love you hair sean revert means to restart i am sorry to point this out but you literally said restarting the roles edit at around 1920 oooo tiny anuses i want one me are you implying yours is big a few basics brandon lee what happened was that the gun used for the scene still had a fragment of a dummy bullet used for a closeup lodged inside the barrel when the blank went off the fragment was fired killing brandon lee the method method acting is the practice of finding emotional grounding allowing you to more closely simulate what the character should feel we actors dont really relive our emotions or become our characters were crazy enough as it is the first step is to abandon the idea that pretending is somehow shameful or childish to recapture the drive we had when we played cops and robbers or cowboys and indians and didnt care who saw us or how silly we might look the second part is to identify the emotional core of the character and match it up with emotional memories of our own we are not the characters nor can we feel what they would but we can simulate it very closely by drawing on our own memories then running our bodies thro jack we dont often get horror things on boats me gets re7 vibes funny that jack mentioned the shining did yall notice the carpet in the room beyond the wall it was the carpet in the overlook hotel hotel in the shining these fucking strobe lights i took piano lessons as a child however you really need long fingers and adult sized hands and my hands are the size of a kindergarten child and im like 31 its stopped me from playing a lot of instruments actually i played the flute as well i also have camptodactyly in my left pinky and it is permanently curved inwards which also stops me from playing a lot of instruments i took guitar but my hand size and my deformed pink put an end to that i can barely play the flute the ocarina is really the only instrument i can play well due to it being small 851im eating a bagel right now its not a game but i feel like based on your comments around 1900 youd like the movie the others not sure if its obvious or not but that act it spells out character im pretty sure then again im jumping to conclusions d yarr captain shit be fucked jackspediceye 2019 1850 ever played off i dont know if anyone will see this but a good flip in perspectives in a horror game is observer you are not a ghost per se in this game but perhaps something just as horrible its difficult to say much more without spoiling any story though 827 here we go again does anyone else think theres a possibility that youre playing as a woman when you enter the room with the projector most of the clothes look like womens clothing also that orange red and black carpet is from the shining there was kinda a ghost game i can remember called geist for the gamecube way back when although the being a ghost wasnt a surprise or anything in that but its the only thing similar i can think of to the been a ghost the whole time idea hey sean upload another happy wheels cause i miss the series hahaha why is jack wearing eyeliner someone please tell me now is he going into a phase jacklooks at a fake moon this fake sun reminds me of pirates of the caribbean unmooring is a term used with a boat yall the amount of headspace ads are stressing me out more than the scary video you cant be really dead if you were dead all along insidejacksepticeye 2019 demon voice speaking me is that noob saibot the dude with the creepy voice sounds like soundwave from transformers this is bill he is being haunted by ghosts one like kills one ghost 2109 sean i just realised my face is like this all the time loosen your face sean your gonna break it sean proceeds to have a very concentrated face 1010 me with art a really upbeat successful singer so nathan sharp you are a lost actor that doesnt know where they want to go anymore the more they go they find being controlled by there director being a puppet and as it goes you fell getting uglier and not being worthy or this jobthat you used to love so much is my theory i think the creepy voice guy is tony todd think hes best known among sci fi fans for his various star trek roles 2537 doesnt that sound a little bit like auto from walle no just me ok if you wanted a spooky game set on a boat play the return of the obra din im not just saying this because i want to see your reaction to the game itself for anyone wanting to learn piano i strongly suggest rather than learning chords or notes to learn specific songs first using piano synthesias first 1840 does bioshock infinite count game you are an actor jack so am i like some kind of director or something or a storyteller theres a game called cry of fear its a tad old but the description fits the frame bet this comment wont be liked by jack 700 roll credits that game idea is a move called the others for some reason i cant get into the game like its just boring for me jack is not boring at all its just the slow not scary game he didnt notice when the girl said i believe in you the flower was gone anyone notice how siri on seans watch sounds exactly like morgana from merlin dammit jack whyd you have to go and be a flat earther lmao just kidding also love your new do i havent seen ya videos in a little while and its amazing cuz i just so happened to have cut my hair in a similar fashion i knew i was irish at heart play terraria why does that sound like noob saibot from mk11 when you dont flip over 90 of the things you pick up so you miss a large portion of story line than say i have no idea whats happening lol in the first room it says no stowaways will be tolerated than you saw a report that says i saw a black figure maybe a child it say see red circle the circle was around the area where they saw a small child so far youve built 610th of your character hractr the scrabbled word so far spells scratcher with a extra h possibly more letters to come youve relived the security forces chasing the children hence the dying part aswell as the bullets and bullet holes in the first door you closed the directory was the male voice whos also controlling the manechines the male child is dead aswell as the little girl this is my understanding so far 1902 i think thats layers of fear 1 its quite a spooky game and in the end you find out that you are the one who caused everything and denied your wife and all that shit that at the end of the day your wife is innocent and you created a monster out of her in your head deep voice talking suspiciously do you remember me the 21st night of september jack the 21st night of september that made me so happy the voice telling you what to do sounds like the candyman jack do you think the world is actually flat 2621 as soon as he said that the song earthwind fire poped in my head and seconds later jack starts singing it we are all dead try and pove me wrong i dare you the chase scene is scary jack the game your thinking of wee your the ghost or monster is prey you in the end are the like main monster 2436 amazing i love dat musical 10306 this section is seeking like annoying still cant feel fear but great graphics i know they had a hand in it but i think it was some different developers who took it on and made this one but im not sure dont quote me on that sean the demon voice sounds like moofasa this game is so boring what a waste of graphics these are alot of peter pan references 2446 sean you just made my whole day i love that musical and the phantom 3049 is a quote from peter pan thats the quote from peter pan google unmooring cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him i believe in the shit thats in my pants right now oh my lord that had me dead 852 do you really want that unmoorunmooring releasing the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him 500 character did you put on eyeshadow for the thumbmail the person telling jack not to sleep in the beginning sounds like noob saibot from mortal kombat 11 jack ive left your channel for awhile now almost a full year when i came back the green was gone the stubby short beard was gone ans the almost normal length hair was also gone your content is as good as it always was but im not sure i like the new look ive been here since 2mil a long time ive seen you change your look but not your personality and i love that about you but bring the green back its really easy to scare me im an aspie so its 1am rn why am i watching this omg so boring i just cant stomach games like this i mean scenery and atmosphere are important but you need some sort of action in a game does he ever realize that his character is an actor jack i played this about a year ago me you played layers of fear 1 in october 2016 makes sense the deep voice in the game sounds like venom who else thinks that ew hes so fucking ugly this shit right here is why i hate instadeath chase mechanics in an otherwise really atmospheric cool horror game especially when the controls arent meant for it just let it be what it is and what youre best at dont add annoying frustrating cliches math class exercise with stuff we learnt last year on the board teacher do you remember me no i do not 2620 1907 the game is already out its called we happy few i think you would enjoy it 1850 theres a movie the others dont know about a game tho 1917 yeah please someone make a game like that or ill have to 957 yeah i use to be like you i use to want to be able to do things without putting the time and hours into perfecting it im still like that now also i am on the autism spectrum so its a lot harder to do certain things even when i really really really want to do it and yes i will eventually do it coz im easily influenced by strong desires but i dont under why im so easily influenced sometimes so thats a problem also i cant always stand up for myself im a doormat 2510 thank you woah just had a major deja vu moment at about 2040 felt like id watched about ten fifteen seconds before like about a month or so ago when looking for a different video and accidentally clicked here instead does that make sense anyway loving jacks play through everything is scary but your the ghost sixth sense intensifies 4443 if only locks worked like that 451 i think the word is character brandon lee bruce lees son fyi 5507 that was not a manicom can i just say how awesome it is to hear tony todd in this game his voice is perfect i did some research and apparently the fire extinguishers come from the late 1950s so thats when the game takes place jack play dollhouse just came out in full version also horror and i played the beta and its awesome the best polish game watching the film in the beginning reminded me of the la devotee film in the music video im 14 and this is deep i fckin lost my shit i want a game like this where i am a detective thats basically call of chtulu you should try it jack jacksean sean plzhey do it for the fans do it for uswe have been sitting back waiting just waiting for anti plz bring him back plz i ask from my side of the world vry very politely plz bring him back please please 253 yes it is a word unmoor verb gerund or present participle unmooring release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him its more realistic if the locked door gives a icon or it could be open from other side there is a movie kind of like your idea i played the first layers of fear like a year ago first video posted in october 2016 thats almost 3 years jackaboy lol the voice that keeps talking reminds me of the voice actor that plays jhin from league of legends in the room with the bike 4845 the carpet is actually the same as the one from the shining polish games 3 bottles and paintbrushes very familiar if i do say so myself like if you remember layers of fear 1 ill try to break the pattern why do i feel like layers of feel is a smoking commercial lol the real cost im just as confused as the first game love that for me the guy speaking in the film reel sounds like malcolm mcdowell and now im reminded of fallout this one seems to be from sometime between 1890 and 1940 or thats the feeling i get from the setting im probably wrong about that since i am not too familiar with the designs of fire extinguishers and ship designs of the earlytomid 1900s i dont recall there being much if anything that could indicate the time for the first one i think that the character you play as is an actor and this director guy hired him across the sea this director in particular is very strict and needs everything to be perfect hence when you had to place the chair on the moving thingy correctly this actor is afraid to upset this director and wants to build his character so he can please the director also i think the two voices who were playing together as pirates were probably stowaways on the ship and if you remember there were no exceptions for stowaways so the older voice kept trying to play with the younger voice in order to get them to behave and stay quiet on the boat thats just what i think if you have anything else to add please let me know jack tiny asses i want one of those hmmmmmmm wow your phone wanted to get into the video this time its not the lamp this time he side it oh how did i know you would say 90minutes mayday mayday i would like a chicken sandwichsean 2k19 so far ive loved this whole game the monster part i actually didnt really like as much as the rest but i loved the quotes it gave when you died its an actor going through all the movies hes acted im pretty sure it was character 36513652 jack reading the letter me listening jack i gave chase brody me wait one of your alter egos is in the game also me looks at screen reads over letter oh you added the brody part okay but sean looks amazing in the thumbnail jack jack jack try closing all the doors huhthis was a bit different for me some posters were different the code to the lock was certainly different and some of the scares here didnt happen for me at all clever game dont play with her she only likes to play with herself when he said he wanted a game where you okay as the monsterghost the whole time i thought of this game on cool math i used to play called dont look back youre better without a beard jack i think the game prey have u as the bad guy xd idk tbh i can teach you to play the piano if your in canada is it just me or jack looks like bricky orchide 8 in the thumbnail phantom of the opera is so gooooood maniquins being birthed from the wall vagina jse 2019 am i on a boat nice tree house lol this game feels like anti should play it im just giving my opinion why does the voice in the characters head sound like venom the symbiote when you think your a girl but your not sure heydo you likeboats 1900 i think prey is that kind of game but im not very sure i think that little nightmares is the game you were referring to jack the shadow reminds me of eric from that 70s show he better not fake shoot me so should he real shoot you then 3612 jack you cant shoot someone with something that doesnt exist jack maybe i can actually morse also jack but i cant cause im an iiidot 1901 thats the movie the others 3050 their voices reminds me of 2 main protagonists in a plague tale innocent for some reason sean this stuff doesnt scare me anymore 20 something minutes in the only thing i believe in is the shit in my pants right now no one commented the jumpscares time stamps game your an actor act blah blah blah sean am i a director or smt game am i a joke to you am i the only one that saw that hallway and instantly thought holy shit hes on a haunted version of the titanic amazing video amazing game amazing graphics amazing ads wait no cancel that last one please unmooring cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected hence the head i havent watched u for so long originally i hated your look but now its kinda growing on me im going to take your head and shove it up his ass was that a hancock reference that is a sexyfrightening thumbnail sextening if you will no one literally no one at all jesus chris himself triggered people watching this its a ship silent hills shattered memories has the concept of you being the ghost who noticed the object at 10952 before the world told you who you should be do you remember who you were i didnt know why this quote stuck to me the witchs house is liek that everything is trying to kill u but it turns out u were the bad guy all along jack that wasnt his son that was how bruce lee himself died i kind of got the feeling in the middle of the video that you are playing as a mannequin looked that way when the character was casting a shadow on the wall its ok jack i appreciate the fan joke the guy talking at 5004 reminds me of tony todd aka the guy from candyman editomg it is him i feel that i wanna act cause my soul would speak the unmooring is that even a word fun fact yes when you begin a voyage or a ship ride the first step is to untie or in nautical terms unmoor the ship so you can disembark or leave the dock hence why the beginning is the unmooring not trying to be a smartss im just letting you guys and girls know 3 4842 im

i a director 23min in and its a lot of boring shit tbh okay boys im going in fullscreen wish me luck resident evil revelations was on a boat it was pretty scary lol the trippiest game ever i think the movie the others had an ending where the main characters turned out to be the ghosts better than scary mansion istrapped with a ghost in an steam boatlol yar captain shit be fucked jse 2019 is jacksepticeye a flat erther mentioning the phantom of the opera between 24312446 made my day it is a fantastic movie with splendid extraordinary music a job welldone masterpiece forever since childhood it is a memory and will never be forgotten by me i sing songs from it even now as well as watch the movie over and over again sometimes i love it and sean mentioning about it made my day im glad he enjoys it and that he knows about it too it makes me happy 3 moorings are the ropes that hold the ship to the dock put the hours in and do it he talks of piano he talks like a true man he talks like an artist hooray 1900 i think that game is called spec ops the line jack p 4833 the corridor is from the shinning anyone seen the trial of charlotte doyle that has ships aunt murder and mystery so jack ive been playing piano for over ten years and would love to play drums so we should just together and ill teach you piano and you can teach me drums ok cool wasnt the icarus the sister ship of the titanic that also went down i am not sure 1834 i wish there would be a game like that where ur the monster and thats why everything is so crazy ahem little nightmares what if this was vr hey there random viewer are you in the comment section to hide from scares me to i hope you have a good day good man youre mourning whats your name james no mistaking that voice tony todd ok now i shit my pants when jack said he wanted a deceive game where you go around and talk to characters all i thought was danganronpa honestly i want him to play it that might be interesting jacksepticeye hay guys look layers of fear 2 me eating my snack me this should be good 925 der deutsche correspondent was a german newspaper published in baltimore from 1841 until 1918 that means the game should take place in this timeperiod and also according to that map you found combined with the paper the ship should be on the route between us east coast and africa nice little detail wonder if anti will return in this series i think your youtubes favorite gaming channel you get monetized even when you swear he thought it would be funny to load a blank gun to his head and died of stupided 3652 is it just me or does that give anyone else a anti vibe jack doesnt usually just pop out an egos name he is quoting merchant of venice by william shakespeare 754 so does anyone else think lily talks like shakespeare aaaand now i need jack to make a phantom of the opera cover 1446 hey siri stop interrupting my lets plays siri i do not know how to respond to that person next to jack ugh 90 minutes still the train comes how did i get here jack well jack jokingly the truth is the bottom of the page is torn off thats so deep me i mean it cant be that deep the bottom was taken out i love your videos so much jack especially loving the horror games layers of fear 2 seems to be very promising 255 jack unmooring is that even a word me yes it means to release the moorings of a vessel or cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected youre welcome sean the code for the safe is everywhere brendon urie wait wtf is the code guesses the code and gets it right he attacc he protecc but most importantly anti be bacc did no one else hear the creepy exhale i heard it at 17 minutes and 20 seconds this has to be marks nightmare if you want a game with an upbeat successful musician get someone to make a game with lucio from overwach jack oh a ball me i love balls 2533 sounds like the dude with the red hair and tats on his face from jak 3 lol everytime there is a jumpscare instead of getting scared i laugh at jacks reactions i had a similar idea to jacks concerning a game where youre the monster about 5 mins before he brought it up great minds think alike p did he seriously just said he used to watch murder she wrote me and my mom still watch that today nice to see youre a man of culture as well jack unmoorunmooring 1 to release from or as if from moorings 2 nautical to release a ship from all but one anchor watch this in 125x its sounds normal and saves time too lol everyone come to my channel i do fortnite wins and fails 3830 cannon fires jack walks up arrrgggggghhhh shit be fucked captain so i screanshot the mirror before it brakes theres a ghost kid behind you thats why it broke lol didnt want to end up in hell then why are you wanting to go down ya know i hate scary games but here i amand now im scared of elevatorsagainthat elevator is evil that game idea was in silent hill downpour me and jack both collectively share 1 brain cell everything im thinking he says jack i have to give you props on this thumbnail its really cool my friend you just earned yourself a new subscriber jack when he dont do all he kan do to get the video op 1st is ok you set in her coming to a set of 2 open doors jack took the first open door on his leftthis was not the correct way to the poop deck and jack knew it perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop by the lounge first just to admire it whether intentional or not im enjoying the occasional prop hunt references jacksepticeye a flatearther confirmed at 2522 915 wasnt expecting an answer was he something spooky happens ad pops up doordash is the new crave layers upon layers onions have layers yarr captain shit be fucked jse 2k19 is this the return of anti 3310 almost sounds like the mermaid song from harry potter when he opens the egg under water in the bathroom im sure i saw a picture of anti at like 2000 2020 i just cant find it again wtf layers of fear 1 was all about an artist going through his own depression yeah im a depressed artist and all but i dont paint canvases with my own blood and skin this narrator sounds like the one from merlin lmao sean mispronounced britain enters room me huh the music kinda sounds like the start of old town road jack a couple of seconds later this sounds like im gonna take my horse to the old town road tries to open door in another room do you remember me 21st night of september jack a couple of seconds later 21st night of september i swear to god jack stop stealing my jokes 4150 yes it was bruce lees son brandon lee on the set of the crow that awesome voice actor that played the narrator is the same guy that played the fallen in transformers revenge of the fallen 1159 jack sees searchlight thinks its a telescope the scariest game in forever 2 jack hiveswap act 2 has been confirmed will you play it when it comes out jack ni ni ni wall street journal write that down write that down as someone currently binging the show i love the fact that jack has watched murder she wrote also im totally enjoying the vintage luxury travel vibes at the start of the game hears bang in a horror game jack fuckin rats i played and beat the first game at least my biggest fan got on board me blow him away with likes and subscribers editwoah the wall just disappeared mejack it appeared edit 2also jack it is a monstrosity and it wants the d jack i actually want something to come and kill me game be careful what you wish for ugh i hate when things chase me in gamessssddndnnd a game where youre the monster wasnt scanner sombre like that you go through a cave with nothing but a scanner to guide you and the scanner sorta threw colourful dots everywhere where there was a surface to cling to and you had to explore everything that way game based on the idea you mentioned at 1846 actually exists it is called skyhill jack im so glad you love phantom of the opera as much as me ps you have a great singing voice be come an actor hint hint i want a horror game thats just a persons daily life but all the visualmusical cues and the notes and all are just made so scary are they saying jacks a poor excuse or are they saying he is a sleep 246 but is it though the cane was probably about the crooked man werent you an upbeat character in bendy and the ink machine anyone miss the green haired lad pretty hard critiqe manaquins in boiler room silent film metropolis will help yer your right the film was the crow brilliant film is it warm in there jack or is it just you dudunce tt k ill shut up now lol just as i was thinking man this game isnt that scary the first game was scarier the fucking mannequinns starts moving and the thing starts chasing you bloody hell who watched layers of fear before going here i sure did im guessing the character is the director and he ended up getting one of his actors killed or something like that buhjeezles i was eating some spicy tuna sean with some cocacola coke zere same great coke taste with no suger now with a hint of added vanilla i wonder if there will be multiple endings on this one too im back this probably takes place around 1910 style is alot like the titanic jack i am plaing a sad artist again i want to play a game were i am a happy musician me artist can be happy thinks back to many famous artists never mind that eould be like asking a mime to talk 4924 i laughed and i am not sorry 4455 its leviohsah not leviohsaw sounds like hermione granger omg layers of fear 2 two tvu it is amazing titanic horror themed hello this game feels really flat and empty tbh sure it looks great but its for the most part just perrendered lighting and you walk around looking at shit in the environment coupled with lack luster and predictable jump scares to me this just feels like a look at how pretty we can get the graphics demo of the engine rather than an actual game 2527 the director in this game sounds an awful lot like twoface from the 90s batman cartoon anybody else hear it jack ew i though they were real rats me its a video game jack yells at fire stop right there criminal scum 817 where i play a really upbeat musician layers of fear 3 announced would fit the theme a painter an actor a logical third step is a musician me oh a bagel jack oh tiny anuses me dont play with her jack okay well she only likes to play with herself hmm i doubt anyone will read this but if you play league of legends is it just me or is that voice the world is a stage sound very much like jhin you will learn what beauty truly is jacksepticeye best game reviewer of the century 10847 you probably know this already but the letters spell out characters i think these kids are stowaways great to see trivia boys made it so far after his debut on game grumps i see your bo burnham reference the name suggests you shouldnt watch at night i watch a midnight i got 2 ads in 15minutes are you fucking serious youtube what we know so far our character is an actor on a ship there are 2 stowaways one of which is a small child named james his sister lily may have been shot the woman mannequin in the hat presumably there is something unnatural about the ship despite their being many human inhabitants thank you for coming to my tedtalk me says layers hears glass crash and a car yowl as jack bursts in the door jack of fear 1858 you just described the others a horror movie o game layers upon layers jack whispers into microphone fearrrr me oh wow he gonna get chased soon no one not a single soul literally no living form jack well do you have 90 minutes can you play game roblox its cool game plsss play game roblox i had 6 ads really cmon sean surely you do know the morse code for sos thats the first thing i tried when i came to the morse code room and it gave me an achievement sos creepy whisper i believe in you me i believe i believe i believe in steve in steve oh yeah that thumbnail though sen looks sexy af in eyeliner just sayin lol idk about a game but theres a movie to where a family realizes that they are ghosts and have to help the family whos alive that lives in their house now and themselves from their murderer i forgot the name of the movie tho siri is too speechless throughout all these years now she had spoken it took me forever but i finally realized that the guy talking with the really deep voice is the actor who played the candyman in the candyman horror movies your mic is peaking a bit its cutting out the top end lower the mic peak and up compression the in game sound needs to be turned up badly i keep getting my head screamed off by jack when i try to turn up the volume to hear the sound effects of the game haha sean how do u not know the most basic of all morse code even children know it sos signal for help 1527 jack ugh that does not look like a fish that looks like a nightmare me you got a problem with my family ps thats a whale very cool video 1437 i cant just the whole situation siri tell fire to stop and apologies is the only way to describe that why is his hair black again just cause its true doesnt mean that its right bo burnham reference hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is what you call a fear of long words us phone users cant hide in the comments we dont get that luxury its not fair talks about game that reverts roles sean had literally played 5 games thats done this you miss the boat in the telescope sen the world is a stage me the world is a vampire 1830 theres a game called homesick not gonna spoil it but is has something of a similar twist to that great video jackspeticeye call of cthulhu is similar to this games atmosphere and you play a detective check it out d on a note one voice the deep one like at the beginning and where he said do you remember who you are in there sounds very similar if not the same as the actor who was candyman and final destination movies i know i shouldnt do comparisons but i find it fascinating and awesome i just realized im like this the entire time loosen up your face there sean youre gonna break it continues to make face anybody else notice that youtube out 2 adds now ok this is giving me creepy thoughts already and cool video petition to buy jack a recording sign who in that voice in the beginning sounds like tony todd o0 jack pleaseeee find a copy and do a lets play of criostasus im no doctor but heads are supposed to be attached to your shoulders the gaelic gladiator does not care for science charactor yard captain shit be fucked this game reminds me of hello neighbor because of the mannequins 10941 in the subtitles it spells morning as mourning i love watching jack aw on the graphics and engine of layer of fear 2 for an hour sorry jack but holy crap this game is boring i hesitate to even call it a game as it just seems to be walking simulator the only 2 parts that genuinely interested me were that white room with the ink painting birthing the thing and the chase creature audio duringalthough immediately ruined by the poor interaction mechanic now the first layers of fear had an actual characterprotagonist who the game made clear to be wandering their own home delusional hallucinating tormented by his past that he constantly relives and the game centers around his delusional roaming through the halls of his home reliving past memories and still struggling to create a work of art while being his own worst critic as he slides deeper into madness either his disturbing paintings were part of his hallucinations or he is actually using the weird ingredients for each painting as you walk through each section you interact with objects in the environs that cue memories of his life that giv lol jack basically describes 6th sense the game at around 18 minutes oh boy time to sit back and watch some back to back ads that game idea reminds me of the movie the others you knows those ones where you read through the comments and get spoilers the scrambled letters spell out scratching its the only possible word ive never really enjoyed watching lets plays i usually watch games with no commentary but sens commentary is lovely he not only comments on the game design but he also appears to genuinely like the games he plays i never thought to look at video games the way he does but i do now who noticed the shadow in the bottom left corner 2900 time is all over the place for me 011 sleep is for the weak dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 who am i where am i antiis that you jack sings phantom of the opera me yassss 3304 jack and i at the same time oh jesus omg quote of the day yar captain shit be fucked bahahaha xd 2109 jack just realized im like this the entire time loosen up your face there sean youre gonna break it proceeds to make the same face expression 2 seconds later do you have 90 minutes to talk about the graphics of this game man this gives me nostalgic feelings finally jack is playing the game and simply commentates as himself not as a comedian i missed a lets play thats just jack and the game more of this please not every word turned into a joke jack being himself 2742 that window gave me serious bendy vibes the voice sounds like tony todd the candyman is it jack i dont even get scared by these games anymore 14 minutes later jack oh jesus crist the hole in the wall looking at the hallway is the shining not just the tricycle but the carpet as well that was cool 2112 loosen your face up sean youre gonna break it goes back to making exact same facial expression dont quote me on that jacksepticeye jack but please for the next parts look more forward rather then down it seems you will miss thing happening in front of you soon did anyone notice that the flower at 2738 is missing after jack looks away at 2750 creepy so i was looking the room that youtube subscription page and i come across jacksepticeye and i see the title layers of fear so i was like ok cool but then i realized on my playstation the wallpaper is literally layers of fear and its just a weird coincidence its crazy starship damrey had the concept of a horror game where you play as the alien but dont know it it was pretty good and spooky too ghost girl i believe in you me i believe in steve in steve oh yeah in steve sry not sry i rly rly want hints kf anti in the vids back then anti appears aah fuck nowanti appears yess 0825 jack open door jack ah shit here we go again your character limps and the guy in the first game did too edit possibly its him most likely not 310 the code for the lock is different for each person playing i think cause daz games had a different code for lock when playing the game the monster thing that killed jack it protecc it attacc but most importantly its fucking terrifying i think that layers of fear 2 is about what happened before layers of fear 1 came out in the video or in the game it shows and tells that the person on the boat lost someone and the manchins in the game are following you but in the first game parts of the manchins are around your painting room the candyman such an iconic voice good choice yarrr captain shit be fucked as soon as jack picked up the mask i was just waiting for him to start singing did not disappoint 1728 is that a mothefucking brazil reference that was the carpet from the shining as well 331 jack who is talking me the radio you turned it on was that tony fucking todd in the beginning of the game talking jack actors are the saddest people of all confirmed me an actor well fuck since you said so tell me why that guy in the beginning sounded like noon saibot in mk11 you can send sos in morse code you get a trophy for that 919 i actually thought that was my reflection for a moment me goes back to 2017 to get a refresher on the first game jack am i on a boat me same 5841 i too like to play with myself i love phantom of the opera jack you have made my day one does not simply play the part edit sorry again if i ever get my dream job of becoming a game dev and have a bad guy or villain i want sean with his sick robotic scary voice 311 thats my birthday d how does jack make this so creepy and freaking hilarious at the same time i totally geeked out over the voice of candyman recognized that voice instantly yes sean tony todd has a very cool menacing voice couple of fun facts at 1710 you came across a map titled your final destination tony todd was the mortician in the final destination movies you spoke about bruce lees son brandon lee in the crow tony todd was grange in the crow just a couple little connections i noticed while watching this anyone else hear it that one british voice sounds like emma watson from harry potter even has that heromine attitude do you want a tiny anus ooooooohhhhhh i get it now thats why the logo kept popping up on the left corner you go into any scary game and enjoy it i dont know but im liking the content i was on edge and waiting for the spooks and i like the video 1845 actually theres a really good movie that kind of uses that idea i think in english is called the others however im not sure i really recommend it i accidentally clicked layers of fear 1 i miss the green hair but whatev i think the actor behind the creepy voice is the same one as zoom from the flash and the vortigaunts from the halflife series what if someone mailed you a lifesize mannequin that was an alive everything else has been a dead or a wooden or a not alive jackspedicey 2k19 yar captn shit be fokked who else copied jack word for word as he said do you have 90 minutes 10553 umm was that a buoy or a ship jack opens the door theres not any thi harry potter ad pops up the titanic was a transatlantic boat too now its a subatlantic boat lol all hail the magic conch a movie has toyed with the reversed roles scenario you mentioned its a great movie watch the others 2001 me looking at a guy mannequin that guy has wood in his pants its a boy the little brother no horror games on boats jackaboys never played nightcry i see ok fine horror game in that ones case xd i dont know if theres a game that reversed the roles but i know theres a movie involving nicole kidman did anybody else find how adorable his irish accent was like 20 some mins into the vid or is that just me i laughed way more than i should have at yarr captain shit be fucked oh the nostalgia the one dude with the awesomr voice gives me insane jhin vibes clearly theyre childs drawings what is the gaming engine layers 2 uses jack hey jack you want a game where youre the ghost and youre the detective murdered soul suspect is the game for you no seriously its a story of a dead detective leading his own murder case as a ghost 1850 what about the game deep sleep by scriptwelder dont play with her she only likes to play with herself jacksepticeye 2019 5839 i will say although i am terrified of every aspect of this game mannequins boats being alone silence etc i have great appreciation for the graphics and the animation in it i love horror so much lol yall who else thought anti was in the thumbnail play plague inc again single player has vampires now damn jacksepticeye looks like the father from far cry 5 in the thumnail 1847 off xd jk im just concerned about the fact that the boat is called icarus transatlantic its like theyre asking for something bad to happen hey jack since you were talking about a game that either has the spooky environment but you play as a bad guy my fianc and i are playing a game called murdered souls suspect its a game that reminds me a lot of detroit become human but with a creepy horror element to it 3650 sooo no ones gonna notice that he said i gave chase brody but could not find anyone wheres satisfactory at hey jack what year is it in ireland right now jack thats not right the worlds flat socreepy thumbnail plus a title play the part seemingly taken from the game in reference to itis it really in reference to the game or is it instead referencing something far morefamiliar we shall see hopefully 5422 sean its like humpty dumpty me thinking they never said humpty dumpty was an egg thats creepy adding more scares huh sean in the first layers of fear i noticed the repedetive line was finish it and im this layers of fear its build the character he iz growing up so fast when he stared yt he had no facial hair and was in college sigh they grow up so fast they didnt make a game like that where u discover u are the ghost but there is a good film is it me or is the act 1 from merchant of venice lmao his part is a sad one is this bassanio d probably done with a purpose that sometimes you have a shadow and other times you dont otherwise it wouldve been a very sloppy mistake the boat sure as hell became a helicopter there mate she just wants to play with herself now thats a lot sandwichgraphic jack you can buy cryostasis on steam ya know 1904 in the deepest sleep scriptwelder game there is a twist like that near the end of the game who was scamming at jack in the beginning that he was an actor 1846 goosebumps the ghost next door no game but i loved that book check out la noire for a good detective game if you have an already me nobody jack the swinging orgie they used the exact same tiles that the titanic had so i think the ship susposed to be the titanic 5908 well you should play condemned then i thought i recognised the scary voice its tony todd i love that guy yep one more horror game im not playing because of mannequins the setting brings me back to monstrum im a little late to this but here are all the spooks mirror turns around 918 scary fucken rats 1829 scary noises 2005 door opens creakily 2059 door closes 2149 vase breaks 2422 thing breaks 2656 kinda scary cage flies up and celling breaks 2855 head falls off of mannequin 3302 spooky noises 3419 pipe breaks 3505 spooky noises 3725 something flies by your feet 3809 spookyish cannon fires 3831 spooky stuff happens 4101 jack get caught 4226 piano falls crushing mannequin 4923 spooky noises 5005 window light turns on showing a mannequin 5145 scary figure 5503 again 5558 black and white tv as thing crawls out 5708 less scary more intense but scary door 5735 boy laughs above 5910 jack misses the main part spooky noises 10010 shadowy figure 10042 and 10046 wall vagina 10108 10118 figure chases jack big bang 10159 scary noises 10059 wtffff 10215 jack is chased until 10612 5503 this has to be one of the most creepy moment in the history of scary games because of that scene in the crow i believe theyve moved towards all their guns being entirely fake giving them more realistic muzzle flashes later on in the editing i dont like all that unnecessary rat hate rats are valid 2111 jackloosen up your face there seanyoure gonna break it 1 second later shows the same face jack okay the old imma open the door on you and the close it on you trick that shit is not scary anymore me owo also me locks door and barricades my entire house 5504 looks likea ghost of some kind it looks human enough by its hands but its legs seem to be missing i can make out a white longsleeved shirt and a dark vestlike something a waiter at a fancy restaurant would wear disappears completely as soon as jack freaks out and moves to try to get a better look at it 5559 this onelooks different to say the least while its legs are also missing or fading out past the waistline its clothing appears darkerlike its wearing a black jacket furthermore its now white where the vest on the previous thing was appears to have no human facejust a mess that appears distorted by heavy mutilation and allowed to heal over vanishes in under a second great voice over tony toddcandyman about 1850 theres this game called open your eyes which is kinda similar to the kind of game youd like to play i think a lot of people wanted you to play that game so after this series you could check out that game jack literally looked like the devil in the picture ive been on many boats in my life thats how you know youre rich i think youre on the titanic sean its interesting how everyone in the youtube comment section seems to think its anti in the thumbnail but all i see on tumblr is marvin this is so interesting we call this sculpture the swinging orgy jacksepticeye 2019 missed the second spook when the rat goes in the door way xd its so crazy because already by the time you get to the first mirror where you saw your reflection and then it was shot out our games are different i wonder how many ways this can go because there wasnt a whole lot to change the trajectory already by then i noticed that we got different lock numbers too after the bird cage you need to play a plage tale innocence its an amazing indy game please check it out you will love it robin played it and loved it ask him about it hell yeah awesome man hope u finish the whole game wait is jackie boi a flat earther or was the boi joking im confused yoyoyo theres a second thats awesome character a c t wasnt that fuckin hard jack could you please stop trying to voice act every voice thats already voice acted in the game i love jacks videos too bad this game is highly disappointing for a horror game it sure has literally no creepy atmosphere no ambiance or scary popups i mean what is the horror behind this i mean its still sort of entertaining to watch because jack is playing obviously but i literally get bored from watching this game even if it is sean behind the monitor jack sing old town road the full version i dont wanna become an actor anymore i didnt finished it so now ive been sitting here ten minutes thinking itd loading when its just paused the first layers of fear was about him going through his own form of depression of bathsalts jacksepticeye 2019 you made the first one like 2 years ago in oct 2016 when jack was talking about actors being more suited to one character than others at 10730 i couldnt help but think of james spader playing raymond reddington lmao i know they had a hand in it but i think it was some different developers who took it on and made this one but im not sure dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 anyone realise that jack missed that door slam xd is that the same boat from black ops 4 zombies 205 when u accidentally summon a demon through morse code that deep voice talking almost sounded like grigori from dragons dogma or is it just altered enough to sound close to it but damn scary game i dont like jack anymore he just acts so fake sean would make a dope decepticon for transformers like for agree this was disappointingly unscary you should play murdered soul suspect you play as a cop investigating your own murder 3608 am i the only one that thought of papyrus you fight monsters and you saw that you are the monster sounds like deep sleep series for me at 1040 i absolutely lost it when he spun the mannequin super fast jack why not play vampyr its a good game the only horror was calling this ship a boat the entire time jesus christ the outro is so fucking loud yeah this is that type of game where you have to look as close as possible to details and make sure you get every bit of information possible 1858 wasnt that the premise of scanner sombra 2620 the 21st night of september oh my god and then jack

about the thumbnail anti vibes just me cool 2626 he sounds like a darlek from doctor who lol 4841 thats also the carpet from the shining jack blow me my biggest fan hey jack people seem to be kind of abandoning your chanale just saying absolutely no one sean i wanna look directly at the sun and go blind 5034 lmfao damnit jack just when i was creeped out that you got too close to the swinging orgy you went and named it xd 2007 then an as opens the cone shaped fire extinguishers were made by minimax in britain around 1903 jack can someone make a remix of jack singing old town road its for science pause the vid at 3458 you wont regret it 3455 will help you layers of fear 1 is better than layers of fear 2 change my mind their is a movie like that its called triangle this ship looks like its modelled after the queen mary which is a haunted boat and thats just super cool 5717 well now i know how mannequins are made 2114 proceeds to do the face 1920 jack you act like you havent played shadow of the colossus 1900 postal is the game you looking for jack game do you remember me the 5th of november hehehe i really hope some people get this 5545 as of this timestamp there will be flashing lights watch at your risk everyone yeah his name was brandon lee did anyone else notice the other two picture at the beginning in the first room and i think in the dressing room 4842 wait a minute isnt that carpet also from the shining the guy talking sounds like the candyman i can never find one horror game where anti is back isnt mentioned in the comments lol sean is obviously playing an inspector gadget horror game because the main bad guy voice is definitely doctor claw the sensitivity almost made me sick lol but its ok are i the only one looking for a jumpscearlist first two minutes of playing game you were born to play a role you must act jack so are we like a director or something 1156 i want to look at the sun with my bare eyes tries to look through spotlight i would just like to say that i was thinking about the bruce lees son incident and when he said it i had to high five him mentally you get an achievement for sending and sos in morse code play 916 in 025 playback speed i was watching this and my cat jumped on me and scared the shite out of me 1915 not any game i know off but a movie known as the others im not far into the video and i dont know if hell recognize it later on but the boat ironically looks like the titanic and it just so happened to have been sinking in the beginning accordingly in the movie there were areas blocked off by gates for private high class personal which was partially the cause of many deaths i just got an ad for some prepubescent rocknerich kid talking about fortnite and gaming what has youtube come to that creepy voice sounds like the guy from candy man the moment he thinks a spotlight is a telescope 1157 yo sean if you want to play a mystery game set on a spooky ship try out return of the obra dinn you get to play as a time traveling detective whos trying to find out what happened to the missing crew of the ship the obra dinn highly recommended hashtag not sponsored haha for a non christion he says jesus christ alot you know shits about to get real when jack pulls the mic up to his face is it just me or does he really like spongebob i mean dont get me wrong its a great show but jack could this be the guy from the first game sees the closset filled whith bottles yep this is the guy from the first game defenately i wonder if jack figured out the story of the first one obligatory quote of the thing jack said to not quote him on jacksepticeye 2019 254 unmoor to release a ship from its moorings ropes or chains that keep a boat from moving away from a particular place 1838 that idea is know as the dead all along trope its more popular in movies but also happens in games it happens to one of the player characters in one of the fatal frame games 2254 where sean doesnt get scared and just talks about graphics over and over again isnt that par for the course at least when it comes to talking about graphics p 4134 yes brandon lee bruce lees son died when he was shot on a movie set with a gun that was supposed to fire blanks normally when a blank is fired a piece of soft wadding normally comes out of the gun but that time a metallic projectile came out instead 2110 goes straight back to making the same face after he said to loosen up oml when the globe fell i got a multi media random notification it scared the shit out of me i wanna be a film and tv directorglad to get this glimpse into what my future will be i just like replayin scary sections and looking at jacks face remember the gun shoot from the intro of the game and then when jack chooses which one of the mannequins to shoot related 4332 i cant stop replaying this who is that kid on my tv sounds like venom the voice jack i have a challange everytime someone says layers you must say of fear 828 aw shit here we go again titanic btw tiny anuses i want one of those jacksepticeye rescharcth becomes scratcher jack i highly recommend the movie the others dont question it just watch it dont play with her she only likes to play with herself jacksepticeye 2019 sean you missed one of those videofilm slots things in one of the rooms just saying lol hey its the mortician from final destination wheres tabs i wonder if the kids are stowaways on the ship and your playing as one and the monster are the security people nice bit of shakespeare on the projector with the deer if you scroll slow enough there is a monster that looks like the scream mask right 2 frames before the door the puns are great in this one lol 252 no jack heads are supposed to stay attached to necks not shoulders what kind of notadoctor are you jack thinks he played the first game about a year ago jack its been 3 years man omg at 206 when the light turned on my phone vibrated at the same time and scared the shit out of me jacknine nine medont you fucking say it jacknine nine nine meinstanly laughs jesus fucking christ jack i love you 2857 hey ron hey billy that hurt game narrator youre an actor act jack i must be a painter again or a director i fixed the vase jack lets have a brew youve mightve already seen it but it had 2 reflections ah little nightmares i thought the same thing when you were looking off the 2nd deckbalcony out at the sea hey the artist had rats he didnt like i dont remember how he tried to take them out wasnt the artist daughter into drawing or he wanted her to draw better john hardy zsa zsa gabor i seen a face in the crowd figure of 1 sounds like they got tony todd for some of the voice acting update i looked it up it is tony todd yay the candyman cometh to answer your question about a game where youre the bad guy jacksepticeye there was a short indie game where the setting doesnt show too much like eating garbage etc until the end where it reveals you were in fact the zombie all along cant remember the name of it though unfortunately sean sing ng september calms me walks into room looks around woah the is gone but its not unpopular opinion sean looks badass with eyeliner lol i was reading a comic while listening to this and i heard swinging orgy and looked up right a way you and raed both didnt get unmooring mooring pertains to tying a ship down by unmooring it you let it go she only likes to play with herself said with a straight face im proud while else remembers jack playing the last guardian and the shadow of the colossus i dont own a computer or a telly sadly and i assume thats where you play most of these games so thats the only reason i watch instead of trying it myself lol that whole hallway was a reference to the shining wow your voice can annoying me what if the cain is a reference to the first one we call this sculpture the swinging orgy 2435 i made the exact same reference before jack did jack asking for something where you realize youre the monster at the end of it not sure if he realized he was pitching the idea for the outsider by hp lovecraft yes jack bruce lees son thanks but no thanks for my asses sake i need to stop watching i still got second part to watch its annoying one more hour to go through hell thats two hours of hell in one day i dont think i can cope with all this crazy coswallop why cant u make figurine halo vids or why cant u make clone wars figure nice custom clips why u always go down this path u fool u will never sleep unless that wat u like and enjoy then why also how come u never vlog yourself at any theme parks or coo go karting or anything that is out in real world havent done much for awhile 4850 the carpet also matches the ending is just a play i watched barely half of this video this morning went to school and i was sitting in history and all i could hear in my head was i believe in you i believe in the shit thats in my pants and i was trying so hard not to laugh in the middle of class lmao well there is a game like the one you were talking about on 1845 but its a pretty well known halflife 1 mod called afraid of monsters with that kind of plot twist in mind and the reason behind the main character being the threat himself is quite deep and has a pretty cool message around it hes hereeeee the phantom of the opera but i forget the name their is an old ps2 game like that jack im already conjugating things together me im pretty sure thats not what that word means this game gave me the shits unmooring is a word definition cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected anybody else hiding in the comments i love the fact that jack seems to be more genuine and invested in the game we kinda dont get that side of him a lot lately i still love him tho im sticking to the theory that the actor tried to build his character as they should but got too obsessed with it that they forget who they were so they basically lose their sense of who they were and rather became the character they were suppsoed to portray jack you should put your hair back to a come over is it just me or does jack look like a dothraki in the thumbnail at 2127 what the hell was he talking about when did a wall disappear i actually did phantom of the opera with my marching band my sophomore year of high school jack the game where its kinda like how you described was murder soul suspect where you were a detective and you get murdered and put into a middle world where your dead and alive and you roam the streets of the living trying to solve the mystery of how you died and whos the killer that kind of game is the silent hill series jack im 14 and this is deep lol at 1809 the cane went through the holder oh i dont know if its him but the deep narrator voice sounds like tony todd seriously jack you dont know morse code of sos yes it was bruce lees son brandon the scene is actually still in the movie also they had his stunt double stand in to finish filming 1900 there hasnt been a game idea like that but there is a movie called the others with that same kind of plot that thumbnail is soo good character may be the answer a c t hey jack your right at 2551 i sew someone in the way of the earth and i am now scared for my life yup im scared not good at all oh boy bruce lee and jason lee both died on set of there movie and they say that it sorry they were cursed soma or whatever was that underwater game where all those robots and stuff were insane and mid way through before you go into the ocean spoiler alert you find out that youre the robot all along quite a cool concept though but for a horror game this is one of the only ways that really works like if people attack you and youre a ghost and you can die from that it makes you a shitty ghost lmao it would be cool to have them like attack you or whatever and then some sort of screenshift happens and they end up dead or something and thats the scary part rip brandon lee the crow was a great movie shaun i want a game were the ghost just comes up behind you and whispers i believe you also shaun hears motivational ghost i appreciate the encouragement but thats not how you do it sailor in the navy here unmooring is when you take the mooring lines lines that connect the ship to the peir off of the pier so the ship can set sail not gonna lie i flipped my shit when jack said he loved phantom of the opera 1010 youtuber no question conversation over okaythis took me on a trip he mentioned that brandon lee died in the making of the crow i looked him up started digging around way too much and ended up watching the entirety of the crow and some documentaries on the incident its been 3 hours now and i still havent finished this video starship damrey was like that the voice at 301 sounds like noon saibot from mk11 why was he on that massive boat completely alone when was the scary part i need to know so i can watch it u didnt see it game sleep is a poor excuse jack sleep is for the weak oh oh oh that bit with the shining tricycle at 4842 also has the same carpet from the overlook i think this game is based on something that one of the notes mentioned in the previous game about a boy finding a gun and going through many worlds and then killing the man who killed his father or something along those lines 5906 like observer meeating curry while watching jacksepticeye tiny annuses mealmost chokes on food i really liked layers of fears 1 but sadly i feel like this one aint as good hope it can prove me wrong tho not sure what it means but those letters on the board spell scratcher when unscrambled layers of fear sequel exists me

who else only knows of this game because they saw brendon urie playing it on his livestream jack loosen up your face there sean your gonna break it also jack continues to make the same face running screaming little girl close the door jack shuts door gladly jack turns around jack who said that noone youtubers in their thumbnails 0o0 0o 0 i think this time the main character is an actor litterally noone not a single soul nobody anywhere ever jack the visuals are stunning is the base of these games based on anxiety of the character the player controls thatll be neato burrito it is the moon jack not the sun great video sean 1532 dont worry thats just phil hes a lad 2 years ago jack jack that game is called prey ok theres the tricycle now wheres redrum this boat reminds me of the titanic anyone else lowkey want anti to come back btw you got th3 bad ending in layer of fewr 1 to hell o sean actors are the saddest people of all confirmed me oofyou right i jumped and my headphones flew off my head when jack fell down the stupid ladder into the boat wtf jack the game where you play the ghostmonster is a game its a multiplayer game called dead by daylight dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 like a boss a box large enough for grown man jack am i a magician also characters i played the first one when it was free on xbox gold but i cant afford the second i really like these games 3356 bo burnham refrence yes brandon lee is bruce lees son brandon lee died on the set of the crow in march of 1993 or 1994 during the scene where eric draven finds funboy thats where brandon lee died due to prop gun malfunction and he was shot in the stomach if u watch the scene closely u can see where he was shot and hear the strain in his voice after it happened the actor who played funboy was traumatized from the accident i believe when i watch a documentary about the crow the crow will always b my favourite movie of all time til the day i die tragic how brandon lee died gone to soon back in the nineties even for an irish man wow nobody people in the comments wheres the jumpscares l i s t any one else hear ulysses of fallout nv lonesome road when the guy in the intro started speaking 19341939 jack i hear the voices they whisper beep boop boop boop beeep me is laughing for literally no reason other than my sense of humor has just been absolutely destroyed jack i wanna play a horror game where i play someone upbeat me that would be called lollipop chainsaw boringjust like the other exploration games are the kids the stowaways that they are talking about jumpscare times click read more for the times will edit this as i go along 2421 2658 2855 3303 majorish 3420 major 3506 3558 minor 3809 major 3832 minorish 4923 majorish 5056 5504 5559 major 5735 major 10044 minor 10047 minorish 10114 major all people can comment are quotes and memes its a little repetitive people land of the flame the sun clearly this contains flashing imagery but theres no warning beforehand can you stop with the loudness says the guy whos spiels about being loud af lol i love you jackieboi the children were probably stowaways acting like pirates my new favourite word sean says in his accent is water when i was younger i could play the piano but i lost the talent long ago no joke in the first seven mins when that flim starts playing i thought that he was talking about youtubers 2736 actually dentists have some of the highest suicide rates 1900 it was a movie for damn sure jack watching this at midnight the fact that this man is almost 30 and he can still go that high in the outtro is amazing i think it was some different developers who took it on and made this one jacksepticeye ive never been on a boat or a plane in my life mom whispering in your ear i believe you you jesus what the fuck mom its im only going to the 2nd grade 3850 yarr captain shit be fucked 2643 me well shite thats a deep question oh shit this was a scary series oh and in the first one you can die from demon girl not a single irish mention or any gaelic reference i missed you jack welcome back did anyone else realize that sean said disapear when the wall apeared lol xd i already completed the game its great highly recommend the worlds a stage but the play is badly cast thank you so much for the phantom of the opera reference that guy that was talking in the first part of the game about how he needs to play the part and stay awake that sounds like zoom from the flash right i cant be the only one 2015 mayday mayday i would like a chicken sandwich and four loaves of bread jse 2019 i have rewatched you play the original so much its actually mental if anyones looking for another take on this game and is into canadians feel free to check me out mad respect to jack but we

chasing jack oh shit oh shit its chasing me mei mean fuck dude if i saw that thing id be gone ship exists jack titanic sinks i miss the old green hair this episode should be renamed jack tries to find a connection between the first and second game for an hour and 12 min this is what working for alfred hitchcock must have been like hmph didnt that one director nearly drown an actor to make it believable i want this game i recently bought number 1 and loved it pls check the vids out i really want this but my ps4 isnt working well and i want to make a vid on this but need the money please sub the first game taught me how to dial an old phone worth it 3349 me when my mom tells me to get over it when i talk to her about my depression and when she forces me to be a part of her religion and all of your subcrbers are bitchs to so suck a big you gay white basterd jack sees a shadow jack right after hmm i think im a woman nothing really gives it away tho tiny anuss i want one of those

friends to you can think my mom for this to 4845 that actually is the carpet pattern from the shining i will bet that the children are stowaways the line you know what theyll do if they find us sounded genuinely scared i wonder if the mannequins you had to shoot represented them and you were reenacted them getting caught jack i dont have a shadow me 3805 4833 shining reference overlook hotels carpet sees this in suggested squeals instaclicks the setting reminds me of that titanic video game i played when i was a kid titanic adventure out of time anyone else play that or just me stop with the loudness he yelled loudly jack i just realized im scowling the whole time loosen up your face there sean also jack 5 seconds later scowls deeply 1840 thats a movie jack i forget the name 3358 just cause its true doesnt mean that its right did he just quote bo burnham was it glitchy for anyone else man cant find the time to watch these longer episodes jack took this very fast and never crouched to check under things c i love his commentary but maybe this playthrough was kinda rushed not that i didnt enjoy watching i just wonder if something was bothering him when he recorded it this is undoubtedly my favorite horror game ever the plot was so fucking good and jacks commentary was just ok im all caught up now took some time to find your first series playlist was quite buried be careful jack the cake could be a lie you never know mewhen is your next drum cover copy right police exits the room i love how well timed that was to disappear right when jack tried to look at it its over mannequin i have the high ground me gets scared by pipes because im a fucking pussy sean im not going to get scared by pipes anymore me jack beepbeep beep i would like a chicken sandwich daz beep beebeep can i get the tuna foot long xd surprised he didnt do a darude sandstom in morse code icarus travels to close to the sun make sure your character doesnt finally somebody who loves phantom of the opera i cant even tell you how happy i am to hear that gosh what a pleasant surprise hes trying to grow kratos beard about a year ago more like 3 line circled in red im impressed this is what is recommended by the national archive when transcribing nontext based elements or maybe im just weird i swear my work building started to shake at 2552 and i didnt much appreciate the extra spoop xd 1840 its a movie called the others 1036 thats the voice of the artist from layers of fear 1 im on a boat im on a boat everybody look because im sailing on a boat 416 some say he is still testing till this day 3952 then take the hoodie off disney channel actors this job is so great disney channel actors after they go crazy this 2525 was that kratos 5906 jack the nancy drew pc series gives you just that the game grumps have played a few of them as well unmooring when you detach the rope connecting the boat to the jetty im gonna turn this ship into a helicopter rip he didnt close any of those doors when he had to lol to stop the monster each time welcome to layers of fear 2 where sean gets scared talks about the visuals over and over again oh damn when he read the note at 845 4315 im 14 and this is deep im 14 and i cant understand a single shit i honestly hate his new hair welcome to layers of fear 2 jack sings random songs that come to his mind because of the random things that happen anxiety jack do the worlds loudest lets play i would love to see u playing draugen do you have any idea where satisfactory went 1007 same i was trying to learn japanese on duolingo but got bored with it do you remember i immediately start singing jack the very first time in september 3853 red sun at morning sailors take warning red sun at night sailors delight perhaps it was an omen a warning of sorts of rough seas storms or other bad things pretty sure that film reels doesnt come with included audio titanic thats what the setting looks like door creaks open jack ok walks through other door if u like detective games try call of cathulu you played layer of fear the first one 2 years ago just thought id let yah know 3302 so no head the director the worlds a stage but the play is badly cast jack your voice sounds awesome me hey its candyman tony todd play nms again please umm im the only person who noticed hes on the titanic jack wants an on air sign oh look tiny anuses i want one jack takes it up the ass confirmed that intro never gets old i think there has been a game like that jack yeah the game is called dying light the following wait jack watched and knows what murder she wrote is bruh i watched that when i was a kid i loved the series but they took it down jack you know about others right i hate the rocking motion its making me nauseous to watch 2509 my ears have been blessed like cause he mentioned murder she wrote i like how at the start jack was saying that theres no monster to hurt you but then a monster chases him xd 2855 this bitch empty y e e t the music in layers of fear was always the best and it still is in this one the female vocals are absolutely amazing and it gives you the real spookycreepy vibes through the game geist for the gamecube is fairly similar to that idea you proposed 4842 it looks like the carpet from the shinning as well might an easter egg and this game seem to be themed around movies and the shinning is a horror movie so yeah cool easter egg act instantly me character sean compacted okay jacks faces 243 when you dont sub and turn on notifications you should play the deep sleep theories me watching jacksepticeye and the final of the europa league xd duuude this game looks soo goooood and interesting and kinda mild horror for now i dont like horror but its interesting to watch horror gameplays lol 1840 there is a game like that its called maize its really fun please play it this game is fucked for anyone with automatophobia jack in little nightmares youre the monster jacks game idea is basically the game acuivalent to the sixth sense who else wants to get stuck in a horror game with sean this may seem weird but what is jack brought septic back to almost react to different games jack has been playing recently id watch that aw shit here we go again 2533 is the globe moving around those werent real rats jack but it was reel rats jack you cant really be dead if youre dead inside all along me sweet im immortal mesees thumbnail meantis back peeps edit16 likes thank you the dark voice thing sounds kinda like mufasa form the lion king i just had to wipe my gpas ass and i wanna thank you for making this video so i can suppress the thought of it without being able to have alcohol right now i think your the artist daughter actually am i right or wrong just because its true doesnt mean its right jacksepticeye 2019 its pronounced unmoreing referring to the detachment of ropes from both bow and stern rope rings 310 jigsaw is that you bud this is one of the most boring scary game ive seen in my life do you remember me starts humming september jack a moment later starts singing september lol that seen was directly from the shining the carpet and everything at the beginning of the game when jack flipped the black board and it said act i think you are supposed to spell character layers of fear more like layers of fear 3 i had to go back and watch the first one and then come back to this so i qould understand and let me say the first one omg bro my mom almost died yesterday and i saved her not only me 1838 i actually had that idea for a while but im not interested in game development i would love to see that kind of a game some day the childrens voices with that specific accent and the lullaby in the background fully ripped off fable still a good game though how old are you shawn the voice sounds like noob saibot from mortal kombat time is the great enemy jacksepticeye 2019 1846 been done but it was a movie 3119 to fuckin victory town 2359 sans is that you someone get matpat on the horn i got the theory of the century remember who you are i think this game is about and actor who lost himself warning bright flashing lights at 5546 5617 please like so people see thank you im a little confused with the sean thing can someone explain i love how your intro has gotten faster and faster do you remember my dumbass the twenty first night of september what if hes on queen marry 3652 i gave chase brody hey whichever one you are could yall not jacks game idea is in a way a game version of the sixth sense bruce willis experience nice beard jack 1525 someones takeing a massive shit 4135 its true i just had to look it up it vas brandon lee bruce lees son he vas as you said struck buy a dummy bullet a round the has no gunpowder or a primer so i cant produce an explosive charge that vas logged in a revolver barrel so without knowing someone loaded a blank round a bullet without an led shot just the gunpowder so the led from the dummy round was jammed in front of the live gunpowder from the blank round essentially sending out the dummy bullet from the barrel at the same force as a regular bullet 8 minutes in the game jack ohh is this a boat me jack youre on a fucking titanic jack ohh it is a boat me fuckin ell 1837 afraid og monsters and cry of fear are both horror games based on the player being the killer both games have been fetured on the channel jack 4841 that is a carpet from the shining note to self 458 i think its character update 4024 yay im right congrats me that first tape reminded me of dororo jack you sound like a decepticon transformer also thanks jack for singing the phantom of the opera cus now i wanna listen to it jack i actually want something to kill me something actually comes to kill him jack i hate this jacki dont knoe moscode also jacki just wrote i like a cup of soup i literally have nothing to comment anyone else like jack is he on the titanic and lo gary the mannequin did not die of scurvy the woodrot got him yes my night is saved i huge the most dangerous game vibes from this game anyone else notice at 934 that there really is a man standing behind you in the mirror there was a film that let you believe that they were alive until the end and they found out they were dead called the others soup is it just me or he looks like pale khal drogojason momoa on the miniature xd fuck maniquinn thingys they suck when in cloth store then im ascared they wil start jumping and start singingigig kanye west eskitit dying light is just like that so i dont know if theres a game with the role reversal where youre the ghost but i know there is a movie where thats the case and its one of my all time favorite horrorsuspense movies its called the others with nicole kidman as the main actress warning though the movie is one of those ridiculously quiet movies where you have to have your volume obnoxiously high in order to hear anything but still a fantastic movie wonder if pirates talk like that well actually they say look look at me i am the captain now common misconception prediction made at 2811 the main character is the director and thinks he is the only one broken enough to play the part in his story in the do you remember part i was actually singing the song sean sings shortly after awww my heart i know him too well ahaah im not even looking at the comments yet how many are making the jack septiceye titanic comparison how did we get here do you have ninty minutes the others is a great movie where the rolls are reversed the voice reminds me of candy man dudeeee when u read those notesur voice sounds sooo good my eyes barely work so my ears work very precisely maaan i cant concentrate with that beautiful voice the game cryostatis was removed on steam there are multiple endings he looks so angry in thumbnail cant wait to buy this game i get some monstrum vibes from this spooky boat i knew it was tony todd as the creepy narrator candyman himself great stuff jack the last one was a depressed artist game build you actors fucking character jack hmmm sad artist love it but honestly theres been much more frightening horror games layers of fear 2 plus kindergarten 2 was given a release datetrailer in my opinion this one is worse than the first one finally something thats not fortnite in gaming trending ah s here we go again d in the first game wasnt the painters wife an actor i believe theres a bedroom full of her pictures from her glory days looking like movie posters perhaps this is the story of the painters wife edit 1 i do know this might be far fetched since theres spoken about a him as the only one to portray the character but theories are fun edit 2 4526 the voice of lily states that mr hardy the young boy we hear is her little brother could this lily be connected to both this player and the painter as a sister and a wife not scary and kinda boring i mean nothing is happening jacks voice changer at 2625 makes him sound like a darlek hello humans lex clarkdo you believe a man can fly clark sure in a plane lex no im not talking about that im talking about soaring through the clouds with nothing but air beneath you clark people cant fly lex lex i did after the accident when my heart stopped it was the most exhilarating two minutes of my life i flew over smallville and for the first time i didnt see a dead end i saw a new beginning thanks to you i have a second chance we have a future clark and i dont want anything to stand in the way of our friendship smallville tv show terrance out method acting is very dangerous as you can end up going into the shoes the character too much and losing yourself so anybody using it be careful not to overdo it turns out unmooring is a word verb gerund or present participle unmooring release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him why does the dudes voice at the beginning sound exactly like caustic from apex legends yar captain sht be fuked jse haha had me ded how did he miss the figure at 4037 thank you jack make a game where youre the baddy but you dont know dont escape makers let us introduce ourselves wasnt really horror for a horror game tbh speaking of hitman did you finish hitman 2 jack ok im not a doctor but im pretty sure heads are supposed to stay attached to your shoulders lmao me i think somethings wrong because my head is attached to my neck help xd im gonna turn this boat into a helicopter sean i fixed the vase take me out for drinks when they say chapter 1 unmooring mooring is the process in paint is made pigment and oils are combined through a milling process so unmooring is separating the pigment and oil ungrounding it this boat is the titanic crew ship aka the unsinkable ship i recognized it by the shapes of the smock stakes and the structure on the outside this boat is the titanic crew ship aka the unsinkable ship i recognized it by the shapes of the smock stakes and the structure on the outside i believe in you now its steves turn it gets better and there are plenty more chances to die die die 40 minutes in is this even a horror game 4822 isnt that the carpet from the shining at 2733 i got an ad for headspace about reducing stress hey i have cryostasis on steam but it got removed from the store i would gift you my copy if i could brody i thought it said but it hurts me that im 10 mins in and jack hasnt realized that hes on the titanici dont know if he figures it out through out but right now its bothering me you said you wanted a game where you go around as a detective talking to characters i recommend la noire one of the best detective games ive ever played i dont know if youve ever played it i didnt look through before writing this and i have the worst memory but its such a fantastic game and i think youd really like it congrats on trending jack in episode 5 of your layers of fear playthrough your siri was activated as well playing this game makes siri talk to you the voice that says the hunt at 10618 isnt the same of the narrator from little misfortune demo why did jack say chase brody when it just says i gave chase 4820 jack ive never seen it before me the ring jack watch the ring still waiting for sally face chapter 5 u need 2 play eyes the horror game i have it on my phone which is an android so u can get it and play it its free i loved the original first game its one of my favorites so im super excited to see jack play this one is this the shining on a boat heeeres ahab this just seems like those unity and unreal engine 4 graphics showcases not a horror game cause its not scary at all i know the voice at 627 but i cant place it anyone know who that is sean i gave chase brody me how did you just say that out loud you played it two years ago this thumbnail makes you look so much like baldur from god of war jack you should play a mobile game its possible that it could be played on pc named identity v its super good its basically dead by daylight but its also unique and amazing game i recommend it jack could you lower your lights next time please it would make the experience so much better arggggghhhhhhh bloody love horror games especially in vr at 1900 he was talking about something like little nighmares how at the end he is the evil thing im not really a big fan of horror games but this one i really like plus it has jackbonus everyone me this fucking format is dumb please stop using it is it just me or did vid diesel do some voice acting in this game if this was a morgz video it would have been at least 100 ads is it not obvious by now that the mc has been killed hes been shot in the head hmmmm repeating are we last years anti was during a five nights at freddys with ballora and baby play through and a layers of fear play through hes playing a five nights help wanted be play through and now a layers of fear 2 play through is anti going to make another comeback i have been watching you since i was like 7 or 8 i am 14 now thats a long time got to love method acting puns on 1717 when that demonic voice was like doo you remember i thought about the song september and when jack started singing it i was like haaaaa d haha im 14 and this is deep ok dont play with her she only likes to play with herself ha i need to stop that be awesome if they based that ship off of titanic that be a really neat twist youve heard of murder she wrote now get ready for murder sea boat im kind of waiting for robin to do some kind of an out of context video of sean with clips like 51035112 in this one d is it bad that i like the first layers of fear but not this one it just seems boring and confusing right now 3040 its quite like the voice actor of amicia and hugo in plague tale literally the top 100 comments are memes but this does put a smile on my face oh my god in the thumbnail with that eye makeup you look so sexy this is extremely victorian gothic style its similure to the victorian gothic books such as phantom of the opera frankenstein and a tell tale heart meanibg it aslo likely set around the same time 18301900 ish but if yall like this game i highly suggest reading those booka 2417 the phantom of the opera is theeere edit i commented this before he sang it i didnt think hed actually sing it wheres anti thoooo 1900 its a movie called the others the creepy voice that keeps talking to us kind of sounds like the guy that plaays the candyman i think it was some different developers who took it on and made this one im not sure dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 jack iv been on an elevator like that before it was 100 years old jack iv been on an elevator like that before it was 100 years old they copied roblox titanic im offended first of the video ouh fck this boringgg end of the video shit this is scared all my bone the longest five seconds of your life is waiting to skip an ad release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him a hour long vid with only 6 adsyou truly are the chosen one jeez i remember watching you play the first game as you uploaded it this is awesome jack im not a doctor but im pretty sure heads are supposed to stay on your shoulders me yeah uhm i dont think jack would be a very good doctor is there any anti moments in here im to lazy to check man and if so give me the link plz jack the game idea you had around 1900 is the plot of the movie the others with nicole kidman do you remember who you were before the world told you who you should be dang man i like that a lot im here to see if i missed something in the game because i was screaming instead of focusing on the game if anyone wanna see feel free to take a look btw i will play my part its pretty unclear whats really going on but my theory is that you play as the grown up little boy from the recordings and that lily is your older sister shes way older than you and when youre around 4 she runs away and hides as ship cargo and brings you too its unclear where you were running away or where from i think the boy james or you as they grew up shot his sister or ran away from her he grew up to be an actor and also a broken man he might be schizophrenic but it mostly just seems like he lost himself the beginning of the game really shows he was only picked for this role because his sense of self is so lost he doesnt know who he is now hes trying to build the character for his role in a movie on a ship but memories are flooding back or maybe his character is james and we dont really know the real person we play as how did i not see this yesterday so from what im getting is that the actor who is going to build that sad character hates the sea because when he was younger he was playing pirots mr hardy being in charge of many things in the boat and the capitain with his older sister in one of the lines a female and child like voice says something along the lines of my little brother when he wanted to stay home lily i want to go home but the girl sounded like she dragged him where there was a boat maybe he hates the sea because his sister drowned while playing pirots am i the only one who thinks the cane at 1808 is a reference to the main character in the first layers of fear i mean he did have a prosthetic leg and while he never used his cane in the gameplay there were canes lying around that were referenced at being his im not that far into the video so im not sure if it means something else but that was my immediate thought when jack looked at it im also not sure if the games are connected or anything so wait are there traces of anti in this or something and if so could someone pls time stamp his moments i didnt see any throughout the video or maybe i just didnt recognize them 202 omg dj vu this is what he literally said when he started playing the first layers of feari literally just checked hahahhaa so this is what ulyesses did before he went to the devide 10136 close the door jack uyehusj gladly jack realizes wait who said that hey jack do you know why the boat looks like the titanic because it is the titanic jackie boi it was actually bruce lee himself who got killed on set rtx off theres a game called ghost master its where you play as a ghost master where you play as many ghost its for pc oh my god the crow such a good movie so sad that brandon died but man oh man good movie nice nod to the shining at 4834 thats so dope loved the original game had tones of genuine jump scares this had very few quite lame scares not a worthy sequel sadly there are games where you play as a ghost for pc and game cube and playstation and other game consoles more please okay the director sounds like claw i cant be the only one who thought about this how disappointing i loved layers of fear funny as hell watching jack getting scared by wheelchairs and paintings but this what was this maybe it will get better but i have a suspicion it wont every time jack says boat me its a ship he said ruth we cant be together because we are to wooden i say jackthats ok because were two sticks rubbing each other set on fire emo jacksepticeye has me shook i want a game where you can manage a kingdom and take control of other lands go through eras but not one of those mobile games that give you gold and have you buy diamonds to speed up building things something like kindom new lands but 3d and with battlefield graphics and physics so you want a game like the movie the others i would fucking love it please someone make this idea real the black guy from candyman did the voice 1910 american horror story murder house is kinda like that were your a ghost and dont no it sean loosen up your face there also sean creases his brows again you would make a wonderful pirate is it only me who is getting titanic vibes 3651 i gave chase brody say whaaat lol the deep sleep franchise you talk great you should be a journalist jack play batman arkham knight its batmans new game 2019 pls and if you really are going to do a gameplay of this game then pls do a full gameplay until the end you will be suprised believe you me jack i think you would really like the game a plague tale innocence sadly it wasnt really scary props for jack for trying hard to make it interesting says to stop looking like that then does exactly the opposite and stays that face jack the thing the first game was lacking was someone chasing you also jack when being chased i dont like this 1835 literally describes fromsoftwares dracin holy shit jack your thumbnail is fucking terrifying act 1 the unmooring is that even a word jacksepticeye 2019 5905 murdered soul suspect jack u have a watch that talks to u ask it mores code also we know u love the lighting we get it jack at 1857 you just described the ending of a movie called the others tiny anuses is my favourite food when you opend the door the hall look like the shinning hall what if this game is a memory this game has literally no introduction xd i want a compilation of jack spinning items rapidly in layers of fear can someone please explain the whole anti thing to me sea of thieves horror edition jack we dont get a lot of boat murder the titanic am i a joke to you i have been watching u since i was 8 now im 11 lol im growin up with jack youre on the titanic is that noob saibot anyone else remembering jack saying hed do drum covers anyone no one jack oooooh the texture of this game is so cool the art style in this game also often gives me slight reminders of little nightmares 630 ryan reynolds took notes from this game for his part playing pikachu 10719 also ryan reynolds in deadpool jack there was a threat in the first one there was a section the burnt wife could attack you and set you back jacksepticeye i think youre on the titanic sen did you ever finish observer i never remembered seeing the rest of it the little nightmares is kind of game that first u play as good guy and at the end u become monster that you have been avoiding dont go loosing your head over it head almost yeets off his body when he got scared project wright is coming out but you know youre the monster already its more of a good guybad guy in your opinion scenario woo how 10 on trending for gaming anyone else think of mufasa when the voice said do you remember what if anti played this game this game seems like a take on the monologue from as you like it by shakespeare and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurses arms and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lind with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipperd pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his yout play more house flipper 1529 the dad from nightmare before christmas i ended up singing do you remember at the same time as jacksean d 5030 jack is naming famous art layers of fear is one of my favorite horror games im excited to watch you play the second one jack 3058 jack sir my brain randomly its maam how quickly the turns are makes me feels sick but the visuals of this game are outstanding yaaayy youre playing the game i suggested ah yes tony todd does the narration the candyman strikes again d i saw this video shut the lights put my headphones in and snuggled under a blanket i almost dropped my phone on my face but i dont regret it wait is it near halloweenand this is the second part of the game he turned into antisepticeye i dont like where this is going you look like jason momoa a bit on the thumbnail i put the video on 2x speed it still felt slow not sure which is scarier the wooden mannequins creepy environment scary music or jack saying essqueeak when opening doors jack you can still do attack on titan the narrator sounds like david attenborough play raft they did a update you can capture animals and make them your pets as long as you have a pen with dirt jackaproches red floor also jack goes down even further cuz he doesnt want to end up in hell can we get the return of jack doing every vid with his hat at the beginning i thought the voice actor who was saying the play your part blahblahblah sounded like venom and i laughed so hard candymans voice scary but awesome do gorn soon the gaelic gladiator must beat that game once and for all me gets to good part of jacksepticeye video ad f u me forgets what happened before ad 1906 its not a game but the webtoon webcomic comic call it what you want ghost teller is sort of like that the main characters are different types of monsters and just like humans tell ghost stories they tell stories about awful humans its really good and has amazing art a vase fell off from a table 2 times a vase fell of from the same table but its jacks fault so it means it will broke murder she wrote vibes 048 if only that could work with my refrigerator hi jack can you plz plz plz play roblox more tabs the part where the mannequin came out of the wall this is completely my opinion and could be totally wrong could mean that the scenes are acting out what happened because it came out of a photo i think and you kept finding those everywhere i think the mannequins are acting out the play jack i think there is something behind me character yes a messed up past ill just hide down here with you guys i am watching this while tidying my desk every time the kid goes lily i jump cause i get scared ahahah i must be a green lantern cause i have the ability to overcome great fear theory the actor is the little boy in the memories and hates ships because he lived with his sister as a stow away they ran away from home when they got off not sure if lilly got to he became a big time actor so he would never have to do that again he now has a role on the same ship and gets ptsd of childhood memories could be switched for lilly too but maybe the role he plays mr hardy is based off a novel or something that his sister had and they played pretend with it also triggering the memories too just a guess edit lilly plays games with her little brother to distract him from the reality too jackie redbeard yaarrrr captain shit be fucked i dont know about games but the others is a movie with that plot twist xd first one is way scarier i miss observer we never got to finish that series but this is cool ive finished the game and jack is still in fir a world of confusion if the developers took more time towards gameplay they could have some promise to me the gameplay just feels like its there for the sake of it being a video game and they arent really taking advantage of the medium im not the type of person who thinks walking sims arent games i think that narrows what a game can be but if you want to spend the time and money to make a game you may as well put your all into all the elements to make it as great as you can act 2 is very very long and there is a lot of puzzles its that or i am slow at progressing am i the only person here that wants to see jack play touhou or the room games i got an observation ad during this xd the narrator sounds like tony todd from candyman can anyone confirm mirror mirror in my hand can you help me find my dad unmooring means to cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected 1840 maybe you mean murdered soul suspect sean the thumbnail reminds me of dark for some reason maybe its the eyeliner holy shit a new layers of fear how about trying to play dark deception in the shining area he looked at 4843 i think its the carpet from the shining as an easter egg jack your videos make me smile and make me laugh wait a minute no no no no jack smack laugh getting me ready for the squueekqule nobody literally nobody jackaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah in the evil within at the end you were the ghost it was bruce lee son brandon lee and yes thats what happened to him 300 sounds exactly like noob saibot when you talked about wanting to do a game like this where youre a detective in this setting it kinda reminded me of observer it was a different setting but still similar kind of vibe maybe i think the play through was actually almost finished based on the length of the game i cant remember though god creates death as the most feared thing throughout human history humans use technoligy to simulate death repeatedly for entertainment god am i a joke to you god creates death as the most feared thing throughout human history humans use technoligy to simulate death repeatedly for entertainment god am i a joke to you when jack almost perfectly describes little nightmares you cant be really dead if your dead on the inside all along jacksepticeye 2019 like how he whispers when they say layers dark creepy voice do you remember eart wind and fire the twenty first night of september why are the audios of the games jacks been playing so quiet i swear it didnt used to be like this but i havent been here for a while so has he just decided to have them quieter i think the first time i noticed it was in life is strange before the storm but i thought he said it shouldnt have been that quiet too how long do you think jacksepticeye has been a youtuber this dude gota get druck aga shit oh im a smart boy nobody me i was born february 21 u should play vrchat horror games they are scarier than u would think dont play with her she only likes to play with herself cant stop laughing i like to hear jack make theories and alot of them end up being right the game audio isnt high enough to be immersive enough saun yas this is gonna be tripy af we see the natural bird cage in its natural habitat oh no it flew away uhhh hey jackaboy you forgot the link of the game in the description hehehe your character is a director its nice horror game see layers of fear 2 in the title meoooooh boy here we go again seeing 12 on my bank account meah shithere we go again working and working until i have enough to buy the game mefinallyhere we go see the

still good 2822 its sans love the smoky eye makeup on your thumbnail sexy as fuck it should be the new look for antisepticeye awesome game the guy speaking in the game sounds like candymantony toddcreepy yes sean you are correct brandon lee lost his life while making the crow and its extremely sad i didnt know that this was even announced i dont know about a game where youre a ghost but there is a movie that is pretty much exactly what you described its called the others definitely one of my favorite horror movies im just a youtuber i just work here play one shot already jeez i dont know about video games but there is a movie called the others where the whole time you are led to believe that this family is being haunted but at the end they find out that they were the ghosts all along its really cool and is a great twist the first time you watch it if you dont know whats going to happen of course jack im just gonna try out new games me but satisfactory is amazing why should jack stop playing it because people say they hate it and i say do what you love jack because im cheering you on all the way plz play satisfactory cuz its cool and ur amazing hey jack you should check out the movie the others i cant explain to you why other than to say you described something similar to it in the video and i think you might enjoy it if you have some freetime being more specific would spoil it i think ive already pieced this fucking story together and im irritated because i wanted to be surprised when things fell together 734 who got shot little potatoeman wait wait wait wait a sec the earth isnt flat the first game takes place in the 1920s just subbed damn sean you look like joseph seed from far cry looks good 1904 the others film is the same every time you take a tape in fnaf vr that creepy guy gets closer 2105 angry ha loosen up for face there sean you gonna brake it goes back to being angry i like how at 4946 jack actually thought he could hold the door 305 that room look so much like from clip korn insane 1858 maybe im the monsteeeeerrrrrr thats been here all along watching this and freaking out when hearing noises in the kitchen the thumbnail is so cool i can finally watch your videos i got grounded from my phone but not my laptop lol well im not a doctor but im pretty sure heads are supposed to stay attached to your shoulders yeah definitely not a doctor i dont like the look of that thumbnail maybe this so said kid was killed on stage or somthing by one of the mannequins jesus crist is there a single game out there that has an elevator in it and it doesnt brake down jack dont quote me on that me hmmmmmm i think i am gonna quote him on that you can eat those tiny anuses you just have to believe 3439 why does a this remind me of jake and the neverland pirates when they find the gold dabloons xd 620 im getting the ring vibes 1325 i thought you knew not to trust those types of elevators from bendy and the ink machine the fact that jack and daz black both ordered a sandwich in mores code is hilarious its not quite the first game ok though layers of fear huh i only get scared when i see homework thats layers of fear that thing where creepy things are happening and the house is haunted and then they find out that theyre the ghosts spoiler space thats the movie the others with nicole kidman make some raft vedios please feed you played layers of fear 1 two years ago 1938 wish jack woulda done the sandstorm beat im not a doctor but im pretty sure your head is supposed to stay attached to your shoulders jacksepticeye 2019 in outlast you can run forever without needing to stop why cant every other horror game be like that see jack im not a doctor either but im pretty sure that your head is supposed to be attached to your neck not shoulders anybody else notice that icarus is the greek guy who had wings of wax that were melted by the sun and he plummeted to his death and the cruise is named after him and the opening sequence is of water coming in through the walls and things are on fire what happened to life is strange jack in the thumbnail last night i had to stop watching because im ill and was tired lol i come back today and the first thing you say is it is me bumley i have come to be sad on a boat lol its good to be back when jack looks through the telescope near the end there was something in the water floating but jack didnt notice im so hapoy iys longer omg finish it that was an alive one jacksepticeye 2019 so sassy in the first 20 min lol play the plague tale innocence pls im begging u jack 1837 jack just described one of my favorite movies these boots are made for walkin and thats just what theyll do btw its not only the tricycle from shining even the carpet is the same theory this is all just method acting and the director is doing this to get him into character theory for the end the mc is going to end up doing something terrible due to the fact that he thinks it is all real and itll push him over the edge the monster scared me so much i wouldve shat my pants if i hadnt been sitting on the toilet the whole main character being the ghost all along is def a cool concept the movie the others was like that jack jack kindergarten 2 came out recently you should totally play it jackanboy we know u where going to play this game 5555 was when i realised his shadow was a mannequin look at the neck ghost master jack in the thumbnail looked like khal drogo jack stop fucking talking too much youre missin the spooks what the hell i really wanted to see the slides lol person i wonder what would be a good concept for a game me watch jacks hour long playthroughs person gets so many game ideas just from jack rambling dunno if that was funny or whatever but seriously jack comes out with some really good design concepts whether he means to or not xd layers of fear2 all new walking simulator the voice at 300 highly reminds me of the treasure planet evil spiderydude also so happy to see a 2nd game d ummm 243 was that laugh in the game or was it something else i had to stop myself watching this yesterday because it was late but i did really enjoy the first one of these isnt the blackboard at the start meant to say character scared see 3849 and laugh unmoor nmoor verb gerund or present participle unmooring release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him jack what about spider man dlc monster pops up jack the lighting here is phenomenal he played this at about 100 in the morning play dollhouse ps4 win jack says afayr i think its free rilastate i wold absolutely agree that many of these horror ideas such as the closing door or a bottle rolling out from under the bed are done over an over again that theyve completely lost the ability to cause fear if this game wants to actually make people shit their pants they need to a focus very hard on what makes this game special which is the extremely subtle alteration of the environment which makes you question everything and b this needs to be in virtual reality since actually being on the ship like an full on nightmare is far more immersive than watching it on a computer monitor where your far more calm being able to see your true safe surroundings and just being able look away keeps seeing sun imagery am i the only one thinking of the story of icarus that thumbnail jack just sayinghot your right jack you are a genius and you should have said mirror mirror in my hand who is the best youtuber in the land jack jack looks like joseph seed from far cry 5 nowadays i hate these long episodes jack where your drum covers at the thumbnail gives me the heedie jeebies i use your layers of fear playlist to go to sleepcant wait for this new one yes morgan lee in one of bruces films he had to shoot his characters son with blanks and life imitated art during the crow i think the played character was forced to leave their home for some reason when he was young and his older sister lily took him on a boat to get them out his sister probably used the pirates to keep him distracted his sister probably died on the ship most likely caught by the officers something probably really scarring so that would make him not like boats and now he probably moved on kindof and is now an actor but

feel sorry for whoever gets 666 idk if its me but it seems like hes on the titanic oh god its back 1850 i have a game dev team thanks for the idea i will make a game that revolves around that that

princess leia 3341 have to do with remember me but hey what do i know alright game developers whatever ive never made a game probably what most game developers say when people play their games and

lars of r2 that code was different to h20 delirious i played through act 2 last night with my older siblings i waited to watch this im honestly not surprised that it is a lot funnier than what we did xd jack your head isnt attached to your shoulders its attached to your neck and if it is attached to your shoulders you might want to see a doctor for some reason i want to teach you the piano san i wish i could sexy beard m8 what happened to you jack you look different do more five nights fredy vr videos commenting before the video starts i am a huge wimp honestly the only reason i watched our jackaboy play the first game was because it was on in the background and my friend had already fallen asleep so i couldnt get up to turn it off i watched the entire thing in one night clinging to my sleeping friend by the time the playlist stopped the sun was already up it took me a little while to sleep after that the story of the first game was so good though that i have to see what happens dont get me wrong i am terrified but this is what needs to be done wish me luck guys i hopefully ill make it to the end of this video brandon lee bruce lees son was indeed who you were speaking of jack with the accidental death on the crows set though there was speculation he was murdered as to stop him from over shadowing his father welcome to the how did we get here boat tour i hope you have 90 for graphics the closest thing to playing the ghost i can think off is ghost master lof was about an artist suffering from artists block depression and a drinking problem lof 2 is about an actor going through a personality crisis since they forgot who they truly were after being so many different people why dose the guy that is talking at 5058 sounding like yoda jackaboy has kataraa deppression please dont tell me im not the only one who remembers this the word is character jack you have one of the biggest gaming channels on youtube im sure getting a recording light on your door is not a problem im still watching the last part of the first game cause i found it like a week ago may i just say that jack looks like a younger skinnier version of khal drogo whats with the chris angel thumbnail why am i laughing the entire time isnt this supposed to be a horror game 1903 yes jackthere was a game like that called doom yaaarr captin shit be fokedd this looks like the inside of titanic when it was sinking no one absolutely nobody not a single soul jack oh tiny anuses there is unit possession update for tabs remember the ghost pepper challenge well you said if u resist the

seen on the stray instagram post and not that i know either of you but you look older and mature in a good growth way although the nostalgia in me misses the green its nice to see change all those trails in chalk and all that it seems to me like two kids left their family and hoped on that boat titanic i like u sean ur are the best of the best of the best stop looking for jumpscare timestamps

upbeat successful musician character you should check out perfect blue it follows a jpop star and has a shocking ending omg jack the word is not flat its round go to space if you dont believe me so excited for this game i love that seans siri is irish is no one going to talk about how the game changes from black and white to colour constantly yoowho else remembers when jack played layers of fear 1 yes jack unmooring is a word unmoorning is a verb it means release the moorings of a vessel or cause to feel insecureconfused or disconnected you werent trying to kill me you were trying to help me

building your character eh im to sick to be scared watching this do a plague tale series maybe i know ur a busy man but i think you should try it sometime ur an actor lol not an artist 3651 chase brody hahhaha only real ones will get it fun fact layers of fear 2 is the sequel to layers of fear 1 the more you know play gacha life at 3am if you want views lmao why didnt you finish observer seanjack it was a phenomenal game this might be nothing but if you make anagram out of rescharcth the only one that makes sense is scratch her i just got a spanish ad for league of legends yarr captain shit be fucked aaah this is awesome ive always loved layers of fear im so glad there is a second game sean my son would like to see you play hello neighbour n i want to see you get scared lol theory you are a actor playing the role of the artist in the first game you become insane try become the character but thats just a theory a fear theory im not sure what look hes trying to go for with the unkempt hobo beard and greasy slicked back hair but he just looks like hes homeless and needs a bath proper scruffy and his hair looks like it hasnt been washed for months you can almost smell the grease and fust trim the beard and wash your hair sean you look dirty yeah brighton it reminds me of bendy and the ink machine and that jackson game hee hee yes finally what if the objects you pick up are memories the person living them and what if this is the titanic is it just me or jack in the thumbnail looks like kamski in detroitbecome human 445 felt like the clue was already there saying character and it was capitalised so i thought it was the answer to that hangman question because it actually makes sense but then i hear jack saying impactedwhat anyone else notice no just me damnits lonely here jack you should play the game affected the manor with vr im happy that its on a boat it gives you more of a helpless feeling cus you cant really run anywhere unmooring is when like the boat leaves the anchor or the moor and in australia a woman inteviewed ryan reynolds as pikachu and he said he covered himself in canary yellow to try and get into the character can someone tell me what happened in layers of fear 1 cuz im too lazy and idk wtf is going on why mannequinsanything but mannequins they are so creepy oh my god its here finally jack is playing layers of fear 2 now this gonna be epic folks me hears jack saying really nice abs what about a 10 inch benis did you see the new seth everman video bad guy do you remember h2odelirious you guys played depth was it just me or did anyone else hear a little slight bit of anti at 2009 because i did i want to see jack play a plague tale the unmooring is that even a word yes jack unmooring is a nautical term that refers to untying a ship from its moorings allowing it to set sail yea u played it about 3 years ago 1910 there is a game like that jack you played it little nightmares jack intense spinning im going to turn this boat into a helicopter jack top of the morning to you laddies im jacksepticeye and welcome to scary titanic wheres jack and rose how is this boat just deserted fun fact for everyone like me whose first language isnt english unmooring means pulling up the anchor and getting a ship ready to leave harbour and theres a lot of boat symbolism in this game play return of the obra dinn its an indi murder mystery game from the maker of papers please it takes place on a boat boy you shouldnt play with strangers she doesnt like it when you play with anyone but her jack right dont play with her she only likes to play with herself dodo you even listen watch from 914 922 in 025x speed youre welcome lmao thanks for the conversation jack really hurtful though im not made of wood 3340 the guy sounds like real proud dad leon from resident evil 2 just me yk that narrator dudes voice kinda reminds me of the cat from coraline cept he probably became a chainsmoker lmao i think the kids that you hear conversing throughout this whether or not you as the player are one of them were stowaways on the ship like the ran away and that is why they are concerned of being found by anyone behold jacks new evil persona emo jack from the thumbnail jack says he wants a horror game where u play as an upbeat musician developers writing down notes for layers of fear 3 edit holy crap thank you all for all these likes 2533 is jack trying to do antis voice 50 shades of fear hmmmm hmmmmmmmm layers of white one is lucky to have seen this in the archives before here i suggest it to be read go forth and search it as a reading material its worth your time am i the only one who thinks about shrek movie when the word layer comes out game do you remember me the 21st night o jack no i do not me wheezing 3709th comment jack ninja is catching up to you in subs jack the return of obra dinn check it out as someone whos been in theater for 8 years i can relate to the anxiety can you do more pipe videos they are really good and funny creepy thing such a shame jackay will jack be playing medievil remastered the ship reminds me of the titanic 1450 wierd flex but ok a theory in one wordtitanic jack in the end of the episode the telescope you looked through shows you a ship in the bottom right so anyone here who knows what format that tape code is ive only ever seen formats down to 4 tracks jack is 29 jack its been about a year since i played the first game i dunno time is broken anyway me without hesitation its been like three years the say goodbye video happened in the middle of the series after you did that you specifically told us that for the rest of the playthrough there wouldnt be any glitches and stuck to it but yeah times broke or whatever off i go i guess jack a game like you mentioned discovering you are the ghost may not exist but a movie does the others with nicole kidman i recommend it hehehe tony todd has the best voice hey sean im pretty young and i just realized ive been watching you for over half my life thats straight fookin water i now understand why phil swift from flex tape saws his boats in half and now believe we should all proceed to saw our boats in half immediately oml theres a new one not the heritage dlc ooooohi need to try this pfffff im literally in the first 2 minutes of the video and im already peeing my pants jack i just saw the kindergarten 2 official trailer i have a theory that those mannequins are real people but you cant see that and the character your playing as is a killer as for the brandon li thing what happened was they bought a box of real 44 magnum bullets and converted 6 into dummy rounds take out the gunpowder and pop the primers and the rest into blanks take the bullet out and pack it with paper because for some reason fake guns and fake bullets are more expensive than real ones by a large margin but they didnt pop one of the primers for one of the dummy rounds so the bullet got propelled into the barrel by the primer so when they switched to blanks it fired now they dont point the gun at the actor anymore isnt that the voice if tony todd aka the candyman aka death in the final destination movies game loud noise loud screaming man stop being loud the voice sounds like noob saibot for anyone wondering jack played the first layers of fear in 2016 im 2 minutes in and the design looks a little like the titanic from voyage of despair black ops 4 zombies map i love this videos ay jack listenend to me when i suggested he play this thank you the creepy man narrating is the candyman actor tony todd nice touch to a creepy game can you play episode 5 of sally face please loved that game jacksepticeye sees a door but then just walks into another one a game where you are a ghost was made a long time ago it was on the gamecube and called ghost really awesome game just realized that this game is made by the same company that made friday the 13th the video game its titanic 1914 there is a game like that scanner sombre but i gotta tell ya if one more room loops im outta here layers of dooshbaggery 2 only ogs remember jack am i on a boat the lonely island everybody look at me cause im sailing on a boat my special room aka his padded cell dang it jack how dare you spoil the end of your idea for a game before its even been made spoilers the good thing is that i now have knowledge from the future xd my name is connorim the android sent by cyberlifeare you still remember that jack uploads fear 2 me ah shit here we go again 4842 thats definitely a shining reference the carpet is the same iconic one from the hotel in the film you look life jafar in the thumbnail he should play the dlc to the first game someone needs to go ahead and say this jack you have started uploading 2 videos a day again and of course they are great we savour every moment of sean but the thing is and i think i can speak for everyone here no one wants you to burn yourself no one wants anything to happen to you like last time pls dont push yorself and pls pls pls take care of your health yes i predicted no one gives a shit but im numb haha insert yes memes yes it was brandon lee bruce lees son it was a live round that got accidentally loaded into the prop gun and he was shot during a scene with said gun very sad indeed 5952 ok but doesnt this voice actress sound like peppa pig or is this just me awwww murder she wrote i remember that show good show jolly good show hey jack would you consider playing gris its an ultra aesthetic relatively easy game about the 5 stages of grief i think it would make some nice videos and possibly add to the pma about how you dont always have to be happy but its healthy to work through rather than dwell on things watching this at a normal time of day no watching this at almost 3 am absolutely i love spooks and sen biggest fan i love you sen i never can make you see my comments but i can just move on abyway i hope did you watched the sixth scent am i the only one that got scared of shaun when he gets scared wheres the top of the mornin to ya laddies a door opens out of the blue jack goes to a different room are you gonna leave this one after 4 episodes as well just like you did with observer that was such a nice fucking blade runnertype of game and you stop playing it for no reason smh am i the only one that thinks that marvin is the one who we should be really afraid of and dont get me wrong i love marvin but i think that anti is trying to warn us this time its been over a month wheres the rest of vacation simulator little nightmares is kinda that game where you find out youre evil cut your beard the beard is looking badass bud womanghost i believe in you jack jesus christ who are you same man thats really showbusiness jack septic eye how in the world do you have the uncanny skill to look exactly the opposite direction of where important stuff is happening aside from the glitches in the recent videos i think part of the reason everyones been expecting anti is because hes been appearing in games recently that are related to games hes appeared in in the past observation for example was created by the same people who created stories untold and anti made an appearance there as well he also made several appearances in the original layers of fear which is probably part of the reason were expecting him here too im predicting hell be around at some point before the end of this series jack may just be postponing it as much as he can false sense of security and all that after all its been a few videos since antis last appearance and weve heard nothing of him something big is coming uh jack your thumbnail makes you look like joesph seed from far cry new dawn game texture exists jack oooh i like that jack i want him to have really strong calves i want him to have nice abs me you missed a bit great video jack keep up the good work when the dude says do you remember mesing justin timberlake pls i really hope harry wood find his kidshahathat was really bad the start of the game looks like youre on the titanic 1715 since when is spain in brasil d looks more like brasil to western sahara either england or france and then towards usa presumably new york as most ocean liners ship there hey jackaboy the monologue about how the man must build a character or he will lose himself is almost definitely based on the teaching of sociologist erving goffman who used dramatical theatre to explain how we interact with ourselves and others and began the dramaturgy perspective he talked about how we play roles in order to pass in life and that well play several different ones he theorised that many of us many never truly realise which role was the true character thought youd appreciate the depth that the devs have gone to with the story layers of doors sean keep collecting the slides the rolls and also the posters theyll fill up the empty white walls in your room i think and will give you a better understanding fun fact about the shinning and danny the young actor didnt know it was a horror movie he was playing in they told him it was a drama so all his reactions were real if i ever make a video game ill be sure to add binaural audio that gets up close and personal whispering things into your ear when youre least expecting it this game is so much more intense than the first even the first one is still good to replay the chasing sequence kept making me jump cant wait to play this game myself top of the mornin to ya too jackaboy i swear to god you look like a bearded kamski in the thumbnail no one not a single soul no one anywhere jack 4332 hey jack you should maybe try out apex legends if your not into it its fine im just giving you a suggestion but if you are down to play it play with your friends or randoms ps no hate on fortnite players impacted jack its character nobody cares oh okay this game is soooooooooo boring im sorry but my god for a video thats an hour long i feel like i waisted my life watching this love you jack but my god this game sucks 4533 did jack legit just say the moon was the sun when the character awake he hear a voice why does the voice sound like noob saibot from mk 11 daz games uploads a video on this jack uploads a video on this me interesting 2443 hey you know what were not gonna do ever admit that i immediately started singing the chick part to that in perfect harmony without thinking about it weird creepy man voice do u remember my head the twenty first night of september now i realise jack made that joke a few seconds after whooops jack oh boy why is jack emo in the thumbnail not gunna lie jack looks cute in the thumbnail full homo the thumbnail can of looks like a goth anti did anyone else notice the little boat in the water when sean looked through the telescope 10953 3849 yar captin shit be fucked 1855 yeahhhhh thats called soma for ya 5842 sean thats inappropriate jack you should definitely play a plague tale like if u agree jack can you play resident evil 4 on your channel i would really appreciate it not really into this one that much i will definitely watch the rest of the series but i dont think that this will go down into one of my favorite play throughs wall banana removed a bad word xd your video wasnt as entertaining as delirious you are just complaining about the game not being scary enough and all the time talking about the visuals and just messing around instead of actually thinking about the story and talking about it dislike sorry it almost seems like you just dont care anymore jack in fact you havent been that much entertaining lately god very atmospheric and as a storyteller and actor im invested as well as the prospects of anti keep up the good work jack a little anus i want one jacksepticeye 2019 jack you already miss stuff st the beginning no one literally not a single soul jackaboy im gonna turn this boat into a helicopter me died me sees thumbnail gasps anti is back whi are you alone is the ship jack we dont get many spooky games on boats little nightmares am i a joke to you is it just me or did jack get real irish at 3508 3515 nice game choice mate calm down you have rand to binge yet you already shat out another series how about persona 5 as your next game after this the answer too the hangman thing is character am i the only one that gets goosebumps whenever jack does a creepy rusty voice anyone else think the voice sounds like tony todd layers of puns first encounter with the blood moon in breath of the wild be like 3847 i really liked the first game so i am excited for this maybe those voice lines you hear when pick up some objects are your memories that build your character tony todd is the guy with the voice hes a major actor from the old days he was in night of the living dead he was the only black guy in the whole movie because ya know 50s so i got a crazy speculation in this game some papers kept eluding to people without permission of the captain of the boat i guess you play as one of the kids not having permission to be on board and the monster that follows you around might be one of the employees trying to do his job and where is the place you suspect people with no permission will hide exactly in the loading area with all the barrels and extra stuff where the monster chases you and subsequently tries to catch you and like kids they like to pretend and discover stuff and if youre right and it is supposed to be on a titanic like boat well you dont have to be sherlock holmes to see the tragedy unfolding judging by the phonograph in the beginning i would estimate that this game is set sometime in the late 1870s or the early 1880s i feel like i have already figured out the gameit would make sense but i hope for a plot twist and that i havent figured it out already xd 4228 holy fuck my youtube app closed right then and i was left in my dark room with no sound and i gasped so hard your the best we need more antisepticeye before creation comes destruction just thought id point that out saw the eyeliner in the thumbnail you already know whats going down oh damn i will like the second one because i loved the first one jackthere is a game similar to what you saidits called deep sleep by script welder my current theory is that youre playing as an actress who may or may not be lily from the childrens memories if she is lily i think that she and her little brother james once stowed away on a ship like this or perhaps this same ship and somehow james or someone else or maybe even lily herself died now the events of that persons death is haunting the character thoughts anyone probs jack when wondering how to make the video interesting robin any ideas robin maybe your jack anti yay normal intro again finally your videos felt incomplete without it i just have to say that thumbnail is sexy as fck that is all continue with the video i fixed the case when are we going for drinks lol another spectacular video looks at thumbnail anti is that you aw i just watched daz black play this i dont care though this game is dope id watch everyones playthrough thats kids sounds like hugo from a plague tale innocence jack i want a pear me jack you already have a pair of balls high fives jack the magic cunt shell jack i love you but im 3 mins in and im gonna be completely honest im gonna watch it during the weekend in bright daylight anyone else watching is 3047 other than the mask i kinda get major phantom of the opera vibes from this game like some dude with an obsession of his play or whatever and expecting everyone to play their part whether they want to or not theres something fishy about it 1531 dead meme formats dead memes as far as the eye can see anyone who sees this20xx me you do realize that no one finds these kinds of memes funny you but the part where he said is my favorite me we all saw the same video we know he said that and you reposting what he said is the same as explaining a joke not trying to be a hater more like a disappointed father scolding his children because he knows they can do better did anyone notice that at 3651 he says i gave chase brody 1242 that was when i got jumpscared jack ahhhh you got cake me eating cake so i guess youre reliving the experiences of being the kids as stowaways on the ship playing pirates and avoiding the ship personnel sees thumbnail uh yes hello satan we stan emo sen me sees name of game also me hahah that sounds like my life 747 shakespeares poem 7 ages no one jack have you heard of the how did we get here live show we love it anyway that monster made my fuckin heart beat fast well i wanna do it but i dont wanna put in the effort sean 2019 alan wake was technicaly like that as the only reason everything happens was because he wrote down a story about himself causing all sort of things to happen 1034 14 seconds of jack looking at a dolls butthole gone wrong umm well i know my head isnt attached to my shoulders its attached to my neck but dont know about u sean i havent checked the comments but i think it will be spoopy already you should try titanic honor glory demo since you like boatsships i am surprised jack uses apple i thought you would want to customizebe more open than that weird althoughpromo wise applejacks great video but light sensitive epileptics be careful who else thought of the queen mary haunted ship while watching this jack they are just fire cones its so the stewards could yell to let all the passengers know there was a fire so they could get to lifeboats i love when you do full

you know what i mean you want to play piano but not take the time and effort to learn it let me introduce you to the magical scientific world of nueromods the latest greatest invention of transtar jumpscare list please kind people of the great youtube nation sean you need to watch the movie the others by director alejandro amenbar i really feel that you would like it also i feel that if people really like a thrilling tale along with a wonderful unseen twist it is a great watch for everyone 925 did jack not know that that wasnt him and that it was someone behind him i dont have this video to be over you should create a gaming company to fund game ideas you like welcome to layers of visual design i will be your host jackspedicey 1044 the prophecy is true 1013 i had a guitar and the strings brokemy dad didnt fix it and we moved so i lost my guitar but im buying a new one to continue playing they were reel rats their is a game like that is really old and pixelated their are three called deep sleep deeper sleep and deepest sleep check them out yourself this if u like them make a video of them thanks jack question why is jack a boss answer he has a beard jack i didnt touch it after the fuse he keep pressing it i agree murder ships are a nice change of scenery from murder houses i kept waiting for that voice to say ill get you next time gadget i dont like big boats they are scary jack time is all over the place for me me time is broken ahhhhh actors are like onions onions have layers actors have layers when the guy said do you remember i started singing september then sean did after me its meant to be on the titanic i believe as ive heard anyways no i have not yet watched it all the swinging orgy thats a double entendre me scared jack hi dont mind me just hiding in the comments section by the way if you were wondering the narrator is tony todd the guy that played candyman i think jack wants to speak to the manager i knew the character was a girl from the start bc in the mainsafe room in the dressing room with the lit mirror all the costumes were dresses how did jack end up in the titanic what happened to observer 919 its because you gave me the ugly im both sad and happy to say that layers of fear got to me once again fucking mannequin in front of the shelf nearly gave me a heartattacki want more the idea about being the ghost in the end as the final reveal its not always about the what but rather than its about the how its in the execution that makes an idea effective joseph or john seed on cam yay im so happy your playing this bird cage flies and roof falls me oh the real spoops have begun this late lol just finished watching the 1st then saw this come out i get to watch it in a row did jack miss the shining reference just curious reminds me so much of the art style of the dishonored franchise i dont trust that red hue on jacks face h2odelirious is right it sounds just like candyman in my opinion this shouldnt be called layers of fear 2 because there is almost no scares at all at this rate its just finding memories the first one was better because it actually went up to the name and scared you almost 247 dont quote me on that jacksepticeye hey jack i think that you should play sea of thieves again cause its a way better game now who else agrees with me leave a comment or like please everytime i hear my name is jacksepticeye i cant help but sing all the way lmao play days gone too holy shit good thing im not sleeping on the bus im on xp sean loosen up your face jack he does it again me your doing it again chuckles im in danger layers of fear ninja passed him we were fighting the wrong war why am i watching this at midnight someone send help im not gonna be able to sleep at night after binging the first one and now this does anyone know how i can watch jacks videos from soma i know he played it but i cant find it thumbnail boys with the new snapchat filter yaaaaaaaaas loved this game plz play more just because there is a creepy voice does not mean anti maybe soon but stop acting like its always him when jack wants to do something funny nor creepy if he wants to do anti than hell do it just in advanced im just salty about these fangirls and fan boys being obsessed do what every you want i seriously just watched a quiet place 5205 hello thats a mate xd jack you should go over to game jolt and play the demo for unbound worlds apart creepy deep voice do you remember me the fifth the fifth of november the gunpowder treason and plot jack you didnt mention that when you walk into the special room the characters bedroomquarters at the end of the video the room is in disarray it looks like someone threw a party or was living like a slob for a couple weeks theres trash and clothing on the floor in about one thirdone quarter of the top and bottom floors really creepy play dollhouse its just showing the trailer of it do you know what an artist and a sniper have in common details watch the whole video of jacksepticeye to know why i said this jack im already theorizing about the game me haha jackpat haha jack i gave you a shoutout sean looks like that dude from far cry game in the thumbnail i played the first one not to long ago maybea year ago its hard to look at jack without thinking of aquaman for some reason for me yall antis back to clap them cheeks 4845 the carpet pattern is the same too definition of unmooring jackrelease the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored also what voice changer do you use me sees that hes on a boat thats leaking also me i sense titanic references coming up i love your ghost game idea of course jack lifts up the doll and looks under it at 1040 that thumbnail those eyes they pull me in soma does something like what you described but not exactly anti is that you yes no at around 4850 it is not only the trike from the shining it is also the carpet youre just playing roles pirate bank robber i dont think theyre memories well not real ones acted ones i think the voices are lines from past roles i am also a irish potato and lithuanian potato jackaboy ive got a game request for you its called epic coquest it a fun rp game and its one of the funest games ive ever played and or had wait they made a second game man i was such a fan of the first one im happy they made a sequel at around 40 min you turned around and totally walked passed a scary figure and didnt even know lol dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 unmooring is the release of something as a with the lines or anchors of a boat or maybe a head from the shoulders im just sayin but it does pretty early on to be boaty i like it when ominous titles tie into the setting 3 is it me or the voice in the room with the giant globe sounds like vin diesel otherwise known as riddick wrong game again youtube thats lof 2 jack where dafuq is sam okay i think youre playing as the little brotherand you dont have a shadow at first because youre building your character which is the job you were given then you get a shadow for a moment once you kill your ex only known by the hat the mannequin was wearing in the romance memory the other was a nurses hat so i think it will effect your outcome the mannequin emerging from the wall in the room is the birth of your first character on a blank canvas but it died because it wasnt written right this is all just speculation coming from a story writer does anyone notice that this boat is like the titanic hey u did missed a memory in a room before the artist room just to let u know ok jack ok jack if you see this keep your pma when going back to your old schedule we all dont like seeing you hurt we dont need to have a video everyday just be safe love ian 4156 sounds exactly like a minecraft door dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 dont quote me on this jacksepticeye 2019 451 watch it be character play with h2o delirious again jack why does the scary voice sound like tony todd holy shit xd thicker than a snicker hey jack wheres tabs also check the comments on the last tabs vid he has a man bun i want a horror game about a musician who is extremely successful heshe is around 30 anyways throughout the story you find out more about them and that the way their success came wasnt based on just talent but murder and all the people they have killed to become famous come back to haunt him i think itd be dope do u actually think the world is flat that video game concept is like the movie the others where the family finds out that theyre the ones haunting the house instead of being haunted dude the code for 3010 is 990 but the code in daz games video it was 317 weird 5057 and out the other 2108 sean loosen up yer face there sean yer gonna break it also sean goes right back to making that face im pretty sure blanks in a gun dont work like that you have the primer and all in it just no projectile i heard a blank got replaced by a real bullet some how why do i have far cry 5 vibes from the thumbnail 827 jack ah shit me here we go again anti has been coming back ive seen him in previous recent videos actually jack the idea you were talking about has in fact been done but not in games you should watch the move the other anti pls come back i will worship you did anyone else notice the demonic face on the right of the picture at 5020 minutes was that the guy who played candyman who were talking in the start you missed the part that explained why you are on the boat a director is shooting a movie on board and you are an actor i see other youtubers always playing the trendy games but wen u upload the same exact game as em i always choose to watch it from u first cuz ur reaction n energy is just the best fck yessss i just watched the firts layer of fears from you jack 3days ago yay back 2 back videos thanks jack for workin so hard jack spinning the globe boat ghost with the spooky voice breaks the globe c o m e me sir this is a mcdonalds drive thru the others starring nicole kidman is a movie that has her character believe her house is haunted but in reality she and her kids are really the ghosts haunting the house jack this shits not scary anymore me hiding under a blanket and leaving it off of full screen i think my favorite part about this game is the two little kids playing pirates it reminds me of playing pirates with my little siblings avast scallywags do not cross me or you shall be swimming with the sharks in the show you would just be our dog i think my old pirate nickname was a black coat captain of the misfits just to be young again i love when tony todd has random cameos his voice is just gorgeous looking forward to this playthrough 2747 reminds me of the scene in the great gatsby where hes looking at the green light jack you didnt see the pirate ship 10952 did you see this flower vase 2738 and in 2751 the flowers vanish she is here runnnnnnnnnnn what happen to your hair its gone i miss the green hair that twitching monster i dunno why but it gives me the feeling of fear of the dark when i was younger terrible fear of the dark the eyeliner in the thumbnail can only mean one thing jack is going through his emo phase a little late dye your beard or hair green i love your vids that mirror had a person in it very cool scare jack its have been a long time anti grows beard i dont know if there is a game where you play as a ghostmonster but there is a movie called hunter i think which is about a ghost haunting a girls house ok so that voice at the beginning saying to stay awake did anyone else think it sounded like the candyman tony todd from the candyman movies hi jakyboy and antiboyi have a few words i want to say first is anti all i want to say is thisyou deserve better antiyour the best friend a person could want someone to be there someone to make you laughand someone that you know well so keep being there for jack to jacki have a request for you jackieboydo something for anti cause he always seems to be in a bad mood thanks to all the hate and blame you put on himso i want you to do something anything for anti that you wouldnt normally do psanti is better that jack layers of fear 2 dosent hold the same level ss the first one so far its visually well made but the story is very confusing sean talking about the lighting and saying oh i like that for an hour and 12 minutes i believe in the shit in my pants best jacksepticeye quote of 2019 and on are left we have the swinging orage one of a kind isnt it theatre things jumbled in the word on the back of the board act research if you repeat the e react characters these words might have something to do with the show your true face line 5700 mannequins getting birthed from the wall vagina so thats how mannequins are made actually a lot of the time i do have 90 minballs in your court mr eye that thumbnail luci isa that you tells self to loosen up the face immediately goes back to scrunchy face me i cant love this man anymore jack starts singing phantom of the opera me how very wrong i was i like when jack gets scared and then just goes and analyse the art of the game a 180 4843 jack where is the kid from the shining me that is the shining movie set when you have to choose between watching h20 delirious play this game and jack in your free time when you dont know what to record how about satisfactory also it got an update i will be very happy if you do but if you dont i will be fine just a bit sad yes they made another one hey jack so i know you liked the rick and morty game so i was looking thought steam for new games then i found a game called trover saves the universe it really looks fun and i would like for you to play it this looks like a awesome game for vr when will you play attack on titan again you left off on a cliff hanger for season 2 i clench my but for you jack im all intense and investedfrom the environmentthen suddenly spooked by a youtube ad oo voice i believe in you not even a second after jack jesus christ who are you yes jack it was bruce lees son brandon lee in the crow great movie very tragic accident the way the ship looked like in the inside looked similar to the titanic movie great graphics the voice is that the guy from final destination movies the creepy sounding dude when will vacation simulator be played again sixth sense hey jack you remembered unravel well theres unravel 2 with multiplayer i think like if jack can see it his thumbnail reminds me of vaas from far cry 3 right when jack said you think its the guys from the first game my foot twitched whale oil beef hooked thank u thank u ive been waiting and asking for this i was supposably named after bruce lees son jackim not a doctor but your head suposse to be in your attach shoulder meumm jack its attach in yur neck not shoulder but its still funny xd please keep your good work up pal jack shon stop it now you keep copying me through all of your videos i started singing do you remember than you started stop it jack its happening to much now maybe i just need to sit down and figure out out how we get here do you have 90 minutes the first game was honestly weird but good jack scowling at the game jack loosen up you face sean continuous scowling at the game the shockwave of sound turned his brain into a slushie its a murder boat i also thought rescharcth was characters scrambled but its not i wrote both down an a is missing and there is an extra h instead so either they misspelled the scrambled word or its meant to be something else did anyone think the voice at the start sounded like noob saibot from mk11 im like 99 positive there is a game like that youre mentioning where youre the ghost i think it had something to do with bathrooms and mirrors about time done missed out jacky jack play tabs new update dude well yes the actor died from prop guy also another guy die from blank killed him self by accident with blank because there intended to make noise but still kick out a blast an he put the gun to his head with blank inside and well u can guess what happend so yea thay can be lethal treat them as if u would a real gun i want a game like this where im a detective going around talking to people did you mean observer the world isnt flat jack its a sphere please play a new game called a plauge tale innocence yes i loved layers of fear and im so happy it came back cant wait to see how to goes 1850 sounds like the plot of drakengard 1 when jack was spinning the puppet mrstark i dont feel so good when he stopsim fine mommy i dont want to go to school i went from listening to sad bts songs to watching this parkour so the boy and his sister were stowaways except they had been let on the boat they were told they had to avoid people by the guy making the tape and that they could escape their homeland poverty by coming on the boat he wanted to help them not sure where the movie fits in but thats what i have did anyone else see notice the flowers disappeared red lamp behind jack jack with red light on his face red lamp am i nothing to you 3141 i could see the mannequin i was expecting the mannequin and it still made me jump in surprise maybe im just tired p i like how i just finished the other vids on this game on your channel but three or two years to play this onebruh theres actually a horror movie that used the idea you described the movie is told through the perspective of the ghosts and how scary and confusing it is for them to be in a living persons home without realizing sucks that i cant remember the name but its really cool do you have 90 minutes to watch this video im amazed he didnt start singing respect when he was at the chalkboard lol thats thumbnail has me feeling some type of way 1900 sixth sense videogame you mean tiny anuses i want one of those jacksepticeye 2019 dying over that lmao jacksepticeye can you try and beat all of the game poptropica hay jackaboy play more we happy few tiny anuses i want one of

that well dead jack the character you play as is on the titanic your head is on your neck duh the game takes place in the early 1900s approximately 1920 had anyone played the room two lof2 reminds me of that game 850 jacks been doing anal the thumbnail if u decode it and remove some stuff its actually antisepticeye with green hair still i wasnt going to watch this but now i have the hiccups so lights off headphones on sean is it me or your hair are starting to get wite your becoming old thats scary i dont want you to be old be freaking yong being old sucks lol ive been scrolling through the comments its bottemless you have so many fans jack if you see this hi and heres another fan edit so i was going to insert an image of a fan like one that blows air but my phone wont allow it joke failed oh well top of the morning jack im assuming that the act thing is character and im assuming your staring in the movie the titanic thanks jack now whenever i hear how do we get here my brain will immediately slap me with idk do you have 90 minutes i think jack should play hollow knight but its just a suggestion i miss sallyface like if u miss it too number 9 on trending oh god the title screen is horrifying my god nice picture though he says the thing about loosening his face and immediately goes back to the way it was jack you fixed your lamp didnt you i just noticed that now tell me this game is pretty much going to be scary isnt it now listen to me what is the best idea of place where i need to play this game because i want to know how to play it right maybe you could teach me you are very wiser than me your wiser because youre older do you know all these things i am proud im a big fan you know i have an idea what if you waited a a couple of minutes before doing your intro with a straight face an then just not mention it for the whole video the sweet sweet sound of tony todds voice as he narrates the candyman was definitely the right choice 3 im 12 yrs old and my drawings look like crap i need to take drawing lessons or have a steadier hand that was a good episode please go back and play observer that game looked absolutely incredible and i really hoped to see you finish it literally no one jack tiny anuses 5030 this here is what we call your flying fcks its very warm in here just just take off your hoodie tiny anuses made me laugh harder than was necessary its so cool that you like phantom of the opera not enough people do imo such a great story and your singing was the cherry on top of that moment to answer your question yes it was bruce lees son brandon that died on set of the crow horrible situation great movie when are u gonna play satifactory with robin doesnt anyone else have that bioshock vibe yay titanic conner from detroit become human i dont listen to music as such 955 9 on trending for gaming me sees the thumbnail anti give me a sign that youre here me goes to turn off light but turns on night light then goes full screen to enjoy the show jack can i call you jack its like you said in your older videos sleep is for the weak well now i need an album of jack signing the phantom of the opera songs lol i didnt find jacksepticeye until late 2017 i actually found him by clicking on his layers of fear series and i am so sad that i didnt get to grow with the channel from the start or even when he became his true self im sad that i dont get all his true references or know exactly when anti is coming and you guys do im so happy there is a second game of this this was one of the first series i saw on seans channel to see him do the second years later makes my heart happy 3 layers of fear 2 exists literally every single youtuber 732 that gun shot sound man scared the absolute crap out of me the demon voice reminds me of ron pearlman for some reason any one else knew it was character before jack did i knew as i saw it and the heard him say build the character but i still could be wrong because im writing this ad the video plays so im not 100 percent sure so is anti finnally back what about layers of fear inheritance gonna take my horse to the old town road copyright strike me fear is like an onion jack they stink me no jack they make you cry me noooo jack oh you leave them out in the sun they go brown and strout out little white hairs noooo layers onion have layers fear has layers onion have layeryou get it they both have layerssigh okay i loves the first layers of fear but right now its dark outside so there is no way i will make it through this video i shall watch it at a later date lol you are the best youtuber oh and can you please mention me in a video you ever see a god damn notification and go oh fuck here we go again rusty lake gamessss theyre a nice turn about in the playing the ghost kind of thing 5905 could always try call of cthulhu or the sinking city when that comes out everything spooky and it turns out you are the monster sounds like american politics jack im 14 and this is deep is darling in the franxx season2 happenning does anyone know me and my brother have been watching you since the very first happy wheels video its billy jacksepticeye presents layers of doors 827 here we go again what if the 3rd one be in vr hahahaha the 1st game had a better atmosphere and story telling this is just boring and not even intriguing or scary i think the boat was a good choice too because it very much isolates you from civilization in a way that haunted houses or spooky forests cant all around you there is nothing for miles except unending sea and whatever lurks beneath and the only thing keeping you from a watery grave is a bunch of metal when is little misfortune coming out is that the guy that voices the candyman in horror movies loveeeeee the thumbnail jackaboy keep up th good work w robin isnt scared by layers of fear but 5 nights at freddys scares him to death smh 2511 gonna ride till i cant no more im a big fan of your work on youtube good night and we are going to be waiting for your next video icant play the piano but id like to he sounded exactly like connor 1514 outlast hold my beer i love how he said with ya like wit cha jack i missed the old times that you were always yellingthose are good times and made us beme your fan are we not gonna acknowledge how fuckin beautiful that speech at 4455 was brought a tear to me eye heyyyyy i recognize that voice the guy with the gorgeous voice is none other than tony todd who played candyman 3 anyone else thinks the narrator sounds like the candyman im surprised sean didnt slapped the blackboard and said act 2min in jack am i on a boat me titanic who i dont see tpain anywhere so im gonna say you are not on a boat tiny anuses i want one of those xd 5905 there is a game on steam called the ship i think its a mystery game where you solve a murder i havent played it yet spoiler alert for not this game there is a movie like that its called the others it has reversed roles the protagonists are ghosts 2751 i thought he would start to sing i believe in steve black eyeliner is a good look for sean js watching his playthroughs always inspire me to play more games did you know theres still more to the final station you thought that anti will appear because of the thumbnailt t at the start of the game when the mirror got shot i believe it might just have been the mirror itself committing suicide so that he cant reflect his face anymore i deadass screamed when he sang the phantom of the opera omg yassssssss 850 me turns up volume to hear what jack is saying jack aaaaaa tiny anuses my family judgement compared to layers of fear 1 this game fuc suuucks well so far when jack said it was like murder she wrote i was filled with joy that moment when the video in the beginning 614 describes youtubers 1842 call it the 6th sense 6 ads thats every descent youtuberes dream most channels that get 6 ads dont deserve them half the time is it just me or does the interior of the ship look like the interior of the titanic i remember the red face light from really early anti videos i missed the ego hype mooring is kind of synonymous in how it can be used with docking docking is the act of parking the boat and mooring is more the act of strapping anchoring or tying to the dock jackwhat would you do if you were in this situation me yeet myself off the boat is that one voice the guy who played candy man sounds just like him just verified it is tony todd knew that voice immediately loosen up your face there sean youre gonna break it immediately goes back to making exact same face 1840 thats braid to a certain extent if you want a good mystery solving game then try out the return of the obra dinn if u waited 5 months exactly to play this than it would be 3 years ago since u did the first layers of fear game jack breaks a vase me kiss kiss fall in love 453 its character 1856 i recall a point and click game where this happened you find out by going through a door into a dark tunnel and you first run thinking youre escaping a monster and if you escape you get one ending but if you wait and let him catch you you realize it was you essentially i dont know about games but the others was a movie of a family combatting the intrudersonly to find out that they were the ghosts all along jack its very warm in here also jack is currently wearing a hoodie alright then sean trending i see you unmoored adjective of a vessel not or no longer attached to a mooring an unmoored barge of a person insecure confused or lacking contact with reality this freedom can make people feel unmoored tiny anuses caught me offguard i choked on my icecream i want that voice to read me a bedtime story eyeliners look good on jack 010 time is all over the place to me i have no idea oct 28 2016 one of the first series i watched you play after keep talking and no one explodes and the long gap where i couldnt watchcomment on anything 147 am i on a boat cringes hard looks like it and you are sinking o grab a pfd and get ready to bail out into a life boat 255 is that even a word yes unmooring to take a boat away from a moor dock or other tieup spot 544 makes you feel like a big shot laughs but you are a big shot we use them for putting on makeup and doing hair normal ameture dancetheater on the weekend stuff 956 you ever have one of those things where you are like aww man i wish i could play that no not really i can sing reasonable but cant read music maybe i feel that way about reading music 1420 i wonder when this takes place not sure but steamer vessels like the one i am pretty sure you are on became popular in the 19th century what memes mean to jacksepticeye my extreme masculine energy i think rescharcth is an anagram of characters what is the game telling us you should play a game on steam called let it its a horror hack and slash and i know for a fact you would love it i dont know who else noticed but there is a small glitch at the start of the outdo animation you look like klaus from the umbrella academy in your thumbnail titanic inspired game idk the earth is flat the witches house would be the closest to that red light 1730 jack but where are we now me do you have 90 minutes more screaming more swearing ok ok so i started to sing the beginning of september when jack asked remember what and i trailed off exactly when he then started to sing september around 2639 and im shook hes a phantom of the opera fan im officially in my full glory jack maybe we are also a struggling artist me passpartout layers of fear 2 hell yeah the first one was so good hopefully it doesnt go all outlast 2 on us and yknow fuck itself up also maybe anti will come the voice in the beginning reminds me of the actor that played candyman 850 poop on a plate jack i want a game that reverses the roles me isnt that the premise of the movie the 6th sense love this channel i want to hear jack sing with his beautiful voice i cant help it jack looks so fucking sexy in the thumbnail you are no doctor heads are on necks jack make another attack on titan video jack continue attack on titan can we also give a award to jacksean for the most beautiful singing the word on the chalk board puzzle is character i was takin a huge shit and 3307 made me asshole cut off my shit your on the titanic all i could think of is anti i want a small anus too its kinda loose from all those megaseeds congrats on 9 dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 half of this comment section 2019 2853 who else thought about johnny depp hay jack im pretty sure im a super fan i achally begged my grandma for a sam themed bday btw been subed sense i was 6 im 11 now btw best youtuber ever keep going cuz im always rutting for you btw im irish to jack 2108 also jack goes right back to it shawn i love watching youre videos but the easy stuff you miss because youre moving around so hyperactively sometimes pisses me off to no end lol layers of fear has strange suspicious thumbnails i wonder who it is i feel like the dialogue in here went a bit too long tbh you get the idea and then it keeps going especially noticeable when the narrator speaks so slowly jack go back to sally face pls pls jack unmoor verb release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him i didnt watch the first games playthroughmostly because i didnt enjoy horror games much so now im diving right into it who needs sleep anyway sleep is for the weak you fucking what theres a sequel mirror mirror in my hand whered those voices come from the man in the mirror gives his two sense he said chase brody and laughed like anti dont that ring a bell he gifs tips all around the place jack reversing the roles sounds like the end of shadow of the colossus jack your smile reminds me of the smile of murr from impractical jokers time is all over the place for me can this man become any more obvious what voice changing software do you use jack ive been searching forever for a decent one the one i have is trash someone should make a compilation of every time jack accidentally clicks out of the game someone should make a compilation of every time jack accidentally clicks out of the game that was brandon lee in the crow someone put the times down for me and everyone on the different ego messages from this vid please dont act like you dont want them act translates to 3 acto which if you translate from french means 3rd act fun fact the icarus transatlantic was real and was the other boat that was made by the same company as the titanic there was a theory that the titanic was swapped with the original icarus but there wasnt enough evidence to prove that it was true i saw you on player select jack you most likely wont see this but a game that i would recommend to you since you keep commenting on the setting and imagery would be the call of cthulhu game which i think was made by telltale its similar but a little nasty and lovecraftian onions of fear jack when are you gonna make a third episode of duck life space a tiny anus jack are you applying you have a gaping one did anyone else notice that instead of using the name jack he used sean when he was saying come on sean loosen up your face he didnt use jack it could just be something normal or something not normal 4850 the carpet in that hallway is the same as the one in the shining too how are there rats on a boat in the middle of the ocean that thumbnail makes it look like anti might be coming back its been thirteen minutes and shit is already happening i love this channel let me know if there are any anti moments its currently 0225am and im watching this am i the only one who thought of titanic with this game the director i want to play the game there is a movie like your idea called the others this family thinks their house is haunted but its the living people they cant see they later find out they are the ones haunting the house jack looks like an old school movie villain still outshines the majority of people on the planet gasp tiny anuses i want one of those jack 2019 jack 2019 cares more about graphics than the game i heard murder she wrote and was like so jack knows jessica fletcher tiny anuses i want one of those jacksepticeye 2019 i dont think jack noticed the face on the door during the deer projector room theres a tornado 245 is the best part goes till 2 50 3756 top of the mornin to ya laddies is it just me or does jack look sexy in the thumbnail yay im so happy you started playing this im so excited you should play bioshock infinite jack how did you not know sos lmao yarr captain shit be fucked jacksepticeye 2019 oh my lanta im so excited about this the thumbnail is edgy as fuck 749 sounds like bane from the dark night rises jackspecticeye if they bring this on virtual reality you should play it been waiting for this game and for you to play it sean character deep wellwritten monologue jack furiously loud mouth noises jack you left potatoes out of your order youtube has better acting than most movies where are we in this game how did we get heredo you have 90 minutes the thing you thought was a telescope is actually a spotlight for when people fall overboard sean play lone echo for the oculus it is my favorite vr game ever i wonder if anything happens if you sos in morse code im here im a thousand years late but im here jack you should check out nancy drew ghost of thornton hall its one of my favorites and i think you would enjoy it jack first of all love the thumbnail for this game secondly i am thinking that this is all in the head like the actor we all play roles in life for example my roles are mother daughter sister niece and best friend so my thinking is that his character is going through the roles they played in life from little boy to bank robber to a murderer and it is making him crazy i could be wrong but this is how i am understanding this game so far its anti plz watch the movie the others omg right when i saw the mask i said the phantom of the opera and then jack says i think the phantom of the opera is trying to kill me sings intro to the movie i love the phantom of the opera me me too i watched it for thr first time this year and fell absolutely in love with it jacksean is amazing you should play more slime rancher it made a lot of views i thought this was the friendship the only ship that cant sink jacksepticeye 2019 he said he wanted a detective game like this but is that not what observer was just saying i didnt watch the first one when it came out cause i was way to scared ogres have layers like onions subverting the roles jack may i interest you in a certain hp lovecraft short story i dont remember the title but it was pretty much that unfortunately lovecraft tilted his hand a little too hard in the beginning but if hed played it a little more cool it would have been perfection i thought that reschartch word was jumbled up characters at first too but then realized it has two hs and not two as jaaaack i have watched all the slime ranchers and i would like to see some more of your baby slimes aaaaaand house flipper hey bru can you play this game called dark deception its really creepy with some evil demons in levels you need to pass edit also finish fnaf vr please we miss anti bring anti back this gives me some jigsaw vines hey jack there is a really good game on steam called a hat in time its a really fun and quirky game its a 3d plat former with a great story line and cool bosses not to mention there is a irish character called the conductor and hes my favorite its a really fun game and you should check it out i am planning on making a game where youre the ghostenemy you could be in it if you want this game would be awesome in vr who am i where am i but most importantly why am i sppeeeaaakkiinnggg off observer you should go back and finish it lol what happened to satisfaction in band i play the phantom of the opera as a piece in our concert jack you should really bring back sims i really miss the serious from 2014 jack i played the first game about a year ago i think me checks layers of fear upload date i didnt know that 3 years was actually 1 year ago alright time to get the wow this would be so creepy in vr idk do you have 90 minutes jacksepticeye 2019 i have to share this with you guys i just found out that tony todd does the voice of the director and if your wondering who he is he played candyman i think thats cool hello and welcome back to jack walks around for an hour while he talks about graphics hope you enjoy i do agree with you jack the game itself isnt really scary its more just visual pleasing to the eye and i honestly didnt made that you werent scared by it i enjoyed watching you play it overall sean do you get to choose what game you play when youre on polaris player select finish metal gear solid vote to let jack know he saw the bike and mentioned danny torrance but i dont think he noticed the carpet to realize it was just a straightup reference to the shining yes brandon lee it was true i kept waiting for the voice to talk about the vortessenceand the free man 928 jack the face you saw was actually behind you you your face was the black mass on the right the girls name is lily and the boys name is james could you please play more we happy few 1905 yup u played it oxenfree hey im a special boy mirror in what way dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 this reminds me of the playstation game eco night fantastic horror game jack the game has ghosts a boat and time travel dose anyone think that he looks like aquaman jack please look back at the comment section of your launching the rocket video of subnautica there is a comment there that i really put my heart into that i had been thinking through for years before there is an added little part in your video titled the sonic movie stole my idea to explain the part of what your videos have done for me there has been a lot of death in the family and your videos are the only thing that has kept me going 2752 well i can tell you right now its not jesus christ jack plays layers of fear 2 me sees logan paul on the sidebar im going fullscreen theres some nightmare fuel over there the guy who voiced the guy who talks while jack spins the globe sounds like the same guy who does mufasas voice did anyone else notice after i believe in you the flowers vanished narrator is definitely megatron the world isnt flat sean its obviously a prism 2231 the boat was louder when he entered to hallway where are you jack how did you get there do you have 90 minutes if you havent seen the movie the others you should watch it i think you would really like it the monster that chases after jack is so creepy looking theory time the children in the letters are probably stowaways and in the beginning jack read a letter talking about how the crew hates stowaways the older child might be playing a game with the younger one to convince himher to get on the ship and go in an adventure maybe the ship sinks and you are going through the memory of one of the children plz bring back antisepticeye 2202 not scary anymore idk i might be a little scared hello neighbor full release5 plz ive been waiting for it for a while plz why do i feel like anti is coming back hmmm looks at thumbnail then title 1847 id consider spec ops the line though its psychological rather than supernatural is it just me or is this game eerily similar to the new tv series high seas and yes in the movie the crow that happened where the actor was killed by a bullet during filming 733 no little potato man edit or 735 is it just me or does that voice 5003 sound like the vortigaunts from half life 2 yayayayyayayayayayyayaayyaayayya crazy person in the comments dont mind me jack released two videos in a day its been a long while i swear that thumbnail gives me ragnar lothbrok vibes thought i saw lucifer on the thumbnail yall looking hot af in that thumbnail ok but like why does the voice on the intercom sound like noob saibot just me no one jack tiny anuses yo for a moment it looked like jack had eyeliner on in the thumbnail game makes constant references to an actor but noticed most of the clothes in the dressing room are womens clothing time for madcap theories a you play lily lily is an actress and the female voiceovers on the posters are heryou any reference to an actor is meant to be a profession and not exclusively male b you play a male actor possibly lilys little brother the male vos on the posters are himyou actor is intentionally gendered c you play lily lily has disguised herself as a man in her public life possibly to get more interestingadventurous roles she liked being a pirate its the 30s i dont know the male vos on the posters are her gendered nature of actor is meant ironically right to revision is reserved ive never been happier to know jack knows and enjoys phantom of the opera its such an amazing musical and it means a lot to me and more people need to see it where is tabs game we have cleared people out this floor for you jack about 515 minutes later am i alone in this ship no one jack im not a doctor but i think heads are supposed to be attached to your shoulders go to 850 is anyone getting a titanic feeling the hallway at 4842 is very much an actual reference to the shining even the carpet is the same as in the movie cool theres a second unravel game play it sometimes i got really strong what remains of edith finch vibes from this game especially when jack mentions the part that looks like the pirates of the caribbean ride anyone else feel that the ship looks like the one of the titanic the lady and the mask reminds me of the lady from little nightmares jack hello i recently heard about my favorite you tubers breaking up and i realized that as im growing up all of the youtubers i watch are changing ive been watching you since surgeon simulator and youve honestly changed my life so much and i would just like to say please do not change for anyone stay you your the only youtuber i enjoy watching anymore thank you for being you im not asking for likes i just wanted you to maybe have a chance of seeing this why did i guess the word on the chalkboard in 6 minutes of this video is that tony todds voice 2620 am i the only one who thought of lion king like am i seriously the only one who thought that sounded like mufasa probably ight cries mufasaaaaa 844 the sixth sense not a game but yeah it would make a good one hahah jack turns chalkboard around makes meaningless discovery jack whoooaaaah bruh the word is character are you gonna be at vidcon i really want to meet you in real life unmooring unfastening the lines or anchors of a boat i would like a cup of soup mayday mayday i would like a chicken sandwich and four loaves of bread you sound like a hungry boi i am happy that this was released after my trip bc being on a cruise ship while watching this would scare me too much destruction is a form of creation donnie darko jack theres a new mobile game called like a boss i think you should play it pls 501 maybe its fun f is for friends who do stuff together uis for you and me nis for nonexistent letters of the word fun on the chalkboard hey jack been watching since you played crisis 3 im so happy your channel has grown so much since then but i know you can go farther hey jack when you were talking about a game where you secretly play the ghost it is actually a really good horror movie called the others that thing is so scary yes i told you play this and you did cx is jack gonna play the new star wars vr game this video is nsfw not straight fucking water yes it was his son and it was in the scene where the meeting room shoot out happened those fan jokes were everything jackaboy you look like a fucking viking who kills whole armies layers of fear the deeper you get the more cake you get to eat layers of cake edit because i chose to type this im surprised that people like this comment but thank you yes its bruce lees son brandon lee on the crow died one of my favorite movies unmooring release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him i have to say that thumbnail is creepy whats the difference between jack trying to get a sponsorship from cocacola and a dog begging to have chocolate none they both never gonna get what they wants i hope someone will makw a meme out of this you first one 2 yaers ago i kept getting confused when ever the game would say hardy because its my last name you would love it promise shawn make a video on watching jeffy im gonna turn this boat in to helicopter jack the builder 2019 yo bro your cheering me up and im in a tornado be safe kansas and missouri and everyone else i m r e a d y although lof is an odd game to make a sequel for edit 320 actor ahh it fits so well into an anti story i really hope we get some spooks seans makeup in the thumbnail fits him so well its weird for me when they kept saying mr hardy weird hearing your own name in a game i want him to have nice calves abs but not too perfect so chris evans layers of fear 1 artist painter with dead child wife and severe depression layers of fear 2 actor screen writer jack im already theorizing the game us were already theorizing the video omg i cant wait for part 2 movie the others jack that game idea of reverted the roles is a movie called the others jack missed the opportunity to say we cant be together it woodnt work out now hear me out but my theory is that your an actor who has played so many different rolls that you begin to have a fear of forgetting the real you but thats just a theory i could be very wrong but just an idea the music is doing a thing i say scared as i listen to any progressive rock song lllk you said conch shell were you referring to the lord of the flies its candyman the ghost in the background sounds like noob saibot from mortal kombat the phantom of the opera is my favorite broadway show i noticed some noises that sounded like ones similar to the ones in observation thought that was neat great sounds not sure about hitman but the movie you were talking about was the crow with brandon lee he was shot on set and they thought he was just acting but the slug hit him and killed him jack the idea you were talking about is the others the only things i put layers on is my lazagna 3618 could that be referring to the hardy boys not the wrestlers that kids book does anyone know what he meant by ghosting effect i want to get into game design andor game development so i tend to watch these videos to learn off of other games people have made and of course for entertainment if i have the ability to play them then id play them it best experienced when you play it yourself and find what you find and what you dont find taking your own route but i also want to learn about level build and how it ties into the story and thats what games like these are good for though some of the simplest or low budget games can also have good level design so its not just the high budget games that can achieve it however there are some terms i dont understand and are hard to look up such as ghosting effect since it brings up ghosting in a game or in an online presence thank you so much for reading this far and if you cant help then thats alright i still appreciate that you read my lengthy comment have a wonderful day horror game jumpscare me walk the whole game backwards horror game am i a joke to you action announcer i think we can do whatever we want venom is it only me that the announcer sounds like venom shawn during lis2 aw i wish i could draw like shaun shawn here if you want to be able to do something put time and effort into it love the last game and so happy theres a second onegreat detail i love the phantom of the opera too sean thats so cool of you to reference it i havent watched the video yet but the play the part gave off an anti vibe i really hope he does something with antisepticeye comment and like if yall agree san my boy youre being a little too curious at times you miss a handful of scares when you always walk around looking at the walls or behind you when you progress ps you shouldve given the projection with the deer a bit of a closer examination frame by frame if you are dead on the inside and dead on the outside that means you are eternally dead why does the voice over the loud speaker in the beginning sound like the fallen from tf2 yo what happened to antijack i thought the title was lazers of fear no one not a soul not a single person on the globe jacksepticeye im going to turn this boat into a helicopter he says my name is jacksepticeye in every video but his channels name is jacksepticeye his name is sean hes lied to us since day 1 to anyone who wants to see that once scene of cryostasis search for cryostasis the sleep of reason hd wcommentary level 15 12 on youtube its at about 410 timestamp you are welcome who got shot no little potato man you were always my favorite the music in the beginning reminds me of the bitterblack isle dlc from dragons dogma which jack should do a playthrough of i know hes played it but it wasnt really a playthrough your picture in the thumb nail is sexy af i read the title as play the fart layers of pear 2 part 1 this shit isnt scary anymore b e t ummmm this is giving me a very strong titanic feel just saying the first game was setted in 1919 10012 ahbscuse me do i smell a game grumps reference jack hell yeah i got to act 3 of this game fuck the critics who say its bad its not y did u stop playing guardians of the galaxy telltale series just saw h20 delirious play this 2566th comment edit at 158 is that the treehouse from captain underpantsi used to read that series the artist in the first layers of fear is schizophrenic also the husband in the first game was said to have a wife and child and the husband looks like he would have lived in the same time period as in this game in the first one the main character was affected by his wife who was horribly disfigured in this game you play a woman there may be a connection 4157 while waiting for the new set to be put up the actors got bored so lees son suggested playing russian roulette with one of the prop guns guns that have blanks dont shoot nothing things leave the barrel and therefore holding it against the side of your head is a bad idea he was unlucky he lost the inside of the blank penetrated his skull and damaged his brain sufficiently he didnt die instantly from the wound he slowly drifted off as he bled to death 5844 did you hear yourself jack jack play clone drone in the danger zone because they updated it 1659 and thats just what theyll do one deez days those boots are gonna walk all over you 1904 there has jack one of those examples is mortis ghosts off 831 he states he wants a pear though he himself was not prepeared for what was to come will we ever laugh again are the little elves okay is it just me or is jack starting to look like baldur from gow4 dont pin this jack your starting to look like jospeh seed no one literally no one game build this character oh oh wait i love this game layers is he the shrek the amazing game murdered soul suspect does the exact thing youre talking about wanting in a game where youre the ghost hey jack just wondering if you use beard oil to make it shiny and luscious my dad does and his looks great ive been trying to remember the game cryostasis for such a long time man thank you so much anticsepticeye on the thumbnail oo tell me why jack looks like a dothraki man in the thumbnail imma just say the thumbnail is awesome thats your biggest fan i can fan you with a bigger fan than that than i will prove to you iiiii am your biggest fan or fan creator the voice that pops up and narrates little segments sounds like a random goon from the batman arkham games sees thumbnail me chuckles the egos are in danger idk about a game but ive read a short story called the hitchhiker its pretty good i liked it atleast can we have anti play this i want him to play a game for once the menacing voice sounds like tony todd does anyone else notice the fact that once a video gets posted everyones like oh my god great vid jack ummm scuse me this videos a hour long you cant watch a hour video in seconds okay heres my theory just a theory the brother and sister ran away from home possibly with abusive parents hiding on a ship they get caught and something happens to the sister maybe shes thrown over board the boy survives and grows up to be an actor forced to play a part as a result he hates boats because of what happened to his sister now hes forced to be on a boat again for a movie and hes having nightmares about his late sister dear god and jesus i could actually feel my heartbeat when i was just listening to the audio what the hell finally lof layers of fear is back prepare for spooks wait 2 videos in one day and one with a creepy thubmnail channel chuckles i is in danger its 1230am im ready ive actually met the broadway stars of phantom for kristine and the phantom and actually heard them sing the piece it was so beautiful in person im so glad i knew exactly who the narrator was before having to go and confirm yo boy tony todd is back someone should make a horror game situated on a crash airplane or something just to add some original variety can you play pacify it is a horror game like if you agree sean please do the joy of creation some people are still waiting for another episode trust me it is free roam please we have wanted this for so long its funny how little effort you have to make to sound like a pirate sean you just have to say yarr in your regular voice and there you have it xd its awesome trying to watch this without stopping is hard if u are not watching at night i dont know if you remember but at the end of layers of fear 1 the main character was coated in bronze and became a creepy bronze mannequin then the game ended in this game there are tons of bronze mannequins oh yeah babey its back i love this series you should play call of cthulhu its a great game its based in the world of hp lovecraft who got shot im pretty sure it was the deer that got shot what happened to observer is the ship gonna hit an iceberg yar captain shit be fucked moments before sinking the restaurant looks like the a la cart restaurant on titanic flamengo shorts im not a doctor what aw you then a whale biologist god that joke is old characters scrambled play close to the sun would you consider playing rime it looks to me like a game that you would have fun playing and people would like to watch also it has now become free to download so theres another bonus i guess off topic but did anyone watch girl meet world that stuff hit me hard for no reason at all and i dont know why i love these type of videos one excited and hyped video and then one chill kinda scary game a perfect balance i never knew there would be a second game i thought the dlc inheritance was the end of it im so excited 2108 loosens face then goes right back to tight face me sees link ah shit here we go again click orient express the book im reading it for the school d this reminds me of the mystery of the obra din mostly because its horror on a boat is it just me or does the deep demonic like narrator voice sound the like the fallen from transformers speaking of observer continue playing it anyone else looking for the jumpscare list every video that has anything about getting anywhere jack do you have 90 minutes me saw thumbnail scream me 5 seconds later oh no hes hot me hey sam u wanna watch jack sam plushie across the room me then come over here sam plushie across the room doesnt move cause its a plushie me you lazy bitch fine ill come get you me spends the next hour 12 minutes and 36 seconds watching jack with a sam plushie sean you should play timers at baldis basic i think the word was character because it made sense because the person is an actor play some evie theres something weird about horror games using children with english accents that make things more creepy nice i played the first one demo and i loved it anyone else think this boat looks like the queen mary so i wasnt really paying attention to the video but had my headphones in but then i heard gonna take my horse to the old town road 2510 my head shoots back staring at jack thinking the fuck did i miss but i rewind it and it was nothing actually so this game actually came out of fucking nowhere i had no idea this was happening in the part where you said the kid from the shining is there 4842 its also the same carpet from the same hotel in the movie oh yeahalsodid jack just admit that he has a large anus the thumbnail got me waiting for anti lmao yay the voice is the guy that did candyman great choice devs and good video jack d if i had put my headphones the moment i started this video i would have been dead you should give a jumpscare warning wheres fnaf vr i want to see a scaredticeye can you bring undertale back those eyes in the thumbnail this is so much like the titanic the way its set up it looks a lot like the move outlast whistleblower where jacks good friend wayland park slowly becomes one of the disfigured patients thats a game where ur the monster like so jack sees please the scene you were talking about is from the crow brandon lee was the actor and is bruce lees son is anyone else looking at the comments when there scared cuz i am like if ya agree man i should play the game for sure this time oh my god theres a second game almost over 3 years ago jack 1845 that is a game its called little nightmares that is exactly from the shining jack you should make a twohour long video where you try to make a game on highend game engine i feel like that would be really interesting since it seems like you know quite a bit about lighting and shading and textures already it occurs to me that making the chief of security personally responsible for stowaways with his job on the line may not be a good idea that just seems to incentivize him to put a lot of effort into not finding any stowaways instead of steam boat willie we have steam bout murder the main menu theme looks like ac2 ezios family sound track with one of bethovens songs or notes idk i dont know if i am correct but the deep timbre of the disembodied voice reminds me of vin diesel oh my god its back brothis game was so clich but i did love jacks lets play of it sean i think the phantom of the opera is trying to kill me me oh sweet he knows of it sean sings me ooooooooooooooo more satisfactory wait should i watch the first one before watching this one ismellchaserefrances hhhh i love it but i hate it theory layers of fear 1 depression layers of fear 2 anxiety some other ideas from the replies lof 1 paranoia schizophrenia anger disorders lof 2 dissociative personality disorder i almost missed the face in the cracked mirror in the beginning i believe i whispers i believe in u i believe in steeeeve in steeve grab the story get it cause hes an actor polish games are the best jack 2444 sings phantom of the opera me no way jack i love phantom of the opera me falls in love play the sinking city this is like my favorite series this game is giving me mad motion sickness 2 vids in a day lets go nobody sean thats not right the earth is flat i wasnt following your vids back when you played the first game back in the infamous spooktackular of 2016 but im really excited for this and it looks like yours doin a bit of spooky scary stuff with it now too but in even better forms im pretty pumped let it be halloween all year around a fan in a video gameexists every youtuber hey look its my number one fan jack were is satisfactory jack doesnt realise that you could die from a monster in the other game that fucked up woman that wonders around crying anyone else go anti anti anti like a puppy barking at a squirrel when they saw the thumbnail i want to buy this for myself but 30 damn jack the word os character hey sen ever seen the movie the others yes jack a new wall appears and you say woah that wall just disapeared xd i was watching daz and he also was talking about bread at the morse thingy this feels like what remains of edith finch but more horror esc jack to himself loosen up ya face jack ya gonna break it also jack looks right back at screen and scrunches face again 136 is it just me or dose this place not look like billie eilishs bury a friend scene were shes floating lmaooof just meok ship its a ship not a boat a boat is smaller freaking out bc jack loves my alltime favorite musical i absolutely adore phantom wall appears jacksepticeye woah the wall just disappeared antisepticeye the wall has disappeared hmmmm maybe it was the door that dose not look like a fish it looks like a nightmare sean mcglocklin a nightmare on elm street what if the game is the movie that is being shot on the boat is that the voice of ron pearlman im not a doctor but i dont think heads are supposed to come off your shoulder me i thought it was his soul if you thought of it then it most likely is already a thing you should find a game where youre the monster and everyone else is trying to survive your attacksmake it big since that is a good idea for a game hi jacksepticeye i love your vids today i was sick and you cheered me up today and im going to buy you pma merch keep up the good work from a fan you could have also wrote out in morse code ide like a soup of cup dont quote me on that jacksepticeye im halfway through the video and im going to guess its someone going through their memories of being a stowaway with their big sister using their imagination to get them through idk but i really like the introspective way they piece together the actor part having to play the character and the child like part remembering how the ship was and then being there as an adult really cool game i want to be able to do it but i dont want to work for it matrix it into your mind i think you just described the inciting incident of prey 2016 ohhh myyy goooooood yeeeeeeesss you have no idea how fast i clicked on this video xd i watched other people play the game and i noticed that at the birdcage section some youtubers had a different code like jack had 990 others had 317 or a different number multiple endings literally nobody jack helloooooo 3427 jack stop it with the loudness me so your afraid of yourself ahhim imagining jhin from league of legends preparing for his big role just like this what when did this came out i love the voices jack does and the way he gets so into character in every game you are getting to old to scream like that looks like a really bad acid trip on a honeymoon i think theres a movie in which a family of three a mom a girl and a boy live in a house throughout the most part of the movie the house is shown to be haunted the girl even befriended a ghost named victor the twist comes in the last part though the family of three learns that they are actually ghosts and we see victors family moving out of the manor i feel like the character is an actor who is a sociopath just me ok jacksean how did you manage to get here if only there was a way we could know how you got here like a documentary or something they have a show on disney xd no this not a laughing face it is only the letters x and d called poloris player select and your gaming videos are on it a lot just curious but are you payed for having your videos on the show if not you should sue them i wanna makd video games eventually and thats not a bad idea i wanna do that can i use your idea eventually lol but jack the ride never ends i started laughing when he said 247 this was great super stoked for you to continue i loved your videos of the first game look up you reposted in the wrong dimidone can you play granny simulator ps i love you im your biggest fan i was hoping he would sing phantom of the opera when he mentioned it and he did 809 sean make ur own horror game that would be so cool this games visuals are fucking fantastic i know that intercom voice anywhere thats tony todd how cool not even 5 minutes in and im sold sean can you get sally face on ps4 yes jack you are a poor excuse for not turning in your homework 2433 oh no jack broke a vase yall know what that means kiss kiss fall in love hi im jacksepticeye the youtuber sent by ireland so what im getting so far is james had an older sister named lily that was really into pirates and nautical adventures one day lily and james sneaked on a ship at lilys instance to get away from their poor way of life they hid away to hitch a ride and somehting happened and that thing forced one of them to kill the other to save themselves later the one who survived became an actor that was breaking into big film at the behest of their agent they went on this cruisewhich they never wanted to set foot on a boat again after what happened the director is putting them through a test to see if they are truly right for the part and doing that is triggering them to have a breakdown over what happened to their sibling and the guilt of killing them do you remember me the 21st night of september jack am i the only one on this boat me well yes but actually no jack in the first game things couldnt really interact with you or hurt you so it became repetative and boring i hope that changes in this one jack when the creatures actually can hurt you oh my god i hate this actually heads are supposed to stay attached to your neck not your shoulders why is the red light on the right side of seans face but the red light in his room is on his left dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 hi jack i also get massive titanic vibes from this maybe you are playing as a passenger that survived the sinking just a thought its like this game was made for jack and his egos and i love it sometimes i forgot you were on a boat jack you should start selling alarm clocks that yell top of the mornin to ya laddies wow thnx for almost 1k likes telling jack to play spiderman dlc until he does it day 42 yea it was brandon lee and a part of the blank was left stuck inside the barrel and another blank was shot which turned the left over of the blank in to a bullet poor brandon lee died on seat please make these episodes shorter like if agree a movie with nicole kidman like 20 years old i think the hell is going on in this game thank goodness for the biggest fan where is tabs is it just me the get the lagines if only you had finished observer you just reminded me of little nightmares i could never play this game id fall asleep playing it from boredom 1440 jack hey fuck iwatch i dont know how to respond to that jacks face is so funny when he sees the mirror if you pause at 920 that deep voice sounds like the claw from inspector gadget ss ulysses was built in 1914 and was out of service by 1929 of course there were more ulysses built later on but its probably safe to assume this is the first one reenactor thats my guess i would run a away a shit my slef i watched this at 2330 pm and my dad laughed at my face im 14 and this is deep was that a pig reference 2703 i didnt know youtubers worked on creepy ass boats 916 mirror mirror in my hand whos the greatest gladiator of this land it was bruce lee actually he died doing a rehearsal when using a gun that fired a blank round however it was just enough to hit his temple with the force necessary to kill him i learned just enough force given to certain areas of the head will cause certain death and for him it was the temple on the side of his head where your most likely able to fall on your side if not careful when he said phantom of the opera was he referring to scooby doo game did i hear the voice of the man that played candy man tony todd near the beginning the little mirror bit 1850 bruh thats been a movie its called the sixth sense anyone else see the girls face in the little bit the legend of the crow is one of the blanks was switched with a real bullet and he was murdered in the first game is something that kill you the ghost the zombie jack i love you but those in the water arent sharks them be some waves matie 4038 was that person there before lol the movie the others hits on the topic that the main character is the ghost the whole time even though she thought she was being haunted by ghost sean im 14 and this is deep me im 20 and this is deep tbh jack how me do you have 90 minutes it looks like hes wearin eye shadow so many egos vibe and references are you planning to burn us all into crisp san is that david attenboroughs voice 700 jack how long is your hair rn i certainly wasnt expecting him to mention the crow or brandon leebruce lees son two uploads in one day again try dauntless am i the only one who thinks that the games that jack plays nowadays arent very good anymore compared to 201420152016 why does jack look like jason mamoa from got in the thumbnail im only watching the end to get your take on this game jack id like to pick it up if you think its good so far it doesnt sound like the beginning was very strong thats actually the same carpet from the shining too mooring is like a ships car park fun fact the guy with the creepy voice is tony todd hes the guy that plays candyman i happened to be playing overwatch and listening to this in the background really thought the girls voice was tracer for a second lol a few of my youtubers are playing this game but i just couldnt get into it enough to watch it i finally had enough patience to watch just one ep but this game is still boring as shite so far face palm the boat didnt leave from the spanish coast it left from the portuguese coast its ok though were used to it xd why the titanic actually sank a thread spoilers ghost mannequins me playing this on tv my mom its two fucking am me scared african accent okey gun media helped them make this game theyre the ones who made friday the 13th the game in 1992 brandon lee landed his breakthrough role as eric draven in alex proyas the crow based on the comic book of the same name which would be his final film on march 31 1993 only days away from completing the film lee died during surgery when injured on the set of the crow after being shot by a faulty prop gun that fired the tip of a dummy round that was accidentally lodged in the chamber the film was completed by rewriting the script cgi and stunt doubles and released one year after lees death to critical and commercial success it is now considered a cult classic no one absolutely no one not a living soul horror game developers but what if it had more mannequin jack whomst you know its serious when jacks in his chair also no game link i am in love with this game all the old school horror movie references this game is making me feel like a kid in a candy store so happy i know that its probably a no duh kinda thought but i really feel like this game will give us maybe a hint about jj i mean its the right time period the character we play as is an actor maybe an actress like sen said there are so many references to puppets and i think the game gives a bunch of hints at time displacement all of which tie in with jj so yeah or maybe all of this is just me looking way too hard into an awesome horror game 502 the chalkboard spells character im pretty sure i have been waiting for this please shave beard and cut off pony tail or i wont be able to watch another one of ur vids seriously he mentioned murder she wrote and i thought murder she boat why dos that voice sounds like the 90 horror film actor who played candy man in the game going to guess that act on the chalkboard will end up spelling character welp that was quick never mind yes it was brandon lee while they filmed the crow one of my favorite movies but also one of the most tragic also im really glad theres another layers of fear game i loved watching the first one i havent played it myself intro music reminds me of sleepy hollow and the narrator is scorpion come over here yes i remember the olds series me naa jack could never do a genuinely creepy pedo face hes just too nice jack for the thumbnail hold my beer oooo i like that jacksepticeye 2019 just had an image of a pirate saying to captain jack sparrow argh captain shit be fucked all aboard the ss sniperwolf i used to just skip through these videos to see if any alter ego stuff was at the end but since robin and sean put so much more into these videos than that ive decided to watch them all the way through the ship looked like the titanic no one actually fukin no one youtube lets give him ads the thumbnail reminds me of kamski from detroit become human sean the thumbnail really makes you look like the true gaelic celtic gladiator warrior you are your celtic brothers would be proud is it the titanic 2627 jack slitheen what is your opinion on gays yarr captain shit be fucked new catchphrase omg i died when he made the phantom of the opera reference lol i like the eye shadow you used for the thumbnail in the first 20 mins you have all ready missed like 5 secrets ya you are a secret finder 2806 thats why im watching this on the toilet lol jk the first game was 3 years ago time really is fucked who else keeps looking at jacks face waiting for the screen to glitch only me at least your watch knows u dont worry jack all the people who disliked this video are just haters i like this game but watching it kind of makes me motion sick lol anyone else jack brandon lee got shot with a real bullet its said the blank bullet was switched with a real one when i hear layers of fear all i can think about is junji ito i feel like the guy pulling the strings is the same guy from the evil within 2 theres so much horror in his channel right now and so many referencesthere must be something about the egos coming up soon i can feel it game do you remember me and jack at the same time do you remember the 21st night of september me oh hell naw this makes me thing of the film ghost ship it looks exactly like the titanic omg i remember this first game ah dont quote me on that jack 2019 hey jack the doors werent locked those handles are cald dog bones and ensure the door is secured tightly so no water gets in jack how much do you want to bet that you are a manikin you look evil in that thumbnail i love it two years ago not 1 kind of looks like the inside of the titanic at the start i hiccuped in sync with the high five xd wheres satisfactory jack i thought you liked that game me sees thumbnail anti wearing mascara also me puts on anime glasses antiwho hurt you my boi hey jackyboy the first game was set in 1920s here to help d dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 20162019 im getting real strong queen mary vibes from this also jack i think the mannequin you shot was a representation of the little girl since it was wearing a pirates hat i saw the thumbnail and had a mini panic attack in class i got weird looks can you play draugen dem fucking mannequins creepy as hell cant be dead if your dead on the inside all along just like his lamps blue broken on the outside red broken on the inside like me sean im not a docter but me ohmygawd shneeps comin whipers i believe in you jesus christ xd lol as a costume making beginner i was planning on making a full sized mannequin of myself but i think imma just leavr it disimbodied this game look sick sorry meant star wars vader immortal who gave jack permission to be so hot in the thumbnail my prayers have been answered thank you jesupticeye jack maybe th phantom of the opera is the one killing me and jack at the same time the phaaaaantom of the opera is there no actually i went quiet after he started because i didnt think he would sing it jack sings a lot more in his videos and im liking it d looking at thumbnail anti is coming back with a vengeance hey you should play a vr game called darth vader immortal youre gonna love it jack waiting to see my boii antisepticeye yeee apologies if somebody else has already brought this up but spoilers forwell saying which thing it is gives it away detention was a game where the twist was that you were the ghost and the reason everything was freaky the horror is back anti breathes jack chuckles im in danger im only 4 minutes in so i might come back and delete this but its not the same characters its not the same location its not the same voices its not the same assets and the original team didnt even make it so how is it a sequel it seems like an interesting game but why piggy back on someone elses name just cheapens the whole thing to me because now instead of looking at it like a unique experience im looking at it like a bad imitation when it is probably would have been good in its own right without that comparison o hes definitely watching jack loosen up your face you will look like grumpy cat omg this scared me so badly im currently at my grandmothershouse and shes has a bunch of creepy ass mannequins in the attic and i think i mightve shit myself jack have you ever played the witchs house you might like it ive got my anxiety juice and im ready 2 fuckin party please play attack on titan 2 jack was asking if theres a game out there where youre exploring and at the end you find that you were the ghost all along right idk if hes played the deep sleep series but something like that happens doesnt it sorry for spoiling who else watched daz play this jack use your fucking imagination cindy me cindy ok captain jack but plz dont hit me xd chuckles im in danger hey when are you going to bring back anti 2619 twenty first night of september actors are the saddest people in the worldquote by jacksepeticeye could you play a plagues tale dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 its really not normal if you see a person with their heads in their neck like this guy who manages to sneak in his tour to remind you do you have 90 minutes sean losen up your face there sean youre gonna break it also sean proceeds to scowl again i am scared really interesting how much more jack has been referencing his egos im not a docter am i magician chase brody just to name a few i rate seans idea about the player being the ghostmonster isnt limbo and inside games where everything is scary and you turned out to be the monster a game where youre the ghost sixth sense the game dang how long has it been gasp 2hrs i need to step up my game ahhh get it ok ill leave now ngl 1447 sounds scarily like antis laugh and he isnt even trying 0o does anyone else think the narrator voice sounds like megatron from transformers like from the original movies jack finally said his outro it seems to be the first time in forever did you know that gallic is scottish not irish are you secretly part scottish this is all what my friend says 3020 i watched daz play and the code was different im this game is so fucking cool unmooring to release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored synonyms undo unknot unbind unfasten unwrap unlace i looked it up i did this for you people you will play your part you will stay awake your brain when youre trying to fall asleep at night yar captain shit be fucked mister jackspedicey 2019 mysterious voice do you remember me the 21st night of december 2619 well another recommendation is deadly premonition it is a detective horror game 2552 pause and u can observe the guy standing there im on a boat im on a mothering boat chuckles nervously ah shit here we go again geez sorry fuck sirii dont know how to respond to that stupid stupid siri you were saying this looks like the tower of terror at disneyland tbh do more gta pls 2430 jack im so glad your referenced phantom of the opera that is by far my favorite movie top watch i know most of the songs by heart we played them in band my freshman year in high school i loved it the entire time im thinking im on the rms queen mary back when she would sail before wartime and just its very trippy because having been on that ship in march of this year i can tell you that the textures of the boat are all perfect and if you know what i mean from having been on a giant ship like this i can like smell it like its rendered so well that it looks realistic enough to envoke my other senses from when i was on the queen mary very much so liking this thus far 1433 someone please make some fanart of sean yelling at fire through that red thing so were getting anti with a man bun now lol just imagining that is weird i listened to the start of his intro and it reminded me of the song as it sounds almost just like the song intro itself 4846 thats the same carpet from the shining as well great reference i just have to say one thing lily the little girl playing as the quartermaster is an a to her little bro 521 letter says the section jack is in has been closed off to the other passengers 1353 am i the only person on the boat jack read the letter too fast 955 litterally me with everything xd yaar captain shit be fucked jacksepticeye please play fallout 76 please jack is the master of scares boo did you get scared i hope so yaas finally thank you jack d 3 3 love the thumbnail and this series eyeliner is a powerful thing i am willing to watch any horror games as long as sean plays it keep them at bay oh tiny anus jacksepticeye 2019 jack plays a horror game me okay when is anti showing up anyone else went to check up if unmooring is a word i have completed it all ready the way they did this story is amazing u see why all i am saying its basted on a true story 18131843 on it jack play ducktales remastered edition cuz u can btw which is scarier duolingo bird antisepticeye ricardo milos gnome theres a new star wars game for the oculus quest called vader immortal episode 1 and its 10 and i wanted to let you know jack bc i want to see your reactions to it the game do you remember my boyfriend being gay for disney per usual who you areeee i love when i make the same joke as jack at the same time he tells it love this please do more after subnautica every boat or sub is called maria 20 jack look up the witches house its a good game character im 12 and i got it instantly oh i actually had a little freak out when i saw this because i always watch the first one and specifically remember him laughing at the baby doll that kept running into the wall which i couldnt stop laughing at too hmmjust a personal theory here but i feel like shooting the mannequin was a key moment the other mannequins left you alone until you shot one and then everything suddenly got scarier the mannequins start acting more aggressive i think youre an actor trying to get a part based on some of the dialogue the director is excentric and makes actors auditioning for roles jump through a lot of hoops maybe the main charcter was supposed to play the part of a murderer and the condition was that he actually had to kill someone your watch is listening to you 2513 jacktake my horse to the old town road everyone else im gonna riiiiide till i cant no more u should play la noire it is a game where u are a detective and it kind of has the same vibe sees title immediately screams and clicks 1826 i wonder if hes an actor making a film about the artist from the first game and since no one has ever truly talked to him thats why theres rumours and the actor has to make a character for him jack nearding about the graphics singing the phantom of the opera i see you are a man of culture xd the end is near if you want a game like that just play pray i suggest that you add a warning for those who suffer from epilepsy just to be safe because of the flashing scenes i see this mentioned all the time but like who is anti im still gonna ask can you make a video where you speak only irish please emo jack stop i see what u are doing with those references theres another layers of fear that goes with the first one i watched daz black play this and it was so funny now i hope when jack plays it will be funny too 4155 youre thinking of brandon lee killed to death on the set of the crow one of the greatest films ever as an aside a cap was left in a revolver its a fake bullet head so when the camera looks at the front of the gun it looks fully loaded shooting went late that night and the weapons guy had already gone home this cap remained in the gun when it was loaded with blanks for a scene blanks still have more than enough percussive force but normally are only capped with cardboard wadding the aforementioned cap for all intents and purposes and at that close range functioned like a bullet that thumbnail anti is watching does the voice in layers of fear 2 sound like venom that thumbnail it can only mean one thing guys im afraid jack is going through his emo phase 304 scary voice you will stay awake jack with even scarier voice i will is it me or jack could have got a lot of money off that game idea like i know hes not in for the money but a little bit of cash does help a man cuz we can get a better price smack laugh production as far as i know the new developers of this one are gun media the same guys who made the friday the 13th game you are the bestttt sean please just design your own game already it would be so good you know so much about game engines and environment building id love to see you work on an actual build of a game check everything jack rushes through game and misses things somethings not right here i think hes watching us be careful who you trust the footage of the deer reminds me a lot of when jacob seed is trying to brainwash rook in far cry 5 my whole body is also like bioshock is that you unmoor nmoor verb gerund or present participle unmooring release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has

jack why are you wearing mascara well now im not gonna sleep at night antinick and dark reversed bendy is that ron perlman i mean its not a funny picture im just surprised he has it oh hell yesss i loved the first layers of fear and observer jack plz play more satifactory with robin 4127 and also bruce lee himself wassup peps unmoor nmoor verb gerund or present participle unmooring release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him p im sticking my tongue out like this p act character hmm looks at a paper the paper says next egocalypse im a duck moo sometimes the cliche parts can fit in a game depending the theme and all that jazz this is my first time seeing this i have not seen your other one i may see it again because i wanna be spooked at night while its thundering all throughout the night the ambiance makes the game thank you jack for this video i appreciate your videos your sensai look and the laugh you have phenomenal job jack i saw your yearbook picture go check out tall fishmans channel he has your yearbook picture lol i dont find this game scary or creepy but the graphics are beautiful sean aka jack makes it interesting plot twist the woman is karen and your the manager of the cruise game sleep is a weak excuse me jack is going to say sleep is for the weak jack cricket cricket me is this really jacksepticeye first laugh and now horror ok i agree with jack in a certain way at 1140 horror games with big scary houses are over done in the wrong way i myself love a good haunted mansion game or story but most games do it terribly most games that take place in a haunted mansion are like power drill massacre or something theres no detail to the house its more about the thing chasing you and the loud noises instead of whats around you like most indie horror games are just basically a big box with boxed off rooms inside that is over done but i cant ever hate on having haunted mansions in horror games when the mansion is built perfectly like in layers of fear 1 and visage especially visage i absolutely love the game visage with a passion it is perfect horror to me why do i think visage is perfect horror because it doesnt spell anything out for you for those that dont know visage is a horror game that is still in early access not much is known about the story except for a girl who has encountered a d you should try the call of cthulu creepy voice sounds almost like venom now bite their heads off i looked at act and my mind went to stuff thats in acting and movies and i thought of character bio shock is kinda like that where your being kinda mind controled biggest lie he told i dont know morse code 1850 well you just described the movie the others very recommended to answer your question jack yes unmooring is technically a word linguistic wise at least the word mooring is a sailing term it means to dock your boat to bring it into port and use thick ropes typically called mooring lines or something like that if i remember correctly to hold it there by tying the other end of the rope to a post or something on the dock so while i dont think unmooring is the actual term or at least auto correct says it isnt though its been wrong beforetechnically unmooring would be to remove the ropes holding the boat to port and head back out to sea dont quote me on any of the details like the name of the ropes i havent had to use that information in a while im positive thats what the word means though im relatively decent in linguistics and the mechanisms of the english language so dont worry there also youre an amazing person jack not just for how youve helped me but also because youre just a normal person but you dont quote me on thatjacksepticeye 2019 jack blinks everyone anti trying to get out wait there is a second i played the first one lars of ir2 whos lars the engine i think is frostbite 3 or 4 idk if 4 exists because in the battlefield games 4 mostly lighting worked very similar to this love this games atmosphere and aesthetic glad hes decided to continue playing the game music is reminiscent of drawn a search and find game i played all the time as a kid i say reminiscent loosely though because it more like reminds me of the music from that game you played it three years ago jack three did he say the earth is flat i know im supposed to be scared but jack makes it so funny that its hard to be scared the masks have layers 2700 his voice sounds like prophet from the crysis franchchise xd jack at the beginning of the video i wish theyd add a part where something chased you and you could actually get hurt jack when it actually happens oh god oh god oh god i hate this me you just had to jinx us didnt you what a coincidence that im in a group project about the crow which happens to be the movie brandon lees son got shot on set 1850 you just described the film sixth sense good movie btw mayhem is happening jack i love you but you now look like jafar with that beard i love it show u my pp was there a movie that the main character turned out to be ghost in the end 4843 thats also the rug from the shining your game idea is the others movie with nicole kidman ok so far the story seems to be that these kids lilly as we hear from the dialogue and her younger brother james im guessing thats his name as the voice in the film first reel 10948 sounds like one of the two kids stow away aboard this ship with lilly creating this pirate fantasy judging by the mannequin sequence the siblings are possibly trying to escape something bad from wherever they came from poverty i guess and have to keep hidden from the crew or theyll be sent back im guessing the she doesnt like it when you play with anyone other than her line was the brother referring to lilly i gotta wait to see more of the story unfold to find out more im not sure how their story ties into the film but im gonna predict were playing as the younger brother all grown up lilly got lost in her pirate fantasy as a child and possibly died in some sort of accident maybe she took her story too far and that lead to her accidental death and now the b am i the only one who likes the thumbnail r u going to finish hello neighborim still confused on that series that thumbnail is absolutely terrifying im seriously watching h2o delirious play this at the moment now ive gotta watch u i feel like lily is the main characters older sister and she was the one to get him into acting in the first place and his name might be james idk man theyre just theories man this is pretty intriguing while the scares are kinda predictable im very interested in what the story is behind this one theres a lot of questions i have that i guess well find the answers to eventually xd but yeah im into it sweet another horror game about how a man goes insane in attempt to find the perfect piece the boat in the picture in the beginning is the titanic i recognised the design and colour can someone please tell me where the whole do you have 90 minutes came from sweeps floor scrolls through youtube sees layers of fear 2 me drops brush bitch its time the prophecy clicks anxiously has spoken it is 2316 rn idk if its a good idea to watch it in my bed turns back against the wall so i am invulnerable to any form of harm tbh he should just make a channel just for horror games damn i just watched murder on the orient express today xd skipped my english lesson hey jack i play little league baseball and i got hit two times last game which was last night and now i think my elbow might be broken but i can move it but still hurts like a bih its the titanic hi anti and jack you typed out nonsense in morse code it was i think e e s t could be 4 s m or two ts 827 ah shit here we go again that moment at 2210 pick a booze dont quote me on that jackcepticeye 2019 me reads the title me oh me sees thumbnail me ohno why does the dude whos talking in the game reminds me a bit of wally frank from batim actcharacter i literally just rewatched layers of fear and super recently learned there was a sequel super nice coincidence this game is like ogres it has layers oh hey theres a new layers of fear game aint that neat just hope youve got the belly for the spooks cry of fear saw you play as the monster as you kill yourself in the end sen with eyeliner why does it look good woo the first one is about a artist and this one is like a actor or a musician unmoor nmnm verb gerund or present participleunmooring release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him jack there was a lady going after you in the first part where if she cought you you would resurrect on like a summoning circle why is anti septiceyey hiding somewhere that thumbnail be looking like antisepticeye retrothis game reminds me of echo night if you like horror adventure games try call of cathulue can i find 1 comment in any comment section that isnt begging for likes the fire extinguisher is from the 1950s so thats probably what years its set in back at it again with the double upload 3 3 3 i love you so much you keep me alive every day if it wasnt for you id be dead just keep being yourself i love you so much this game looks very scary and it looks like fun to play layers of fear 2 narrated by megatron made some popcorn and ready for the jacksepticeye nesss who am i where am i how did we get here i dont know do you have 90 minutes hahahaha i laughed so hard the actor was brandon lee and they were filming the crow visually very sexy jacksepticeye never thought they make a sequel i instantly got 999 vibes from this sean please play the nonary games jack a cup of soup me ah yes and i suppose youd like a bowl of water to when jack calls me on my bullshit for just wanting to matrix things in my head we are at code glitchy green everyone glitchy green this is not a drill i have arrived i have not started the video yet now i will proceed to watch his other layers of fear 1 and then watch this one ill be back edit ive only seen 6 seconds of his first layers of fear vid and im already crying bc he has green hair in it omg a second part i loved this game so much jack talks about astonishingly good graphics and visuals also jack doesnt say anything about the shifting of black and white to color me anti you specifically made fun of dark for wearing eyeliner that thumbnail bbboooooiiiiiiiiii play either bomber crew or surviving mars layers of fearjust like the fear youtube brings to creators ryan reynolds was born to play pikachu i really liked the first layers of fear so im really hoping this ones good too time to sit in the middle of my dark hallway with my black hoodies my earphones at top volume at 3am watching this wish me luck please jack said a game where everything weird is happening around you and then at the end you realize that you were actually the villain and that reminded me of shutter island with leonardo dicaprio do more space type games pls i love them question where do you get jack from sean pls respond finally a great game to look forward to cant wait for the next part back in the old days there were no safety precautions on sets forgot the name of the movie but a stage had to be flooded for a scene and an extra drowned also just remembered this a lot of those old silent movies like a famous scene in a buster keaton movie were all done as is buster keaton almost died doing that famous scene with the falling house side and he just makes it through the window scared the piss out of everyone on set there werent any matresses in scenes with pits but sometimes they were just really clever camera tricks choose the right one jack im choosing the one on the right me maybe they guy meant stage right he is a director after all 600 man i for real thought he was going to make a penis joke wow i think im a woman jacksepticeye 2019 2527 anyone else getting ron perlman vibes the actor who voiced the lich from adventure time adults can have shitty drawings xd tbh i get croatoan vibes from this game yk ur the only one on the boat you dont seem to know who u are or what happened idk im just super intrigued by it jack the kid from the shining is here literally the tricycle and floor from the shining i paused the video at the mirror part when it broke and someone was behind you with glowing eyes so i was in the middle of rewatching the first series of this ive watch daz games play this but he saved a part where he says of my god and his making a part 2 of it but honestly this is awesome i finally understand what he met now hey jack watch how is pragnant formed and also curse of the weegee board please for jfhv 1036 man gives story significant information contributory to the task at hand jack fiddles with new toy well thats quite convenient i was watching him play the first one when this came around thumbnail is giving me antisepticeye vibes at 453 the missing word is character at 1918 he literally fuking described outlast game that he already played i had no idea that there was a sequel to this lets hope this one is just as memorably crazy as the last one im going to be the one that claims responsibility for fixing that vase so ill be waiting on those drinks sees thumbnail shakes and clicks vid to read comments sees talk about anti jack where he at tho screams cuz no one is home well anti is gonna kill jackagain sometime soon or not kill jack and just let us know hes still here character a c t just a prediction lars of ir 2 fukin finally but i thought sleep is for the weak jack i like that you are posting more videos because they get more better and thank you for always inspiring all of us 1457 with no sound it looks like he says a long hallway and goes nope there is a movie with that concept the sixth sense jack speaks about shining the floor in that room is straight from shining me jack why cant you realise oh my god that hallway with the tricycle is from the shining its the same freaking carpet d 1900 no thats the sixth sense ehhguysany jum jumpscare stamp stamps pplease guyguys no please please ahhh what the fuck was that i just found out about this game and i bolted here as quick as i could top of the afternoon to ya sean dammit these notifications are just appalling what i think is that we play as the little brother of the girl who is talking and the girl got killed or something and he forgot so the dude with the evil voice reminds him of what happened i gave chase brody jack what are you doing to me hay 2825 i used to draw smiling suns when i was a kid then again fuckin bitch said chase brody also mentioning magicians and doctors i swear 2621 demon do you remember me the twenty first oooof september edit i wrote this before realising jack said it too 10 seconds later edit 2 i was genuinely unaware there was the word night in that verse 809 its not a horror game unfortunately but upbeat successful musician you say o wandersong might be the game for you noob games ever if you buy this jack the viking jack but when you realized you cant get hurt it kinda ruined the mood also jack i can actually get hurt this time and i hate it awesome videojacksepticeyekeep up the good workmy friend im pretty sure that this scenery is the titanic hmmm unmooring is a word and fits perfectly with this 0 is it just me or does jack look like kahl drogo from game of thrones in the thumbnail i instantly thought of this as i saw it sorry for the bad grammar hmm not so scary the moment he said do you remember all i thought was the 25th night of september i believe the artist in the first layers of fear had depression and was a paranoid schizophrenic this game looks really good feels realistic who else just loves when sean makes a broadwaymusical reference in his vids the thumbnail reminds me of khal drogo from game of thrones icarus doesnt seem like a great name to call a ship seeing as in the myth icarus drowns yo anti is giving yo ass that death stare mah boii dang pls dont hurt me i love you anti your on the titanic and was lonched in ireland for the first time voice sleep is a poor excuse me ok mom can you pass me the coffee 2821 this is the reaction of someone with a gun up to his head me sees thumbnail

volume of the game i can hardly hear it without blasting the volume on my pc then when you talk you just about shatter my windows jacks new haircut and beard basically makes him look like baldur from

everything i dont think anyone has seen that yet dont quote me on that jacksepticeye jack you should really play return of the obra dinn a detective game on a ship made by the same people from papers

someone was just talking to me very creepy creepy games tend to have that visually very sexy died laughing i didnt even know there was a second one this is gonna be good please play lisa the painful sees anti in thumbnail meaww shit here we go again lars of r2 yes unmooring is kind of like disconnecting or coming untied and i think here its being used as a play on words not only does it usually refer to a ship being untied from the dock but it can also refer to someone losing their grasp on sanity becoming unmoored from reality big no no to that thumbnail apearences will deceive you fear is like onions onions have layers and fear has layers is that vin diesel voice acting little nightmares is a game you have played and is an example of what you are talking about im quoting you on that your playing a women btw me aight its time to go to sleep school is tommorow jack updloading layers of fear 2 are you sure about that edit whoa thanks for the likes the thumbnail of this video is probably ma favorite thumbnail sean has ever done its been years since the green boy played the first lof on this very channel i am old in places the video was very laggy but that just could be my phone i saw daz games play this like if u likelove billie ellish like if u likelove jacksepticeye jack you should play the original again and try to get one of the alternate endings therere 3 to both the main game and the dlc petetion for anti to host meme review anyone says anything about layers jack whispers of fear upbeat successful musician sounds like bama from the musical game please give me a shoitout your new look is giving me irish version of the show vikings vibes also jump scares are basically the only thing that gets me to actually scream i hate it 316 is that the candy man he sounds like tony todd i love it jacksepticeye post a video over 1 hour long me do i really have over 90 minutes jk jkand yes i do jack would be a great video game maker 2723 damn if anyone knows about league of legends doesnt this remind you so much of jhin because i cant stop thinking about him watching this edit man even 5322 screams jhin like the whole idea of thinking about killing as a form of art amazing loved the first one and i love this one so far also when you were looking out by the end on the see there was a ship in the left bottom corner layers of fear and fnaf videos at the same time what is this october 2016 im so fucking excited yoooooo this is really good so far im actually watching a layers of fear series as its uploaded i watched jacks original series after the fact since i wasnt subscribed until april or may of 2017 on a side note i thought that astonishingly creepy voice was tony todd who among other things played candyman its not him though 1921 there is an old newgrounds game that does this very concept it shares the same name a poem its based off something like unwelcomed or unwanted stranger mesees thumbnail o is that antiseptceye clicks on the video oh still good please give me a shoutout why is everyone talking about anti it isnt the spooky month sees jack wearing eyeliner me omg inheal deeply it anti that ship looks like the queen mary now that i think about it i got an observation ad has volume all the way up forgets and clicks on jse video goes deaf okay so it seems the young girl lily and the boy mr hardy are the stow aways that shouldnt be there for whatever reasons it seems they had to skip town as fast as possible and the young girl is trying to keep the boy happy by playing pirate with him what we are we as the player our connection to the children and what film has to do with any of it is not yet clear my theory the children are your kids you abandoned to pursue a career in film or we end up becoming their cause of death which is why they haunt us i love hearing jack talk about video game visuals and graphics yeah we all saw dannys trike from the shining but is nobody gonna talk about the shining floors as well how did i get here i dont know do you a have 1 minutes i look up jacksepticeye and clicked on this video act one the in memory i legit jumped at everything from this lets play lol i loved this video cant wait for part 2 xx i have 3 fear layers tony todd freaking candyman awesome plot twist its jhin from leauge last time i saw it it had 66k views coincidence i think not thumbnail jack with gages and eyeliner me picks up my phone to make a call ah yes hello sam dean im gonna need silver knuckles a super soaker full of holy water and instructions on how to build a devils trap yep hes back thanks uhhuh bye when jack plays a horror game its just pure comedy because he is just too funny jack i thought of a game then describes the sixth sense love it 918 perfect timing guys what happened to observer moree as soon as possible plzzzzzzzzzzz i love this game what a menacing voice big bad scary man so then he copied it and did it right into the mic thanks i hate it jack make a game where im the monster me deep sleep me comes home from school and checks subscription page first thing me well he has returned 854 ah tiny anuses i want one of those jacksepticeye 2019 me in the first few seconds of gameplay not prepared for the sensitive controls jesus take the wheel the story you described where the main character is actually the ghost and the spooks are made by living people is actually a movie with nicole kidman from 2001 i guess this is spoilers but the movie is almost 20 years old xd its called the others the word is retracted the deep voice in the game is that the guy who played the candyman love that jack is playing this game 1142 hearing you say that there arent many horror games on boats im not sure if youve played this already but theres a randomized game called monstrum that takes place on a boat the entire premise is you have to escape by fixing one of the three getaway things im so excited for this i genuinely just finished rewatching the first layers of fear playthrough and was telling a friend about it haha does the setting look like the titanic to anyone no just me 308 that scared me when you growled the music at 3112 sounds sort of like the mermaid song from harry potter and the goblet of fire yes i am a potterhead and proud lol sees the word fear instantly thinks of anti but i usually think of trypophobia game creepy sounds in the background jack man the lighting is very nice yayyyy jack uploaded on my birthday or should i say anti congrats on the 22 million subscribers jack this is giving me little nightmares vibes 1842 ive read books where the main character is like that jack jack have you ever considered trying persona 5 i am from the netherlants and i am a big fan jack loosen up your face 5 sec later goes right back it its my burthday today i am so happy i thought i was the only one that said it sounded like old town road 1949 spoiler not about this game or series silent hill shattered memories was something like that world aesthetic jamesonjanti 3650 mention of chase brody 4010 marvin the magnificent the mirror didnt cracking cos u were ugly its because it couldnt handle your sheer warrior beauty did anyone else catch that the window at 2812 was actually like a projector screen and its like the player is in the movie me ill be a brave man watch fullscreen with headphones also me 2 mins in shit where the jumpscare times at 1900 wow jack that actually sounds like an awesome idea for a game someone do that and be sure to credit jack in this video watch he does all this anti hype and then anti never fully comes back xd its all just his transformation to emo boi did u just call jse a poor excuse well me and 22 million people are about to fuck u up not just me who thinks the game narrator sounds like darkiplier you should have played plague tale innocence 10 video 90 comments about the thumbnail its actually a really awesome thumbnail agh these comments hurt me a little jack so we left spain me thats portugal its not a part of spain dont fuck with me sean dont get a girls hope up with that thumbnail aw tiny anuses i want one of those jacksepticeye2019 what did everyone say for the chalkboard in the beginning am i the only one who only gets observation ads for jacks channel now little morse code lesson in case of emergency sos me bloody hell jack bloody hell harry me what a jack idk whats happening in t this game me makes 2 of us me i dont like it when jack ends the video when something interesting happens jack uploads a whole gameplay me oh dear you know im early and dont know what to you know comment so yeah a game where youre the ghost so the others but as a game lol the guy talking is candyman and the morgue guy from final destination series youre on the titanic it looks almost exactly like titanic wait do you wear eyeliner in the thumbnail im a new subscriber so can someone tell me why his real name is sean but he goes by jack hes back plsssss bring back green hair out of topic to make the robot in fnaf vr to get closer is by collecting the tapes walks in sen hey gabs could i borrow your eyeliner wait i read this as lasers of fear i was literally expecting lasers jack can i get a highfive already off to a great start do you have 90 minutes yaaar captain shit be fucked jacksepticeye may 2019 im going to watch this video with headphones on a phone that means that i cant hide in the comments i dont know how everyone feels about this but i think you should play this with a heart beat monitor anyone agree such a shame what a shame the poor grooms bride is a whore 2108 sean loosen up your face sean your gonna break it sean immediately goes back to the same face the thumbnail is attractive 5823 somehow i got scared jack that bloody thumb nail for the video scared the hell out of me 6 minutes in we know hes an actor and because this is layers of fear hes got some form of mental illness dissociative identity disorder that would make for an interesting narrative 90 of the comments omg its anti omgg jack make the phantom of the opera like five seconds after i say it out loud to myself are we on the same wavelength or do i just watch a jack more than the average bean i love jack but i i cant deal with that hair no hate just not a fan of the style announcer sleep is a poor excuse me dont you mean sleep is for the weak hopefully you dont get us excited and leave the game your giting old ainteseptceye warning dont watch while high dont do this to me on a school night hopefully this one will help us understand the original story more the return of obra dinn detective game set on a ship by the devs of papers please so excited when i saw thisss thats not right the world is flat joke or not i will punch you in the dick there was ego references in this video hmmmmm it wasnt an accident jacky boy you missed alot of doors something i wish i could but cba learning the violin i always found it cool love its sound you hit that right on the head jack the carpet is the exact same as the movie in the shining thats suck a cool water egg jack and i sang the phantom song at the same timethat was funny the first film reminded me off that tape in farcry 5 you did not beat observer game as an actor i can say bruh jack great game jack a boy i can teach you to play paino 6th sense flipped the perception of who the ghost is i cliked on this the second i saw it jack you mad with these uploads that red light on your face looks shit tipremove it 2530 that guy speaking is so sounded like candyman can the eyeliner become a permanent fixture cause mumma mia unmooring can have two meanings 1 to release a vessel from anchorage and 2 the cause of feeling insecure confused or disconnected both definitions feel like theyd work well for this game theres a film where people think their house is haunted and turns out theyre the ghosts instead dont know if that helps but ye cant remeber the film name like of it is a good video the truth is the bottom of the page is torn off me oh wow new jse video lets go also me has volume at one and crunching snack as loud as possible im so excited that your playing this layers of fear was one of the first horror games i ever played and realised my true love for them so much so i streamed them 3652 jack says i gave chase brody instead of i gave chase but sexy thumbnail dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 should i watch some of this episode or should i wait until i play the game its so hard to decide 3654 excuse me how dare you do this to my poor heart the guy with the cool voice is tony todd he plays one of the lead roles in a movie from 1992 called candyman a phenomenal horror film that i encourage everyone to watch i hope this is super scary jack looks at donuts ooh look tiny anuses i want one of those me facpalm i will never look at donuts the same way again my son was named after bruce lees son so i know what you were talking about he is my brandon lee d you know hes in your head when your watching a show where someone says how did we get here and you say do you have 90 minutes i am so glad that you made that phantom of the opera reference i love that song you sang it good too i thought it was anti in the thumbnail you really look like youre living your best life honestly and just look super chill thats why i have been subbed for so long we need to make jack a custom recording sign 1931 no one gonna talk about hear the voicesthey whisper nah thats fine all creepy demons are welcome jack in the thumbnail you look like the bad guy out

tony todd love his voice jack i though someone was gonna chase me jesus jack chase me jesus had you guys seen that the red light suddenly showed up the phantom of the opera is inside your mum im not a doctor but im pretty sure your head is supposed to stay on your shoulders jacksepticeye 2019 this gives me some vibes of that really old titanic mystery game the one where you had to find the answer to the mystery but you only had a certain amount of time theres a second one god damn itimma shit my pants twice as hard loved the first game hope this one is just as good me sees tricycle my brain get on the tricycle candace its a cruise ship dumb ass not a steamboat epilepsy warning at the white room in minute 57 your a boss jack do you watch youtube i spilled my fucking cereal because of a fucking jumpscare and i have no idea why im writing about it in the comment section is it me or does one of the voices sounds like the actor who played the candyman anybody else still waiting on the end of sally face oh boy time is all over the place that explains everything the style of this game reminds me of call of cthulhu so im hella excited the painter in layers of fear must be a irish every1s tru final destination is wait this came out today hmm i didnt think it was coming out till later this year 4846 sam amd colby anyone yarr captain shit be fucked shouts like jack anti are you coming back i love it thank you for making my evening happy seeing that nightmare fish on the wall makes me really wish that jack would play call of cthulhu jack you always said you wanted to be a super hero with powers but you dont need super powers or a cape you are a hero your happiness and energy saves lives i personally have been clean from self harm for 4 months but i unfortunately relapsed last night but after i got over my panic i watched some of your videos and felt better so you are a hero but instead of a cape you have headphones and instead of powers you have energy and pma thank you for all you do for not only me but all of your fans such a shame jackhi yo i literally threw my phone in the beginning when he flipped the mirror over i believe in the shit thats in my pants right now jack septiceye 2019 the graphics in this game are phenomenal i am honestly impressed im going full screen and im ready to be spooked already a minute in and the only thing that i will remember when i play this is ooohhhh tiny anuses i want one of those mirror cracks in game we really need to talk jack i just got a kpop music video as an ad i love when jack just geeks out over lighting its so cute there on the titanic there is a movie like that where the people are spirits and the things that are haunting them are actually just people in the house trying to get rid of them its called the others im a simple gal i see jack who uploaded a video i simply click clack and watch the voice when you wake up zoom anybody it is the same voice in the blue globe room 2700 tony todd antis back back again hopefully i think there is a game where ur a ghost and everyone and everything runs from u idk the name tho sadly a mooring is an anchor with a rope or chain attached to it that is then attached to some sort of buoy or floating ball that a boat can then attach itself to in order to stay in that usually designated place so the unmooring would be the act of freeing your boat and or self from it or whatever metaphor theyre going for the word is character and it says build the character as in building the word up from the word act jack you should play silent hill shattered memories its the type of game you were saying about you being the ghost itself and yet nothing makes sense until you finish the game and you realise that you were a ghost all along beautiful game anti is always there he watching it all the time anti is back two videos in a day one with a creepy thumbnail chuckles the channel is in danger wow i just watched layers of fear 1 and now this is out time is all over the place for me i gave chase brody what do i look like a magician so many references no one jack oow tiny anus i want one me ummmmm jack is getting a bit weird he had not facial action like he ment it friend wow jack has a loose anus if you pause the vid right in the mirror it shows a large shadow and a creepo dude with the glowy eyes so are you being followed or smth 2624 jacksepticeye as the new voice of megatron what if the game is the hollywood motion picture like a horror movie and your the actor jack time is alll over the place for me my brain do u have 90 minutes are yoy going to make another omegle meetup i love jack but im very angry that he had the perfect opportunity to say dont test me i will turn this boat around and didnt dont quote me on that jacksepticeye looking for seacrets sees the red light on side of jacks face ehehehehe if u dont get it check out the video named dark silence i think sean should be doctor who hope u get more subscribers jack cause ninja is behind u by 800 subs yes it was brandon lee killed because the gun wasnt cleaned properly the crow is one of my all time favourite films there is a nicole kidman film called the others which has the plot that u mentioned the reverse ghost thing its a pretty old movie but i love it who else has anti vibes from this video i fixed it it is not even scary who all are looking for jumpscare list me too 5252 the two mannequins are the mother and the father the player is the daughter all grown up the one you shoot is the one you blame for the incidents of the previous game i love how jack has already posted a video of this before playstation posted the launch trailer o i think i watched daz games play this but imma watch this anyway cos its sean still waiting for charlie to play this game with no hint of emotion and a tiny spice of 1010 humor i scared my grandma with the inguman screech i did when i saw this thank you jack i was literally laying in my bed forcing myself to go to sleep and then i see a new video by jack sleep is for the weak door leads to a different room than the one you came into normal person what the hell is going on jack ah shit jack when will you play we happy few again my fear just got doubled help me my mind when i saw the thumbnail omg they made a 2nd one since when 64591st view or maybe the 64590th view jack play persona 5 people who love horror jack there was a zombie game where you kept finding people and the always end up getting infected somehow and you figure out at the end that youre the carrier of the plague you forgot about king kong and the boat maybe jack is on the second titanic hmmm idk what it is why it wants but im out jack ok i saw layers of fear and holy shit im gonna cry layers of fear is my one of my favorite games how comes u did 2 vids in 1 day 830 jack i wanna a pear me of balls dearcine you play as a fairee a person like ghost who pranks people give the fans what they want jack realise the demon whos gonna be the brave lad to watch the whole thing and put timestamps of all the jumpscares check out drphil drops the mic jackif any thing were gonna be in for a visual me seeing the fake really if titanic was a horror movie yes it is a word 4834 the shining reference look at the carpet in the door i like the shot at 732 followed by the phrase and yet he stands cause its a play on the chekhovs gun concept which his principle was if in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall then in the following one it should be fired in other words every element in a story must be necessary and the elements shouldnt make false promises once something is set up the show goes on love the vid jack also day 38 of asking for jack to sub to me me before watching the vid please dont be a long video actually 1 hour the layers of fear demo was so promising and the game just wasnt that great dlc wasnt that great i was excited about this but im halfway through the video and im bored to death the visuals and sounds are amazing but the story is so slow and uninvolving and the scares are cheap and arent even scares really kinda just feels like someone was trying to make an artsy bullshit game jack was entertaining tho so its fine i guess me add plays okay thats fine me video buffers um mm okay me add buffers fuck you add please like so jack can see this jack i know youll probably never read this but i just want you to know that you have gotten me through so much and i know you probably get this a lot but you changed my life i look up to and want to be like you because i want to do for others what you did for me you helped me out of depression and you are helping me cope with ptsd and i really do appreciate that i truly mean it when i say you help way more people than you think and just know that one day you will get paid back for all the good you do in this world i am sorry to waste so much of your time by writing a full blown paragraph about this but thats how you can tell i mean it you are a great person and i hope one day ill finally be able to meet my hero you this made my day love it mooring is when a boat is tied up i believe so yes jack it is a word also 2 vids cuz one is jack the second is anti cuz hes coming back i just started watching the video but i cant believe im facing my fear of horror games and watching this yoooo if the thumbnail is anti he looks so much more menacing than before me hopefully jack reads my comment and pins it jack i would just skip this comment im not a doctor but heads are supposed to be attached to your shoulders what happened to necks i was waiting for you to actually play this game im so happy you did someone tell jack that kindergarten 2 is out dont quote me on that jacksepticeye 2019 wtf i always 1 hour late what killed bruce lees son was an actual bullet they had actual bullets for when the gun wasnt being used so it looked more realistic and they forgot to change for the scene and he was killed yeaahh the last guy was definitely a struggling artist i mean its not like he used his dead wifes body parts for a painting or anything yes its back i remember watching the first one with jack and i loved it so now its time to join jack once more in this horror adventure ah yes the wall vagina im pretty sure there is an app for learning to play the piano its on all devices at least that i am aware i was watching a quiet channel and had the volume up all the way and i get on this and it kills my ears you look so metal on your thumbnail daaaammmmn jack constantly complementing the games graphics every 10 seconds mestruggling to get 30 fps waitthere are shadows in the game jack at least my biggest fan is on board me awwww thank you ja oh your talking about your fan edit oh god jacks soft voice is going to put me to sleep jack ill just live on ship and not shit about the ghost that photoshopped eyeshadow looks great on jack p me i hate horror game later searching games on google me oh my god woow i should download that horror one its seems cool launch game and screams for a whole week i think the deep husky voice is the guy who plays candy man thank god a new horror game i love scary games 3425 he says as he is screaming that thumbnail is amazing 2526 that voice im pretty sure is the black guy from glass and hes a really well known actor but i cant think of his name i saw on thumbnail maybe the phantom of the opera is trying to kill me me sings the phantom jack sings the phantom of the opera me shdjdjdjdjj how the red light is back anti is there again watching jack and probably looking at the camera off screen shivers im not a doctor but im pretty sure heads are supposed to stay on your shoulders mmmmm but every play needs a villain sean and a dead man something hes not really dead guys you cant be dead if youve been dead on the inside all along well that sounds familiar what with people dying and not dying and having things inside them and feeling dead inside also i feel like the title of this video is anti commanding someone to pretend to be jacksean but who chase as someone cant remember who said jack says chase brody at around 3650 hhhng am i the only one weirded out by the fact that there are no end cards character for a second i thought the thumbnail was anti is it me or does one of the voices sound like that man from the candy man movies sorry i cant remember his name my dad was the fan of watching the movies who else wants to see a jacksepticeye musical goddamn nice voice lad didnt you play the original in 2015 hello candy man is that you 1842 that sounds alot like the early 2000s film the others why do u want 4 loaves of bread i think the last game took place in the 1920s oh here jack goes again with the its very nice to look at ambient occlusion r e f l e c t i o n s loved the first game sleep is the weak two videos one day yay conical antique fire extinguisher circa early 1930s me at 452 its character 2108 jack notices hes been making a face the entire time immediately does it again i forgot my coffee twice but i am against waisting coffee so i am just drinking it cold jack play the unspoken in vr 303 hey is that noob saibot bi han from the hit fighting game mortal kombat 11 i tried to watch this gameplay on other youtubers channels but couldnt take their pointless jokes and fakery screams that got me to stop watching them but jacksepticeye always gets me to watch whatever game he play because he talks about the games he play in a clear details sharing pros and cons about the games he played and conclusion at the end of each of the videos which is what gameplay shouldve been this is why i like watching his gameplay videos and other videos he posts more on youtube than other channels it shows that jack enjoys video games more than other youtubers because other channels looked like they are forcing themselves to play the games that makes it uninteresting jack i dont even need to see your video i just start the video and press like button in the face like a boss and then it gets creepy 2300 i didnt know about the sequel until last week cant wait to see your walkthrough for it jack also apparently this is rated r18 down in australia 1526 that kind of looks like a scrab from oddworld layers of fear is a jumpscare simulator i am simple man i see emo anti in thumbnail i click love the music on the opening screen can you play red dead redemption 2 like so jack can see sean wheee wait i cant go all the way me all the way was waiting for you to upload this amazing game jack iam not a doctor but iam pretty sure that head supposed to stay attached to your shoulders everyone whos head is attached to a neck well shit subscribe and like people smash the bell too this comment has layers of fear in i was so excited for this the moment i saw the game release that paired with the anti style thumbnail nearly caused me to drop my phone first comment this game is probably going to be in vr just saying lossen up ya face sean goes back to frowning day 3 of trying to get jack to play the new sea of thieves omfg o so dam happy you are playing this i was hoping you would jackim not a doctor but i me its a sign schneepanti where you at really an hour long i am still waiting for your next video to be fnaf vr damn it that voice is tony todd best known for his role as candyman you know the second it loaded up i just new they were on a boat the aesthetics look so much like the older cruising ships that you seen in movies the handle bars on the wall confirmed it as those wouldnt be common in a hotel or the average home ive came to be sad on a boat i played this game about a year ago layers of fear part 1 28102016 jacksepticeye 3506 straight fucking water i believe in the shit thats in my pants right now jack 2019 jacksepticeye is secretly kaneki from tokyo ghoul let anti out of your brain for once jack we missed him on halloween sean mclockedin around 1900 jack was talking about making a game where you are the monster and it reminded me of a popular horror short story that i cant remember the name of and its driving me crazy theres this person thats lived in a dark tower without mirrors for as long as they can remember but one day they crawl out and end up in a graveyard they go to this house having a party and everyone screams and runs away so they look in the nearest mirror and realize theyre the monster can anybody name it for me i abused my mouse by clicking it too much this is what jacksepticeye videos have done to me i love jacks beard something is incredibly wrong here theres someone else here no thats not possible theres no going back now play the part the titles from his observation series plus the title of this video sort of go together damnit i thought this thing was over and we moved on 1844 a game like that would be awesome i didnt know your a fan of the phantom of the opera sean that is major league awesome looks a little like anti in the thumbnail i came for that sick edgy eyeshadow in the thumbnail and for the sequel to one of my favorite games of all time chill are you ever gonna finish vacation simulator the director sounds like stanley kubrick did he just pitch the plot of the others as a video game if anti doesnt make an appearance in this play through im gonna be so disappointed d i still enjoy watching them nevertheless hey jack theres a video of a ytp that i think youll find hilarious its called ytp train killers it is the most british thing ever youll really l a u g h your head off disclaimer i am no responsible for death via heads falling off in laughter dont sue me i just realized im like this the entire time loosen up your face there sean youre gonna break it continues to stiffen up his face wait jack uploaded 2 vids today is anyone else hoping that anti will make an appearance anyone else notice that there more adds on all youtube videos whos that sexy thing i see over there oh thats jack the others is like that spoilers where the main characters were actually the ghosts the game youre wanting is dont escape a game hes looking for that sounds like the reversed roles plot would be neat the closest thing i can think of though is deep sleep but i dont think its quite what hes hoping for good game still though jack there is an easter egg where a door at the basement would unlock when you set the date to halloween 2435 i screamed the lyrics with sean so basically you want sixth sense the game i see that youre back to 2 vids a day what changed shut up about the lighting sorry for yelling the boat reminds me of the queen mary a little did the guy talking at the beginning of the game sound like tony todd or was it just me jack is playing video games while anti is watching learning improving he will strike when we least expect dont get fooled by a thumbnail saw daz playing it and i was excited for you to begin playing as well spoilers about the witchs house even tho i doubt anyone still doesnt know this if anyone was wondering there is a game like what jack talks about and it is indeed the witchs house where you play as the ghost bad guy or wathever and the house keeps scaring you and going against you cos viola in the witchs body is controlling it who likes jack like yes reply no jack u need to do the repair service in fnaf vr in the error world that lever next to the monitor opens a hole new menu of minigames that are horrifying jack carful your anti is showing sowas anyone else waiting for something scary to crawl down the hallway when the fuck did this become a thing jack or sean please become a villain or hero voice actor we need it in the thumbnail jack looks like a pedophile play dying light please jack played it about a year ago looks at part one of game 1 2016 aw heck im suspicious even the fuckin thumbnail is creepy 1850 theres a movie like that the others sleep is for the weak when is anti coming back looks at notifications and sees this thumbnail i knew i shouldve started making that anti fanart last month jacklets start shit his pants woho what a great start me and jack both sang when he said do u remember saw the thumbnail for this video me yeets everything off my bed grabs headphones switches lights off snuggles into blanket im fucking ready come at me spooks its anti season boys tiny anuses i want one of those welp good to know jack is an ass man woof i just finished watching a stream of the full game not a spoiler but i like this one betterbut its confusing im currently waiting for lof2 to download i cant wait to play 325 he sounds like noob saibot everything you pick up tells a story did jack photoshop eyeliner onto himself in the thumbnail omg its here i love the first one ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh pls play snake pass again i think noodle misses you jack play this three years ago omg jack that video game idea is genius have like mirrors around that dont show ur reflection and people will just assume that reflections just arent in the game and stuff like that but at the end it turns out it was because ur a ghost or something fuck i really want that game now game developers get on it what about observer tttt time too see shawn get excided d only 806 comments man im early i see thumbnail and need to say i am ready for anti bring it on jackaboy am i early if it was out for 24 mins anti is puzzled all over the thumbnail the act anagram spells character jackdont quote that mehmm but jack i think i could make money out of thisgoing to photoshop jackwelcome to meme time andquits meme time i havent been able to watch anything in a loooooonnnngggg time and hearing the intro made me soo happy my heart did a happy jump causing happy tears yes layers of fear 2 played by the legendary jacksepticeye im a happy boy right now little nightmares kinda played on the topic of reversed role where you were what was evil shit im like half an hour late whos talking candyman himself my excitement for this game just shot through the leaky roofs at hearing the awesome voice of tony todd anyone else think that it sounds like vin diesel doing the narration when jack wakes up at 300 dont you sometimes look at comments and say man i wish i wrote that comment this is wierd start of the game in the ship until the curtain is the exact same as the dream i had last night no differences unmooring sounds like something farmers do when a cow miraculously comes back to life youre working a lot these days or should i say playing oh wow this is giving me layers of fear vibes has jack played it yet he definitely should its very rare that we come to a full completion on a sje youtube channel specialy on horror games good job layers of coke zero sugar with a hint of vanilla zero sugar but that same great taste i got so freaking excited when seeing this notification have wanted jack to play this since i saw the first one it instantly became my favorite game watching this while drinking coke zero same great taste zero sugar with orange vanilla flavour unmooring means to release a vessel like a ship or boat from is post could anyone read the morse code and if so what did it say do more videos of this game i liked the first layers of fear never knew a 2nd game was out i read the games name and i was like i swear ive heard that title somewhere else and i realised this is the second game lmao but another game to layers of fear yes please 1910 is a really great idea tho i started watching jacksepticeye because i saw him play this on player select on disney xd thought it said lars of the stars in the title i got an ad for observation i literally just finished watching jack play it by the way i am happy their is a part two of layers of fear yipeee game do you remember me singing lyrics starting do you remember jack after a while singing the same song ahhhhh run for your lifes sorry i couldnt resist i loved the video jack it was awesome i dont how you do it man butyou do such amazing and awesome videos anyway i hope you have a great day until next time bye sorry for any miss spelling or wordingive had a lot on my mind lately so again sorry for any miss spelling or wording when he clicked out of the game we were graced with a puppets ass in our faces play game blades and sorcery vr 2435 definitely gonna replay jack singing phantom of the opera 1 mil times unmoor in case nobody looked it up yet means cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected that chick in the beginning was in the first game she was the portrait the painter was making you better becomehim game you will stay awake sleep is a poor excuse jack what me sleep is for the weak i have a weird glitch where i have to skip back multiple times on 1 hour videos to get the adio to sink up so i was slapped in the face with top of the morning to you ladies like 5 times hi jack love you vides been subbed since 10k i love how much youve gown scrunches up face in focus notices what hes doing and relaxes face immediately goes back to the face he was making i bought the first layers of fear just some days ago l u c k what if the vase falling before was you knocking the vase down in a different reality my headphones are turned up and the begging scared the shit out of me jack starts singing phantom of the opera in a almost screeching note starts doing chirstines part when she sings ah mk im done i do have 90 minutes but i still dont know how we got here 2506 i stopped watching since hes speeding threw the game jackspeticeye nice beard jack one minute into the game jack its the titanic 13 min later oh it looks like the titanic the titanic was the transatlantic boat face palm yes lol jack u should really play a plague tale innocence i think u will really like it briten lol i think he means britian not to be an outlier but whos antijacksepticeye ugly scp tato just me looking at the most likely click bait thumbnail im scared heres to another shit show meaning imma shit myself through this whole game jack the idea if everything going weird around you but it turns out youre the ghost is afaik not a game but a movie the others made in 2001 pin this comment i dare you dont quote me on that me lets go quote him on that titanic horror game k jack 1 year ago since i played layers of fear me searches on jack layers of fear me looks at layers of fear part 1 upload date 28 october 2016 i think its been a tiny bit longer then 1 year 3 did san not notice the other glowing eyed person in the mirror in the beginning the dark male voice at 300 sounds like zoom from the flash i just got twitter and your the first person i followed my name on it is memelord9000xd message me jack dont quote me on that sean 2019 sean with eyeliner a good time mayday mayday i would like a chicken sandwich honestly same i am super excited for this game every teacher when youre late be like 307 i wish he would play more satisfactory anti is coming back bitches you definitely are not a doctor because heads stay on your neck not your shoulders oof hahahaha getting here early and theres no jumpscare list in the comments more like layers of stuff falling over randomly 2 jack will you be playing dying light 2 these comments 90 anti 10 layers of fear 2 this was made for me when it says you will stay awake and i havent been asleep since yesterday play the part sen its what he wants onions have layers of fear yas phantom of the opera epic thumbnail bro edgy septic eye also layers of fear one was about and artist whos family was burned in a fire hes going through his own depression to the environment was changing around him cause hes drunk did anyone else re watch to see what happened in the mirror and why it cracked its really shocking if you put the play speed to 025x i legit squeaked in fear ive not watched all the video yet but seeing the letters from icarus transatlantic peeked my interest icarus wanted to fly so he built himself wings out of feathers and wax and alas he could fly however he got too ambitious and got too close to the sun which melted the wax of his wings and he fell i wonder if this game will delve into the theme of being overly ambitious i loved the first game and im gonna love this one hey jack im pretty sure heads go on your neck not your shoulders but maybe ur right wellshit also3651 we just gonna ignore that or wouldnt this technically be after layers of fear inheritance yayyy more jackieboyman nobody absolutely noone not even your grandma me i want more jackieboy in my life jackhow did we get here me and jack at the same timedo you have 90 minutes i watched this 4 times ok this video is definitely an anti video but i remember jack saying that he might change the egos a little bit so maybe anti hasnt slept and he wont sleep unless he gains control over jack but idk i just know that anti is getting a makeover time for spoopy scary paintings i played first layers of fear because of your videos and now i really cant wait this me sees thumbnail my brain look tf out for anti thanti that you so this is the sign that anti will come back another great time for me holy crap i remember when i watched the original one jack im the fan everyone hey this game is pretty scary me 2127 constantly rewinding and rewatching confused what wall holy fuck is that anti oh dear god it begins all over again hello jacky boiii two videos in one day hm is jack a superhero what happened to metal gear got boring this game gives me queen mary vibes and i dont know it also weeping angels anyone i cant believe no one

layers of fear 1 because i was like hey i like that game lets watch it all again yes i have no life yaaaay after a stressful day at work this makes me happy us needs to be a video game considering the fact that hints of anti have been popping up throughout multiple recent videos shortly after markipliers damien video makes me suspicious what if markipliers characters team up with anti to take over their respective channels matpats theory is becoming more and more possible the music actually gives me like a good horror film vibe kinda like it wait is that the titanic they are on it looks an awful lot like it jack shudnt ur head be attached to ur shoulders me wait arent they supposed to be attached to ur neck hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm intensifies btw i mean no hate i love jse with all my hearteuu

for every child born in wales since april 2014 the welsh government have donated a fruit tree to ugandan families to celebrate the birth or adoption of every child that toy cat that you found on the table at 5340 of part 1 was also in the blair witch game at the bunker it was in a barrel as well as previous layers of fear sure gets around looks like the youtube horrorpt platform will be all your domain now since john wolfe is mostly giving it up congrats 4841 i feel like ive seen that picture before hi love your video i love horror stuff did you see it cheaper 2 i appreciate that you dont say cursed words a lot you are a very good gamer other youtubergamer just say bad words a lot even scream it and i think they are overreacting too keep up the good work oh no cju youre turning into the artist of the 1 layers of fear never satisfied with the drawings of your kid i see naked people in the boat loved the john hurt call out exactly what i was thinking someone needs to make a game all about toilets just for you 1254 sure you are d edit 1837 hahaha as i said i keep on editing this while i watch but the close to the sun one was hilarious also i believe the plain text versions are rather for localisation matters i was trying to lull myself to sleep and then the white room appeared what happens when you shoot the left hm my impression with the kids given the implication that the character has forgotten themselves in some way is that the boy is you perhaps not sure what the think just yet wanted to like the video but it was at 666 my favourite fear 2 project origin cju the game registered on youtube is wrong i quite enjoy your videos thank you happy playing you missed a lot you really like toilets and stuff cju haha 4846 you legitimately scared me for a moment there because your voice did actually sound like the other guys voice except it sounded like it was coming through my computer now lol liked the tweak on the shakespeare quoteand nice to see you get a real opportunity to mess w the tapsand attempt to drift a boat thanks as always cmon man you cant be doin the audiences love it mimic without warning us first nearly shat myself you nutter didnt you have the choice of shooting between them and missing both let the coin decide twoface much excite cant wait for more well since the flush works yeah its a 1010 for me as well great job as always cju i remember seeing a ticket for a ship in the first layers of fear maybe theres a connection yeeees thanks for playing this i was hoping you would like this if xbox is aids evil voice sounds like candyman you see a guy and a woman you always shoot the guy btw the doors actually slows the monster down gah i was so torn which of my favourite youtubers to watch play this first you won i have no idea whats written on that morse note but since it is somewhat a shipwreck you could have tried to send sos code love these games i watched markiplier play the first game first then i watched you play it and since i watched mark play i have been wanting to watch the second one so i am really excited to watch and experience this game with you as you go along 540 the voice actor who is talking on the movie reel sounds like aubrey from close to the sun sounds just freaking like him this chapter of this game was really just as weird and crazy as the first layers of fear also i can still waiting for someone to start making xreader fan fiction reading about you online lol hahaha i looked nothing as of today once fans start making fan art and stories about you and them you know youre in the big leagues jkjkjkjkjk or am i no seriously i am only joking cj fudge thought it was not so scary but it was at least for me damn d keep going d i love that this ship takes us into dimensions and seeing the shinning cameo was great keep playing i thought you gonna play observation and pathologic 2 first oh well this is a great horror game aswell i think u have a wrong game linked in the description this isnt layers of fear 2 this is layers of fear 1010 you are too funny we got 4 hatters disliking cju sad keep up the good work cju love the gameplay yes when i saw jacksepticeye upload this yesterday i was crossing everything i could cross youd play it as well alsothe director if thats who he is sounds soooo much like tony todd bless james and lily harry potters parents ggi find no fault with the toilets on this boatnot clogged with rats or shoes or rats with shoes i remember the rat images gnawing biting chewing clawing the dude with the husky voice in my opinion is reminiscent of those saw movies 2554 watch the flower disappear true to lof the environments beautiful and exquisitely detailed the script actually makes senselol and the voice acting and sound design are good those qualities and your commentary make this enjoyable despite the walking simulatorish feel i do hope the fear factor increases as you go forward ive only just started but already cracking up at cjus alright who have i killed now commentary xd thanks for the hour video im currently playing this game as well i play then watch you i always enjoy your videos i even flushed when i got to the toilets and thought of you hell yeah james and lilly a harry potter refference must be definitely interested in this playthrough great job this game is a proper distance from the sun to be sure i always watch ur videos a midnight i have popcorn and a drink cheers thanks cju i love this cant wait for the next part ive always wanted to say why i like watching your content so much cju you as a person enhance the gameplay so much it feels like youre one of the few youtube gamers that dont put on a persona keep yourself modest and respect the games your lawful good approaches to gameplay helps me feel more immersed not needing to take the audience away with it by a running gag or garbage memes or anything i watched another youtuber play this first act and although i found that entertaining your video completely changed the experience of the game it didnt feel like i was watching the same gameplay again it felt like i was so eager to join you in exploring this gameplay tldr youre wonderful love it thanks cj looking forward to part two mother may i lmao loving this so much fun thanks too for spoiling us with a long episode warning this game has multiple endings and new game people will expect you to hundred percent it i already watch the full playthrough this game is really garbage first one was way better an uzumaki reference you sir are a man of culture you know what everytime they put a zoom in ability in a fps game that has no binoculars or device capable of visual enhancement i just imagine the characters eyes popping out of their head and moving towards the area of interest before snapping back in place okay its every morning a must watch video again lets hope no other titles interfering in between that was great thank you oh my god when you said skull island i yelled im thinking the same thing it feels and looks very familiar i am excited to see how this game progresses but thus far it just isnt hitting the marks that lof1 did i enjoyed the visceral world of the first one and this one feels a bitdry so far looking forward to the rest and definitely to your reactions ive just finished playing act 1 and so far i can honestly say i havent found much to like about this game aside from some nice looking environments and of course tony todds voice other than that the story isnt nearly intriguing enough to keep me immersed there isnt much of a threat other than a couple of brief chase sections in which the enemy is easily evaded the puzzles if we can call them that are so simple that it doesnt even make sense to have them there are codes to safes that you dont need to find since theyre literally right next to or very close by the safes the doors that you need to unlock might as well just be unlocked already since the keys are 1 foot away from the doors the jump scares are uninspired with no build up its more of a walking simulator than the 1st game and i can go on but ill give the 2nd act a chance in hopes that itll get better end rant yess been waiting for this aha knew the narratordirector voice was familiar tony todd of several horror movies and more so far im enjoying the new location it still feels very lof very atmospheric lush environment nonlinear story telling im hoping the next chapter ups the creep factor but im enjoying it so far are you an actor in this layer of fearmaybe yes at least i realised it is that when cju said ive my ticket i guess i imaged if his character is a stowaway hahaha 1836 the acting by cju lmao yes5811 i guess your decision about shoot in mannequin did you kill some kid the girl i presume too didnt that children was the stowaways maybe man this new layer of fear 2 is so cool like that first layer of fear thanks to share with us this amazing game i really eager to watch next act see you soon cju have a great night buddy the ominous voice sounds a lot like the candymans voice wait a minute that narrator is that tony todd wow not even a minute and a half in and you went right to your darkside burning tree houses and killing everyone you know looking forward to this one the voice of candyman those first two minutes but lmao the game is a little quiet compared to your voice so awesome more please thanks chris heres another suggestion httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp770390draugenhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp770390draugen solid professional work as always youve set the bar on how to lets play it looks really beautiful and well designed the story is very interesting so far the soundmusic is great and the settingi just love it thanks for the first act i had a lot of fun so good love your videos ive avoided watchin anyone else and waited for you to upload i love your excitement about the toilet this looks good i cant wait for thr next part great upload thanks chris edit anyone getting candyman vibes from dude speaking havent had the time to check this video because im currently playing the game myself but my opinion at the moment is that its pretty much meh its what machine for pigs was to the dark descent in amnesia its ok but nothing special the first one was simply better to me personally story and all just started playing this on the channel today only gonna watch until the point im at sorry cant ruin it lol nice to see others reactions though that scared the shit out of me when you spoke like the narator my poor heart you should have sent an sos with the morse code awesome video thanks for the entertainment the man talking reminds me of batman i cant 208 okay whose bright idea was it to have the undertaker from final destination on this ship i was wondering if you were gonna play this game soon i have been following for about 2 years still love the running gag with the toilets hahahahahah i love how happy you got because of the toilet please just cave and go on paetron id fund you to just do videos as your soul occupation 3 me and the hubs have been waiting for this all day thank you you truly deserve more subs and fame around the youtube

cju you magnificent person you i love it when you start new series and you open up with an hour long cant wait to watch it thank you play bioshock infinite its a great game not scary though watching this in 125x speed only makes it a more authentic jericho experience i know these kind of videos dont get as many views or as much ad revenue but please never stop doing the long form for horror games its especially great you could have easily done this in 5 parts each 1 hour for an entire week lets say you did play the entire game in 1 day cut the videos 5 parts and upload each day 1 part so you get 4 days off work and take the time to relax dude you gotta love tuckers reactions to scare moments its priceless at 35650 how do you get through the door ive been trying and its really pissing me

u are the reason i player layers of fear 1 ty i saw you streaming this a few days ago and have been anxiously waiting for this video ever since great content jericho its gonna be a binge watch boyzzzzzz 5 hour video this is some bde from 000 to 002 sounds like mario got hit by a red shell very bold of you tucker for not making this into a 58 part series keep up the good content man something to watch at work yay little boy got yeeted first 1st like and comment cuz im loyal i actually liked this better than the first game the story is written way better and it has more immersion than the first one i get that some people might find it tedious to have to find all the things and play it through again to get the full picture but for such a short game it was quite enjoyable for me at least the chase sequences were annoying sure and the jumpspooks werent as good as in the first one but the atmosphere and the music were kickass 20505 youre welcome i enjoyed your gameplay well done you managing to get through a well made but confusing plot hopefully the developers may take note i dont want know what your relationship with someone but i thing you nice girl in the word from algeria arabic nice playthrough as always i am almost sure the dead mannequins past the 32500 mark are a reference to the murders in the movie se7en the ones in the beds are probably lust and pride the one in the office is greed the first one that shows up with his head lying on the table is gluttony the head of the boy inside the box it was kind of interesting but definitely too vague and yeah it definitely didnt seem like you were given many if any choices the first game was much better story was very clear you knew you had choices and i feel like it built things up better i scare pretty easy but this second one only got me on the same rare occassions it got you the whole playthrough of the first game i was on edge in all the areas i clearly should have been this one unfortunately didnt achieve that i definitely agree that this 2nd one changed perhaps too often so it kind of loses its lustereffectiveness the first one worked so well because they didnt overuse changes in scenery and they did some of the things you mentioned i think bb is happy that you played with him a lot good game i also finished the game the sense of horror is different than i care for it is annoyingly vague maybe im like gab and have probably gotten too rooted deep in horror but this was a bit weak sure its pretty but it lacked substance some parts were cool but thats about it i have no idea this game really about please play fear games as you may or may not have noticed i screwed it up and had to switch watching days gone from the streams to here on youtube and the last time i looked up the schedule there was just the resis and days gone and the sinking city so this was really a surprise i knew the game was being made but nothing more than that thats it just came to comment this because theres still part 14 and 15 of days gone to watch first then ill edit this comment wow when is out for the nintendo switch i will definitely be watching your walkthrough gg gab cant wait for this one x yeah gab the whole game gg 3 i guess this game is an example of why more is not better the game may have met its match in gab too shes not the achilles of horror gaming but pretty close by my reckoning im playing this right now too sorry i cant watch your video yet but i wanted to drop in and say hi 3 this is the first video ive ever watched of yours and so far i like the channel i hope i continue to like it i dont understand the story nightmare simulation 20 pretty disappointed in layers of fear 2 the whole pteverything changesswitcherooaspect of the first one was the main reason it was interesting this seems to have none of that theres a sequel just found this channel and i already love it its really refreshing to see a girl play video games and be fully into it just something incredibly attractive about it so i think ill be a regular on this channel now keep up the incredible work awesome videos 5409 gab playing horror games in a nutshell about 11500 whole room is a reference to the movie metropolis i love how desensitized you are to horror games after years of playing them i could just imagine you experiencing an actual haunting and saying ive seen worse now wheres that cat of mine if its available on xbox game pass ill try it out you gonna break his neck oh he doesnt have a neck awesome game this full playthrough girl you are spoiling us full playthrough damn gab oh hell yes the first layers of fear game was amazing im so excited to get to play this one im so glad that you uploaded all of it thats the best way to play horror games all at once and completely enveloped thank you for upload gab the stream yesterday about 6 hours was amazing that was my personal world record to stay at your whole stream i had a lot of fun when i watched it my thumbs up for that have a nice day off wait this is out already now i have something to play on my days off i loved the first one and its dlc so happy to find you and your channel was waiting for your playthrough of this thanks for the full upload whats your relationship with jack i love it when u do full play threws holy the entire game ohkay lets go edit after watching hmm feels like instead of trying to scare you this game is just constantly screaming be scared around every corner lots of scares in this game were simply gusts of wind or stuff popping in and out of existence kinda lackluster and sort of a lost design feeling throughout the entire game like they didnt really know what do to with a sequel but still forced as much scares as possible in it and at the same time trying to sound super preachy am i just becoming a negative nancy or are horror games not trying anything new anymore now ive been in preproduction for my own horror game for a couple of months now and ill start working on it as soon as im done with all the freelancing ill do my best to give you a good scare everything is awesome youre the best i knew you would post the entire playthrough full playthrough heck yeah 4720 sounds like candyman it would be awesome if there was a high quality game that played out delbert gradys role in the shining i love how different this layers is from the last one honestly of all the games ive watched john played this one seemed far more tedious as a gaming experience than most like it irritated me how good the production values are yet the story so pretentious like hipster pretentious something something possessivesomething something traumait felt so painfully boring because it dragged out stuff to condescendingly slow levels of pace also it didnt have any legitimate horrorjust creepy vibes at a push john must be very bad at hangman its always good to go down its red guys did anyone else think harry potter when they heard the kids names are lily and james or was i the only one 526 i feel like i should be getting ready to teleport back and run from a zombie horde lol the film at 630 looks like it could be a nin music video that video at the beginning talking about masks sounded a lot like goffmans dramaturgy theory pretty cool and it definitely suits the game from what ive seen so far character i wish the ghosts in my house would tell me they believe in me this game sucks donkey balls ive been wondering this for a while is john on the autism spectrum somehow i do not mean to come off as rude just genuinely curious john dont you know in the layers of fear series its always the dead wife its like the butler in every murder mystery novel ever red means happy i cant believe you didnt acknowledge that nod to the first game all those empty bottles dirty brushes and blank canvas wow it kinda looks like the sun is angry layers of fears 2 is not as entertaining of a game as layers of fears was im not really a fan of this chapter buh lets see how they other chapters are after i finish watching john play this chapter 342 character man 3522 oh ok omg this game is so boring but i guess that makes it a perfect sequel because it is just like the first one yes i guessed chadactor before character as well anyone else realize that the word was character when the h was put in this game is so lame good horror games are rare 4423 john my man me slow down what do you get when you put a pirate and a pedophile together rrrrrrr kelly aaaaccctuallllly john love the 311 reference gotta love how they have to have a team of adults try to draw a kids drawing it just seems funny when you think about it i like in the description its fear 2 lmao nerdy factoid the director is voice by the guy who played kurn worfs brother in stng love that voice id recognize it anywhere so far im not sure why this game got titled layers of fear 2 as it appears to have nothing to do with the first game other than play style and im not a huge fan of the setting myself demon voice guy sounds alot like the actor who plays candyman omg when he said do you remember i thought of simba and his dad and that scene were he is talking to his dad in the clouds lmao 0553 whos thinking of the chicken nugger is that voice tony todd oo this game seems so aimless its basically one of those vr experiences without the vr is there a way to find the music box from 4755 i think ive listened somewhere 4325 this is the john ive learned to love the hints were too heavy handed i do have to say these graphics are pretty good reenactor its missing the dash but it would make sense if you are reliving these peoples lives to make a choice edit character ah okay 1905 i think that rooms a throwback to the main character of layers of fear 1 i kept mistaking this for cry of fear been really boring so far john the best part chase sequence was decent took me like 5 tries to watch all the way through i bet if they didnt give him early access he would be ripping it a lil more hope it gets better but i was hoping that through the whole first game 1 hour of absolutely nothing character john is it 311 me woah oh john amber is the color of your energy me i wish john would move his fat head out of the way lol damn john so far not as good as the first oneand that was my favorite horror game the first one hi john there is another answer to your joke what are pirates favorite movies rated x marks the spot voice n the background sounds like the legendary tony todd i might be understanding this all wrong but so far i take it that youre playing as a method actor youre starting from scratch to create this character whom youre about to play as and for every piece of the puzzle that you picked up a segment of that role starts to mold that is by showing the slow completion of the word character the narrativeinner voice in the reel and the symbolic limb appearing on the mannequin who is this character possibly based on a real individual from the past who had lost his shit or simply a general requirement of being someone sane who slowly drowned into madness hence the peek show of the familiar hallway in the shining as well as that monster that chased you into a game over method acting is a fine way to get yourself into a specific role but this game seems to prod as to how far youd go before you realize that youve become the real deal instead of being a mere actor that or maybe im just overthinking it lol why you tagged fear 2 john john gets his wish layers of fear added a real monster to chase you who said that a dumbass made me laugh it has begun i tried shooting him first but you end up having to only shot the woman the voice is tony todd candyman layers of boat 0 sometimes guys tries to possess john xdd just realized that the voice is tony todd such an icon my favorite part of this video is when john craned his neck to see further through the hole in the wall very telling about how immersed he was in the game i think hehe keep going 1855 im astonished that john didnt realize that that room belonged to the alcoholic artist from the first game there was a giant canvas and easel in the room and everything and he completely missed it facepalm i like how youtube thinks this is fear 2 project origin i really enjoyed the part where john walks to that one area and picks something up then walks around somewhere else and hears some dialogue it was interesting 2009 me youre gonna have to keep hearing this word arent ya 1240 john redacted me five minutes sooner character i consider this to be hindsight since hes actually playing while im just searching for answers just came to say lol that youtube has tagged this as fear 2 the psychic horror shooter that would be much more interesting to watch the male voice of the film near the end of the video reminds me of father elijah of fallout new vegas dead money dlc probably they are different voice actors but when i heard this fella the thought came to mind all these jumpspooks hey now thats not very allstar of you game you were quality as usual john but man this game is boring the unity game engine is looking pretty good not bad but too much darkness barely can see anything character 600 this dude sounds like one of the rusty lake characters for all of you telling john it is character he knows he is just being john you all should know this already damn is jhin from lol the antagonist 1900 anyone else think thats a call back to the 1st game since the artist was a drunk bruh youtube recognizes this game as fear 2 project origin thank you for this gameplay video keep playing and posting john i like you man but every time you tell a pun its an instant dislike ive tried to watch playthroughs of this game multiple times now but i keep zoning out its just not very interesting to watch i look forward to watching you play this ive already seen a playthrough and the game is pretty good unlike the first one i actually am able to pay attention to this game when watching a playthrough im confident youll enjoy it to at least a certain degree d why do whispers remind me of ilgynoth httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdsk7eh0n1ho youd think with the money from layers of fear 1 theyd be able to hire better voice actors jhins in another game huh bring us the girl and wipe away the debt so i got to thinking about the kids you chose to shoot the girl im assuming she got caught or killed by security and the boy survived so when you listened to the tube and the guy goes to talk to the kid sitting on the bench was that the kid who survived because i believe it was haha this is just me overthinking so i could be wrong keep up the amazing work john i cant believe he hasnt figured out 35 minutes in the game obviously its character why does it say you are play fear 2 not really digging this so far but keep it up i really love this nightstalker voice actor anyone thank you i really appreciated that your commentary complimenting the game play instead of overpowering it while still being entertaining this is the first video i watched by you but it will definitely not be the last character talks about directors using harsh methods and then references the shining where kubrick was such a bhole shelley duvall lost clumps of hair from stress um excuse me what was the font at 735 i havent seen layers of fear but i wanna watch this anyone was that tony todd omg i hope that was tony todd you should play dont starve alone in the thumbnail it looks like the creepy blue guy has fabulous red earrings how did you not guess it was character twoface is that you pretty cool cant wait for the next vid 1904 that room is a nod to the first layers of fear it has a ton of alcohol and painting supplies reminiscent of the painter who was an alcoholic really hoping this game doesnt rely on theyre just craaazy as much as the first one did that really brought the original down from what it couldve been i hear ulysses from new vegas or prophet from crysis john why wont you play metro exodus 2019 we need some full scale horror game from you not not an indie p false advertising this is an hour and 7 minutes long not just an hour the chase sequence actually reminded me a bit of the one from call of cthluhu dark corners of the earth which was kind of nice though i think dcote was a much more difficult one but they had a similar feel imo looking forward to the next vid layers upon layers calling out to him ogres are like onions 3917 oh thanks ill remember that in half an hour lmao really didnt like layers of fear and while i prefer the aesthetic of this one im still not sold halfway in lmao john makes it easy though i wish john had a sexy texan accent howdy guys it really could use some puzzles or somethingjust walking around is not very immersive gameplay and at 3500 we realize that john will never be a viable wheel of fortune contestant well at least hes pretty to look at the diamond in the rough im getting one of the kids accidentally kills the other when he chose who to shoot the note about the functioning gun that shouldve been filled with blanks the multiple stowaway comments in some capacity when john talks about the metronome wait does he play an instrument s h it a ctor welp im about halfway through this video this one does not seem good as the first it doesnt seem have the symbolism and character building that the first one had sounds like the candyman im really liking it so far i like slow burns and this game looks good but man its boring i dont like it didnt like the first either 1st person games are all the same it seems walk around pick up items that give you story along your walking i dont know i very much prefer to see my protagonist this game would be great as a point and click the word is character and its missing letters bc youre meant to build it oscar wilde is a dumbass john wolfe 2019 are the kid young woman stowaways i cant figure out why else theyd be hiding re that first telegram why does his agent sound like tony robbins blathering one of his selfempowerment speeches sheesh oof the last time i was on a boat i got super sea sickfun times just checked as it was playing on my mind tony todd candyman does do the voice acting for the game cool the voice actor for deep scary voice has some beautiful pipes that make my spine crawl i adore it 4409 john im pretty sure that painting on the wall is an easter egg of you d it literally looks just like you its easter eggception d the evil voice is the black guy from candyman thats the candyman voice cant wait for part 2 my mind is already trying to solve this story evil voices in my head while i walk around a plain ol boat theres an app for that love how your hair looks john keep it up fam was that evil voice at the beginning tony todd the candyman i really dont care for layers of fear 2 so far but i guess im the minority here i just cant get into the story too bad i really like the first layers of fear 3457 tbh its a little surprising when john havent figured it out yet when the word character was already mentioned alot on the first 30 mins its really not that hard to figure out what the chalkboard spells this reminds me of titanic dude is that fucking tony todd i just might have to get this im amazed that its even more pretentious than the first game i preferred observer much more grounded and interesting and atmospheric this isnt even a game its just a slideshow thats really into itself this game seems a lot less scary than the first one was not going to lie but this game just feels amazingly tedious character fit the puzzle 2337 2343 anybody else notice the flower disappears hey man will you be playing observation by no code i feel like its a great fit for your channel i dont see how this can really be considered a horror game there hasnt been even one hostile bird monster or brain on a plate yet the dude talking in the beginning sounds like candy man i hope act 2 picks up any chance youre gonna play pathologic 2 ok ive watched 41 minutes and i have to say that this game doesnt interest me at all i dont understand the first one was so interesting sigh what happens if you just dont shoot anyone there because it seemed like not doing anything activated the voice why wait who can the candyman can hey john wheres act 2 are you holding out on us 3903 well that doesnt happen often johns face when the evil disjointed voice told him he was a poor excuse was priceless i have been waiting for you to play this thank you for the upload 245 actually john that is not a metronome it does not keep beat and it has nothing to do with live performances you are wrong third class scum i hate reminders of my boss and work in a game all the alcohol in the room with the painting supplies was from the main character in layers of fear ahh slow downlol omg dude its character guys may be dead but he still peeks out every now and then within john they dont give you the safe code unless you find it i wish john would move his fat head out of the way you should play the lakeview cabin games i think the act was for the word character maybe for some reason this reminds me a ton of amnesia a machine for pigs far more so than the original layers guy whats he gonna do kill ya john or something worse me expelled but youd have to work for him john he doesnt take no for an answer the amount of sass you have in this video lol sitting on a park bench nan nananan beware that boy might be aqualung dat 311 amber reference tho dying in layers of fear what kind of alternate universe is this doubt john will see this but i hope he checks out observation if you like soma youd love this one so that conch poem around 4000 was some one piece stuff evil voice sounds like candyman the creepy voice in the beginning of the game sounded like the candyman i like how john looks surprised on the thumbnails of his videos but he is usually straight faced the whole time ive been waiting with eager anticipation for you to play this didnt feel right watching anyone else equally im intrigued to see where the game takes us how deep the madness goes gasp its red guys love it 1900 did character from the first part went on a trip d i did not get a notification for this video im super excited to watch you play ive been waiting since i played the demo at pax the game looks so good thanks for getting this up so fast hmm main character and lily were probably stowaways on a ship once based on that cracked flashlight and hammer flashbacks makes sense with the pirate motif and why the main character told his agent he doesnt like shipsship travel why does that matter to the story though idk unless the director is trying to draw that past out of him because its the one role he was born to play or whatever i hate playing horror game but love watching you play them not sure if you have an embargo on playing the rest but i would love to see it also loving virtues last reward playthrough just want to express my appreciation since those tend to less views i find it ironic john has so many youtube viewers john youre the most hateful babyrageing rude little shit on twitch and no i dont think youre mature enough to realize this so probably a lost cause anyways keep up the good work brat i think theres still hope for you honestly the number of times that i wondered if he missed something because he didnt flip over drawings to see if anything was written on them is infuriating seriously what part of his brain is missing that is supposed to tell gamers that kids drawings in horror games clues and creepy foreshadowing this fellow is wise enough to play the fool the 12th night by william shakespeare so far it reminds me a lot of amnesia a machine for pigs because of the time period and the guy talking to you through the speakers it really seems more interesting than the first one storywise love the video 3 2621 oh hey i love the caretakers music it doesnt scare me at all is there something wrong with me corrected aloud on pronunciation of icarus and not even 5 seconds later corrects himself oo not sure how i feel about this one so far already kinda seems like a drag at least youre entertaining to watch as always voiceover sounds like brady from call of cthulhu 3500 character maybe havent watched more then to this point main character breathes john the main character is actually trying to avenge their long lost estranged cousin the graphics are amazing so beautiful but the gameplay is so boring no fear at all got bored of the story that has to be tony todd aka candyman as the disembodied spooky evil voice so just throwin this out there the little boy did something that led to the death of lilypossibly i think the monster in steerage was a crew member chasing them because theyre stowaways interesting start so far a little slower than the first one but i have a feeling the next 5 parts should be interesting 1 for each missing piece of the mannequin am i the only one who thought that voice sounded like vin diesel that voice in the opening room is absolutely tony todd for those of you that have any doubt compare 2241 to i remember the first day here httpsdota2gamepediacomnightstalkerresponses part 2 is excellent and the voice actor who has that deep spooky voice sounds like tony todd if thats him they did a wise choice of voice selection im impressed 3027 oh how safe it is here uh is the new and i oop the beginning was just like the titanic is that tony todd narrating i can tell youre not really a fan of this game im actually not enjoying it either story is too scattered to understand at least with the first one you put the pieces together quickly i think john was in band in hs lol john not realizing the chalkboard is slowly spelling character and not shitactor is a massive himbo move are you planning play dollhouse for ps4 so there were 2 kids who ran away from home and became stowaways on a boat pretending they were pirates the youngest started asking questions why they couldnt go home the oldest started going hard on the whole piratelarper act there was also a film that was being produced on the ocean liner at the same time the director was a little bit crazy and possibly disfigured is that the story so far the protagonist is the youngest child and im guessing his sister lily is dead good morning young man youre mourning i just ordered food and really wanted to watch something while i ate and literally thought to myself please let john have uploaded a new looong videoand here we are blesssss the ambient background music with the few piano keys on repeat it sounds oddly familiar like something akira yamaoka did in i think silent hill 3 i dont remember the name of the song from the ost though so i ran into a bug when the game starts up it crashes even before the menu screen if you or anyone else have any suggestions that would mean a lot btw immediately reported this to the devs upon the crash no help yet i enjoyed it but im not gonna lie i prefer the first one alright i am now thoroughly intrigued might go experience it for myself looks quite good hyped for johns reaction to the rest of fnaf vr 2230 the world is a stage tony todd aka candy man the perfect voice for horror i bet your heart would be pumping more so in vr obviously a luxury liner this ship is beautiful i would be below this deck with the hired help lol lol i corrected your icarus pronunciation and then you immediately also corrected icarus and i smiled and had a lil laugh you crack me up 1904 is your old characters room from the first game character im kind of embarrassed to admit that i had no clue about a layers of fear sequel but i really like the direction this game has taken so far it doesnt seem overly jumpscary and respects use of atmosphere it doesnt have looping yet and isnt on rails i was also hoping youd do a lets play of this boreing fact mooring or unmooring is the act of docking or undocking a ship you learn to do this in the navy even if your going to be on land the whole time sir john do you have a discord if yes i would like to join it for once manikins arent used to compensate for the developers inability to model and animate 3d characters it does the cool thing that when a wee event or sum shit changes the environment its great literally as soon as i saw someone else playing this i said out loud man i hope john wolfe plays this you do not disappoint visualy impressive walking simulator is back d lets see if the 2nd game is better then the first written before i watched the video is that tony todds audio in the begging layers of fear more like layers of memes 3910 editing john forgot about it this one seems to have a bit of a werewolf theme going on john might actually end up liking it i was hoping this entire video that you were gonna continue the game and this wouldnt just be a oneoff so excited d this looks amazing so far im certain the devs havent just gone for a shocking inversion of the first games plot so i have no clue where the plot could be going these games are so slow at the start rip that ship is really unrealistic am i the only one that didnt care for layers of fear im hopeful the sequel is different but either way ill be watching you play it my guy ya can always tell when john gets seriously contemplative sits back strokes the beard and then rests his index finger on his top lip character the word has to be character the video is good but layers of fear just isnt scary if it wasnt for john talking through it i would have turned it off i want a scary game like pt that is still the best horror ive ever seen in a game 1900 i think this room is meant to be an homage to the first game noticed the paintbrushes on the table the canvas on an easel plus the buttloads of alcoholic bottles in the room ive watched 3 different people play this game so far and no one notices that lily disappear from the vase damn it that annoys me lol it says character i bet im at 3514 into the video really trying to enjoy this but the game itself just seems so pretentious im guessing that this is a method actor getting way too into his role and breaking under the pressure of his soontobe failing career a family dependent on his income and his overbearing agentsproducers please let me be wrong 410 i was screaming the word was character im about 900 in and im wondering if mc being driven to build the character is making them lose touch with reality as they actually become the character we bad shit that might entail so instead of a guy who cant act to save his life narrating everything we have christian bale as batman ok as expected of our master of horror games he executed a mad mans plan after just a bit of hesitation its red thats not good i love you john maybe the director is fucking psycho i need some horror game so john whats your opinion ign give 910 but i need some professional gamer review my theory hmm maybe the girl haunted the ship played with the little boy n got him killed cuz he kept saying he didnt wanna play anymore and she just str8 ignored him and now since the ship was used for movie shows then the little girl n boy got the cast n crew all killed too long time no see john i will enjoy this video well that was boring cant say im particularly enthusiastic about this game but ill keep on watching i might be surprised the voice actor at 2716 is the same person that voiced hugo in the plague tale innocence right i feel like the setting is much better than in the first game halfway through the video he put in the outro song credit maybe he was planning on cutting there 244 of course i know what a metronome is it is the signature move from the clefairy evolution line can reproduce the effects of any other move at random good thing about this is your commentary being entertaining as always but this game isnt doing for me is that candymans voice i hear im not sure i understand what the point of layers of fear 2 is the first one felt like it was stretching a very very short story and just do cool stuff and jumpscares that eventually didnt really go anywhere as you figured out what had happened way before the game was done and it did nothing to challenge your guess this one im not sure yet although i get an undertone of schizophreniamultiple personality disorderprotagonist life parallelscoma i really wonder if it will go anywhere and i kind of hope it does but it does feel like its more show and less substance its also not very good when im looking at this and i have no reaction for the jumpscares or the monster that is supposed to be creepy will play it of course but it doesnt seem very promising especially with the anticlimactic instadeaths walking simulator 20 ready and action first hour lol im pretty sure this game is about an hours as a whole or a little bit more i made it into your video 322 seconds already too much talking just play the goddamn game and stfu if you have fans of this sure not my cup of tea though good luck wow that chapter title screen thats like pure 70s made for tv movie stuff and that voice has to be tony todd or someone that sounds exactly like him the way he draws out certain words and letters who said that a dumbass lmaooo the word is actually character just pausing at 3515 haha i was pretty excited for this game but honestly didnt have any expectations besides its gonna look pretty so im very pleasantly surprised im very intrigued with the story so far i like the whole actor thing building a characteridentity maybe through loss of his own what also plays into that is that the character youre playing as doesnt speak besides the kid in flashbacks who we can suppose is him frankly i like it a lot more than the painter guy going on about how great or tortured or whatever he is in the first game really looking forward to the rest of johns playthrough wow really creative concept of this game and john actually acts most of the parts of this game so realistic thats why it feels like its a creative piece of concept that room at 1900 with all the empty canvasses paint brushes and booze bottles and the invisible force trying to keep you out is such a huge nod at layers of fear 1 so i dont know if you figure out the word on the chalkboard but i havent gotten to that part yet im going to guess the word is character ones that are rated arrrr maybe its just a slow burning start but i feel like this one is much less tense and a little more boring than the first one at least so far i do enjoy that theres an actual threat in some cases though 3641 i think its shipactor gonna see what it is please play pathologic 1856 this room was a nod to the first layers of fear character he was alcoholic a lot of empty bottles in a cabinet and a painter brushes and a canvas the board puzzle looks like character to me from the start i think they got more intense with the psychological exploration in this installment chadactor lmao its character john theyve been pointing it out the whole game haha although the first layers of fear felt more like a walking simulator i really enjoyed the story and scenery and instead of a mental painter we got some black swan acting stuff and there are actual enemies you have to run from and actual physical characters in the game world this is going to be good a little vague still but interesting am i the only one thinking that 1858 is the artists room from the first game the booze bottles brushes and frames seem like too much of a coincidence yes death death must be so beautiful a dumbass lol john this feels like barely a horror game its more just a thriller still a really good game just doesnt fit the genre super well for me all graphicsno spook wasnt a fan of the first game but this looks interesting this evil voice he really sounds like twoface the fact that there is danger at all in the slightest makes this infinitely better than the boring slog that the first game was yay thank you john for playing this game i wonder why youve never played detroit become human the shoes under the chair in the dining room ive always wanted a horror game that was primarily narrated by danny devito i really wanna watch john play observation cant wait for part 2 hopefully theres actually things to do in this one the puzzles are pretty hand holdy other than that it looks beautiful but not so much scary hey john i dont wanna share my whole life story but its my birthday im glad you posted a long video so i can sit and watch it to try to keep my mind off of today its my 19th birthday and the anniversary of my caretaker dying 2 years okay seriously thank you so much for being here and posting videos every year i watch your videos on my birthday i even watch them while i get my tattoos to keep me calm ty again that epilepsy warning was gone so fast i got epilepsy its always good to go down john wolfe 2019 maybe this is the nightmare rose goes through when she died as she should have let jack onto that freaking door only half way through the video but already know that the chalkboard spells character a c t build the goodactor build the shitactor im just teasin ya still cant get into thisdid watch it all for you though lol im surprised you didnt know it was character from the beginning the game uses the word like 20 times from the beginning i totally thought you were trolling us until you said you would rather be surprised later and my jaw hit the floor lol youre usually so on point with these games so funny bro mysterious voice do you remember me the 21st night of september 3313 the game hated your joke so much that it tried to kill you with a canon ball aaaaaaaaah i am so excited always good to go down john wolfe 2019 the blanks spell out character your welcome edit he already found that out now i feel stupid yes death death must be so beautiful did stefano valentini direct this movie calling it now at 3533 in the word on the board is character this game is stupid just like the first game there is no real threat of death or a monster boring im loving this game so far and demonvoice guy thats the magnificent tony todd love your smile meow the deep voice demon voice guy sounds like candyman is the voice over the intercom at around the 2 minute mark the voice of ulysses from fallout new vegas hm the game i just bought on steam or johns new video a 1 hour long video johns new video it is 826 this reminds me very heavily of the titanics parisan cafe which had real ivy growing along the walls oooh that monster is creepy haha that was pretty spooky im interested to see where this goes i like the change of focus from artist to actor and it taking place on a ship is an interesting setting who said that a dumbass fucking sick burn dude what do you call a lawn ornament that hangs out in subway stations a metrognome ba dum tss d the evil voice guys sounds like the dude from inspector gadget layers of fear story of christian bale ayy i dont know if it bothers you but the text crediting your outro song shows up at 3904 p is anyone else affected by the boat motion i dont get motion sick in real life but narrow field of view and rocking motion in games really gets to me i remember playing the witness and getting nauseated and im kinda feeling it with this one too dont you hate it when sex pistols throws your flintlock ball around i laughed way too hard at well actually i have a smart phone app that no one cares honest opinion so far this game seems really boring it has a good atmosphere time period location and such but the story isnt compelling me at all im not even sure if i could describe the story thus far i do always enjoy your commentaries and gameplay though so im looking forward to your next upload 4512 the poster reminds me of the door to the shivering isles in niben bay in the elder scrolls iv oblivion wow you can actually die in this game already an improvement over lof 1 which as great as it was was basically a haunted house simulator i didnt even know there was a second game coming out until about a month or two ago your playthrough is gonna be the first lof2 ill watch johnwolfefirst 4039 the eulogy of scarface this game is boring c h a r a c t e r those two pirate kids sounds like the characters from the game a plague tale hi john good to see you doing well as always i just came from matt mcmuscles stream of like two hours of this game its boring as fuck and i dont know how youre supposed to be motivated to play it not a fan of all the quick edits transporting from one spot to another with no context but other than that i look forward to more videos of this series everybody else is playing i was just waiting on you because youre the best at these games they made a second one oh heck yea lets get this bread john jigsaw meets layers of fear is every scare a jumpscare anyone spot the editing error at 3904 the absolute enthusiasm when you said shit actor is what makes me happy im subscribed to you john i always treated the first one more like an art display simulator gotta say the art style for this one is much less my style maybe because i dont really watch movies especially classics everything is also looking a bit cleaner but theyre also giving off that plastic 3d model feel that makes it seem like its reminding me its fake if this is most of the same walking simulator style which it looks like it is i liked what i saw in the first one far more an hour in wait layers of fear got a sequel cool i love the violin at 5550 soooo muuuuch just a theory just watching the first 10 minutes is that he played a lot of characters and lost hisher own personalitycharacter 5645 yes death death must be so beautiful to lie in the soft brown earth with the grasses waving above ones head and listen to silence to have no yesterday and no tomorrow to forget time to forget life to be at peace you can help me you can open for me the portals of deaths house for love is always with you and love is stronger than death is oscar wilde the canterville ghost i genuinely got really excited when you said you would continue posting this series i really enjoyed the first game and am enjoying the second so its super exciting to watch you play it as an actor for some reason i get this game its absurdity lmao i wish john would move his fat head out of the way so far this game seems more psychological story then horror but well see where it goes i do wish they had the player be more involved such as puzzles or something i enjoy watching their games but i dont think i would like to play it thank you john for the awesome video hey guys its john pretty sure it says character maybe john at two hours its like its trying to be layers of fear so ive had a thought about the theme of this story im only twelve minutes in but weve seen enough evidence by this point to make a guess both games have the player playing the role of an artist who is suffering for a reason related to their respective visual and performing arts here in this game we see imagery of a woman taking control of her childs life implied mind she lifted his head for herself this is a parent pushing their child to be an actor later we hear the director giving specific demands such as you dont need more sleep etc this person you play as has themselves been controlled and manipulated for the stage their whole life perhaps not been given the chance to develop themselves as a person only the character they play we are told of all these layers built up each a different character what poor broken soul resides at the very bottom saying again that ive only seen the first 12 minutes as of right now i could be totally wrong the kids sister in this game seems to have a brothercomplex the voice when you start the act it sound like the voice of the fnaf pizza simulator animatronic john you need merch because id definitely buy a think critically or red means scary tshirt or mug its character the word is character lmao john i love u the little boys voice at 2717 sounds like hugo from a plague tale innocence awh man you shouldve played sos on the radio button lol gives you an achievement nice graphics o dont hate me but the merkins need help they are selling their guitar from their music video which has over 16million views httpsmistakesonthelakecomproductsthemerkinbroscustomguitarbundle id know the candy mans voice anywhere i saw the 90s one in the theater why dont you turn any of the photos or pictures around there could be hidden messages man layers of doors 2 rise of the mannequins looks great so far i really didnt like the first game but lets hope this one is better excited to see how this story plays out the hand mirror at the beginning scared me more than id like to admit 5550 that fucking violin is so good omfg i wish i could listen to only that track the whole acting thing reminds me of another game he played i cant remember what it was called but they had your gf or something and you would get taken back to your room every night there was a part where you had to chose who to save i wanna rewatch it just dont remember the name i feel like this is an episode of blues clues and im screaming at screen the word is character john cmon also kravin posted so close to yours had to choose this channel first but you bet your ass im gonna watch his directly after spoiler alert the director is m night shyamalan i honestly love johns sarcasm so fucking much i think there was a guest room with a couple canvasespaintings facing the wall and a isle too johns hair is on point this video just saying 1010 hey john nice outro song at 3902 that voicein the beginning telling you to stay awakeit sounds so familiaris it is itthe candyman himself noticed the similarity you were trying to make a director and the movie screen are similar to a painter and the canvas the demon voice guy sounds like the guy from final destination finally glad to see a tangible threat that you have to avoid a nice change of pace from the first though it taking almost an hour to get there for a very short chase hopefully the whole game wont be like that hopefully this is better than the first one the first one was not my cup of tea im watching you and kimmys stream with double screens and when you said woah kimmy turned to you and said john is very excited in there and that was hilarious this seems really nice really good so far awesome upload thats is pretty awesome tony tod is the spooky voice at the beginning i like candy man the movie finally you play layers of fear 2 the first game creeped me out with the ambiance and how we are forced to think on that happened totally a game that makes you wonder a lot and go try for more i hope layers of fear 2 also follows the success that the first game has but keep the essential parts still there i have been looking forward to this game knowing how warped the first one was i am fearful of what unfolds for these two little girls the fact that tony todd the demon voice guy as you called him narrates the game makes it so much cooler no spoilers for me getting my first impressions on release is that tony todd of final destination this game cost 30 on xbox the narrator sounds like the candyman actor tony todd for some reason i get titanic ship vibes so like the first game were they burned the house i feel like the ship is gonna go down as well as the lyric i cant drown my demons they know how to swim comes to mind i have been waiting for this as always thank you john for being seriously on top of these games i always look forward to your content with new games i certainly wont watch anyone else until i see your video first didnt know noob saibot mk11 version made his way into this game i legit irl went woo hoo when i saw you uploaded this video d a ship uh remember john if you get to meet a girl there who claims to be your childhood friend and has a weird bracelent on herwell sucks to be you cause youre never get to see atlanta the mugsy type thats chatting in some parts sounds like clarence from penumbra black plague this is a terrible game you dont want stowaways because it looks bad for your business people buying tickets for your ship might think its unsafe is that the voice of candy man 3904 outro song artificial construct long day editing john lol thanks for the upload i didnt even know there was a new layers of fear game this made my day a million times better after work today always look forward to your videos keep up the awesome work kind sir its the voice of candyman how many are feeling that fuck yes love when you post videos youre awesome john tony todd narrating has won me over it isnt a criticism to john but i am surprised it took him that long to realise the word he really overthought it which i guess is a positive thing because he has more words in his vocabulary to guess it than i do i was completely stumped but then the video he watched on the projector 2 minutes afterwards kept repeating that word with a weird emphasis and i realised it fit im surprised he was coming up with so many difficult alternatives but nevermind the damn puzzle great video and glad to see an anticipated game 3904 uhh john i think you made a whoopsie while editing yes but will there be a child running into a wall in a comedic fashion thats the only reason i will check out 2 is the narrator voiced by tony todd he sounds super familiar can someone explain to me what happened in the first game it can be a summary or a longer thing either one works i just dont have the time to look or play it rn you going to play the sinking city when it comes out next month you ever gonna play pathologic 2 from what i heard you dont need to play the first one its always good to go down awkward silence settles in as john realizes what he just said theres a second one i loved the first one lets see if its as good as the firsto 3904 its a little early to be putting the music credits up john this game has a sequel wow i hope to god this game doesnt follow the first games footsteps and become another walking spooky house simulator it was a bad game lol 3305 john youre such a dad i love it dude is that candyman voicing this game when are you gonna play act 2 layers of walking simulator sleep is a feeble excuse 2am in the uk but watching a new john video is way more important yeeees layers of fear2 3306 nice dad joke john the guy at the beginning sounded like tony todd candyman polish game polish game polish game polish game aw hell yeah new horror game to look forward to and unexpectedi didnt know a new layers of fear was being made pretty cool so far i honestly wasnt even aware that they were working on a sequel correct me if im wrong but is that tony todds voice on the initial introduction in the projector room omgomgomgomgomg i didnt even know this was coming out this is the third video ive watched today of layers of fear 2 because i want to support all my youtubers more please your commentary is the best hmmmmmmwhat do you mean when you say same life experiences sorry we

of seat sequel to what john i gotta know holy shit man i didnt even know theres a layers of fear 2 been with this channel for a long time and havent had as much time lately to watch lately just wanted to say i still appreciate every upload and the candidness in your reviews planning to binge on some of your videos this weekend still not sure how many layers there are the part where you picked up the drawing of the sun and were just like okay made me laugh out loud for a solid 5 minutes that voice in the beginning bish noob what are you doing not in mk i want to operate something that im not supposed to operate me wanting to put an a in all of my classes before the grades are due 148 is that noob saibot from mk11 id like to solve the puzzle john the word is character i liked the first one best but this is really good too is that tony todd on a bope you the best john i preordered this game but i will ruin the first hour of this game because i love john and kravin so much i think the first one is more scary tbh this is like a scary version of the titanic hey its the boy it sure sucks that pt never got released game the beginning of this immediately made me think of the game 999 what i like about john so much is that he explains things really well and he understands that everyone might not know what something is now i will like if everyone can tell something about why they like john using thinkcritically beautiful graphics is that the voice form deadmoney i hope this isnt just another haunted house simulator like the first one with jump scares out the ass with scripted deaths and no actual threats if thats the case id say this isnt a horror game itd be a psychological first person game i dont know if this is coincidence but the previd ad i got was for layers of fear 2 i dropped everything when i saw this upload so glad to see you playing it layers ofi dunno where to take this joke thanks john 620 and that character is shrek character hey john are you going to play observation scary onion 2 they made a 2nd one of these oy vey i wish this was in vr so we can see john jump again lmao john youve never held out on me i knew i could count on you for layers of

waiting for this video my dude love the vid john oh wow this looks awesome hey john its guys im so early i love you john whoa layers of fear got a sequel thats awesome however it is still a great game how does the story excel better than the first when i cant figure out the damn plot and no one explains it clearly boring walk simulator scary zero now i want a sequel for observer go and grab it for free on epic game store looks fantastic reviews on steam are pretty bad for this game i loved observer and layers of fear but it seems like lof 2 and their new game blair were reviewed poorly hey man did you even play this game this was an incomprehensible mess sharp writing more like poop bad writing who ever wrote this review needs to put a letter of resignation on my desk lame game completed it score is too high first game was much better really enjoyed the game except act 2 it dragged on for a little too long to bitter for the bitter on the chalk board tony todd as narrator sweets for the sweet those that know i love how the director is voiced by tony todd aka candyman if you want a real horror go play soma sorry played for 2 hours this game with my girlfriend and really couldnt find us playing on so we deleted it again played the first game of these developers and that was a real masterpiece so well made so scary at times but this just wasnt that at all have to say the game world looked really awesome as it was in game one these guys really know how to make models and develop maps but scary no not one bit of course this is just my personal honest opinion nothing more nothing less i know many people find it a masterpiece after all leon boring hallway jumpscaresthe game feels like a hallway simulatori played devotion 3 days ago and when compareing the 2 layers feels like a shitstainno horror in this one game note 73 mmm is not bad thats why i love ign thought this one was very underwhelming tbh i liked the first one but alot of people did not know about the release of this game including me the first one underrated asf cant wait to buy this one the best horror game you cant play how about the worst hell naw song intensified layers of fear 2 on psvr bring it 90 really this game is so bland and boring the story is a mess and gives no context with these silly audio dialogues which just takes away from the immersion the scary moments is repeated over and over which just makes the game stale you wont get surprised by anything in this game walk down a corridor open the only door that is not locked enter new area with much of the same thing over again rinse and repeat that is what this game is its cool that this one is much better i thought the first was pretty meh but how can the sequel be 3x the cost of the original if its the same length act first one was great too it bores me i dunno why usually i love puzzle games but not a single jumpscare got me the story didnt even catch me the only horror i really got scared of and still got scared of is outlast 1 n 2 alien isolation and i forgot that vr thing possession was itit was exorcist i checked now haha damn they took a step up from the first game for me its a 1010 layers of fear 2 910 says devoition is the best horror game you can play right now devotion 8210 another proof that ign scores dont mean anything everyone you need a horror story to scare people what you really need 1 slow movement 2 a lot of unnecessary voice in the background i knew there was something about 1 i liked now 2 is the real layers of fear we need a psychical release best part i didnt even know the game was made 054 407 gaspsohooh first proper horror game im playing its unsettling as hell im the type of person who thought bioshock infinite was unsettling i think its the old music i think i have seen three ign reviews with them comparing the horror games to pt jeezz weird time of year for a horror game to release ign gave this a 9 and soma an 8 i thought soma was far superior than this game this is what happened when you pour your all energy and resource into game development to make a great product there are no budget for marketing left lol im downloading it on steam now been waiting on this game to come out heard the dev team from friday the 13th helped make it me i love gaming with headphones me playing this game yeah im gonna just listen through the tv the first one made me feel so nauseous well tbh i didnt expected this bioshock is it just me or is ign is actually getting betting with their reviews after we rioted against the days gone review cant wait to see this entire game the wrong way round when achievement hunter play it and geoff refuses to face the camera forward bluper team did not make layers of fears 2 gun media mad layers of fear 2 so another walking simulator great reviews and always trusted 100 ign devotion the best horror game you can play right now has lower score than layers of fear 2 i had no idea this game was coming out wtf i played the first one too so lof got more than days gone morons logic onlyign uh another one huh i truly dont understand horror games like this agony outlast and alien isolation are all like this too ive never understood the appeal in running and hiding from the enemy with no weapons i aint saying that layers of fear 2 should be an action game but id rather play something with at least some combat games like alan wake resident evils and dead space 1 and 2 where there is some combat and you are given some ways to defend your character this got a score of 57 out of 100 on pcgamercom lmao i need this game welp i found my next lets play finally a decent review from ign first layers is brilliant why does it kinda sound like its chaseface narrating the video would be an amazing vr title when next gen comes out hope it sells well enough to see a port how did nobody know this existed the developer and publisher have been talking about it since last october ign is the worst reviewing channels of this generation how come were all just now hearing about this game for the first time lmao soo what kept this from getting a perfect 10 come on ign like wtf this might be the best ign review ive seen in a while even more excited for the game now day 1 if vr support auto generate captions please unlike the original that lacked layers well yah its not an onion 111 you said delirious omg i cant wait until h2o delirious plays this game is this out for ps4 gamespot gave it a 5 way to go for reviewers to cover up such underrated gems world war z days gone and layers of fear meh reminds me of bioshock in some ways visually i mean very art deco well i say thats very bad marketing coz i had no idea this existed i did not like the first one people over hyped how scary the game was and it was completely borning so long story short i dont think ill buy this one wil this come 4k on xbox one x yea thanks ign for spoiling jump scares maybe try a spoiler less review next tyme i cant be scared in a game where u kant die sorry this needs to be on psvr im not denying this is a brilliant game but im sick of horror games where you cant fight back gamespot gave it a 5 i wonder which is closer to the truth 57 pc gamer 510 gamespot 910 ign i like puzzle games but the horror push me away this looks interesting when is this out on ps4 not that i have played this but surely game spots review of 5 is wrong i love this game i saw the gameplay video once didnt knew it was already released lol layers of ign 90 the soundtrack reminds me of bioshock with the dramatic violins wheres the americam fugitive review wait i didnt even know that it existed reminds me of bioshock loved observer so id love to give it a go dude please review ace combat 7 now you clearly are better than the guy who reviewed it the review is much better than the typical ign stuff but 9 and you havent mentioned single downside amazing writing fresh puzzles outstanding atmosphere etc etc id really appreciate if reviewers started to actually care about the score it literally means nothing like this got it on steam will be playing soon didnt even know there is layer of fear 2 should give it a try how do i scroll gaming news and social media everyday and not hear about this till now im actually very happy im only learning about it now but what the hell happened did bloober not want to advertise green pewdiepie should do a playthrough this dev team is amazing observer is a classic too lilly and james potter lol i was looking for the first ones review pleasently surprised ign played this game where can i buy playstation vr release well unlike ign i loved the first game so this is a must buy for me this looks like the closest well get to an echo night revival mixed reviews on metacritic where is the vr version congrats to the studio for following through on their vision and giving it another crack you say devotion is the very best horror game to play right now and you gave it 82 and this 90 ignwtf i had a jump scare just from watching the review movies to watch before playing this game voyage to the moon dogville repulsion suspiria metropolis ghost ship missed opportunity to call it double layers of fear edit comment has reached the ideal number of 69 upvotes further likes will be sanctioned h20 time baby wish more devs would announce a game 2 months before release pt and bioshock had a baby i literally didnt know that this was in development huh pleasant surprise on two fronts why not even more layers of fear the first one was one of the most dullest games ive ever played loud noises and jackintheboxes arent scary they only startle lol why do you love walking simulators ign days gone 65 layers of fear 2 90 so you just run from things the whole game i just want to know if the frame rate is stable on consoles damn didint even know layers of fear 2 even existed lol i had no idea this game was a thing the first game was very overrated tbh hopefully this might be better first game was great this one looks much better the first one is excellent and this new one has everything to be an even better continuation 90 for a game you literally just walk around in for 8hrs ok lily and james xd first millionth viewer ign is evil im watching this at 232 am in my country 10th lol hope it comes on the switch whats inside the chest though i think the bit where lily dies was not what actually happened it was what happened in the script but not in real life in real life youthe player choose who died and who survivedif you dont you just keep doing it because you cant be both whoever you are you see the events from their point of view if lily survived and james died she thinks that if james lived he should die in order for them to be togethernot because hes weak but because she always had a dramatic and creative imagination if james survived he accepts his past although it doesnt make his character any stronger i had a different ending i had to choose which one to shoot i choose the man and thats it credits there are no good or bad ending as far as i understand we the player are in a journey to find who they were the player and his sister were born from a unhappy family the father is the one who kills his mom and rape his sister in the ship wreck their only 1 surviver and it james but james lied to himself that lily still with him and that create a persona of lily inside him in the picture we found we see james sitting in chair but there is another face look like his sister in the audio we heard james talk to a reporter we heard the voice of lily tries to help him with his lines in the frist ending boy actor james step in the stage with a boy and the boy said what done is done what past is past which mean he finally left his past behind and the persona lily was no longer exist in the second ending girl actor james step in the stage the boy shoot himseft and die telling us that james decide to let the persona lily his sister soul win and take over hi shirrako im making a video for lof2 detail explaining but i lost the forever ending after reinstalled window may i borrow the forever ending from your video that would be really great many thanks how do i watch all the ends please how to end the game on the brother obviously the first is a bad ending theres no explanation needed the actor simply has lost themself and has not been true to the character themself or the performance the neutral ending implies that everything up to this point was real it wasnt in the player characters head but rather their really insane on board a ghost ship anyone know the name of the violin song playing at 400 the mysterious woman ending sucks i got that one no audiences no claps i have a question though which of teh endings is teh bad ending which one is the good ending and which one is the true ending cane you tell me where good bad and true ending when male version looks at movie posters and that music reminds me of rapture my poor brain i dont get it so confusing is it possible that the character james has dissociative personality disorder and the visions along the game were merely his illusion childhood traumatic expreriences with his sister caused him to be lunatic i assume he also suffers schizo like the painter from layers of fear 1 and as an actor he tried his best to hide his mental illness please correct me bloober my head is jumbled trying to understand your storyline ouch this game was shit the most incoherent game i played so far 543 subs on just as iphone the ending music is so good whats is name ok so i got the rat queen ending and the woman but one thing that baffles me is why does it cut to the chest at the end and just cut out anyone have any ideas as to what is supposed to be in there the mannequin heads was my only guess its pattern is as similar as previous series i guess that the unknown bold man is loop ending while lily is true ending i honestly dont care which is good or bad the disobey and obey ending speeches both give me chills no matter how many times i hear them and that violin music at the end so pretty i think that neutral ending is just that the character is not finish yet maybe im going to guess that they may come out with a dlc like the last layers of fear is there a reason why subtitles arent enabled whats in the case this is the same guy who enjoys killing and torturing ppl in red dead redemption 418 i love the soundtrack on this one dont follow the clickbaiting title none of the endings are good bad or true the whole point of the game is that you dont know wich one is true and that none of them are bad as far as ive understood the good ending is the one with the female actress because you need to disobey all the directors orders in the four possible choices the bad one is with the male actor because you need to obey the director in all four choices and the trueneutral ending is because you have mixed obeyed and disobeyed in the four choices that was lightning speed u got this out jeez lol nice one though what ist going on in this game confusion isnt even the word to discribe this which is good bad and true someone please explain why do i have feelng this game is similar to agony nice gameplay is aqua the va for the female woah is this what its like to be first whats up guys next up is layers of fear 2 my apologies for the lack of content over the last 2 months i know its been scarce iv got some oldschool gem goodness for yall next stay tuned 22500 considering he lost that eye fighting for his country low blow this game is like the art film of horror games its good but most people find it too convoluted you are so underrated youre like the only tuber that dosent make me cringe when watching and actually does a good job beating these classic jems feels like its been forever thanks for the playthrough would love to see some indie horrors if you ever have the time great job on this game dude i am damn impressed with your skills im not a

creepy tho 10501 best way to die in a horror game lmao twoface is that you speaking whyd you flood the bathroom im wondering if heshe gets scared while making these scary games lol 14700 hey han no commentaries just a walkthough 1080p60 i love it 3 daaaamn how man room and stuff that are in one boat this game is so evil and spiritual that after playingyou need to go cleanse your spirit omg the mannequins on the lift fakthe chasing demonthe child with long hind legseverythingsounds like omg god help us gamersilluminati is into the gaming world in thumbnail pc in gameplay console why i cant run a game it says you didnt select any profile and i have 2 optionsbut neither of them respond on clickbuttonany ideas i like how he has no commentary it makes everything easier welcome to comment section it is nice and cozy here also we have tea and some freshly baked cookies i thought it was going to be about layers of creeping fear but nah jump scares i cant get past the running part when you do crack on a boat im one of the people who really enjoyed lof as well as observer and thus really got my hopes up for this game it left me disappointed first of all because the horror elements are nonexistent or at the very least so devoid of any sense of actual danger that they fall flat plus the entire game feels somewhat uninspiring and tedious overall it relies too much on tropes and doesnt really tie the story together in a good way hey thats the voice from the first game awesome they used him again game looks amazing cant wait to get it man ive been a fan of your gameplay videos from day one and still have the interest to watch them keep up the hardcore gameplay they are amazing and a1 so its a filmacting themed horror game interesting so basically its a horror movie slow down with the uploads im still watching the 1st part ha titanic meets silent hill 20 they are using the same tricks that they used in lof 1 and observer but im fine with it i think ill buy this video quality tho layers of fudge your channel is my favourite goto gaming channel as always spectacular upload i have always admired your quality dedication speed and consistency with your uploads can anyone tell me what this game is all about wtf wheres the band playing their last song not friendly to the add folks it seems first minutes of the game reminds me of myst and riven a long time ago why

wiill be that guy when leaving the bathroom turn the tap off hahaha a little too scary to watch the gameplay alone at night or just right way to do lol this game is boring you never fail to deliver quality game content well another worth to watch photorealistic ship the best game plays ever you are the best youtuber continue the videos this is really amazing game the reactions without commentary

sleep watching marz hmm 1313 nope definetly wake you up if sleepy you are absolutely the most charming gamer girl i just found your channel maybe a week ago and i look forward to watching them you should play bendy and the ink machine damn it was boring this game on ps4 lord shes so gorgeous love to always see you play not sure if shes totally given up on this game but seems like many others on yt are abandoning it after only one or two installments starts out pretty good but quickly gets really boring repetitive and unscary i think it would be better if you play horror games in the dark for better experience i love your videos greetings from czech republic she hey guys is hey guys one hey guys of hey guys the hey guys most hey guys genuine hey guys and hey guys natural hey guys streamer hey guys guys hey guys guys hey guys guys wow youre so beautiful god bless you more sekiro please her accent is infectious gives me warm fuzzys try outlast some time both 1 and 2 are great games she so dam pretty i am in love really hoping you play outlast one day guess dmc5 wont happen sigh oh well i love your playthrough best wishes my torture brings you guys pleasure damn you low key calling us sadists lol but yeah your reactions to all games are priceless especially the ending to rdr2 will you ever continue that life is strange episode you started months ago asking for a friend lmfao xdd howd you know i be eating popcorn in the dark hahaha well in decisions you force your decision if that mysterious voice telling you to do that you can force the other decision whats that say william shake a spear lol love it even though pt was only meant to get people hyped for silent hills it set the bar so high for me that so far no full length horror game has come close to creating such an unnerving disturbing experience you should play the dark occult and outlast 1 and 2 the first one really scared the crap outta me your the most legit respectful and real woman gamer youruber its great when people are just real heart rate marz gameplay holy crap so excited for part 2 marz marz thank you for playing layers of fear 2 i enjoyed watching your gameplay please be well and waiting for the next video so far not as creepy as some of marz old residences but it may well pick up observer is a lot better tbh game of doors the new walking simulator some open slowly some are hard to open some will never ever open at all nice lets play btw but i like sekiro or plague tale a bit more that a lot of lights you have on in the background there marz has anyone suggested you play walking dead i want to play this but it freaks me out too deeply like some people cannot do certaim things less they cause like a seizure or something like it xx ok tell me are you drunk or high in this video xd shes playing lots of games at the same time yes but actually no a plague tale e layers of fear 2 are way shorter than sekiro and days gone in a couple of weeks will be both over keep up the great work marz 3 in the first layers of fear the painter was the protagonist the wife was a singer you are getting more and more beautiful have you forgotten about days gone you dont need to do what the director says you can go off script d ur so funny when u get scared lol layers of fear 1 is way better than the sequel wasnt sure if youd play this since i didnt know if youd played the first one so this is a nice surprise i love that they cast tony todd as the narrator his voice is always a huge bonus to anything horror related i have been a big fan of his since candyman is that tony todd the candyman himself is doing voice work on this game thats both terrifying and awesome at the same time we just love watching you in general you play to many games at once please stick to 1 or 2 before staring a new game i wish i have girlfriend love playing ps4 yaaass i was hoping you would play this and here we are your hair looks amazing btw thanks for playing this im too scared i watched most of this through my fingers for the firts time i see gamers girl you are missing soooo many documents and hints that would bring more light into the story its a shame but still interesting to see what do you make of it without this puzzle pieces little hint if theres whispering in an area it means there is an item to pick up and there would have been a possibility to kill the guy but there must be put in more effort to go off script but this game is just jump scares nothing psychological about it how you are always so gorgeous and beautiful tt too much and too many doors ummmmmwheres plague tale yes finally horror game again panickedmarz is the best marz wow another horror game arent you already playing multiple other games lmao never heard of this game before looks good marz should play amnesia the dark descent i played lof 1 it was scary and beautiful though the story is great and deep im gonna watch u do this ill be honest i liked the first one better but ill still give you the clicks for the couple of episodes youll get out of this ones 45 hours me watches another horror game video my heart ah shit here we go again oooooooo sheeeet im excited d marz you are actually too funny are your lights off cause mine fucking arent xd 2020 marz hey welcome to sekiro we left off on owl not gonna spoil anything but ive seen full lets plays so there are a few things you should know lots of notes objects and collectible slides hidden around the area you really need to look because they dont glow or anything there are multiple endings this is important to know because of my next tip you get choices like you had with shooting the man or woman but the game really makes it hard to tell you have a choice if you dont want to do what the director tells you you have to disobey multiple times if you are motion sick try to increase the field of view and put antialiasing off i would love to see you play outlast maybe in your case part 2 first seems appropriate wait what they made a sequel to layers of fear when did this happen what happened to plague innocence its better to do 1 or 2 games at a time until you finish it otherwise its gonna be a bit to difficult to make video on each game to satisfy everyone play visage when it finally releases your hair looks incredible and our pleasure brings you a lot of money i wonder if your mug so huge or youre so smol where is days gone rage and fear this is freaky as helllove the play thru christineyou say relaxnope not gonna happen lol my 2 cents this lof2 is possibly less of a good fit for you than a lot of other games youve done personally i think you kick ass with games that have a good story characters like gow rdr2 no need to terrify yourself i want you to be happy wow marzyour always gorgous but today woahyour exceptionally beautiful this is just a guess but those same paintings all over the ship might be your ticket off the ship look closely at each painting of the same ship and its surroundings there might be hidden clues in the painting anyways that is my theory and guess which is why the same painting appears on almost every level and in certain small quarters marz you forgot the 2 in title no game is more horrifying than outlast i love you scare or not pls continue playing a plague tale innocence i wish it was a little shorter episode damn girl hair and makeup on point i love you when you get scared one of marzs favorite quotes oh my f lol holy shit you look gorgeous marz always wears the best outfits oh my fuck lol i hope you patented thatso no one else can use it lmaokinda suits ya madam this game looks awesome marz playing a scary game hmm let me think if i want that yes i would love to see you play alien isolation you forgot the 2 in the titlelove ur videos marz loved todays vid continue playing but can you please bring back days gone horror games stress me out too much so i just live vicariously through marz lol this is awesome marz that youre playing more horror games yay thanks for awesome quality contend keep it up your make up looks amazing in this video do not mind me i am just here to ask why you dont focus 1 or 2 games at a time keep up the good content your headphones are really interesting are they good why didnt you try pro gaming headsets in your games a double win for me a game ive never seen and marz is scared omg yesssssss holy shit marz another horror game oh god im scared but ill be scared with you its nice to see you play another horror game cause i agree horror games are hella fun great video u looked really cute btw my dream is to meet

aside from that common reason im slight yandere so a part of me like seeing people jump scared plus i like making humor from their jump scares and also you are so much like how my sister was used to be so thats why i love watching you play yes marz u figured us out but we also luv u you the most beautiful girl in the word oh hey another marz video huh a horror game switches lights on marz are

awesome plus this game is dam scary you gotta play spiderman ps4 you should probably turn off vsync in the options cause from my experience it delays the controller inputs oh no marz what have you gotten into this game is terrifying theres a 2 glad youre playing this one the first one was fun not the best horror game but great for what it was its still stuck with me after all the years not to mention the music is haunting as its pretty in a dark way ill be tuning in on this playthrough for sure might want to add a 2 in the title you are the best love u love the horror games your hair looks good by the way marz dont be afraid be brave and when you play days gone more sekiro please your hair is so on point love it darn youre starting another game ive really been enjoying days gone a plague tale and sekiro and i definitely hope youll continue them just feels like another game is just adding more to the plate layers of fear 2 is pretty good though and im excited to watch regardless like i said my only concern is that youll get overwhelmed and drop a game even though the three youve been playing have had me hooked hey marz will you be playing death stranding when it comes outand what did you think of the trailer glad my peer pressure worked yesss love it when you play horror games youre right your fear brings us happiness we laugh out of love though i like your videosi love

you are wonderful other than that i never say this often but i am first never heard of this game 1525 dmm i see you also are a man of culture how did u get it eary if it is not released yet a few mins late but hey still here this game remind me to amnesia the machine for pig nobody not a single soul idiotsfirst first great whoever designed those chase sequences deserves a special place in hell 2640 it moved 2643 yes dan it moved is it me or does that voice sound abit like tony todd who plays as candy man you did have a choice to either give up or take it away ive seen other people choose to give up watching this at 2am but not scared outlast was the best scary game there was a door you missed at 1306 maybe that was for the code on that chalkboard that killing joke light beam thing is i think a batman comic reference a joke the joker told that made batman laugh see there were these two guys in a lunatic asylum and one night one night they decide they dont like living in an asylum any more they decide theyre going to escape so like they get up onto the roof and there just across this narrow gap they see the rooftops of the town stretching away in the moon light stretching away to freedom now the first guy he jumps right across with no problem but his friend his friend didnt dare make the leap ysee ysee hes afraid of falling so then the first guy has an idea he says hey i have my flashlight with me ill shine it across the gap between the buildings you can walk along the beam and join me bbut the second guy just shakes his head he suhsays he says whwhat do you think i am crazy youd turn it off when i was half way across its about something being real because you believe hey dan id love for you to play a game called darkwood lol who wants to see him play fnaf vr lol cool 8th view first even if its the last video appreciate the support on it i may do more just gonna see how it goes 150 gave me shivers when i went through the slides slowly on this part o play more i like these series i love how he saw a ghost upstairs at 1152 then ran to another direction right away xd if i aint running into em they aint gonna haunt me xd the doors close them itll slow him down 1653 when the adderall kicks in dude this part has nothing but the suffering on original xbox vibes what with the voices n video projector light beams n shit lol i love it old school xbox horror right there im expecting dr killjoy to ghost out n kill you at any minute lol its not scary at all kinda lame love to see you finish this game the lighting and sound in this game is incredible also the first one is scary as hell too i bought it but couldnt play it lol that really does happen to actors they become so into the role they forget who they are i want more make a part three make it a longer video bradim supposed to go under this then proceeds to go through it haha 1650 i love your gasp xd stop acting like a idiot when you play so play the fucking game right i dont why didnt more of this video pls do a series about it brad if you dont continue this game ill unsubscribe im kidding but pleeeease continue i think outlast was one of your scariest gameplays brad the one with the crazy doctor guy with the chain saw and you having to hide and run in that hospital or insane asylum fucking scary 958 its like the ring man its been too long since the survival horror or just thriller games have come about thanks a ton brad i cant believe he didnt see that lol 608 most horrorscary games just take advantage of the fact that it has to be scary so they just put jump scares everywhere with shit story and lore and it will still be considered a good game since its still scary but this one is kinda different like you arent reading the notes for no reason this time rad when will you give that sweet 4k gaming and video resolution brad come on please dont end it when theres at least 1 or 2 more parts you could do please upload another video this game looks so good im

want to see finished games my phone stopped working while i was watching this and you all know what was going on in my mind thing scared tf out of me yuss brad thank yoou i have to say brad when it comes to horror games that really gets to you thats usually where you usually shine with the words that you speak all those comedy words are coming back to you thats from your past videos all the ones you began with in 2011 i looked at those old videos that was your wilder days i mean yeah youre older now so hey when i make gaming videos i let loose i dont care i say some stuff i shouldnt say i mean not real bad but sometimes i go too far with comedybrads got to bring that classic humor back its feels boring when you watch unless you are playing the game horror games are the best more braddd this game is wery creative interesting things happen im not for sure how to say this brad you make great videos but by all means i dont know because i dont own a ps4 or xbox one by the way my computer is not the best computer neither so i was going to say i saw somebody play this game on pc and it was like super like smooth and it look like a real 60 fps i was going to say that lot of your games dont look like that type of movement now i dont know if thats ps4 or the software are you using but i dont know i guess i aint no big deal you always used to say i dont know if its 60 frames or not its a lot of your games i dont think were 540 i saw the doorand the internet in the house was gone for a minutethat is wery rarewhere i live interesting im glad you playing this gamei didntthink you would continuethanks bradso far so good mein mind famous last words i dont think you should be listening to what the voice tells you to do lol death stranding release date reveal trailer ps4 this game feels like something out of a eager allen poe book or his mind i dont care what any game looks like i just want original games with good story lines do you have your dog sitting on your lap right now lolboo brade there is always a point to insanity this game peeks your curiosity doesnt it i have the conjuring in my movie collection the movie the nun is how the nun became to be 607 im the only one who saw that those chase scenes are terrifying close all the doors behind you damn it mann this game is crazy of fear not layers of fear really like this game rb it could use a little more action but im good with this the narrator kinda sounds like the guy from doom iv thanks for braving this game once more for us brad would love for this series to continue the story seemed to be a pretty tangled web love the horror games by you brad want more of this series you can try kingdom come a womans lot if you played on pc start wear you left off all the rest will be later you can tell the dog to do

should play next new game that came out today its called draugen tip dont watch at night not putting the screen on full nope please keep playing this game this game just messes with a persons mind i kinda like it i thought i could watch this with headphones but took them off after 30 seconds legit shat myself at the same parts this game is interesting plz do more bruhh brad i swear your reactions are just like mines no offense to the quality of the video brad but i can tell youre genuinely scared that being said you are kind of speeding through it and not letting the audience absorb some parts i know jumpscares suck but maybe give them a little more time to happen before you move on in the story ill keep watching regardless brad playing this game like a lil bitch when nothing has happened yet lmao ok so far it looks like a puzzle game with jumpscares but no real dange oh sht what would you do in a situation like that in real life id swim or stay in 1 room pretty sure the paint room that you asked what the point of having it there was that it was a reference to the first game where you play as a painter that voice at 511 it sounds like xemnas from kingdom hearts lol when it comes to brads videos i feel like a grandfather like back in the day when brad played mw3 and skyrim kids these days dont know what there missing and i am watching it in midnight how convenient india please keep playing would love to see a full series on this game its just too weird and intriguing to not see the end just so you know brad you dont have to listen to the creepy voice you can make your own choices i love when brad plays scary gameshahahahahha i like the rendition of an old turnofthecentury ocean liner 1st class 2nd class 3rd class steerage crew and then we get to go behind the scenes bwahahaha hey hows it going brad he got so scared he told us the temperature outside hahahaha anyone noticed that mannequin blink at 608 it also included an witch face in it another episode would be divine please more its awesome finished this game to day and now i have played one hour of the first layers of fear the first one is definitely far more scarier 607 there was a mannequin that you

moves away and dont pay attention i was so scared watching i had to decrease the volume i mean im generally not interested in watching a gameplay of something like this im much much more less interested when a soulless idiot like brad plays it jesus fuckin christ now its even less enjoyable even though it never was to begin with you are awesome gamer manjust loved your gameplay keep up the

zombie ones who gives fuck damn i never have clicked so fast 9s in and no views likes and comments must be safe for me to get some attention i think the mannequins represent others on the ship andor how they died ye need wine 4038 it was hilarious because the way how jack said that wasnt a god it was a dog xd so the kids are called lily and james huh so are harry potters parents one of the children is a girl named lily and one is a boy name james when the candyman speaks you just have to stop and listen i briefly glossed over the title and i thought it said breasts in the dark thinking this game took a very odd turn 10154 the only joke to make batman laugh with the joker loved you playing the first one cant wait to see all of this one thank you my god sean you are a boomer fraggle rockthat is from my childhood and i am not a boomer you know so much about history as if it was your memories is boggles my mind 3005 that moment sean became danny gonzalez that grand voice is the voice of no other than tony todd aka candyman 725 freddy what are you doing here it was a white lily white lilys represent death it was a white lily white lilys represent death does jackaboi say the cunt or the hunt cause i keep hearing cunt and has anyone noticed he merges w and hs together in words like wheel at 1600 i 100000 expected him to say top of morning but then i remembered that this was before minecraft i should be sad but kids are annoying and gross i can relate to jack im a sympathetic person i also have lots of energy most times im positive but sometimes im depressed i love how in the beginning jack says the game really isnt that scary and then he looks terrified for the rest of the game lol nothin like watching jack murder mannequins for an hour straight jack stop taking lsd its not good for you jk referring to the thing at around 1200 i think the story is a girl and boy were playing pirates when the older girl wants to escape so takes the boy with her via imagination the boy starves to death and your playing the girl being haunted by the boy and going and out of reality reason or instinct oh my us humans are able to reason metropolis reference im in love also terrified i guess these mannequins havent heard of a little thing called personal space someone should teach them cause if they keep this up im gonna have to start throwing punches im not a violent man but you invade my personal space being all creepy and shit and ill be forced to flatten you im just saying ah shit here we go again act ii the cunt sweetie theyre stowaway kids the monster is people catching them jack evrything gives you clues of what happens or what to do or how to react ayyyy a metropolis reference i learned about that in art history as soon as i saw the giant monsterlike machine and the human clock i was like could it beee i had forgotten that the game had referenced other films in the last episode the shining so i was like ooooooo are there other films in the game i didnt notice power is by my side jack locked me opened where i killed a family member and those two girls died horrifically hey cards it doesnt sound psychotic at all that you get so happy right after talking about murder when is part three jack hey jack i think those dummys are huanted or there is ghost inside of them tony todds voiceovers are awesome for those who dont know he played candyman and was the morgue guy in final destination films 914 oml the game grumps reference 2110 the moment that made me laugh out loud jack super casually i can see up your shorts by the way i love how every time you get hit by steam you yell oww as if youre really feeling the pain of it anyone else get metropolis vibes from this part of the game the mannequins working the dials of the giant machine in particular did it for me when you were messing with lock where you said you saw pennywise go down the well the arm was georgies arm 10345 my first thought looks like the mask from jjba second thought is that ricardoor 1316 jack is this gonna be another thing like the original where i killed a family member or those two girls died somehow horrifically also jack hey carrots first game was better i love the audioit makes it more scarier did anyone else hear rarewolf at 10724 your so retarded the music sounds like silent hill the guy with the creepy voice kinda sounds like tony todd from candyman and hellfest be cool if it was 816 plot twist layers of fear 2 is actually an updated version of plug and play act 2 the cuunnnt jacksepticeye 2019 hello someone who is scrolling down the comments you can be happy here and enjoy the video captions as i cannot enjoy your hard work otherwise your right i am freaking out jackaboy to whoever decided to put mannequins in the horror genre fuck you yours truly pretty much everyone the flower its a lily 1927 remind anyone of a certain movie jack its raining like ireland outside me i bet it does rain like crazy there wow as soon as he walked into the room at 2143 i was reminded of metropolis but 2523 absolutely confirmed it nicely done jack at the beginning of the game i reasaally hope there is more interaction and participation within this game jack after game with arms crossed well now im just not gonna do it anymore broke physics now were getting somewhere its more spectical than horror like its predocesser hitchcocks rolling in his grave going jesus i was the lord theater suspense but you guy arent giving a frightening pay off please tell me the pace of this game increases i watched this playthrough on someone elses channel before i watched this and i didnt knew the meaning behind the flower that appears randomly in some places i forgot about it in the end of the video series but now when im watching it again in this video i realized something the sisters name is lily so i googled what i suspected and i guessed right the white flower is a lily mind blown i like big boys itty bitty bois mississippi boys in the city boys i like the pretty boys with a bowtie get you nails did let it blow dry i like a big beard i like a clean face i dont discriminate come and get a taste from the play boys to gay boysxd i had to i was dared to do this jack talks about family death also jack oooooo cards a for the fired and missed reference fucking beautiful jack toilet no jack shitter yes s jack become bilbo baggins jack your just a big ol dummiez me and my friends all figured out the mechanics on the fly its called a basic survival instinct 3214 looks out window nah im still here fam heres what ive gathered so far there were two kids lily and james who stowed away on a ship trying to escape something if i had to guess they ran away from an orphanage that was probably hit hard by poverty judging from that one audio recording of the man saying how watching kids playing carefree could make you forget the poverty that the country was suffering and just knowing how orphanages were run a few decades ago which seems to be the time period of this game as well as lily saying you know what will happen if they find us theyll send us back there it makes me feel like thats the case but things slowly go from bad to worse as their taking food puts the captain and crew on alert leading to the decay of food and the growing desperation of the crew as some had already pointed out the chase sequences probably represent the children running from the guards and crew members another thing i picked up on is that it seems like lily heard or read stories about hi if you want to know about the scene with the workers and the math clock it is a huge reference to a 1927 german movie called metropolis by fritz lang and erich pommer it is about a rich man falling in love with a poor girl discovering the monotonous and destructive life of workers in a futuristic dystopian city which could look old to us now this particular scene is probably the most famous and impacting one when the rich man takes the place of a worker that died out of tierness the confused one near the clock and sees other workers walking into the mouth of this fire idol as a sacrifice to this incarnation of the factory if you like old movies this one is gold and i recomand it even if you do not actually like old movies dont be repelled by its length it is quite fun to watch it is scary to see how our world kind of evolved to what was feared by this artist 00330 that mispronunciation though i have a sneaking suspicion this story was based on the tragedy surrounding vic morrow and the twilight zone movie where his life along with two child actors were taken in a unfortunate stunt gone wrong was that a killing joke reference from the batman comics 522 jack its backwards so many good jacksepticeye quotes in this video and even a game grumps quote bonus gold 2918 me when i leave my friends 3050also me with my friends 4700 best reaction laughing so hard xd that deep voice is none other than horror legend tony todd the candyman himself whether you like or dislike this and its predecessor you have to admit between the audio and shear awe inspiring beauty its a fucking gorgeous game theres a ton of love in it jacks attention span is this gonna be like the last game where those 2 girls died horifi oh cards 4700 what the fuck just what the fuck hey jackaboy you think you could tell me what scares you most these kids tragic adventure feels so much like a movie id almost say i have a theory but theres to many lose ends jack i didnt freak out you freaked out me we both freaked out 1214 thats called fortnite jack 1042 i still see the shadows in my room regarding the method acting thing jim carry did a documentary with netflix on that looks good no jack youre wrong im not 14 anymore you have to change it again i was singing pfudor through this jack brings up something important actually i only have experience writing but we have a very similar depressive period after finished a work i finished five books in quick secession after a long year since i havent posted anything in the past two months just needed the time to mourn i dont see this kind of thing spoken about enough in the art community as a whole jackmaybe its the sinking feeling of time slipping away meim 14 and thats deep if you reverse the audio at 520530 its multiple voices what i could make out of it was 2 male voices and a female voice the female voice seems to be the sentence from when jack picked up the picture and a woman asks for an autograph the main male voice says this year the award goes to and cuts the third and last voice i was unable to decode id like to be that moth please kindergarten 2 has been out for a long time now jack please play it like so jack can see this i think that you play as the little boy who is with his older sister who is trying to protect him she sneaks them on to a boat obviously and has him think its a game like how we here her talking to him in the memorys me halfway through the video hearing the two children holy shit its peppa pig and george its ok this is the comment section youre safe here oh youre also welcome to stay here enjoy some popcorn so jack compared the scenery to something out of alien and then immediately after we see a mannequin with a shadow hand bursting out of its middle and then a vent with its cover hanging loose then going into said vent in a chapter called the hunt theory confirmed nice work jackaboy 2036 that boy reminds me of something from limbo like the shadowy body and the white eyes or like deep sleep jack its never just a mannequin manifest destiny you go get it jackaboy when jack said climb the gold and become bilbo bagans did no one else think of leonard nimoys song the balled of bilbo bagans no just me okay jack i wonder if this will be like the last game like i killed a family member or those to kids die horrifically oh look cards every time you say your intro it remind me of the song all the way xd 3500 so thats why kit harrington has got to go to a phyicatrist after got ended yeah id never play joker dude is a twisted character actors get stuck in his role downfall of the last game was that there was little game play i basically just watched i was never in real danger i hope they changed it an hour later omg stop chasing me i hate being chased i wonder if the quadrapedal baby is a rotoscope reference for mowgli from the jungle book 3145 you can tell those guys never skip leg day honestly that baby at 4710 is the creepiest thing ever to me oh this guy looks just as lost as i am when u start talking to mannequins 2845 its storming really hard out tonight and as soon as this happened my power went out for a second and came back on perfect timing thought it said breasts in the dark jack its either two girls or two boys lily and james fook jack gets scared wtf is happening drinks the bitch juice that shit follows him jack goes down the elevator jackokdown i gobye am i dead this part was so fucking hilarious 426 ah shit here we go again do noti repeatdo not watch alone at 300am when everyone else but you are aslepp at 4623 when the lights went offmy lights at home turned off as welland then i started hiding beneath my covers 748 is it bad i found that kind of hot sign the hunt jack the cunt when we learned the older one was named lily i named the other one james bc harry potter and all that and now his name really is james and that makes me really happy when youre done with kissing and its time for act two the cunt whats up greg danny gonzalez has entered the chat 2286th comment 912 nice game grumps reference down we go into the pits of hell oh hi satan a hungry man cant eat gold but he can live off eating fishes with or without wishes really you havent even finished observer where do you get off from playing layers of fear 2 the scene wtith the big skull looking thing with the torture machine that pops off the heads of the mannequins the big ass clock and the working mannequins really really reminded me of the movie metropolis that movie is phenomenal partly because its a movie that makes you think and partly because of the freaking effects presented in it i wonder if this game is making nods to a bunch of classic movies ie the shining with the bike in the halljack sparrows hair trinketit pops up at the part where the kids are starving and sean was like can i eat it so i wonder if this game is actually asking a question about the philosophy of actingmovie making in general i mean it has a story but its called layers of fear for a reason lol i tried reverse the reversed words and all i heard was oh im sorry then some gibberish i feel like talented devs worked on act 1 and the devs from the first game worked on act 2 i know rats were a big thing in the first one but there isnt really much context for the excess use of rats here also the excess of black and white is getting really tiring 4005 iiiiimmmm gonna swiiing from the chandelier from the chandeliiiiiieeeeeeeeeerrr 2819 the flower is a lilly the older kids name is lilly something happened to lilly is no one going to talk about jacks reference of game grumps missed fell asleep had a popsicle joke around 918 cos that was hella cute hey im a quartermaster metropolis 1927 feels like a reference to that film hay at list you have souls to talk to at around 5450 jack will sound like marv from home alone and do what he did hope a spider lands on jacks face an not spiderman either 10249 pulls back the curtain me foxyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 3150 jack being a crab play try to wake up again that voice reminds me so much of tony todd in candyman jack leaving the faucets on reminds me of professor chaos from south park me so the kids names are lilly and james harry come here im going to tell you a story of how your parents run away from voldemort 3550 this is my thought on when spn ends why do i wait for it to be night to watch your scary lets play bruh the cat from coraline be narrating this whole thing lmao jack im going to leave this episode here plays for 2 more minutes jack okay im going to leave this episode here plays for 2 more minutes jack okay im going to leave this episode here its a weird quatrapedal baby jacksepticeye 2019 the cast for the lotr trilogy touched on that after filming for return of the king was done they shot straight through from first scene of fellowship of the ring to last scene of return of the king 3 years with the same people playing the same characters and basically living in new zealand for those 3 years and then it was done check out the hobbits talking about filming the gray havens scene they talk a lot about how that was one of the last scenes filmed for the movie and they were all crying realtime about shooting ending and how they used that for the scene it just gives a great perspective for what these people go through on long shoots im sure the got cast is feeling the same way in the camera part its says if u listen to it backwards it says this year the award goes to at 524 i think thats it reminds me of little nighmares the deep voice sound like zoom from the cws the flash i would just like to point out that at the beginning of the first episode the booming and ominous voice telling you to play your part refers to you as actor so i think its pretty safe to assume that you are in fact playing an actor especially with all of the context clues hidden in plain sight throughout this game go to 3955 and watch the vid time something scary happens at 4000 on the dot its weird i agree with you to jack the jump scary are pretty cheap and annoying and i do like what is going in the ship to how to transfer pirates pirates i think whenever lego adventures in like sneaking around especially whenever theres no food especially when its whenever its all gone they have to like look for it all and i say thats that was cool did anyone else expect when he asked are there anymore questions i can ask at around 1140 into the video anyone expect him to go do you have 60 minutes lol i wouldve picked the creepy boy then the well jackam i safe jack half a second laternope 533 i wished it was edited so itd play it backwards if there was any message played backwards this game is kinda boring tbh i mean the visuals are nice but the story is awful and doesnt make any sense so far 10145 the killing joke walking over the ray of light sad sean didnt get the batman reference there its an older girl and a younger boy jack the game there is a girl and a boy jack there are two girls the game no i said there is a girl and a boy jack oh so there are two boys mmmh okay omg jack chaos did ensue as soon as u left the taps on the power went today jack watches metropolis jack i can do it too youre not special me so my mom lied i read the title as beasts in the dark i cant vouch for everything but the factory was from fritz langs metropolis the game grumps references are amazingly placed and awesome to recognize heh not knowing how the thing is going to attack is suck because its annoying but the moment that door in the hall popped open and i heard the thing roar i was like why are you backing up run you know since every other time it has shown up anywhere but directly in front of ya trying to back up has been death lol shouldnt have bullshit like that in your game me you should have looked left where he came from 5238 but then every time i did it puppies came out i believe thats not right jack lily and james all i can think is that their last name must be potter and their dad is named harry at 4602 does anyone else see the face in the window of the door or am i just going crazy 1920 made me think what if the movement of the creatures is so choppy is because its like a flip book cuz really really old movies used to be made like that and we do keep hearing about an actor i thought of inside while watching this too 2500 anyone see that german silent film metropolis here that haircut and earrings is horrendous me who slipped this caricature lsd also me this would be fun to watch on lsd this thing with actors and they becoming the character its very true for example emilia clarke was very depressed when they finished making got i can only imagine it was super super hard to just stop beeing the mother of dragons after such a long time during the whole fire section i got flashbacks from that pulse thing in inside did we ever find out what that was edit holy shit jack just talked about it wtf i think the kids are lily and james just a guess 3 love you 3 hi jacksepticeye ive just downloaded outer wilds on xbox after watching your video of it on youtube has anyone decode the backwards voice in the beginning 3132 seems like they were inspired by the film metropolis jack what happened to you you look so beautiful with the green hair and then i was fine with your shorter brown hair but look at you what have you done sees direct visual references to a famous 1920s german expressionist film called metropolis movie geek heart explodes 2147 is that a reference to metropolitan the music gives me nostalgia of the silent hill movies friends protect me wheres the spooks list i cant believe youve done this that creepy quadrupedal baby was horrifying trial and error i feel like there should be enough information no prior knowledge a there were clearly 3 paths 1 the opening and closing door 2 the gate door with light shining through 3 the room the person was staring at hints the player had at hand 1 the opening and closing door had the film lines prior to moving close to it 2 the gate door with light shining through was really a gate with a chain and lock you could see this before you moved to the opening and closing door 3 the opening and closing door had the film scratches where as the persons starting room did not thus concluding that the first door was a trap the second door was not a door leaving only 1 clear answerso the real issue is your slow on the uptake of context clues my man the voice when jack picked up the camera was backwards and it said something like this isnt your i couldnt get the rest top of the page torn off to ya laddies one is a girl names lily shes the one thats the captian james the young boy is mr hardy emphasises on the mr 2353 i betcha theres a lucky emblem here 910 someones been following the grumps i knew the narrator sounded familiar its tony todd the guy who played the candyman i can do the voice to jack your good but im better star wolf jack why is it so quiet probably because its a depiction of a silent movie which is also probably the reason why the environment is black and white but dont quote me on that its just a theory of mine lol nobody is putting down the time stamps for the spooks and now im anxious haha jack being scared by the game 5 seconds later also jack those textures tho 1420 that drink face truly engaged i dont know if you can change this jack but the game thats associated with this video in the description is fear 2 project origin please change it i luv the layers of fear series i would say it is my one of my top 2 fav horror games next to outlast layers of fear isnt as scary as some other horror games but i like it because they tell their stories so well and honestly they have some of the best graphics and environmental imagination ive ever seen in video games that flows altogether it feels more like an intriguing narrative rather than a true horror game to me but i guess thats the part i like and i dont care for the spooks much spoiler alert jack black is not actually black hmmay be your the boy may be she got killed and your feeling the blame od itpotenially yee speeking of manichins all manichans in fallout4 are siths um jacki think your mr hardy and your seeing your own ghost and your brother is your guidance at least that is how i am starting to see it why was jack so challenged by the idea of the kids being different genders older sister lily younger brother james wopah top of the page torn off 2852 look this scene make me remember film metropolis 1927 why does it say youre playing fear 2 in the description then i fired and i missed again thumbs up for game grumps reference act 2 the chunt jack 2019 about the whole show thing we at my school drama club that i call hell week its one week of staying there till like 6 for dress rehearsals and then we get to the show and on the last night people will try to stifle thier tears backstage as to not make a scene and look like thier ok on stage because this is professional we have a job to do and youve put months and have developed a emotional connection to this play and these people and yeah you get this sence of depression and like you said people lose themselves in roles i forgot which role it was but jim carry thought he was a person and he secluded himself and yes he eventually got out of it it was a few months jack in an elevator of mannequins where did you guys come from why are you here me they had 90 minutes to talk about the jacksepticeye how did we get here world tour jack i love you but please dont say the c word fuck is ok though jack maybe its someone playing basketball walks into a room with a creepy demon boy thatll hunt you in your dreams had a dream where i fired i missed had another popcicle and woke up i pissed why the fuck is there a well in a ship tf that kid walking on all fours was creepy okay sen to be honest even if you are in the worst place of all time you make the situation seem way better than its supposed to i have an idea what if each layers of fear game has a different fear simulated the first one has depression and this one is anxiety jack when a door opens a bit with light shining out and then opening completely when youre right next to it usually means the players looks at it within the next 5 seconds has anyone noticed that the voice actor for the voice sounds like the same for admiral briggs in cod 2 that made me extremly upset i would have given the food to her mama and puppies i dont care if im d y i n g of hunger its not a theory but i think the game is drawing a lot of inspiration from all sorts of different popular movies throughout times there was the mild alien reference that you mentioned in the video and the huge machine looked a lot like a huge machine thats in an old german expressionist film called metropolis where poor people are symbolically fed into the machine of death then obviously theres the film noir in the aesthetic a lot just some cool stuff that i noticed then referencing 3408 jack can i have some fooooood im starving also jack turns around ohohohohohohohohohohohoh me bish plsssssssssssssssssssssssss xd the music sounds like when you go into the safe room in resident evil 7 jack i wanna be chased also jack stands right next to the moster for several seconds then gets killed thats just an instant kill such bullshit 518 of course slender mans not in the woods hes on vacation i hate being chased to at least by a shadow of slenderman you know i know this is irrelevant and has nothing to do with the story but the older little boy sounds like len from vocaloid lol hear we go into the pits of hell o hi satan lmao i like how the whole series is uncut mostly the machinery part was the metropolis thing whole ass game mr hardy jack oh i thought it was two girls 10516 the original quote was a house is built of walls and beams a home is built of love and dreams they replaced the word love with fear which might be hinting at something going all heath ledger on us there at the method acting talk 10316 whoops i just killed someone again hi wilford worfstash jack slenderman you should be in the woods somewhere slenderman i deserve a vacation too jack well stay the fuck away for me act two the cunt the deep voice sounded like vin diesel at some points haha like at 1700 xd 3300 i think i saw something like that on pornhub 3250 you should of pulled the hand through the body surprise it got me good anyway lol im literally 15 and thats not deep the comment section is just quotes from the video this is honestly the most boring horror game ive seen game do you know the way my mind of dead memes do you know de wae you run but do you know de wae sick gg ref bro 913 i understood that reference i personally really like it when games punish or in this case directly kill you for making the most obvious choice were used to making as gamers maybe because i also love trial and error stuff but thats wonderful about humanity isnt it that different people have different tastes watching this with my bud from the uk and just about died when he yelled you need a knob you knob round 1523 lmao is it just me or does jack come off as a lot more cynical nowadays i dont know about you but i feel like mannequins are seriously overdone overall i like this game so far and i always appreciate when you do long form playthroughs like this i dont like the recent trend of developers using a game to tell a story that relates or metaphors to mental illness or physical ie cancer dragon or whatever so i really hope thats not where this story is going but i definitely gotta see it through at this point lol its the boy from brightburn every time jack turned the water on and left it i was reminded of that part in home alone when marv left the water running for wet bandits and harry called him sick for it lol does this game remind anyone else of little nightmares hi people from the past i havent watched his third part to this trilogy but here are my theories so far plz like so other ppl can see idk who the main character is you play as all i can assume is he is an actor not sure how hes connected the kids tho the kids are a sister lily and a younger brother james the kids are the stowaways that are talked about quite frequently throughout the notes in the game that is why they sneak around and why officers report seeing kids running around the lower decks of the ship theyre not ghosts just stowaways they may be ghosts in the current time of the main character tho lily tells her little brother pirate stories to keep him brave even making them the pirates in her stories lily even says they will send us back if they find us evidently suggesting theyll be sent back to whatever other country theyre from and theyre hungry because they arent able to find much food considering the lockdown since theyve been stealing food th 5943 reminds me of a level from inside jaaaaaack its a girl lily and her little brother james theyre stowaways on the ship which is why theyre having trouble finding food the chief of security keeps increasing security on the food bc he thinks one of his employees is stealing from the company my theory is that something happened to lily andor the ship and only james was able to make it to wherever they were running to i have two theories as to who the person the player controls is 1 the person is an adult james a struggling actor who took this gig from an eccentric director because his friend and agent told him to making this some weirdass saw situation in order to make james into the perfect actor for his playmoviewhatever the second theory which im finding more and more likely is that the person is just an unlucky struggling actor and the director is james making the actor relive what happened to him and lily in order to make the actor become him so he can play him in an autobiographical mo i wonder if jacks saying the cunt instead of the hunt on purpose or im just deaf the voice actor sounds like the same one from the netflix show troll hunters he sounds like angor rot there is mannequins behhind you jacklookout jumpscare list if i missed anything comment below 0056 loud noise 418 noise 515 noise 620 door opens and closes 630 loud noise 632 glitchy ghost thing returns from behind 956 thing spoops jack 1200 very minor 1345 noise 1544 noise 1916 noise thing strapped to bench shakes 2845 a whole bunch of mannequins appear when jack turns around 3240 mannequin glitches on ground 3412 minor 4033 noise 4041 mannequins behind jack 4127 glitchy ghost appears again 4420 noise and crash 4438 another explosion sort of thing 4617 glitchy ghost appears basically from here its a big chase but jack escapes 4717 projector screen glithces 4720 major glitch jumpscare1 4750 another jumpscare 4909 dead dude sitting in front of screen 5109 noise and glitchy stuff 5133 glitchy stuff merges 5416 more glitchy stuff 5635 glitch 5826 wall glitches and explodes oof 5914 jack gets caught in flames 10025 jack pr why cant i find any jumpscare lists so since its nighttime and act 2 is the hunt is it the night of the hunt isnt the killing joke a reference from batman the one that joker tells a story about one of 2 guys told the other to step on the light hey d it reminded me of inside as well when i played it please tell me somebody else got the killing joke reference about how joker tells batman a story about two crazy guys long story short one guy goes to walk across a beam of light and the game does the same thing here with the reference love it yeah i love this game and how it give you many chances to either take or give the daily responses for life but you can either continue on one path or chance in mid way like with the dog part that flower is a lily jack 1303 me its the plaggg dudeee makes a sandwich here you are jack girlyou run but knucklesdo you know de way why is no one talking about the dog and puppies scene thats cool how everyone gets a different code on the board i was just watching daz games play and he got a completely different one very cool hey jack i am an actor and when it ends i do go crazy baby we built this house on memes what if youre playing the game as if you were on some movie set everything could intentionally be happening hence the buttons opening multiple things and all the weird things happening at random times deep creepy voice guy sounds like the candyman heath ledger passed away getting too deep in the role of the joker that he ended up going crazy and odd who else binge watched the first series that he did on this its ketchup no need ta worry i feel like with the manikins at the demon machine place its referencing fritz langs metropolis because you go into the elevator and all and their there with you the movie is pretty cool the 2 girls probably died horribly oh hey cards jack at the beginningokay im scared now 40 minutes laterjust shutup i got unreasonably angry and shouted thats a lily at my tv screen and i have no explanation for it finds treasure i smell pennies he found a lily on what looked like a grave and the girls name was lily has anyone noticed that jack is slowly losing veiws everyday not getting as much as he used too but still looks so happy and joyful in his videos i want to be that happy does anyone else turn down the volume on the music so the only thing you hear is your footsteps and everything else so you dont know when you have to run and every little thing makes you jump when that dog came out i was eating cereal and i just smacked my cereal bowl every cat when it sees a moth 1255 i didnt know i wanted final destination the game and then tony todd speaks do people not like this game why is it getting so little views play trover saves the universe made by justin roiland sees the well me yahavetacomequicklytimmyfelldowntawellvance im 14 and this is deepfor real i have potato skin the irish 1700s present jack lemme drink my lil bitch juice jack that isnt trash youre the belly of the ship the boiler room thats coal i was eating watermelon at 4035 i got scared and threw it across the room how does sean swear all the time and still get monetized jack sees creepy mannequins jack were you from i really dont know much about you guys and girls dont read comments its full of spoilers eat the gold jack says youre just going to buy food with it anyway jack says gold turns out to be fish me well he wasnt wrong they could have just eaten the gold after all also this whole game just makes me think of the creation of art destruction of self thing jack you are gonna have to explain this to me its weirdly scifi me yeah its the movie metropolis for some reason 4034 made me throw my phone and spill my coffee ffs dummy jack i dont usually shout corrections at you when i watch your stuff but several times during this vid i had to say out loud its a girl and a boy you dddumbaassss ready for the new it movie jack talks about horrifically killing family 3 seconds into the talk jack hey cards 056 and 144 is that the queen that the ugandan knuckles find her hmmmmm i am curious 3603 being a amateur actor in local theatre productions i usually call it post show depression the hobbits actors filmed the cast leaving and it was emotional to some of the cast how did you miss the door being slammed open by the monster twice ohshit your pants and died huh i have been therejack2019 this just in if you like theatre youre a thesbian jack before playing the game i wish therell be more interact with the game jack while playing it i hate it cool am i the only one who got bts dionysus v focus ads in the beginning anyways imo the second game doesnt really give that creepy and scary vibe that would keep you on edge like the first one though the plotstoryline is more interesting just my opinion tho what is it with youtubers and gefuel lol jack ive never been much of a puzzle person also jack literally spends his life solving puzzles for peoples entertainment ep 1 i wish there were more gameplay elements ep 2 you shouldnt have bullshit like that in your game hey 206 is my favorite number jackplz play uncanny valleyits a game made by digeratiits quite similar to the final stationi think you would really enjoy it based on how much you liked the final station not to look too deep into it but i really like how they make little hints towards things you learn in actor training for example the bit about finding the animal to find itthe character is a common idea from multiple well know practitioners if an actor is struggling to find a character its often recommended to pick an animal that relates to to the character and work from there using characteristics of the animal etc and the whole becoming a vessel is very similar to how method acting is explainedtaught any way i just thought it was a nice touch man this one is like way less cool than the first game even the voice acting sucks okay so did no one catch onto the fact that the player picks up a lily flower in the steamengine part while the narrator talks of death seems pretty significant to me besides the older girl being called lily in some cultures the flowers are seen as flowers for mourning or funerals i like how this game went bendy and the ink machine mode this game had a lot of potentialthe voice acting was on pointthe atmosphere goodthe story good but the scaresaction maann what a let downhalf of the game was empty and the other halfyou get chased by a monster that couldt even scare a child the first layers of fear got my hopes up for the horror genreit was almost perfect but this onedisappointed my guess is that the director is really the little boy who snuck on a ship with his sister a long time ago they eventually get caught and something happens that causes big sis to get killed so director comes back to similar ship to make the story of him and his sister but it drives him mad and he ends up walking through his sets losing his mind the thing that chases you are the shipmates who were trying to capture them in the past jack plays scary game also jack look at these graphics 544 no its the new slayer album pissing blood please finish the game no matter how much views it gets i think the kids are stowaways theyre the ones who stole food and theyre hiding from the crew 4029 great timing on that scream there jack 740 anyone else think this guy is the actor from the candyman horror movies didnt the pov character have the same demon eyes in his reflection in the first episode so isnt he playing as james the little boy jack plays a game with a main character called lily jack finds a lily flower in game jack i know what type of flower that is i still get so pived that for my entire life i thought it was open sesame and i only recently found out that its actually open says me am i the only one who read the title as breasts in the dark i hurt my foot this is a nice video to watch and snuggle in a blanket thank you jack w 1135 jack that was a cool effect i dont like it like really jack this layers of fear 2 doesnt really have that much to do with painting who else is chilling out in the comments while jack is being chased by that demon shadow love the game but that shit makes me anxious as heck ok layers of fears 2 has a gripping story extremely good graphics and presentation excellent atmosphere but it has an excessively linear experience the puzzles are too simple and despite some innovations the game feels a little too much like its predecessor im wearing a shirt with words on it and when jack was in that really dark place i just saw the words of my shirt move across the screen and i screamed 910 shows how much love jack has for the grumps 3 please keep in mind people that its harder for jack to keep track of story elements or characters whilst recording than it is for you whilst viewing having to keep entertainment on your mind vastly occupies the brain 222 balls deep also the mans voice sounds like the voice from animal planet 336 the cunt wait what suddenly metropolis 1927 movie search metropolis moloch and see what looks familiar this is how many jacks got why the mysterious guy voice is like venom who else thought the title was breasts in the dark xd omg what happens what is the mystery need to know now loves watching you play games please post the next part soon x there seems to be a lot of references to old films like metropolis 1927 the part with the clock and the squatting mannequins made me think of it did anyone else notice that instead of the hunt he said the cunt jacksepticeye is allowed to say cunt multiple times in his videos while other youtubers cant even say damn lol the killing joke reference il just writing this down to tell jack how toxic this community is we dont give a fuck on this comment section and we can say whatever we want dont ne that dude who thinks hes noble and dislikes this comment like this shit layers of fear 1 was better than layers of fear 2 like if u agree 506 comment yeah i think he moved in front of something play better games like this one 910 then i fired then i miss then fell asleep then i woke got a pop cycle and then i fired and then i miss game grumps yeah theres an older sister her name is lily and her little brother his name is james also there are 2 main endings 1 secret ending jack im going to leave the tap on explosions and chaos i love the music in the game is this whats in jim carreys head these days the part at around 20mins reminds me so much of the movie metropolis with the machinery and the huge face entrance no gonna talk about the alien reference with the door and the chest bursting scene at 3230 i thought that was awesome that whole section with the machinery and the black and white was like something out of a tool video jack im leaving the taps on again cause im chaotic evil me thats chaotic neutral at best lol 3607 jack isnt heath ledger i think a perfect example of an actor losing themselves completely in their roles playing the joker cost him his life stage plays and movies arent the same as a live show there is a lot less audience participation its not at all high energy because even in a live play the audience has to be quiet to watch the show it would be disrespectful to the actors and the crew if the audience was high energy and loud through the play so many references to old movies lily and james both names are now given honestly i am glad jack is planning cause no way would i fnd this game interesting yes love the metropolis scene very suitable what i get about the backstory is that the actor is one of the little kids in the flashback they were in a bad place and got into the boat to start over but the food was running out and the crew noticed food being missing so they secured it and because of that the kids were starving they even went as far as wanting to eat the food meant for the animals on board like the dogs or even eat rats the crew members that keep a watch think something scary is down there making noise but its the kids or something else and vice versa the kids think something is down there with them it could be a monster or just an animal which they imagine to be a monster or just a crew member keeping watch the monster could be the kids traumatic memories what he thinks he saw during those days their present and past are mixed in his mind so he sees now what he thought he saw then am i the only one that hears the dude from the horror movie candyman in that voice the worst thing in horror games is mannequins anybody else hiding in the comments this guy jack really just says whatever comes to his mind for better or worse usually worse me jack found a poster with my last name on it yes my real last name is hamlet the gold was a red herring lol it sounds like the two kids are stowaways those leg skins might be necropants dunno what an icelandic sorcerers trousers would be doing on a ship but supposedly if you made them properly they brought you luck and fortune the older one is lily the younger one is james 738 he sounds like the main villain from the second transformers movie anyone else think so pleas play more jack seems pretty negative in this episode overall hes obviously a grown human man whos allowed to have opinions and bad days and so forth but im really missin the pma on this fine thursday night run run run as fast as you can you cant catch me for i am the jackaboyman lol came up with this and i think it sounds pretty great hey jack i think a perfect game for you to play given how you mentioned a supernatural murder mystery on an oldtimey boat is return of the obra dinn no spoilers obviously all ill say is that your role is to solve what happened to the passengers who were they what was their fate it doesnt hold your hand and its up to you to piece together what happened through various means its a sleeper hit of 2018 this kinda reminds me of bendy and the ink machine what was that 4658 i dont know why but to me this was just too funny the amazon guy knocked on our door and i literally threw my phone and screamed what is that thing i take that as a yes your still on the ship 2521 metropolis anyone i know i was i was waving goodbye i had one earlier today had to dump the wood into a pile dont be scared of shadow hesshes only a petfriend sure like why are you disappearing kissing the lock for luck weird shadow its a lilly but the type of lily i dont know i only know that cause lilies tulips and roses are easy learn to draw plants that can get better with each drawing im not consistent enough to do that but others can a stage huh can i sleep on that nvm i prefer a bed to a stage ok now i have ello you stuck on repeat in my head and i cant think of the movieshow are you still on the ship or not its not an anagram for characters that word only had one a in it and characters has two as heck jack jack goes through door game closes door jack no wait aw fck am i the only one who saw the face in the window of the door at 4603 im gonna be honest i never watched the whole i fired then i missed thing until i saw it in the comments of this video instant like for both videos because of that i wonder if this is a visual representation of the acting world the guys voice sounds like the actor in candy man patanormal activity isnt even scary its alll jumpscares and not even good ones lilly a bitch i still dont understand by people outside america dont put screens on their windows to keep the bugs out in reply to seans comment about the moth and having to open his window what if the scary guysguy that walked towards you had cake the set with the slavic dancers and the face is a reference to the movie metropolis about the elite living in a utopia on the backs of those who do the real work to keep society alive and reside underground edit my interpretation is its commentary about how much credit directors and actors get when theres a sea of people making sure it all comes to fruition the scenes where the mannequins are moving and are super creepy is definitely a reference to metropolis everything is so similar to the first scene of the movie my theory is that he is playing a part in a horror movie and he is captain bains love the reference to game grumps then i fired and i missed i fired and i missed again jack why does he have demon eyes me cause hes obviously demon eyes kyo thats tony todd doing the creepy narrator voice at first i thought you said act ii the cunt its the doctor who dont blink mannequin impersonationlol jack why is everything black and white me its because youve interned the twilight zone that scene with the clock the buildings the men dancing and entering into the demons mouth was all a reference to the metropolis an old film from the 1920s you should see it its a really cool film oh that poor mama pup and her babies 1139 jack are there any more questions that i can ask me do you have 90 minutes at the start you forgot a note on the mirror well the exact thing that jack is talking about with trying to live normally after the end of a role is why kit harrington john snow from game of thrones just checked into a mental health clinic he was really depressed now that game of thrones is over great video sean 1416 what the fck is happening casually takes a swig of bitch juice i dont know if anyone else picked up on it but the scenes with the 10 hour clock and the mannequins doing the little jig and the elevator are all references to the 1927 movie metropolis which pioneered the modern syfy genre edit 2522 jack you sounded like homer off of the simpsons when the food disappeared at 1114 this year do u want couldnt understand the rest i think the monster is the security guards in the ship the older sister shows him its a monster so he will run away it was a little girl lmao james and lily im guessing one of the kids died i think the girl died and the actor jack is playing is the little boy that is trying to remember what actually happened and thats why hes broken enough to play the part the director wants him to maybe he forgot or something made him forget also im guessing they ran away from home because they were maybe getting abused and she the sister made him believe they were playing a game to save him and they stored away on the ship and they stole a lot of food which made the food more restrictive as to why gourds were now there that parts confuses me the flower at 2819 was a white lily it can stand for innocence or the loss of it a connection to god etc but is most commonly known as a sign of death though im no florist or any kind of flora expert so dont quote me on that are they hanging legs me no jack those are pants part one getting a feel for the game loving the textures ooh creepy manaquins oh no do they move wow the sensitivity is really off putting huh guys part two stress stress in black and white pop up mannequins death rats catious stress death ooh beautiful textures here more rats what the fuck was that asmr stress stress in colour death thicc hair i dont know how it could be relevant to the plot but the part with the mannequins being dismembered and destroyed by that grotesque machine the elevators bringing them down in to that city reminds me a lot of the film metropolis from the 1920s its a german film and its kinda creepy i guess it could be a reference because of the filmmovie thematic going on but i seriously wouldnt be able to come up with a connection to the story in general game a house is built on fears and dreams jack no a house is built on jokes and memes too much asmr hey jack i ws wondering if you could do a live stream of playing this game i mean its a really good game and i think that a live stream would be a nice touch to a horror game the guy speaking sorta sounds either like the fallen from transformers the movies or corephyeus for dragon age jack you are being the wet bandits from home alone by turning on all of the sinks in this episode two characters james and lily anyone else immediately think of james and lily potter p like the actors in game of thrones 10 years and now its over just like that one b o y one g i r l boy is james girl is lily transadlantic is actually a clothing company sooo your scared of your own shadow and little noises and when it come to being chased you just say what the fuck i hate those things lol love your vids tho older girl and younger boy sean younger boy sean why do i put myself through this mannequins are my worst fear yet im subjecting myself to this but why just hearing the intro and outro again is bringing me immense joy that i didnt know i was missing are the mannequins the roles that the character were playing as had before game is ok but layers of fear 1 was better creep factor just not there and there is a reason lots of scary games are in big old houses cause they are the creepiest sean the part where you saw the wooden dolls dance the elevator the underground city the clock and the monster machine are references to the 1927 movie metropolis one of the first sci fi movies been lowing the film references here so far if im not wrong theres been the obvious one for the shining then one for metropolis the clock game with the factory setting and one for nosferatu the coffin in the ship hold no one jack leaves taps on the black and white parts already gave me a german expresionism vibe and then came the metropolis references this game is beautiful i just love the dream like atmosphere the black and white gives its awesome and super immersive the tragic story of a painting that came to life its a painting come to life explosion ohhh nevermind its dead sean is the wet bandit jack is it blood or piss me its jam im normal man leafblower 1120 stalinsnaps his fingers food i dont feel soo good i love jack to death but getting angry with the game just bc he doesnt get puzzles right off feels like its doing the game a disservice 1 boy 1 girl not that hard i think that you play both as the kid and the actor at the same time or you play as the actor and you relive the memories of some dead kids what do yall think i think that you play both as the kid and the actor at the same time or you play as the actor and you follow the trails of some dead kids what do yall think metropolis the engine room with the dancing mannequins its a reference to the black and white film metropolis sean i say this with the utmost respect but over the years ive noticed you seem to rush more and more in games through this playthrough you missed so many sequences visual tricks visual shots animations because you were so concerned with doubling back on yourself looking in drawers turning back and leaving just when you triggered something and to be honest it almost ruined the experience for me im so excited for this i loved the first layers of fear and talked a bunch of friends into playing it too even a couple streamers cant wait to figure out what the whole story is for the second one jack you should play one leaves james and lily and theyre british harry potter music intensifies i think your character the actor was one of the children thats why in the first episode it says that you dont like boats because of to what you went through oh god look at the eyes at 4145 was there a whole segment of the game turned into alien homage you cant snap your finger inside your mouth i bet you just tried it now your mouth hurts 920 i like that reference to that one game grumps animation jack good on ya mate oh my goodness this game is creepy jack is that skeleton bones me of an arm gregg lets poke it with a stick jack nope its a big sister and a little brother okay this is really annoying me right at the start he walks into a hallway there is a shadowy figure at the end and a door between thats swinging open and closed jack ignores the obviously suspicious door then complains about cheap game design when a monster comes out of it that move was so telegraphed its on you that you missed it and blaming the game is just being a poor sport 523 if you play it backward its two conversations the second plays over the first too loudly to hear the entirety of it but you can clearly hear a woman saying oh im sorry and then a man starting to respond with just dontyourself during that the sounds played over each other and i couldnt hear the middle of it the louder of the two sounds like its over a radio probably between two of the staff both appear male it starts with this here then goes on with something like be warned or do you want it and then becomes severally garbled blocking out the other conversation underneath past this point he could be saying a number of things but it sounds quite a bit like no sir it could all be one man instead of two possibly the captain or one of the people who was in the radio room with the morse code i dont have the skills required to separate the conversations from one another but maybe one of yall know how im a day behind but thats okay its layers of fear so the part with the clock is a reference to the movie metropolis the narrator or whoever thats supposed to be sounds like zoom from the flash this channel is deas jack you should ply green hell cant wait much longer for part 3 dont know if its been said but that voice actor is tony todd aka the candy man he has one hell of a voice the flower you found is a lily symbolising humility and devotion as well as the flower is also asoceation with funerals you keep asking us questions that we are not answering to which i say shut up and watch the movie some of this looked like a reference to metropolis they monster reminds me of spiderman into the spiderverse 2254 it straight up looks like someone skinned some poor bastards lower half of their body to make human flesh leggings sean it cant be trial and error without the error you get it wrong and try again thats how life works you cant always have someone tell you how things work 4008 me hey its the swinging orgy again jack hi amalgamation of bodies me bruh i think it has story secrets after god of war and now this he really does love his secrets what jack is talking about with being on tour and coming off of it and getting depressed is usually called postshow depression or postshow blues its basically the realization that your schedule that has revolved around this one specific show for months is suddenly over im an actor for my schools theatre department and postshow blues always hit hard lol pretty sure that the bit starting at 2520 is an homage or reference to the old silent movie metropolis which makes sense given the time frame of the game but also its just nice to see an homage to that movie in modern day stuff 907 and then i fired and i missed and then i missed again 3 nice reference there jackaboi you really7 need to fix the volume of the game so when you say did you hear that we cant hear it mostly when the kids are talking i still have to turn my volume up then when you talk wow you are loud other then that grat vid and games looks great these are just hanging legs then i got an ad for running shoes 10150 step into the light and perish for those few people who play paladins lol missed so much who makes up this shit lol interestingi wasnt going to watch this series until i had finished playing it myself but im glad ive watched to the point ive played because im seeing stuff after the rotten fish area that i didnt see when i played it im assuming its because i made the opposite choices he did when it came to the gun and the dogs i disobeyed the voice the kids are stowaways cause lily or captain whatever tf wanted to play pirate and the other kid is the actor and this is him filling the role of what lily wanted him to pretend to be and they cant find food because the ships security is up and theyre rationing the food lol the kids names are lily and james am i reading into it too much or is it a harry potter ref i thought i recognized the directors voice tony todd hes the one who voice fallen in transformers 2 revenge of the fallen a large portion of this act is a metropolis reference the face the crowded elevator the questionable machinery jack ew that is horrifyingwhat happened to youre face the panting looks at sean everything me i could relate to that 5703 man i knew that gold smelled fishy just something i noticed about the kid at 4709 in the first frame hes smiling he probably thinks its fun walking in such a funny way but in the following frames you can see that hes still being made to walk on all fours and in the last frame you can see his ribs and he seems to be crying its clear he doesnt want to be in that position anymore this might be alluding to how the director makes his actors jump through hoops to get into character 2140 to 2214 reminds me so much of metropolis that old black and white movie it just looks so much like the underground later at 2937 i take it back most of this episode is like metropolis jack would be the one that got a secret ending were he sinks the ship by flooding it with all the tap water my instinct must be fucked when it comes to game choices then true alpha beta james is the little brother and lily is his older sister they are stowaways i knew that gold smelled fishy im a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude just 12k likes what happend i have never seen a game before that brings attention to mental health amongst actors i am a thespian myself and i agree with a lot of the statements on mental health in this it is often a struggle to come down from the high the stage gives you after its done and i very much appreciate jacks understanding on this topic i love that they got my fav actor tony todd cabdyman himself to voice the narration i love his voice and the fact it always strikes fear when you hear it that part with the mannequins and the elevator is from the silent motion picture metropolis from i believe 1950s game is viciously quiet sean is that a door jack please stop trying to voice act every voice acted part in the game after they speak please eat it i dare you 523 reverse that i can tell its already backward audio who knows what it says im scared of shadows sean touches everything also sean probably shouldnt have done that also also sean im 14 and that was deep no one absolutely no one sean locked love you jack said he thought it would be two girls but why would she call him mr hardy instead of mrs hardy so it was kind of obvious fuck that lil kid on the screen now i cant sleep he is in the back of my mind trial and error diminishes the scarer sean where am i going me dont do it dont do it dont do it me how did we get here i dont know do you haaaaave 90 minutes arent there like people with psychosis who experience these sort of things in their dreams and during the day in their head the stolen flame is a metaphor for using grief and mourning as reason and strength to be a part of your character and push you forward once you accept that this isnt a good basis you understand how empty you are and dead inside as you lose what drives you forward same as if you copy someones motive instead of having your own therefore your character isnt your own and when they die so do you i think we need creepy quadrupedal baby merch also i cracked up at am i safe now nope not safe im not done with the video but here is my theory so far two kids an older girl names lily and the younger boy james escape a bad family situation by getting on a ship as stowaways during this whole thing lily is acting as if its all a game they are pirates and shes the chief etc probably to give herself courage she wants to get to a great land america the problem is that they quickly run out of food so they steal from the reserves but it causes ship security to be reinforced they are also not alone here so there are probably others stowaways my guess is that the boy will most probably die at some point during the storm that is incoming or maybe of starvation since the food seems to have run out in the boat while the girl survive and becomes a reknowned actress but she kept a deep hatred for the sea she is the main character and her new role has her on this ship trying to build a character but in doing that shes going through flashbacks of why did i read breasts in the dark sean didnt notice the killing joke reference with the flashlight bridge it is a girl and a boy the older one is a girl named lily and the younger is a boy named james bro i have an idea the captain child is not real james is alone theory time the man character is the boy that the girl took with on the boot they were running away from home possibly because of the fear that they were going to send them to a foster home or something like that just a guess the ship they secretly got on to was the titanic and the sister died on it after trying to save her brother and that gave him severe trauma and tried to hide himself from the memory by creating characters to hide behind now that his old and on a replica of the boat and is basically recreating what happened through his traumatic and over scarified memory while trying to get into character for a movie that recreates the sinking of the titanic but thats just a theory a insert game theory youtuber catchphrase here sean is this some kind of game where i get to kill a family member or somethingoh carrots 3520 its when you are over at your best friends house and then you have to leave and you feel lonely did you not catch the connection of the story of the kids to the film maker the film maker seems to be one of the kids and he is making a movie about their time pretending to be pirates searching for treasure or food it was mentioned in one of the pieces of paper you found i think that is the most compelling part of the game the story is really interesting the mannequins that move constantly are not the scariest its when they start becoming like weeping angels that they are horrifying i honestly prefer the first game so james and lily are presumably running away from home and they hop aboard this boat as stowaways scrounging for food hiding from the crew and playing pirates i wonder how the actor is connected to them totally tubular sick nasty game grumps reference bro hamalamadingdong one of my favs like totally fa sho spoopy scary manequins so real talk the spooky narrator sounds like death from final destination movies i believe the actor was in candyman as well horror movies of yesteryear but i always enjoyed him what if the mannequins were the people on the boat but actually turned into mannequins by the monster dude i love it when in games because there is steam you close a valve and proceed on your merry way acting like you didnt just stop something from functioning properly x 2145 i didnt know hell had an amusement park ride did you im just going to take a guess and say that youre either playing as james or lily at 10027 when the fire hits the player character the character makes a rather feminine or almost childlike sounding grunt as well at 10246 the shadow of the character appears to have the same profile as the creepy child on the wardrobe slender man is an slender man is emigrating to north carolina jack please play the until dawn prequel the inpatient id love to see your reaction play fear heres all the spooks big scary noise 053 slenderman 514 spooky figure 629 spoopy figure 956 scary noises 1017 pipe burst 1100 warpies and cool effects 1127 food shitting door 1156 at the end of the hallway 1258 sparks and ghostly figure 1342

mannequin falls 10353 final scares 10353 phe play plague inc again single player has vampires now anyone notice its lily and james like harry potter can someone explain to me where do you have 90 minutes thing came from did anyone realize that there is a well in a ship theory time i believe you are playing one of the two siblings youre either lily the older sister who is obsessed with acting like a pirate and never breaks character or youre the younger sibling who is a boy referred to as mr hardy james i believe what happened is that these two kids actually stowed away on this ship the ship has a strict policy about stowaways even daring to suggest that they may be killed so these children hide below decks lily likely trying to separate herself from the horrifying reality shes in will not break character while the younger is clearly scared from some of the reports from sailors on the ship they are not only hiding there but also stealing food i imagine eventually it will be discovered that the children or one of them was found and maybe killed before the sailors knew they were kids im more inclined to think you are lily who survived and now feels terrible guilt over the death of your younger sibling because you any opinions on the following so what i got so fari think two kids a sister and brother stowed away on a ship and hid in the cargo decks they wanted to leave home for some reason while on the ship i guess they roleplayed as pirates to keep themselves or at least the young boy from being scared what you are seeing is the crew at the time trying to find them they know someone is on the ship because food is going missing as the kids are eating it the kids get frightened when ever their pursued and i guess in their minds it manifested into this creature one thing i dont get is who are you playing when it goes black and white that must symbolise a memory so are you an actor researching a true event that happened on this boat the kids on the ship that is being adapted into a film and your just following in their footsteps to get a feel of the character or are you one of the kids grown up and youre reliving a nightmare to be mentally prepared for a role i mean ob 332 sean act two the cunt sean sean sean acts bored 320 game only then can he find the keyand claim his prize sean okay thanks dad me thats the sean we know and love yo jack if youre reading this and like a good mystery with a fantasic story set on a a creepy boat like this play 9 hours 9 persons 9 doors its on pc now and i probably wouldnt be the only one who would like to see

more five nights at freddys all these scratched audio effects keep throwing me back to oxenfree and honestly i dont really mind yall remember when jack gave his pubes to filthy frank with a top of the

episodeanimated hey if anyone has a gaming channel would you mind checking my channel out and telling me what i can do better just leave a comment and tell me the time i can change something at thank you so much the man narrating sounds like the same guy who played candyman jack asks community im gonna need you to explain this to me community looks around at each other for answers i dunno either jackaboy but i think its an older girl and younger boy this is just the movie metropolis as a horror theme please react to jachsepticeye sings new rules please react to jachsepticeye sings new rules please react to jachsepticeye sings new rules please react to jachsepticeye sings new rules the scene after you climb down the rope in the well at 2140 is a reference to the movie metropolis from 1927 me while playing layers of fear ah i completely this game me while watching jack play layers of fear 2 i have so many questions i think youre either lily or james potter and the monster is the other given in to instinct youre probably lily since james says you didnt take it after that thing with the dogs jack high fives camera autofocus holy shit i think you should draw your spidersona please play terraria your icon is pretty much the eye of cthulhu i think the mannequins are the people or actors that used to be on this boat they are just trapped inside of them thats why they move as characters in a story you should play some more far cry games i remember when you played far cry 4 and it was funny as hell cant wait for the next one so excited yeah your character is a mannequin its gotta be please play a plage tale innocence it is an amazing new indie game and i highly recommend it does anyone have a jumpscare list i dont want to watch it unless i know where the jumpscares are pretty sure the two kids are a big sister the one that refers to herself as captain baynes and her little brother james who is referred to as mr hardy even leonardo dicaprio cant explain this gane story nobody jack asking lots of questions me do u have 90 minutes you should try bad north its a procedurally generated island hopper where you have to go from island to island protecting them from invading vikings as you go along you unlock new characters i think it would really fit your gaming and commentary style 2826 jack the white lilly is mostly used in funerals it means that the soul of the departed has received restored innocence after death so as he was speaking about death i guess that helps 2847 you aint gonna go alone take some palls will ya the names of the kids are giving me the spooks 3730 whats in the booooox the smeraldo flower with the guy burning and looking out of the window if this is part of the bangtan universe 1 im sueing both big hit and bts for mental abuse 2 jack you are not gonna understand shit i am a realllllyy big fan 56 years i watched you for 56 years i swear you should play dishonerddefinitive edition hey i started this game and you missed a big clue at th beginning if you just look around the dressing room the clothes around the dressing room are women clothes dresses and what not so our character dose seem to a womanactress now a game theory what if this is the daughter from the first game your being his daughter all grown up now an actor to hide the pain although the narrator did say mansad man but i still like it being his daughter love you jack give shout out to this theory maybe ill try to say it on my channel i want all your horror gameplays to have a heart rate monitor on them please yeet yeet thrers a yeti behind you jaaaaack you cant just ask someone if theyre made of vomit its not nice how would you feel if i asked you that 2124 one puts the lotion in the basket or it gets the hose again they are skins who else understood the reference to the killing joke 10203 i paused the video when sean said im leaving the taps open again and thought lol chaotic evil and then he said the same thing and now im sitting here questioning the universe like fuck the jump scares are cheap idk it was about all i could handle shrugs maybe i dont understand the game in my opinion could be better if it gave more direction and had a bit more plot if it were to be a lot scarier welli wouldnt be here probably ummmnoone noticed the star trek reference in around 5100 minutes the one when jack placed the dead mouse on the scale i mean itstooa reference in transformers movies too the phrase the need of the many outweigh the need of the few were spoken by the same actor leonard nemoyand he said the same phrase in one of the transformers moviesbut the one outweigh the many please tell me that other people noticed d 3603 i think it isnt about that and i believe i resonate with the problem quoted in the note i will rely mostly on my own personal experience but listen to what i have to say when an actor plays a role its a character fictional or real doesnt matter what matters is that a good actor will always play that role good whereas a bad one not so much that is due to the actor not being fully immersed in his role or played character the difference lies in immersion and when you are fully immersed in one or many other roles you begin to lose your own character your true oneself i said that ive encountered this problem but im no actor i think that i cant understand my own personality because i have always been trying to fit into many groups instead of finding a group that is fit for me my current personality is a dissolved sphere of many different roles i had to play or simply behavior of a character that i liked and stuck to myself however thats just my op jack mentioned slenderman i miss those days such a golden game 3 they got the tension perfect but wasted so many opportunitys to capitalize on them they could have easily made this one of the scariest games ever with the ambience and models but like every horror game they wuss out we need a new genre of horror with liabilitys taken out of the developers hands as long as we sign away our rights to complain about what the game does to us you would not have to do it and would need a few proofs of age but it could really bring life back to horror and make it actually scary which needs to exist in some form almost certainly people would buy it just for the scare factor when a mann quinn ting tries to kill you just act like you know him an say ah you woodent kill jack ill throw a wheelbarrow at youi threw iti missed the kids are stowaways and are running low on food i also think lily is the only girl and the little boy is the quartermaster and the one youve been seeing around the ship im wondering if the monster theyre seeing is someone chasing them i dont quite understand that part yet although i wish i did fan hey im a huge fan can i have you sign oh sorry i thought you were someone else person how can this happen to meee 913 sick game grumps ref bruh caught me way off guard lmao at 32 minutes in theres a reference to fritz langs metropolis when the workers keep mordred going when i see his face he remind me of the hair cake isnt the flower a lily it would also make sense since the little girls name is lily edit at 010029 the voice when youre hurt is lilys voice also isnt it so are we playing as lily lmfao 918 i loved the nod to game grumps jack try this game five nights at jollibee jack the last button promp was different while the others were press these two together the last one was hold them just thought i would mention this since you asked about that jack pls play tabs first person mode you can now posses your units pls play aye jack u should play a game called deltarune or none as undertale 2 im gonna give jackoboy a hint to whats going on act for the crowd this is metropolis the 1920s film im your big biggest fan jack my name is brennen you can play an online game called shell shocker its a fun game jacksepticeye more lumber jack jack play more fnaf vr the voice sounds like tony toddhe played candyman play outer wilds 2144 reminded me a lot of metropolis 1927 those scenessets from about 2000 and onwards are a metropolis reference especially at 3137 interesting can you please say thespian not thezpian because it sounds like lesbian and im getting distracted what the heck r u trying to say at the beginning you should play blood and truth vr no one not a single soul irish people shesus english translation jesus your 2 spots away from the 69th most subscribed youtuber has anyone else thought that maybe youre one of the dummies it really change the way to see the game youre just a mannequin between a bunch other of the same episode 1 comment sectionanti anti anti anti anti episode 2 comment sectionmajoritywhat i sawjokes and references 3410 that was freaking brilliant 0 how they made the game mechanics work in this game is definitely a class act is your broken lamp still there just wondering jack maybe the two kids died horrifically jack straight after oooooh cards i bet this is another gruesome story like in the first layers of fear where the painter became so obsessed with the painting that he forgot about his wife and daughter and has alcohol problems 23033200 is a reference to the 1927 movie metropolis and if you like queen the band radio ga ga shows footage of the movie i have a new game idea for you its trberbrook the game won the german game award and is mostly done by a stop motion technic it looks really nice check it out lmao i cant sleep so time to watch jack at 3 am i thought the thumbnail said breasts in the dark lmao please bring back hitman 2 d hey jack they came out with a little nightmares mobile phone app game called very little nightmares its 699 im thinking of downloading it since i love little nightmares jack wheres the po box 133 the cunt 528 i recorded the reversed words and struggled to make out what it said something along the lines of hes here do you want the older kid is annoying like those people that carry on a joke even when its not funny anymore the good old intro 1329 right as jack said that an ice cream truck went by lol loving the metropolis vibes that the developers put into the game for some reason i read breasts in the dark my dear jacki really really enjoyed watching the first layers of fear lets play and im so sooo happy that youre playing the second onebut where i live the time you upload it is very lateand my mom turns off the wifi at 1200 pm socould you plzupload it a little bit sooner so i can at least download it and then watch it where two girls died horrifically hey carrots d 1320 i feel like it is an older girl lily and a younger brother whos named james nothing wrong with naming your daughter james though ryan reynolds older daughter is named james jack make a happy wheels season 2 lily and james potter to answer your question re being a role for months then snap thats a wrap and your life goes back to normal yeah it is super hard to go back to normal life i did this as a method actor where i played a medieval character lived in a tent in a field performed at weekends and some weekdays was surrounded by other people doing the very same returning to modern normal life from that was really stressful and highlighted how unnecessarily busy the modern world is everyone running around constantly being productive even beyond daylight hours when the contract ended and i no longer had that job i struggled immensely with the existential loss of a part of my self as well to all intents and purposes the end of that contract was the death of one of the many lives ive led i think had that contract not come to an end due to shady wheeling and dealing i might have found it less difficult to cope with the return to normal reality but as it was it was abrupt and unexpe 3436 jack top of the pa me top of the mornin to ya ladies jack the treasure was the friends we made along the way game nope its fish flashing chalice at the top of a heap of treasures me is this castle anthrax hey jack you should play outer wilds just came out and so far im having a blast and you might too u should try it im pretty sure that when the game goes to black and white it kind of turns into moviemode by that i mean its like a compilation of every moviecharacter that this actor has played but he has never been able to let go of them so sometimes these characters and the fictitious scenarios get mixed with his reality and he cant tell the difference between whats real and what isnt hope this makes sense it does in my head love the reference to the joke that joker makes at the end of the killing joke can you play sims 4 again its better and more updated new version jack can you play kindergarden 2 pls sub to me fanjack what do u call water that looks like lube jackstraight fucking water im laughing so hard right now as soon as jack says its hanging legs an ad for bacon pops up isnt it a little weird that jacks playing this game and having the discussion about the pressure of acting the day we hear about kit harrington and the issues hes having rn whens part 3 coming jack pley a plague tale act 2 the cunt xd you should play a vr game called blade and sorcery its like gorn but more realistic and there are more fighting styles that affect the game unlike gorn just a thing on web mmm mmm weeeeeee by the way its great here on the moon ms nancy act ii the cunt 910 is that widow maker xd i noticed has anyone mentioned that the deep voice is tony todd the actor that played the candyman 335 uh jack thats not what it says really game grumps reference lol i woke up had a popsicle in my mouth and i fired and i missed sean is this another story were i killed a family member and the two girls died somehow horrifically sean oh hey cards d 1319 10146 batman killing joke reference yassss ill shine the light across the gap and you can walk along the beam and join me how did i fall asleep during this i think the kids are stowaways and they are starving because they dont get rations of food so the have to steal it but because its under watch the keep getting chased by the guards monster and thats why they keep saying that theres something there jack found a peephole into his room and he isnt worried like wait someones been watching me while i sleep how was he not worried tbh i think you are the actor dealing with grief by making your friends and family out of dolls and stuff what if your a manaquin all along jack you can use the money to buy food anyway so just eat the money problem solved is no one gonna talk about how creepy that baby on the projector was the brother and sisters name are lilly and james that makes me uneasy is it me are does the deep voice sounds like candyman i find very strong elements of surrealism i dont know if any of these are inspired by dali why are jacks views so low this reminds me of bendy and the ink machine you should play a game called superbrothers sword sworcery ep amazing soundtrack good story and an art style to take you back to the old days the game is pretty old 8 years at this point but none the less you should check it out you know the girl older sister and the little boy i think its a boy that are like playing together i think that you are playing as the little boy oust in the future and what happened is that his older sister always played with him an made him use his fantasy in ways he never new then his older sister died i dont know how and he got depressed in his sadness he decided to become an actor like i dont know if that makes any sense but yea thats my theory i heard of a game in this genre where youre repeatedly walking down a hallway with subtle changes on each pass a radio is playing in the background narrating a spooky story suddenly he turned around i said turn around your little bitch juice paused my video the captain is a girl called lily and mr hardy is called james i wonder if that was why it showed the lily flower i believe its an older girl with a younger boy not two girls im not russian lol amazing jack im just surprised you dont jump as much as i do when jack said we could see someones little butt in this i hitted my hand on my earphones on of them came out and i said jack what the fuck hey jack could you do a video on grand theft auto 5 its gotten a lot of updates and i think you could do a lot of dumb crap in it they have mad max type vehicles a tank with a tesla coil cannon a military vtol osprey a military warthog and a flying car and bike they have doomsday bunkers and you can get a plane hangar in the military base so there are a lot of possibilities and dumb stuff you can do with those love the game grumps reference then i feel asleep woke up had a popsicle then i fired i missed 330 the hu the cut this is a really big boat lol any narrator with a deep voice jack its so cool i want that voice if you thinks the guys voice is deep you should hear noob saibots from mk11 has anyone reversed the audio at 524 jack please play marvel powers united vr you can even become spider man hi im new and my mom played this game and its really good and ur really funny those awkward moments when jack mistakes the little boy for a girl the deep voice guy sounds like candyman jack have i a murdered family member did those two little kids die horrificallyoooooh cards d your precious pewds has been overthrone by tseries i like the killing joke reference dreams into nightmares creepy boiler rooms a deep raspy voice things chasing you its nightmare on elm street il love your channel but can you please play a another game the saddest part about this is how hard lily is trying to play make believe with her little brother to keep his spirits up especially when things are clearly not going well jack should i put it to full puts the boat to full astern me facepalms i thought it takes after a movie seriously ive hear the dialogue what movie is it from im tryna think hi sean 2o here aka new septic but only 1 video so i want you to watch it and help me make more fun and long videos just like you do and ill see yall duds in the next video why theres creepy dolls in the elevator 6 of them jack is there any other questions i can ask me have you seen the jacksepticeye how did we get here comedy world tour do you have 90 minutes im just as lost as you are sean that game grumps reference tho watch my videos or il rip ur balls the deep voice in the game sounds like ron pearlman jack comes around corner whats that noise spoopy door repeatedly opens and slams implying theres something in there jack focuses purely on the flashy mannequin at the end of the hall that in the past hasnt hurt him at all oh god jack is shocked when something kills him while he stands directly infront of a demon door he can only see his shadow in the black and white world 2515 ignore this hi jack if you see this i have being watching you for a long time i loved your party hard game play i hope you can bring it back it would make me really happy but i must move on to different youtubers bye jack 426 here we go again im still waiting for jack to play bioshock play death standing for a second i thought the title said breasts in the dark and for a moment i thought wtf while i thought i had been learning how to live id been learning how to die is a lyric from the song learning how to die by jon foreman of switchfoot anti was in the first thumbnail idk why but i feel like this game is uninteresting i think its the gameplay of it feels too slow the story however is good jack can you play audica in vs its like beat saber but you shoot jack got a haircut btw sean just dy ur hair green again that dance the mannequins were doing is a reference to an old old movie they were operating the dials and valves flip trickster looks funny and i want you to play so i can laugh that narrator with the deep voice is the famous horror actor tony todd can we please have more beamng drive i miss it wheres tabs ive never hated mannequins this much the setting at 3226 is clearly a direct rip from the movie alien tons of the settings seem to be sets from various films throughout history i hope it becomes clearer why thats happening its a cool visual mechanic so collecting what i see from the game i agree with nikkalick on the majority of it but im thinking that the guy is going through his personal trauma and us as players have to find out the source of the trauma and its bringing in the voices of the children and the whole idea of acting and theatre i have a suspicion about the boy who plays pretend as mr hardy is who you play as in the game but you are trying to find out the reason as to what happened from their childhood to adulthood to possibly cause a loss of a career or loss of your life and i agree that the mannequins are different characters the protagonist acted as but regretted due to the personal issues that cling him to the past and possibly give depression to the present to have committed a possible suicide almost like the theory that plays around the fnaf ultimate custom night to where matpat mentions personal hell and the character is going through hell in limbo to seek the truth before passing on but thats a working 3rd shift watching on lunch at 2 in the morning in my truck in a darkened parking lot definitely freaky i got the geebees to go with my heebees metropolis references everywhere so cool shit i love the visuals in the game and jacks commentary but i dont have the guts for the scary stuff what do i do being a pussy is haaard i have a plug watch out jack 2019 my theory is that youre an actress who as a kid stowed away on a ship with her little brother the brother starved to death and you ended up eating him then later in life you worked with a crazy director who made you shoot someone with a real gun as part of a scene jack remember the hunter primal you should play that again 2816 that flower was probably a white lily considering the white petals and the 6 prominent red anthers one of the siblings we hear about was called lily so maybe this is a reference to her 913 then i fell asleep woke up had a popsicle and then i fired and then i missed i passed out again p 10530 a home is built on jokes and memes are you talking about your twitter home page xd 10312 is a poster of the black wanderer on the door jack escapes from the chasing mannequin man thing also jack sees a naked boy on all fours in some film 2 memes i spotted in the video do you know da wae i dont even know who you are at first i thought it said breasts in the dark and i was like scue me what sean getting scared by just loud sounds me welp you should not watch jacksepticeye channel then at 2531 thats the worker opening scene from the 1927 silent scifi film metropolis before this i have a fear of manikins now its worst definitely got the inside pulse wave vibes from the part with the fire as well jack play the nigt 4 and 5 in fnaf4 its a girl and boy not 2 girls not 2 boys completely unrelated but id like to see some borderlands 3 gameplay from jack when it comes out in september so i havent beaten this game but from what ive seen i think i have a theory of course i could be wrong but i just wanted to see what others thought there are two children an older sister named lily captain baynes and james mr hardy the two of them were stowaways on the boat we have seen in the previous episode notes about stowaways i dont think it was this boat though the notes about stowaways and missing food all seem to be from the past not the present in flashbacks we get to understand the children a little more in the first act the unmooring the whole set is about a ship and pirates i think the first act represents the two getting on the boat and hiding themselves inside the current act the hunt is them surviving on the boat having to scavenge for food and not finding any the scene with the dog is lily fighting for some food that is being eaten by a dog i couldnt see if the prompt did change and that jack did give up or not but the fact stil is he uploading twice a day again watch avenger civil war voice over with you as spiderman oh at around 2620 that whole section is a reference to the movie metropolis i just watched a couple a days ago so thats pretty neat seeing it influence things to this day the door at 5855 was similar to one of door from the hello neighbor the narrator sounds like claw from inspector gadget i love how when he was explaining how binaural audio worked the camera focused on his hand when he said mixes them together to make it seem like it was coming from your front xd yes that was fast thanks for the fast upload i remember the last episode made me think that the main character was one of the children and grew up to be an actor or the director and the movie is bringing back the memories of whats happening but im literally only two minutes into this episode so i dont know if my theory would change i also rewatched jacks playthrough of the first game and the voice was always that of the artistmain character so that could make it seem more possible that the character is the director or that its the actor and hes channeling all the other peoplevoices into whatever hes experiencing holy shit the narrator is tony todd anyone else miss antisepticeye like or comment if you miss anti w i really hope he makes an appearance in this series again in lof1 he did but that was on hallows not wanting to make jack do all that work but i do awfully miss the anti character only 1437 into the video saying this at 523 i think the inaudible voice is a voice but backwards if that makes sense play that backwards and see if it was backwards audio to me it sounds like that from the first word but im not too sure so give it a try fear the layers im pretty sure the little girls are stowaways and the actors maybe are the monsters hey guys im at school writing this like this if u went to skool i read the title as breast in the dark xd ya know i think jack is a very great guy recently my friends on ps4 told me to kill myself but my other friends and jack kept me going thanks for all you do jack the visual symbolic and metaphorical aspects of this game are making very little sense to me the original layers of fear usually had understandable connections between the supernatural events that would occur and the reason for them occurring in the protagonists insane perspective the events were almost always tied to a way the protagonist was feeling or something he was remembering they werent just random scares and nonsensical madness for the sake of it the presentation and delivery of this game just seems very clumsy to me you can never stop asking yourself what the hell is going on because none of it makes any sense and goddamn are they over relying on the mannequins they have already gotten very dull i really hope this game starts getting better soon because its really just making me miss the original game so far jack you could die in the first layers of fear im glad jack is back to his regular upload schedule of two vids a day he protecc he attacc but most importantly he got the horses in the bacc honestly its hard to be scared with jack playing his humor just kinda helps me laugh away the fear im not going to be able to sleep this one did get a little better i think it might get better as we go i hope that this game ends well jack 1 minute into the game hang on let me take a drink of my little btch juice lmao 3438 james charles basically if youre interesting in learning about method acting and stuff like that look up stanislavski and chekhov jackaboys back in the game i can see up your shorts by the way thats one way to talk to a kid i guess i think something bad might of happened to one or both of the kids and the actor was trying to go back in time to prevent it from happening 2040 i walk into that room i would have walked out closed the door and said fuck that and give that a big ol finger i want to see old jack what if this is just about a guy whos on some stuff seeing shit play scpcontainment breach the voice acting is really good i like it then again i also liked the voice acting in the first game too however the voice acting is better sounding here and really pulls you into each moment as well as into the mind of the person thats speaking oliver tree welcome to la audio 000 231 that voice actor getting vortigaunt flashbacks the alex vance her condition is grave between 2520 to 3143 it reminded me of the movie metropolis from 1927 this is bc you left the tap on 3131 ripped straight from that german movie metropolis 1927 homage or plagiarism i cant tell you did a good job today comments section jack oh i like that one the screen reads the hunt jack in a deep voice the cunt welcome to layers of fear 2 where jack rambles a lot about the video game graphics this definitely in one of the childrens perspectives and im guessing the lack of food leads to munching on a human is it just me or is jacks outro music getting louder first it was straight fuckin dirty bean water next it was childrens tears after that it was cocacola zero sugar the same great coke taste with a hint of added vanilla then it was septic juice now its bitch juice so when are these going to join the cloak family part of my theory is that the two kids are stowaways but in their imagination they think theyre pirates hiding on a ship my evidence is that the gaurd who wrote the his logging hours he thought he saw something like a kid but never investigated it and broke his torch because he was started by them another piece is that they were the ones stealing the food because they werent supposed to be there havent watched sean in about a year pleased to see he now looks like a badass viking love the hair and beard turn it up a little bit regarding 3500 discussion about method actors and the resulting craziness jack what youre talking about i would compare to postpartum depression seasonal depression or even just the after party blues theres nothing wrong with explaining someones behaviour providing an explanation and giving an excuse are two very different things as someone with multiple neural health conditions depression epilepsy to name two i can tell you that explaining is good its fine excuses are the problem thats when you get people using mental health as a tool to manipulate and use others the flower you picked up was a lily in some places they are used in funerals and are commonly associated with death its even said that lilies symbolize souls of those who have departed and have received restored innocence after death jackdo you not have screens on your window 1305 jack you should play mechanic miner jack key boi my danganronpa fanboy ass chuckles chaotic evil more like chaotic mutual but what ever hey in case anyone would be interested the sections at 2143 until 3200 are big references to metropolis by fritz lang 1927 great movie in todays episode jack walks into a stage production of metropolis its lily and james potter i lowkey think we need another drum cover from this irish lad girlyou build one character you destroy the other me jack and the egos can relate and then i fired again i hit something but it wasnt what i was aiming for so i guess i missed 5422 jack i cant believe youve done this me an intellectual instantly remembers vine and laughs for a good 5 minutes i love how jack doesnt do youtube for money really or fame he does it for the community alright theirs enough negativity in the world so my tip of the day is to tell someone to have a nice day or evening spread the pma thank you for reading this hey jack today i had to make a irish beef stew for a school feast i really like the graphics of this game and i cant wait to see what exactly is happening jackkk we want antii i ment the aywoki you should play more of the ayoki will u die ur hair green and wear the cap or hat for thos who dont know wat a cap is like if u remember the og days when you play alien isolation again how does he not get yet that the 2 kids are stowawaysthey stopped being able to get food because they were stealing it before they noticed that the food was missing and then they started locking it up more securely and rationing it kami damn it either the people that made this game needs to be entered into a mental hospital or be given a fucking award i literally felt my heart race while jack was playing this i swear if the person who created this game didnt get an award then thats fucked up i have played multiple horror games myself and watched some horror movies but none of the horror games has as much detail as the game the jack is playing of course i watched and played horror gamesmovies before i got my youtube account did anyone else catch that the blackboard that said the killing joke was actually a batman reference the joke at the end of that comic is about two people escaping from an insane asylum over the rooftops and one suggests that they shine a light over the side to use it as a bridge immediately after jack reads that blackboard he runs over a spotlight thats making a bridge i think he went too fast to notice it the kids were stowaways the security people locked up all the food and someone ordered half starved dogs to hunt down whoever was stealing the food the big sister will end up giving up her life to save her brother you you are now an adult and the crazy director is putting you through all this to help you become the character he wants you to play in his movie damn i hope im wrong because thats all so sad the jumbled up word on the chalkboard is research what is a machine for pigs correct me if im wrong but is the actor dude we are playing as the same one that requested a painting from the dude from the first game and he got upset when the painter painted him as how he truely looks aka that creepy af painting we see 522 and so on think it would be a cool way to tie the two together who thought mannequins were a good idea to put into this game cause it is not a good idea also its an older sister and a younger brother jack most people in horror movies whats thatgets scared and runs jack ooooo look at thisyou look coolare you sadwhats that gets scared and yells while running itll never find me here continues to talk about game while hiding i saw anti first time i saw him 4220 where i then paused and went frame by frame when the screen starts distorting look at the bottom youll see three versions of jack the first two are definitely recent but the last one may be older it has no beard as far as i can tell and green hair n the last one second time 4653 where i paused and went frame by frame before you reach the door white static will appear on screen which wouldnt even have existed in this time period white static is for digital pixels not the kinds of photos they used then so that rules out the white static being in the game originally on the bottom left is a vertical row of static at the top of the row is a small but clear picture of jack it may be older im not sure i dont see a beard so it could be older hes appeared melded into the background multiple times in the same glitchy area as 4653 my suggestion for finding him find the thing that catches yo explanation ship is possessed all the explanation we need right there 523 1 this here do you want it 2 no sir thats what was reversed so those two girls have stowed away on this ship while playing their little game lily is loosing herself to a role shes made for herself and thats why the watch saw a child and the food is going missing 4654 the prowler theme obviously dog was worth as much if not more because mommy dog evil voice jack needs to get that demon out of his throat chaos chaos edit the dislikes were eyes not septiceye remember when you did skate 3 you should play it again there were some references to movies as well the lighter in the vent could be die hard there was a had coming out of the chest of a mannequin shortly before that in the sci fi sequence which could be a chestburster the black and white area with the mannequins operating those machines reminded me so much of the early 1900s scifi movie metropolis not sure how many people will get this possible reference but i figured id point it out anyway jackkkkkk you should check out candle the power of the flame if its on steam its a good puzzle kinda game jack they need to have actual threats gets killed by threat also jack this is bullshit what the hell is going on in this game still waiting for spiderman dlcs 523 i put it in reverse and all i could hear was this year do u want the soup hey jack i miss your old hat a home is built of coffee and creams hey jack do whats pornohub to me the voice sounds like vin diesel im watching jack and delirious play it the kids names are lily and james hmmmm potter maybe im wrong but the hanging legs seem a mannequin costume to me maybe in the movie there were people dressed like mannequins and real ones idk just guessing and the director was playing with this thing making actors kill real people until the kids get involved someway probably killed by the director for being stowaways revealing is true sick nature jack the younger child is a boy the girl calls him little brother you are the boy i think your sister died okay venom fucking calm down i know youre edgy but jesus uh oh hes on a horror game spree again i think the hole in the wall peeking into your room is the meaning that actors may feel like theyre always being watched hey jack kindergarten 2s demo is finnaly out go try it out yourself like for him to see jesus christ on a scooter i totally shit myself jack you must play return of the obra din hi my name is hunter jack plays horror game jack aww look at their butts at 2500 it really reminds me of the movie metropolis 1927 directed by fritz lang the whole thing is probably based on the movie hopefully jack sees this its a pretty famous movie and it might be easier to google it to get the story but basically its about slave workers rising up and revolting against the dictator who forced them to build the city metropolis as well as the sheltered son of this dictator learning about the dark elements of the city and siding with the people against his father one of the iconic scenes in the movie is where the workers who slave to build the city are metaphorically fed to the machine it takes on a face and literally swallows them up the elevator descending into the underground city with the square buildings is from the movie as well the workers use the elevators every day and they drudge along in a mechanical fashion i think the mannequins are mirroring that i think thats why you see the mannequin standing next to the clock as w layers of fearrrrrrrrrr then i fired again i hit something but it wasnt what what i was aiming for so i guess i missed i was all out of bullets and then i got sad i fell asleep i woke up had a popsicle then i reloaded and then i fired but then i missed really big metropolis restored vibes yesterdays episode ego hintsreferences everywhere todays episode regular letsplay me im confused upon him dying again this year u think anti will come back 2 so my theory is that the actor was james and that he and his sister were stowaways when they were younger and when they grew up they became actors thus the female voice in the first episode saying i support you or something like that but since the sister was better at the imagining stuff she became the better actress and got good roles and our main guy got envious connecting to the note jack found saying that mr hardy wants to be like captain baynes and killed his sister thats my guess iv been watching way to many if your videos because when you said where does the plug go in my head i was thinking in your ass xd 3608 yeah method acting is actually really dangerous for your mental health its recommended to never fully method act ive heard stories of actors who have become really depressed and even suicidal after a certain role because of method acting crazy stuff me physically cannot wait for next episode of lof2 also me it here revisited jacks older videos with his fluffy green hair and small beard he looked adorable and like a kid but now with this new hair and beard he looks like a gladiator thats such a cool effect i dont like it is that a compliment or an insult 2850 just another day at the factory we should have a counter how many times jack has said im 14 and thats deep so far in the series can you bring back happy wheelsplease part 4 of fnaf vr this has such a metropolis feel to it spoilers about layers of fear 1 it wasnt that the painter killed his wife in fact its the opposite in both endings she ended up taking her life due to the accident that scarred and disfigured herself she couldnt bare to see herself anymore and despised any previous photos and paintings of her because she felt like she was garbage compared to them and that her husband cared more about them than her in the ending where you collect all the work based items it shows the painting failing to be like it was meant to be a true depiction of her and thus it came to life to torment him further but when you finish it and collect all the family based items it comes out properly and he realizes his obsession led to him being stuck in this hell of his for so long thus deciding to burn everything down as a means to an end i like how at 2145 to 3156 the scene changes to the factoryliving quarters scene from metropolis 1927 a great reference to a great science fiction movie jackwhat the fuck was that aggressively sips water 1140 yes how did we get here and do you have 90 minutes you play some bad ass games i think youre a mannequin too jack i think the two little kids are stowaways remember how earlier in the game you found a note from the ship crew saying how they had a problem with stowaways in the past and that the captain says that there better not be any on board this time or theres gonna be repercussions and that they will have to send them back where they came from plus the way the girls are talking they sound like theyre hiding from the ships crew whenever they come down to inspect the lower decks plus they mention looking for food to eat and not finding any because they are hiding so presumably below deck and that the food rations are being guarded and handed out in portions to the passengers jack one is named lily and the other is james 103 i dont even know who you are lily she is the older sister playing pirates with her younger brother james pretty sure that they are stowaways based on conversation in your first part 341 seems rather obvious now doesnt it no how were you to know you only had 1 data point before chapter 1 with only 1 data point the set could fall in anywhere keep going 644 what it appears that you are being hunted like the title of this chapter hinted at good luck 1002 i didnt freak out you freaked out shut up i saw nothing looks innocent 1052 why is everything in black and white right now i have a theory you are walking through memories in your mind of the time you were onboard the ship filming a movie remember the beginning the ship was sinking all of this came before that kind of a titanic theme which is good and bad at the same time 1139 are there any more questions that i can ask always questioning concepts and ideas 4659 im literally laughing so much his reaction since i watched gab finish layers of fear 2 on twitch i have to say that im not as intrigued by the game as i was when jack uploaded his first episode im not going to spoil anything but i will say that im curious to see if his ending differs from hers there is more than one im also eager to watch jacks overall evaluation even if he dislikes a game i always find myself captivated by the way he gives his opinion on games movies etc ps holy shit that was tony todd when i couldnt find his name tied to the game at first i just assumed i was mistaken the outros have gotten a lot louder you can barely hear the in the next video anymore but its fine i suppose just a thing i noticed the poor rats what they ever do to you huh nothing yea thats what i thought and so i feel bad for da rat fam do toxicity by system of a down on the drums my theory is that the actor and actress are actually james and lily the children on the ship were following their turmultous escape to america where they planned to go to hollywood to become movie stars lily convinced her little brother james to stowaway since they didnt have money for it like pirates maintaining the captain bayne and quartermaster bit to keep him calm but because they were so good at hiding and the head security officer was growing more and more paranoid the food supplies were dwindling faster than expected both because the kids were eating them and because of improper storage as suggested haunted by their past the actor or actress d hate ships as mentioned in the first episode because of that horrifically traumatic experience where they literally had to kill people like the guy in the bathtub to steal food and to get away before finally making their big break now that the main character is back on a boat and isolated as instructed by the security i love fraggle rock omg im glad there are ppl who still remember it lol 914 gamegrumps i fired and i missed reference lol i want to see bhd play this 1921 i believe i can flyyyy 4034 literally made me squeal flinch and jump a little jack thank you for helping me find the love of my life no context needed theres no point in having money if you cant live without it by someone ive forgotten was that baby thing the dog that someone order 4710 and i been watching scary game all day and i didnt get scared of it so i just rewatched your doki doki literature club playthrough for the 3rd time and id love to see you play it again and go for different endings maybe in a stream if you dont think another series is a good idea but i think it would be great anyone agree god i can hear what u hear with my earphones hey jack i have a game for yu pocket morty its a rick and morty game love the metropolis by fritz lang reference xd can resarcht be a name imma need yall to explain this to me do you have ninety minutes something about the fish being seen as gold or something maybe they were tricked into thinking there was gold there mat pat we need you jack in fnaf vr that switch that turns everything creepy let you access more content like the 5th night in fnaf 1 2 and 3 a good example 3600 is kit harington can you bring back antisepticeye i read the title as beats in the dark what if the food on the ship was either rotten or poisoned because of the rats so the crew of out desperation decided to cook the dogs and maybe even the kids nobody would miss a bunch of dogs and two stowaways now thats horrible has anyone else noticed how things are already tying together in the last episode a female character mentions him killing her later jack had made it to a room with a gun infront of him he picked up the gun and was told to shoot somebody there were two people one having a hat that men during the time period wore and the other wearing a womens hat he shot the one wearing the womens hat jack what the fuck is happening also jack sips bitch juice game lily and james jack so its either two boys or two girls sean they are one girl and one boy one is lily and the other james from what i can tell is they are brother and sister who may have come from an orphanage or a bad home and escaped and stowed away on a ship to make their choice seem okay they are pretending to be pirates the kids are starting to go hungry from not eating food from what i can tell then the crew discovered who has been making problems on the ship which are the two kids the kids are afraid if they are found they will be sent back but from what i gather if they are caught the crew will punish them harshly for stowing away so we are playing as james who as a boy pretends to be mr hardy and lily pretends to be the captain i believe as they grew up lily always got james into bad or dangerous situations and dealing with these harsh situations by pretending to be different people instead of facing reality but i think that something went wrong and the acting became james reality and he killed his sister while filming horror game idea youre a dog while your owner is way in a haunted house no shit we are not in kansas jack please take the tape off your chair its not pleasing to see at all i like to look at shadows sweating on the wall why does he look constipated is it just me or does main character actor secretly a werewolf jack the older one is lily and the younger one is james sister and brother lol play hard time again they have an update brotha 057 you said that you the game didnt show much about the story but so far i think you play as an actor amd the voices you hear is your olderother characters you played in your career before and they try to tell you that you left them and you are born to only act as them this might be a big nonsense but this is what i got so far when he said act two he said the cunt not the hunt hey jack kindergarten 2 in coming out pretty sure this is a coincidence but theres a tom hardy whos a method actor and the little boy is continuously being called mr hardy and theres a continuous theme of a method actor dont be shy step into the light is the voice tony todd did i just hang this poor mannequin can i put this in the bath stark contrast between rooms i have a headache but i dont care i need this in my lifethis is my strange addiction jack candy man candy man jack 913 i fired and i hit something but it wasnt what i was aiming for so i guess i missed i so want to create a game once i know how to do so itll have horror adventure humor cause i like a laugh when i get surprised and a touching ending that would wrap everything up nicely like a good story should lol bro i got a great infomercial its full crystal full exterior please see this jack no one literally no one sean blood or piss no one knows lmao jse are there any more questions i can ask jse community i dont know do you have 90 minutes am i supposed to be this proud im having a hard time staying invested in this game it just seems so bland to me the story is too far and few if it wasnt jack i would have given up watchin this game looks like it takes inspiration from georges mlis when it comes to the look of the sets and an alfred hitchcock film for the overall tone of the game if thats the case then good job developers jack play the other dark rooms in fnaf vr they change and get scarier also you get secret levels and extra nights by flipping the switch on the desk that fucking sound is freaky jack says i say which one has anyone here saw me comment prob not the ship looks a bit like the voyager of despair map in call of duty do not become sad again my boy please for me play ravenfield again there are so many new things you have to check it out the virtruvian mannequin genius well sen you wanted something to chase you in the last game wowie i misread that as breasts in the dark can you tell people to subscribe my name timthesavage every one must play their part that sentence gives me chills down my spine its so good wat makes me mad is people hatin on you is stupid turn your fuckin tv or phone down jack is great he helps me through alot he is perfect and amazing just the way he is and he knows it all yall people mad cuz he is better than yall how many acts do you need to be entertained how many layers do you need to complete your set how many layers of cake do you need how many plates will you serve so heres my thoughts either the two little girls trapped on a boat is part of this play or its real in the story like i have a feeling that the director is the artist from the first game cause he says only one can play this role maybe the actor in this one has issues and so hes put through all this stuff to see if hell go insane jack the meaning of the giant mouth is um ok im not even gonna act like i know what the fuck is happening what if this game is based on the anxieties and stress of the character you play as thatd be neat suggestion horrortale its actually more of a teaser game related to the comic the artist is making but id love to see your reactions to it x3 the games maker is actually making a new game of horrortale and that one is going to be an actual game in my understanding but its still a work of progress x3 the teaser really isnt that long so if you could fit in one of those x games in one video or something x3 thank you x3 i would love if you brought anti into this beating in the dark play this game jse house party hey go sub to my channel plz and then i fired and then i fired and then i missed i missed both times why does this remind me of little nightmares at minute 3500 i imagine thats how heath ledger felt before the end listening to jack call an obvious boy a girl for nearly the entire video was so ridiculous like how in the world did the young child sound like a girl to him it was clearly a boy not to mention the older sister called him mr hardy even if thats just his characters name she still said mr and not ms it literally took seeing the name james to finally realize it was a boy typical jack when is he going to realize that the word characters doesnt have a second h so i was trying to come up with a name for the dear and im quite content with dilly doe am i the only one who remembers screw you afro dude jack chapter 2 the hunt me wait it just sounded like jack just said cunt the two kids a boy james and a girl lily are stowaways on the ship they steal food to survive but the crew noticed the chief of security took drastic measures to keep the food under lock and key and the kids started running out of food while the guards were trying to catch them i dont know what that thing that james saw is though it looks like the kids killed somebody as well i have the beginnings of a theory i believe that the player character was a method actor and for the particular role alluded to ingame he got so into it that his mental health was negatively affected i think he was slowly losing sanity while trying harder and harder to get into his perfect role and eventually he got so into it that in the name of realism he replaced blank bullets with real ones to shoot a scene he didnt realize that was a bad idea and ended up shooting and killing a fellow actor i think the mannequins may be important because he was talking to them believing they were real while he was getting into his role or he affixed the killed colleagues personality on them or something like that anyway thats all ive got right now feel free to add to it and thanks for reading edit i think the mannequins represent his attempted escape route or just the actions he took after the murder maybe he fled into the lower parts of the ship and ran into the maybe since the food was running out and probably other things were going on in the ship the older girl lily invented or took a story and roles so the little boy james wouldnt be so scared and could keep going in those tough times since theyre pretending to be these brave characters they have to play the part and be brave too he uploaded 2 videos in one day again xd nobodys mentioning the huge influence of metropolis seen in this episode smh so neat ok imma be honest why the thumbnail of this vid look like an ali a video im getting dissociative personality disorder vibes from this game you should play baba is you i see update i click i hit like i want high 5 jack you should get a creator code for fortnite 1 likejack getting a creator code for fortnite what is the mannequins are not mannequins but rather they are the other people that were on the ship but have now been turned to mannequins or turned to stone and so on like they have been turned into something and they cant move and when the daemon appears where there is a mannequin they turn in fear its a long shot i know tbh i dont even know what this game is about but it was just a thought the game constantly reminds you that your on a boat you should do more vacation simulator like those two kids are going to die horrifically ohh carrots lol that phantom guy is really poetic something horrifying happens sean sip thunk okay byeeee why did i watch this at 2am you never killed a family member in layers of fear you were a starving artist whose wife was burnt in a fire and killed herself then you went nuts and your daughter was taken from you the sequel you played the daughter returning to the house jack you can play slime rancher in vr did anybody else get a silent hill 4 vibe at 1633 i almost expected a rabbit on the bed i feel like the first game was better it actually creeped me out quite a bit whereas this one im just like ok its a good game but i wish it were scarier just watching this makes me scared cant even imagine how scared id be playing it i get so paranoid watching scary things like i feel the need to turn the lights on and stuff just to be sure haha hey jack im almost certain that somebody else has pointed it out but that deep gravelly voice you keep hearing is the unmistakable voice of the iconic horror actor tony todd aka the candyman himself perhaps better known to slightly younger people as bludworth the mortician from the final destination series i love that they got him to do the voice of the director in this game cant wait to see more of you playing it why does the little girl sound like peppa pig jack sees rotten flesh eat it all the kids are doing it 1128 into the twilight zone we go man i love how a bit of this game was dedicated to the movie metropolis brought back some memories a home is built on jokes and memes jack 2019 the music on one of the parts of the video it sounded like the song from the silent hill movie maybe its a little like split heshe has all these different characters and personalities and heshe was the monster that these kids were running from and now heshes running from hisher self in fnaf vr if you flip the switch on the desk in the lobby on the screen only one night for every mode will appear i have a theory and i think the kids might represent inspiration and love for ones craft and with depression and such they go hungry or something like that i get way to much joy in watching you be terrified and creeped out lol scary as fuck you should play paint the town red again i bet some of the new levels are sick jack can you please bring back beat sabor sean i always love your vids i finaly memorized the 20 counties of ireland is it just me or does the boat theme remind you of little nightmares honestly if you disliked this video log off and go to sleep wake up and think about why you did come back and like it did you trim your beard let me know no one actually no one literally no one ever me how big that boat tho casual gg reference but of a great joke they made ah yes grumps reference fired and i missed had a popsicle one of my favorites 914 that cheap death with the door was because you werent paying attention the door swung open and closed when you walked up to it and were too busy staring down the hall to see what was there you didnt notice the door slamming open and the thing coming out that one jackaboy is on you jack a game i think you would really enjoy is outer wilds its very similar to no mans sky and subnautica are u ever gonna go back and complete hello neighbor come home to see another episode of layers of fear start the video and a glorious thunder storm breaks out jack horror game and spooky weather could it get better than this been waiting for this all day and just saw it now it literally took 4 hours for the notification to come up that first half was all a giant refrence to the 1927 film metropolis possibly the most famous silent film of all time jacksepticeye looks alot like greg bryk joseph the father seed from far cry 5 no one when your in a cave in minecraft 1543 i dig the shameless game grumps plug jack i got it dont you worry just dont miss again did you know the sonic movie was going to be delayed jacky be the running man hi jack you r my fav youtuber can you sub to my channel plz thanks hii have a youtube channel and i think it would be dope if you guys subscribe to mei will subscribe back jack i enjoyed watching the 2 part to this and the ist one so you are to be commended for them thanks for the caring and kindness that youve done for everyone talking about people dying in 1st layers of fear oh hey cards i love hoq he shifts emotions so quickly like he talks about killing family members and then oh hey cards heres a theory that has a ton of holes in it he doesnt see other people on the ship because he is going through being all the character on the ship one at a time the voices he hears are other characters that he has been or will be maybe he hears thier voices at certain points where the different characters paths would intersect i dunno would be neat tony todd know that voice anywhere i didnt realize there was a sequel of layers of fear tony todd as the narrator how to make a fucking horror masterpiece 101 add one of the best horror voices of the 90s into a 2019 game cant get much better the scariest part of these horror games is when the screen goes black and i see my reflection im reminded of the film the wrestler as the main character spoilers for those that havent seen it basically became his own wrestler persona and killed his real self at the end of the film i wish u got back to the happy wheels series okay heres my theory about whats going on the young voices we hear are an older sister named lily captain baynes and a younger brother of james quartermaster they escaped onto this boat to run away whatever bad was happening at home abusive family this is why the information about stowaways being forbidden was important because it gives us the context we need to know that these kids are in serious danger if they get caught another important piece on info is when our main characters agent mention that they hate the ocean i think this is because our main character was the younger brother and he is reliving the trauma of hiding on this boat right now im starting to connect the actingtheatre part of the game with the story of the children you can remember that a lot of the movie sets weve seen have beenbased around a pirate ship this is because of how james was forced to act like a pirate by his sister yes forced because from the audios we can hear that jame anyone else think the narrator sounds just like tony todd actor from the horror movie candyman in my opinion for a surface scan of the plot someone wants immortality at least thats how it seems to me with all these talks of roles and vessels act 2 the cunt dang jack making me scream its a girl and her younger brother the music sounds like its from silent hill but a bit reworked hmmm i hate horror game but yet i watch this take it easy it is summer im so confused what the story is this time anyone wanna explain it to me so far jack go to marks new vid theres a hard mode in fnaf when u flip the nuclear switch and go into a level there is night 5 is it me or does the one guy that talks sound like the actor who plays in the horror movie candyman lol either way not a bad game so far the sentence you were looking for jack is it doesnt excuse the behavior but it explains it the game is heavily inspired by old movies and the big machinary with the clock is from metropolis from 1927 the siblings on the ship is lily and james and they are stowaways on the ship and the flower you found was a lily the childrens names are liiy and james so theyre brother and sister jesus that demon spawn child walking on four legs my theory i think you are either the girl or the kid probably the last one you are remembering who you are where you came from you forgot it during the process of becoming an actor you lost yourself and this is the path of dicovering who you truly are thats why in the picture your face comes all messed up because you have no idea who you are after acting as so many people and trying to forget your past aparently when you were a kid you and your sister to run from poverty hid inside the boat the girl told stories to the kid asked him to act as a pirate so that they could survive while pretending to play a game meanwhile the crew finds out about the food missing and the kids started to starve thats where the second recording comes lose your humanity and eat the rat or keep searching for food i havent played the 3rd chapter yet but until now i think this is the story i wonder if the kid did something to his sistercos im sure he lost his humanity at some poi that thing on the board doesnt say characters there is only one a because if you look at the jumble it is reschartch with only one a and heres the timestamp just so you know i didnt just remove the a 129 i came back from a live tour do you have 90 minutes you mess with the well and fall into freddy krugers nightmare worldat least thats what it reminds me of talking about how depressing it is to come back from tour kinda relates to the audience too whenever i have concerts im always so down for like a week after and i get post concert depression bc theres always that risk that ive just seen one of my idols and i may never see them again ok can someone give me updates on whats happening with anti on the jse variety channel where they always two boys then james n lily yeah makes sense x is that vin deasil narrator w e l p guess i wont be sleeping this night dio was there in the end marty im scared jack and horror games are great together jack if you are kinda confused about the character apparently from what i read you must be playing the guy from the first layers of fears daughter from what i understand grown up my room door slammed shut by itself 837 where jack says i dont like this so jack clearly hasnt grasped this not trying to be mean this is for him and anyone else confused the two children he keeps hearing the ones calling themselves captain and mr hardy theyre stowaways on the ship they were stealing food but the people on the ship noticed food was going missing so they monitored it better rationed it and kept guards stationed at the storage so it became impossible for the girls to eat which is why they are searching so desperately for food whenever jack says the hunt i hear the cunt as a performer myself i can say that after finishing a role the character doesnt leave you easily you run through the routine and their lines and everything you know about them in your head you miss them was watching this at night while there was a huge storm outside i have many regrets but at the same time i have none the voice ma kinda reminds me of vin diesel so the two kids were stowaways on this ship with a crazy dude who was shooting a movie and who was deformed in a fire maybe so he couldnt be an actor anymore so he directed movies and the boat started running out of food so they started being stingy with food and the kids were starving and also there were dogs on the ship hungry dogs and the boy maybe died idk what if the kids you hear is the guy youre playing now as a child with his sister who has died and this whole thing is just him filming and trying to recreate what they went trough as a child and that he would be traumatized or something from it idk but this is the theory and vibe im getting from it maybe its even the same boat idk the primary theme seems to be a metropolis 1927 movie reference the workers move in a robotic way because theyre a part of the machine which must be kept running for the sake of progress it doesnt matter if their lives are lost in the process workers are expendable cycling in new ones as fresh sacrifices the mannequins are actively torn apart to represent those themes thats why the machine takes on the appearance of moloch a demon associated with child sacrifice older child calls the younger one mister hardy jack its two girls older child calls the younger one james jack visible confusion i want the outro music in 8d thatd be sick i just wanna know if theres anti in these videos hint play disney movies in the background it makes it less scary thats the only reason i survived the video happy cheese is a happy life sup bro something is incredibly wrong here theres someone else here no thats not possible theres no going back now play the part beasts in the dark now the titles from his observation series plus the title of these videos form some sort of connection but the title of this vid doesnt really fit in my opinion it just rhymes what do you guys think he calls the children girls when isnt one of them a boy the younger one i love how the lights on his face are on the opposite sides than whats shown in the background i know its probably the green screen being used but i think it adds a nice effect gives it a bit if atmosphere ya know 1319 talks about murder 1324 hey cards 3214 you didnt leave kansas but youre going to see it its in the game the main character is the actor following the method and struggling to become the best actor for his role chased by the director and his thoughts jack my son 2 years old love watching your video jack i dont think that huge structure is a musical i think its a reference to metropolis a sci fi film in the 1930s it had a huge set that looked like that which was called the ziggurat and employed hundreds of extras to work in the background oof whatever happend to green hair and a flat cap did you see my comment on the first part you would play dark decption 3 chapters are out and i would really love you play it edit fun fun fun fun fun fun fun sean the fucking ads on this vid is too much calm

anyway ones a boy eh the future is melded by the hands of our dreams and the determination of our imagination 1735 close the door your letting the heat out but werent you just wanting to get rid of it please play the darwin project its free and on xbox and pc d love the metropolis reference loving the two videos a day jack keep up the good work i dont think the word on the back of the board spells

saying those two girls but the older one keeps calling the younger one mrhardy the little one could be a girl i really dont know but i think the older one is a girl and the younger one is a boy edit i

734th comment i think the deep voice guyis tony todd from candy man i recognize that deep voice isnt that the voice of the vortigaunts from hl2 i really liked the first game but somehow this second one makes me bored i am really watching expecting more but i mean i think it is not enjoyable at all it doesnt make me on edge or not catching my attention it is really cheap and annoying even if the visuals are good jack hold up i need to hydrate drinks lilbitch juice out of cunt mug me ive drank too much of that stuff already well im not sleeping tonight lol i was comparing the pulse in this

with a house rabbit incase he decides to boop your heel scaring the fluff out of you also the bit 2525 3151 is from fritz langs metropolis its during the scene were freder goes underground to the machine that powers the city only to hallucinate that the machine is a moloch that the working class are sacrificed to he then trades places with a worker whos job is moving the hands of a giant clock back and forth its scary but so cool the little kids voice reminds me of bo from pinstripe when are you going to do another subnautica video 4658 was the best xd 3529 yeah just like kit harrington the person who played jon snow in got he is right now in a clinic for rehab etc mainly because he didnt took the litteral end of the series that well i thought it was a boat n it goes down so far nearly 7 min in and already got scared its lily and james a boy and a girl jack you wouldve had time to react if you were watching where you were going the monster was on the other side of the door but you walked up to it without looking at it because you were too busy having a staredown with the thing at the other end of the hallway love the metropolis reference i think the whole mannequin machine sequence is in reference to the original metropolis film with what he is talking about at 3600 is so accurate kit harrington is a recent example of someone who was so engrossed in a role that when it finally ended he sought help to get back to himself after playing jon snow for so long idont think its two girls it think the younger one is a boy a home is built of jokes and memes jacksepticeye2019 game a house is built of walls and beams also game a home is built of fears and dreams jack a home is built of jokes and memes they arent two girls its an older sister and her younger brother the deep voice reminds me of candymanin fact it is tony todd awesome casting i love the layers of fear series thx jack for playing it jack are there anymore questions i can ask me do you have 90 minutes me maybe he should try the room yeah its a mobile game but itd be fun to see him try the puzzles also me watching him keep missing stuff internal screeching and the boat would sink that day due to jack leaving every sink on haunting titanic storytime with jacksepticeye jack where do i go sees creepy kid sitting on top of the wardrobe and a spooky well leading to his demise jack looks at wardrobe creepy kid kicks wardrobe jack turns around well well well 1915 the jumpscare was so scary it knocked the quality of the video all the way down to 144p at that exact moment i love it when jack uploads it makes me so happy to watch his vids he may not get this but im happy to watch his vids jacksepticeye acts like harry lyme from the wet bandits in home alone at 426 i thought he was gonna end it with here we go again jack its a painting come to life ohhh never mind its dead sub to me bossevening135 you should play deadly premonition i missed both times he dont protecc hell most likely attacc most importantly is anti really back hey can you ever play resident evil 4 this whole video was just jack being like thanks i hate it who wants jack to play kindergarten 2 if i had a dollar for every time it rained in ireland i would just have one dollar because it never fookin stops jacksepticeye a couple years ago idk i dont keep track please do more we happy few that would be great the audio is phenomenal yo i never thought i would be so hooked on a game like this the first game was definitely more obviously coherent i think you got a fairly good idea of the main thing with the painter fairly quickly and other details were filled in as you went along this game so far youve got the actor thing and youve got the kidsfood thing but aside from the kids seemingly playing at the roles of the captain and mr hardy theres no readily apparent connection between the two running themes im sure itll all fall into place in due course but it feels a bit disjointed so far still enjoying it though jack i was going through some of your old videos and i would like you to play turbo dismount again i love all those videos and think you are really funny keep it up 908 that game grumps reference though jack those two girls died somehow horrifically hey cards jacksepticeye you need to play white enamel it should be fun horror game for you looks like someones coming down with a case of pink eye i know how that feels it sucks the littele boy is ron weasley wit scabbers 25203200 homage to metropolis silent movie from 1927 very good scifi and i highly recommend it 910 that game grumps reference killed me lol the whole part with the big machine you walked into in the end the elevator the city below and the thing with the numbers reminded me of the movie metropolis please dont stop making video jack your awesome the guy narrating the films sounds like little finger from got sean mclochlan aka jacksepticeye died on june 26th 2018 and his twin brother shawn mclochlan took over as the new jacksepticeye straight after his death my theory is that the character youre playing is an actor who is either trying to get or has a role in this weird directors movie we know that the director has been said to put his actors through quite a bit to find the perfect one for his films to help build their characters i think that the director is the voice youre hearing when youre in the safe room or watching one of the film reels as for the little kids my guess is that you are james the little boy and you used to be a stowaway on a ship like this one with your older sister lilly until the food ran out and you were caught most likely resulting in your sisters death the monster that you keep seeing could be a crewmate that found the two of you and chased you through the ship basically the game is you travelling through your own memories much like the the first lof except this time its because you are preparing for a role in this movie set on the ship and that is bringing up your past as you build y jack then i fired and i missed and then i fired and i fired and i missed missed both times me hahah nice reference jack nice gamegrumps reference 913 to the creepy dude jack i can see up your shorts by the way i too saw hunt and immediately thought of the c word sean and i would be good friends who else noticed the game grumps reference at 912 and then i fired and i missed me me jksjsksksksk thank you for bringing back this gem sean doctor you have one hour nine minutes and fifty six seconds left to live me there are 3 different endings to this jack so your choices do matter pick wisely i really like the look of this game i cant wait for the next episode i love how he blames the game for his own stupidity n o o f f e n s e j a c k guys the kids names are james and lily if thats not a harry potter reference im upset where are the jumpscare timestamps when you need them jack says shouldent have bs like that in a game one episode earlier i love when things chase me characters say their names are lily and james a girl and a boy jack oh theyre two girls characters mention the name james again jack oh theyre two boys after all me why am i getting a plagues tale vibe from this this is interesting so far also seans voice was a bitoffwhere are you anti i know youre here somewhere stop hiding from usplease the kids are stow aways and the monsters are the ships crew trying to catch the kids and the kids are on the ship becayse they are fleeing their country the spooky voice reminds me of the voice of venom from the movie lol the voice over sounds like tony todd from the candyman trillogy along with some of the final destination films ok theory time lily and james are the 2 kids playing right lily being james other sister and saying that she is the captain who is better then james in short when the first poster is picked up the words are said youre nothing without me said by a female character to a male characterlater on someone asks a man if he killed her his reply was something along the lines of i had to she was slowly killing me moving on a bit you are faced with a scene where to you have to chose between killing 2 people a man and a woman though out the game so far lily keeps saying to james that shell protect him now there has been a lot of notes about stowawaysmaybe lily and jamess adventure was set on this ship as they climbed bored as stowaways there is a note that say about how they have had stowaways before and lily states theyll send us back again in layers of fear 1 the father painter lost his daughter to social services after becoming depressed about h so lily is the older girl james is the younger boy and who you play as the two were brother and sister lily was constantly trying to rope james into acting and he killed her in a fire its not much but if youd been paying attention youd have probably figured this out by now too why do i get headspace adverts which are all about calm and tranquillity right before jacksepticeyes video which is the totall opposite beware whats in the dark im a bit late but im ready for the spooky scares jack oooo narnia i see if your shorts by the way 1046 i still see your shadows in my room jack i am not staying here with with you creeps turns to the mannequin on the elevator jack ahdown please turns around mannequins you talking shit bro 4603 anyone else see the face in the door sees the doe me rachel amber is it just me who thinks that the voice of the girl saying you run but do you know the way etc sounds like sansa from game of thrones jack asks questions jse community do you have 90 minutes game plays weird audio me run that backwards put it through a spectrograph change the file type jack drinks bitch juice coca cola am i a joke to you haha had a popsicle and then i fell asleep then i fired and i missed who knows that reference read more it makes me wonder how jensen and jared from supernatural will acts when supernatural is finally done next year i mean 15 years of being sam and dean and they just have to stop being them thats gonna be such a huge change in their life jack is like hardly scared it relieves me while watching it i didnt freak out you freaked out shut up i has never clicked on a video this fast in my entire life um sean i think its pronounced thespian not thesbian xd 3442 actually in the first layers of fear the main character didnt kill a family member he was just terrible to his wife for the horrible scar she got on her face from a fire and she committed suicide i would love to see you play nancy drew ghost of thornton hall its a creepy mystery game where youre a detective trying to find a missing girl its an awesome game and there some scary parts its more mild than the ones you usually play but i think you would actually like it 4032 shit myself the imagery in the machine room reminds me of a scene in the movie metropolis by fritz lang nice reference welp im scared because theres a tornado warning and a bad storm outside baby face bash then i fired again missed i passed out in the snow when i woke up there was a popsicle stick in my mouth jack stop it the world never continues i want jack to play draugen it really interesting from what i have seen so far ive been a sub since goat simulator and ur still the best hope u read the mixed up word on the back of the board is scratcher and the not filled in word is character top of the page torn off my names jacksepticeye what the fuck just what the fuck 3515 no wonder so many actorsactresses have mental issues where these two girls died horrifically oh cards jacksepticeye 2019 doesnt really give a shit hey jack can you play shadow of mordor or shadow of war both are really good and bloody hes and i think youd like it the only thing ive been getting from this game so far is that the kids are stowaways and theyre stealing all the food and maybe one or both of them accidentally got killed by the actor during filming and that maybe the mannequins are all the characters hes played in the film can you give me some tips to starting out a channel plz maybe this is a story about an actor who goes insane trying to get into a character and reliving traumas of his childhood 912 i love you jack w layers of shrek just ask donkey such a weird yet interesting game but then again whos channel am i at xd 5609 press f to doubt jacksepticeye in five nights at freddy vr you can eat the toys they give you im just getting scared of loud noises now jacksepticeye 2019 so you get scared of yourself 1200 jack is there any more questions i can ask what he is thinking how did we get here do you have 90 min i fell asleep then woke up with a popsicle fired then i missed again im backaboy jackaboy the little kids were stowaways they were trying to get food and make sure they werent found by security their names are lily and james lily is the older sister and james is the younger brother edit the security found out that more food had gone out towards everyone on the boat than what should have been so they decided to keep the food under lock and key the ship wasnt running out of food the staff just wanted to make sure that there would be enough to go to everyone for the trip to the destination and back 10140 did anyone else get the batman reference on stepping on the light jack seemed to recognized the killing joke part the developers even dropped a body in front of you to hint it more lol am i wrong but isnt the narrator the voice of the horror movie candyman jack youre literally me i say locked and gag at every weird turn or certain action too jack are you going to play detroit become human when it comes out on pc jacksepticeye a man with a fear of heights ok down i go bye let me explain the game you play as a actoror actress idk and i assume that mr hardy and the girl are memories of the main character and the ghost demon thing that chases you is someone or something from your characters past also the posters are probably movies your character has been either playing the leading role or a important role also jack you missed a poster in episode one the part where the mannequins are disassembling the other mannequins reminds me of the cky video inhuman creation station scary guy walks toward sean sean oh god me give him a hug please bring back satisfactory hello jack im a big fan and i was wondering why dont you bring back skate 3 itll be fun to see you play it now please try and if not please tell me why you couldnt play it 3131 is that a reference to the heart machine in metropolis 1jack walks down the hall talking about how cool the graphics are 2pipies squeaks 3 jack isnt scared 4 mannequins appear 5screams did he say hunt or cunt did anyone have a laggy video he protecc he ataccc but most importantly anti bacc im pretty sure the flower was a white lily hey sean i know this might be lost in a sea of comments but now youre doing two videos a day againare you ok we know you went down to 1 a day because of the stress of it all and we just wanted to remind you to take it easy and not overwork yourself holy shit i was re watching this series so happy they came out with a second one theres benn at thewme of losing heads why does watching an hour long video on youtube feels longer than watching two 50 minute long episodes on netflix who else thinks the girls voice sounds jus like hermione from harry potter first fortnite deathrun now alia thumbnail talk to us jack if you like this your crush will ask you out like and sub to me to activate yay new episode of this stupid man screaming at mannequins i am the reviver of dead memes and i declare ugandan knuckles overly dead therefore he must and shallth be revived do you know the way 145 nobody jack the cunt jack something something actor darkiplier kicks down door did i hear oh wrong channel and alter ego youtuber that wasnt jesus that was a dog jacksepticeye 2019 jack you should start selling alarm clocks that yell top of the mornin to ya laddies what if ur the older girl looking for the little girl jack l is for lovers who love one another a is for ass which i like to eat u is for ur the only one for me g is for the only gamer i see h is for happy i always feel it when u put em all together what do u get boom laugh tony todd whos the voices the deep husky voice is an amazing actorvoice actor in general this game feels very inspired by alfred hitchcock what headset is jack using or those two died som hey cards jacksepticeye 2019 jack whos flickering the lights nosferatu its a spongebob reference if anyones confused when jack makes a game grumps reference me he did a thing right there chief 5 views 32 likes 6 comments youtube is drunk again jack the captains the girl her name is lily and mr hardy s the boy james jack that whole segment with the mannequins and the machinery is based on an old german scifi film from 1927 called metropolis they even matched the movements of the workers that movement that you called a slavic dance it is a weird movie but really cool they have it on youtube if you wanna check it out plot twisy you are the boy feels like an artist trying to portray dante from the divine comedy he seemed accostumed to having to practice his role by being who is going to be unfortunately dantes descent carried wih him the previous role he once portrayed that is why the msnikins were following him the voices can either be him and the roles he prtrayed or just himself practicing what would have dante felt on his descent different life along with on his jourmey beyond just my opinion i havent played his dope game and i just love when jack plays and awesomely finishes horor games just to show he is the real boss edit or perhaps he is charon he is unconscious that he is charon but he has some kind connectiom with the ship thst is why his room is the biggest in the ship compared to what we have seen he is able to go everywhere in the ship as well as overseersee what had happen the voices are the spirit he is to accompany to the under world and the two children lily and jimmy are maybe stowawa danger do not wach at night nor during a storm it is sacrry the younger one is a boy not a girl are there anymore questions i can ask jacksepticeye cool game ive never been one for horror games but ive been getting into them now because if you jack and i really like them so thank you for that when you have to watch jack play scary shit cause you cant handle it yourself xd if you like scary games play scp containment breach its scary i just like to think that the kids lily and james are running from something and somehow got to this boat while stealing food to stay alive the officers noticed and asked the chief for help and the chief put the food in a hold where the kids cant get to them and then they starved maybe the chalice is like a metaphor for them finally getting into the hold and got something to finally eat the fires might be the kids avoiding the officers roaming the ship hallways and lily asked billy to throw the plug in the bathtub while the chief is having a bath jack its going to be like the original layers of fear where those two girls like died hey look cards me what 749 anti is always there it is so cool 1720 he is slowly coming what ive got so far about the kids two siblings an older sister named lilly the captain and a younger brother named james the quartermaster the two would play pretend in a land they called the land of flamefire one day the sister takes the brother on an adventure which turned out to be them stowing away on a ship she said it was going to the makebelieve place that she and her brother played in it seems lilly was trying to save her brother from a situation back home because stowaways on this particular ship will not be tolerated the children are almost discovered and so forced to hide they begin to run out of food and soon find that they are not alone in the bowels of this ship todays fact rowan atkinson also known as mr bean is the voice of zazu in the lion king jack goes from it was two girls to it was two boys when it was a girl lilycaptain and a boy jamesmrhardy i think were playing as james because of the recording that jack played at the end of the last episode said james i havent watched the whole video so it might come up eventually but the younger child is a boy not a girl his name is james sub to skelacion if you want a 4 leaf clover i got the metropolis reference did you spot it the machine goes on metropolis 1927 german scifi film do you want my numbers sure just check and click more ill get it untagged also untagged means tagged in my comment dimension credit card pin u know i was just joking to make u look at this we all do the second part already dudes a beast sees jack uploaded 56 mins ago im so fookin late make a live stream for layers of fear 2 plz it will be amazing to be fair pre puberty boys can sound like girls loving the old intro and 2 uploads a day just know i need it at what point did everything go to gray ive been in a show where i was all nine characters before it was basically an hourlong monologue oh ive seen enough doctor who to know how much i hate mannequins and anything that acts like a weeping angel im 56 minutes late im sorry i have failed you jack act 2 the chunt im always on the look for anti 3616 the joker for example he was so much into his character that later on something happened to him and he ended up killed himself theres more facts to it but i just said the highlights jack you already uploaded today im way to much of a wimp for this jack do you know the way if you dont why dont you ask anti i just noticed if jack was like stupid buff he would be a greatly intimidating irish giant oof the water is gel those letters dont spell characters i loved the first game i cant wait to see what this one is like am i the only one who thought it said breasts in the darkness at first play kindergaten 2 if its out yet jack characters does not have two hs in it can you please play tokyo ghoul re exist i watched my cousin have sex nooooooooooooooooooooooooo i wont be able to say im fourteen and this is deep no more cause im gonna turn 15 in 3 days 2912 you picked the wrong house fooool 00329 jack act ii is called the hunt not the cunt xd geez jesus christ you become venom at venom at 750 something i fired then i missed then i fired again and i missed then i had a popsicle then i passed out then i woke up and i fired and i missed jack see we have this jumbled up thing of like characters i thought it was latin at the end of the first episode me characters with two hs jack i have a plug watch out where does it go i do not know i cant be the only one coming down to the comments to search for the jump scare times i think the maniquins are the deceased crew memers does anyone share that thought jack you should play i expected you to die its a fun vr game and keep up the good work those creepy paintings sort of remind me of the anguished man anybody else a scaredycat like me who is trying to work up the courage to watch this out of devotion for my man jackaboy can you play a game called ancestors when it comes out please is that tony todd doing the directors voice his voice is very deep and grumbly like that with similar inflections rip heath ledger the best joker i got fired for smoking weed lol peep out the video fam it isnt really scary im sad id hate being in this scenario where things change its almost eleven jack why do u upload at this time atleast i get to watch this who thinks jack should live stream this like so jack can see 1140 what about how did we get here do you have 90 minutes can everybody please go follow rowan b it means alot i love you so much sean lmao holy hell says 1 minute ago feck im to not be noticed now am sadness coolio i have to agree with sean haunted house has been overplayed for horror games perhaps even asylums though those locations can still give the creeps sometimes i like the boat here it reminds me of resident evil 7 near the end of the game i wish horror games would branch out to new and different locations like underground tunnelslabyrinths circus especially if it were pre 60s era where you would have the freak show abandoned ruins like a monasterynunnery i think an orphanage would work extremely well if theres a good backstory plot of secret slave auctions horrific experiments extreme punishments like the chokey in matilda even better if done by a childs perspective 630 i like how jack did not notice the monster on the left and his first instinct when it happened was to stand still and do nothing love this series though my dog is getting put down rn so plz show some love jack if u are reading this thx u u are the best keep it up you run but do you know de way lets not forget that this is all happening on a boat like how fucking big deep and long is this boat i feel like this would be a lot more scary if jack wasnt referencing memes left and right so thanks for making me able to watch it without peeing myself in fear ive a theoryi think your character is the actor either the man or woman weve seen on the posters the kids that keep cropping up are stowaways who were hiding in different areas of the ship including the set for the movie that was being filmed my guess is there was an accident the actor had a direct hand in that resulted in one or both of the kids getting killed probably with the prop gun you used in the first episode the actor now filled with grief is going back through their time on the ship and is finding out bits and pieces of the kids and their story the chase scenes are probably when the kids were having to hide from guards out on patrol and the reason were seeing it through their eyes is because the actor inserts themselves into the role of the kids as they learn more about thembut thats just a theory a game theory this does remind me of he titanic a great deal yaaaaay more jack and more layers of feaer jackman you should play the plague i like that this game is a slow burn vs the quick fnaf style jumpscares maks this an amazing game and played by jack none the less i dont know if youll see this jack but i wanted to thank you for my birthday card you wrote and sorry my brother sprinted at you from across the road i just finished the order episode and refreshed and this was here wow lookie woulda been earlier but i stayed up way too late binging layers of fear 1 and then the first part of 2 anyone else keep getting an antifeeling from this lp cause the style of destroying one character while building another anti trying destroy jack while taking control idk maybe i am reading too much into this xd if youre early anything can be top comment hey you yes you dont hide in the comments like a coward dont be like me i am thinking that in the past the character you play and the other girl lily were once stowaways on a ship i think the character is the younger brother as stowaways they ate some of the food and hid to avoid capture and to pass the time and to help her brother not feel scared lily made a game where they were pirates and this over the years inspired the character to become an actor i was about to get off youtube and this pops up just more horror time awaits us the part with the worker robots reminds me of the movie metropolis 1927 hell yeah your made of vomit everyone else ohhhhhhhhhh he got roasted me cries inside that was mean jack one bonus of being awake at 5am down under all of the europeans are uploading now rainin like ireland game in a nightmare jack in a nightmare i can do it too its not scary me jacks voice is scarier and its currently 330 am watching it the green haired boss so kindergarten 2 has been out for a bit now like if you agree jack should play it jacky boy your going to get scead shitliss 444 me when i wake up and look in a mirror jackmaybe im the dog que x files theme yay another vid 524 that voice reminds me a lot of oxenfree jack im a big fan and i think you should play five nights at candys it is similar to fnaf but with a different set up and different animatronics the main characters are two cats named candy and cindy the jump scares are really good too a huge fan of jackaboy jack do you ever think of doing a vlog of you at a aquarium this game just proves how fucking terrifying mannequins can be i hate them so much thanks game can you play be chat part 2 the cunt i thought it said breasts in the dark instead of beasts in the darkme and my dirty mind this is sad t series reached 100 mill im sad telling ominous noises to shut up is quality content i think at 630 the reason it insta killed you was because of how close you were to the door how du fuck u upload so fast i just finish part 1 play more satisfactory i love longer letsplays of storydriven games so much thank you i thought oh nice im early realizes hadnt seen the first part wassup in ireland where im living its lashing idk why but theres literally a storm outside u know its ireland oh and keep up the good work man nice vids broo im watching this video in vr and its sooo goood ill be watching the fnaf ones in vr too pray for me if u like jacksepticeye like my comment jack are u ever going to do more fnaf vr jack you shoud have done the heres tap tap the mothafuckin tap tap tea that wloud be the perfection ive read all of my books oh wait did i actually read this mom dont look at him son while he is drinking his bitch juice literally just finished the first episode and got a notification just after for this video bro thats antisepticeye voice in 2019 before you continue reading this comment know that i know nothing about this game and im just guessing about the plot for fun so heres my fairly obvious theory so my theory is that the person your playing as is an actor but its more symbolism showing that he changed himself to make others like him but loses himself along the way and now hes inside his own mind trying to escape and become his actual self again but thats only part of the game i guess i dunno what the heck is going on for most of the game or maybe there are different body parts everywhere referencing the build the character thing antisepticeye he did his intro i think things are in black and white because your are on the set of a movie and movies back in the day were black and white thats just my theory 1128 you are entering a dimension of all senses a place of shadow and scares of things and ideas even jack cant comprehend you have just crossed over into the ripple zone i hope im not the only one who read breasts in the dark ayyethe earliest ive ever been notification squadwhere ya at nobody literally nobody not even jesus christ himself doors that lead to the same room im about to end this mans whole career pretty sure the beast is just anti tserious got 100m goodbye add this comment for your videos my

fucking humanoids creatures btw good review first lol youtube saying the game is fear 2 anyone else notice the metropolis movie reference im glad to see im not the only person who automatically disables motion blur its such a stupid setting especially on high refresh rate monitors p 059 im not mad im just disappointed in you yeah i saw it release i was waiting on a playthrough from ya i figured you was down for it keep upif you dont mind please stream dreadout game no one did notice the 420 thats tony todds voice in the beginning fucking candyman great video i hate motion blur i was in this stream live in the beginning but i fell asleep bc it was like late at night for me the voice actor from inspector gadget might actually be tony todd sounds like the candyman ive got my co workers hooked on your channel now so your welcome for the free advertising keep the vids coming plz keep up the great work buddy 13 juega a call of cthulhu esto no sube otra vez deanish of hethan carter yo lo vi en twitch dice perdoname gg sex juega the warriors porfa sube el juego the warriors te va a encantar if you havent seen bloober teams previous games here are a couple playlists you might like layers of fear 1 httpsoddgglayersoffear observer httpsoddggobserver the real horror when you survive through all this and you emerge on a deck only to realize youre on titanic its mehh goodbut shes no observer i dont know what the fish are representing while in the water oh i dunno chris maybeeee uhh fish lmao love the channel though man been off your page to let you upload vids to bend watch and glad you watch you again you are my favorite youtube gamer still to this day fear is like an onion who else noticed that the bolts were on the outside of the door after the cafe segment i thought why would you open that its obviously trying to keep something in i love this letsplay but for some reason the game gives me massive motion sickness im like 99 sure this ship is based off the queen mary ship sos in morse code is 3 short 3 long 3 short to verbalize it silly as it may seem taptaptap pat pat pat taptaptap remember lights off headphones on volume up cat on lap you playing spooky games is my favorite thing that title card was literally something stanley kubrick would use its interesting that you just played another suspensehorror game with minimal interactions on a large ship that was named according to a legend or term surrounding the sun heliosclose to the sun but i loved the original layers of fear and observer so much that i dont doubt this will certainly prove to be its own wonderful and original narrative otherwise this developer is the tops ive enjoyed every one of your playthroughs of all of their games also i feel as though the room you enter around 2300 is in its entirety an homage to this installments predecessorthe blatant alcoholism the canvas the oil paints and tools even the haunting nature of the items in and about the room itself calling back to the both very real and very imagined ghosts of the first titles protagonist antagonist also at 2806 that line is stolen and altered from a quote by erstwhile authorpoet charles bukowski can you remember who you were before the world told you who you you play the best games thank you i love how thorough you are 3 im so glad i found ur channel ive been watching your channel for quite awhile now youve played a lot of great games keep up the good work speaking for myself but it really does feel like whoever made this game and the original were clearly very educated in painting and you do need to be a painter or artist to fully understand a lot of the references otherwise it comes off as a load of jargon and a typical horror game the biggest thing i noticed was how the first game tried to portray the idea of the tortured artist and a lot of the emotions that go into creating a painting were communicated very well and transferred flawlessly into a video game format and horror of all things and judging by the intro this might take a deeper look into the mind of a performer so i love that idea of different people being able to interpret the game from their own point of view and with their own experiences its been a very long time since a game hit me as hard as that one did so i look forward to this series the quick terrified breathing when he just jumps into opening doors fucking kills me lmao guys i set the vibe way too high that being said loving all the content recently odd literally the only youtuber ill watch play all these games thanks for providing endless entertainment titanic vibes same floor tiles at 1150 and cafe slight diffrencs but thats what i get same voice actor as hugo de rune terrific voice hey bro turn your mic down or turn game volume up its too uneven thanks i feel like a cruise ship would be one of the worst places to get caught in a creepy horror scene since theres literally no escape unless you want to take your chances with hypothermia sharks and staving to death on a life raft hey you noticed you dont seem to have a body that can cast shadows love your horror walkthroughs odd more please games like this inspire me to keep working on my own games i only hope that my games will be good and people will actually play it one day like this game cant wait to play this game myself good video as usual you are very easily scaredfrightened flickering lights and youre done closing of a door none of that is really scare inducing im sorry but lilycaptain baynes voice is just really obnoxious to me it sounds like shes constantly whispering and trying and in my opinion failing to do an accent its taking me out a bit since everything she says sounds stilted because of that is it just me i rewatched your layers of fear 1 playthrough over the last couple days in preparation and at one point you said in a very exasperated tone can we get some lights in this bitch and if that doesnt sum up your entire channel idk what does lmfao seems like so many horror games copied the walking through the same room over and over but its slightly different each time thing from pt too spooky for me but ill give it a shot xx thats what happens when you smack a globe 2505 perhaps the word youre looking for is exercises creepy voice sleep is a poor excuseand so are you me well sounds like someone needs a nap and a hug i think some of my favorite series are the ones where christopher is freaking out from the suspense wheres the hot action this game was ripped off from that free titanic recreation video tour a few years ago yes another horror game my cat playing around the house really added to the vibe while watching this at night that mini heart attack when chris picked up the damn mirror never pick up a mirror you wanna know what cracks me up about these types of games in the start all the useless things you can turn on and off just the so the player can say oh thats cool haha game number 2 on a boat is that the candy man voice in the beginning new to the channel but im loving the content youre awesome keep up the great work i dont have the balls to play these games but im thoroughly enjoying them through your experience thanks for that i wanted to see all the angles at 1922 for the morse code so badly maybe early easter eggs also you should play once with a hr monitor and a pupil tracker how bold of oyu to assume i can afford headphones cry is it worth to watch the 1st too story wise there are so many youtubers playing this but i wanted to watch your playthrough i love your reactions and how thorough you are game looks beautiful also ummmm i had no idea they were even making a second one this is a pleasant surprise aside from tony todd i think another voice actor is hugo from a plague tale innocence or do the opposite of set the vibe as i usually put these on at work on a seperate screen which is intermitently blocked by work at least half the time as i do 34 other things ive been a fan since everybodys gone to the rapture i absolutely love your style of gameplay and commentary i know you will take your time and explore everything you always keep us your audience engaged im so excited you should play call of cthulhu sure am glad i watched this in the early afternoon with a movie in the background i had to go back a couple of times to see the jump scares and laughed at your reaction to most of them yikes deadly and this is whats its all aboot i expect great things from this series quality chris freak outs scares wanting to quit chases mysteries that need solvingall those good things dread is here and im ready to open the door lets do this is the directors voice kurn form star trek tng damn the tension building in this game is crazy man im going to enjoy this series mr odds immersion is on point as usual lets go whoaaaa is this really a second game of layers of fear goodness im so excited commenting before i even start the video b hell yeah do you plan playing sec9nd part of mutant year zero mr odd 356 the most terrifying thing of all mate i have exams and you are pumping these awesome playthrough s god dammit youre the perfect person to play this game odd totally enjoyed your playthrough of the 1st game first thing i noticed about this is that the narration is by the candyman tony todd i dig it interesting how the globe was entirely ocean christopher odds horror series are the best type of play through series cant wait for this bravo first youtuber who play this game i thought he sounds like candyman turns out i was correct hooray for tony todd maybe i missed it but how often are you planning on uploading episodes in this series ahh man the voice acting in this is so good im already intrigued to see where this game goes its certainly gorgeous so far i really like the ship setting this time around as well that swaying you were pointing out really just adds to the unnerving feeling of this empty wing were in whaaat i didnt even know this was a thing yes i didnt even know this game was out yet i love your horror playthroughs theres something about the way you react to things in scary games ie a breath a gasp an okay dude were dead that helps me feel like its okay to be scared i like that makes it easier to watch scary games because i hate them lol yessss horror game with odd best way to spend my free time with some snacks odd playing horror game yesss i dont know if ill be able to handle watching this game too much anxiety for me unfortunately chris is clearly having a blast xd oh im so happy i really wanted you to play this game and when i saw the notification i was so happy i loved the first game and i cant wait for this character i like the layers of fear original game and i will never get over how realistic the game looks excited to watch this playthrough i think im going to die if i watch you play it but im also going to die waiting for the next episode to come out so basically i have found myself in a real catch22 observer i could handle the scareslayers of fear i could not ill try and give this a go as ive been enjoying so much of your content recently oh and a trailer for a game i just watched today screamed christopherodd playthroughthe sinking city out june 27th it looks like your jam this is exciting to see i didnt even remember a sequel was planned did you ever play layer of fear inheritance oh my gosh i didnt even know layers of fear had a sequel im so excited king kong the actor on a ship thing except for some reason im now stuck with adrien brody in my head as the actor protagonist here yes i know he was the writer in king kong but still 2753 the twentyfirst night of september editthanks so much for the heart chris mysterious voice sleep is a poor excuse me tucked in my blankets well fine then sir dont come crawling to me when ur head is being bombarded by deadly migraines find ur own paracetamols yassss play more horror odd so intense i loved it thanks to always bring to us these incredible games i truly love how dedicated you are to always keeping the channel updated and bringing new content your game playing also is very smooth you dont let any information pass by thats so important for whos watching help us immerse in the game obs i love your little panic attacks in this game so far haha genuine i dont think i would be capable of playing it but watching you play really breaks the tension specially when it comes to jump scares at the beginning the whiteboard with act i think stood for character maybe the word fits so theres that the first game was overhyped i hope this one is better the whispering is the same or similar mechanic with the first one i think i remember theres a certain noise when you find or when you are getting close to important items connected to the main story for me to watch you play is definitely the best way to experience these types of games despite my rationality telling me its just a game i just cant deal with the stress of playing them anymore gettingold this isodd no menu o so oris the start was the meun im confused already the link for the first games playthrough is httpsyoutubeehjqmbzvu4 the one in the description doesnt work for me for some reason that is the early access playthrough there is also a full release one that was twitch streamed in a robotic voice setting the vibe anyone notice that theradbrad and odd do the same games brad just started this series right after odd did haha keep those playthroughs coming the sway is slightly disorienting oo im getting very strong pt vibes from the beginning and an intriguing story this pleases me yess im ready i liked that thing with your voice at the beginning btw i love you christopher odd your my fav horror gamer you read everything search well go nice and slow lol your a good gamer wait when did this come out just the fact that its narrated by tony todd peaks my interests thor best game ever beat this game today oh the music is lovely still waiting for pewdiepie to play ahahdhshs i forgot aaaahahaha this is such an underrated game imagine if it all was in vr can it on ps4 how am i only discovering this after the game came out just started playing this morning and i thought that was mr todds voice i was hearing bloober always know their way around sound ost and ambience work is just art is this based on titanic ship cause it looks it layers of fear 2016 game the end would be cool if the third one was based around a muscian how did i miss this im so confused 7 months omg the atmosphere and the pressures are too high only watch the trailer could make me imagine how scary the game will be a missed opportunity at the end there couldve had the people sittingin the seats all have there heads turn as the camera goes past them aw man im so excited i loved the first one i already know the soundtrack will be just as magnificent owo this fantastic d shots fired at all actors xd they got candy man narrating this should be in psvr i love the first one best birthday present ever layers of fear is my favourite of this kind of horror game exploration usually i get bored quickly with these kind of games but i couldnt put this one down the scares were so cool that i could hardly look away and the mechanics were very interesting this looks like more of that with enhanced graphics and i couldnt be more excited about it cant wait for this thank you i only learned today there was another one coming out this made me very happy as i thought there wouldnt be another one coming out i loved the first one so i like to listen to lotus land from time to time to remind me of it i didnt find out that layers of fear was going to have a sequel until now the original is such an great game cant wait to see what this game brings to the table of the franchise no idea this was a thing untill it appeared in the coming soon xbox store im crying yessssssss horror titanic im so looking forward to this game but after its release please do observer 2 whats next a tortured athlete cant wait for more doors to slam behind me and appear and disappear layers of fear is a masterpiece why am i just finding out about this now also i love the music at 049 one year from now it will be canceled no new dlc end of support is this the next outlast seems like it hope it wont disappoints the first one was cool i cant believe this is happening finally i liked the visuals of lof1 but really it was only a corridor and door simulator i hope this episode will be more the first one was great my gf and i played it together mostly she watched along side me but it was a highly immersive experience with a wonderfully suspenseful environment befitting of any great thriller i greatly look forward to this i seriously cannot wait for this game i absolutely adored the first game and im eager for what this provides does anyone know the release date cool a part 2 of this yay cool awesome im reading on can we get an observer 2 though i really liked observer and i hate most horror games i cant wait as a horror streamer i can honestly say the first one was one of the scariest games ive played i will definitely be purchasing this game personally i preferred observer over layers of fear not that it was a bad game but i couldnt connect with it as i did when i played observer hoping this time around im able to get into it the devs are undoubtedly talented i feel like a song is in order for celebration please click the link for a stumbling fun time httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdrtfhfyc2fm this game needs more logical tasksinteraction and true damage including possibility of death to become something else the first game lacked those elements tortured painter tortured actor tortured writer tortured gamer tortured singer tortured dancer tortured toddler tortured surfer what else i have missedthat needs to uncover the layers of each story tell markiplierto play layers of fear fast this looks amazingi am so excited when i find out that i cannot be harmed or killed in layers of fear 1 my scaremeter went to 0 hope they will change it instant hype cant fking wait the first one was a masterpiece the first game was amazing i love this game judging by the handfilled corridor from repulsion the movie references will be on point the best horror game ever so hyped i loved 1st one i passed it 3 times and dlc too cant wait for this one frames of fear yes i would love an updated status i played lof1 a lot of times i mean man i love that game you guys do amazing work i know you are working on a lot after brilliant observer ill buy this without a doubt cant wait to play this one i loved the first one this looks so damn cool yes finally i hope it makes its way to ps4 if i get scared by another book

sweet wait melies does it have anything to do with george melies who is considered the first cinematographer in history their is no 2 its a hoxe cus i googled it and only the first came up yes please layers of fear is my favorite horror game i cant wait for layers of fear 2 the soundtrack of the first was masterpiece and the game too the hype is real jacksepticeye will love this the 1st one is great except for some glitch or bug i hope lof2 will not have this kind of thing presentation and horror environment is totally awesome scary game squad better be ready will it be on the switch loved the first one cant wait for this so hyped for this 3 new game new songs hope the story is deep than in layers of fear 1 am i wrong for saying that the first one was kinda average not different from any other walking simulator horror game cheap scares and painfully long letters i have nothing against the genre in fact amnesia tdd is my favourite horror game but it seems that developers see the genre as an excuse for not putting much effort i was sold as soon as i read layers of fear 2 layers of fear is about the best walking simulator type of game ive ever played except for maybe soma strong i mean strong silent hill vibe but i loooove the soundtrack already so epic im so happy for the upcoming sequel akskddjdkddj big thanks for the developer team to continue the series i liked the first one but got bored half way through because i was just expecting jumpscares at every turn wish i could die and have more stragedy instead of pretty much just walking around this is making me get outlast vibes idk why but i already love this nice i enjoyed the first one pls dont cancel this one i couldnt bear it another timelayers of fear is also one of my favorite games so pleaseeeeeand im so looking forward to new pieces of beautiful yet terrifying art and the story and the wonderful details and the music i cannot waittttt yesss im so excited looks interesting i really loved layers of fear so im expecting this sequel to be up to the challenge you became an actorso you wouldnt have to be yourself look at the floor at 008 is this the titanic sure looks like it i am pretty hyped about this first one was a great horror game just hope the framerate can be a little better ps4 didnt finish the first one cause all the flashing lights and stuff really hurt my eyes and head hopin this one wont be as flashy this is giving me major outlast vibes cant wait for jacksepticeye to play it thats how i enjoy horror games how do you guys expect a game to be scary without jump scares you want to be able to see the ghost from a mile away and not be scared at all or open a door and then bam the ghost is right in your face ill take a scary game with jump scares any day never played layers of fear but im a huge horror fan and this trailer is kind of intriguing is the first game worth playing oh a bendy easteregg with the hands in the hallway i hope jay will play this wasnt a fan of the first one but this could be interesting i played the first game and i really enjoyed it looking forward to this one game brings back memories wooohooo welcome to potential railways next stop perfection cant wait to play it bendy lookin thumbnail the hypeeee i love psychological horror games like this the immersion made me more scared of a harmless ghost than most survival horror games

unique incredible music andexcellent secretshidden pathsi absolutely loved 100 completing this game on ps4 uncovering the secrets was just so rewarding i hope the this one isnt a boring walking simulator with jumpscares yay i cant wait to point the camera angle at the floor the whole time yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yeeeeeaaaaaaassss love this already the first game was great d i just finished playing the first game and i enjoyed it im glad theyre making another game i like how it doesnt always rely on jumpscares to spook the player but instead uses the creepy atmosphere definitely wanna try to get this game for myself zalzar markiplier jacksepticeye look at this i just completed the first game and it was one of the best horror games i have played yeeeeeessssssssss the first game was amazing im so ready for this spoiler simon is the bad guy its better be source engine 2 yes the masterpiece returns masterpiece reborn oh great i cant wait the first one was awesome and had

artistic concept nope this pts baby is growing up hopefully this can be another successful franchise nice looking forward to it d candyman narrating interesting niceeeee when this comes out i hope it will be on the nintendo switch i loved the first one very scary and great horrific special effects me omg im so gonna play this game d my potato pc i hope you die tommy wiseau is going to be great as the actor my favorite horror game anyone knows the name of music at the end of trailer boring as fk awesome loved the first game omfg is this real i am so excited wtf please let this game be a legend the first one was very mediocre hope the second one will deliver i loved layers of fear but i wished it was scarier im hoping this will be better finally i could play visage last hills layers of fear 2 maid of sker even son gosh i love horror games definitely enjoy them so much i hope its more than just a walking simulator this time first one stopped being scary as soon as i realized nothing was actually a threat just bought the first one and the dlc now the second one is announced oh jesus its great game i tell you this will be awesome everyone should see a trip to the moon i cant put to words how much i needed and wished for this to happen layers of fear 2 im ready af what kind of imagination can create this game its just unbelievable cant wait d wow that was a really nice trailer so far looks like a bunch of stuff that haa been done before hands out the walls jump scares blah blah blah looks cheap layers of fear was not very scary visuals were awesome but as the game went it also became repetitive loved the originalrelease date i loved the first one cant wait for this layers of walking 2 reveal trailer does anyone else feel like if the next sequel was of a tortured musician the game would be 75 instrumental jumpscares literal bought the legacy edition i hope arkadiusz reikouzki was in this game too i love his music the first game gave me artistic inspiration to learn how to paint and now the second game is about an actor i think its time i learn about making videosminimovies anyone else find that hallway of arms creepy as hell oh im ready for thisi think o this looks so much better than the first and the amazing music is still present is this coming out on consoles it didnt say it im suffering playing the first game and for now i isnt suffering with observer pls im dying of fear i dont want other game to suffer xd not super excited is this a haunted titanic cant wait to watch the ah boys play this omg omg omg omg omg pleeaaassseee be the painter or the wife no way ive allready been obsessed with the first game and now there will be a second one my life has purpose again the exitement is unreal nice wasnt expecting this is this for ps4 please make it more scary the first was ok in horror narrated by tony todd cant be much worse than the first one if it comes to switch like the first ill get it seriously another one forgive me for being so negative but after the first lof turned out to be a mess i have little hope that this one will turn out to be anything special yaaaaaaaaaaas cant wait alot evil within 2 vibes lol remember when everyone was mad that the first game was given a low score because the reviewer thought it was boring and not scary at all made me realize that ign viewers are babies when it comes to horror wasnt the first one a buggy and inconsequential time waster since there was no way to lose not interested 3 words oh hell nah hopefully this one is a horror game if it wasnt clear this was a joke sounds like candyman doing the voice over lol looks interesting im going to need the heavy stuff because we got the golden road or bloody lane with red stuff on the elevator crank me bloody lane it is omg omg please longer story this time first one was boring as hell doubt this will be any better the boat scene reminded me of echo night cant wait i tried to play the 1st one when the walls started shaking and running red with blood i was like nope i screamed and stoped playing i had my headphones on and it was 1am the first didnt do it for me and im a diehard horror lover i want tour tires dev after finishing re7 and other horror titles on psvr flat screen horror games are not scary at all shame indie studios dont release their flat screen games vr support didnt expect a second part from this game but hellyea im hype for it hopefully they improve the narrative side of things story was a bit lacking overall dont buy anything from gun media i think i like this sweet i loved the first one the first one had a couple of jump scares but it got repetitive hope this ones better the first one was great cant wait to play this sequel the first was pretty bad i hope this one is better a coffin in a ship is this a jojo game well this is unexpected 7810 too many layers ign what music at the end called please say its coming to switch is the first worth playing its really odd seeing people say i cant wait to see youtubeperson play this my nephew watches people play the games more than actually playing them oh man i love the first one and had no idea a sequel was in the works i did not like the first one i hope they really improved this one cant wait i got goosebumps this is wonderful yes another nope nope game the first game had potential hopefully the second one improves on that potential enjoyed the first one whens this out cant wait for girlgamergab to play this tony toddthats epic gun media is behind this game ill pass the first game was amazing and had great ideas cant wait onions have layers hopefully this time we get a vr option nobody wants this that soundtrack is superb made me replay it 3 times just for the song you could say that this trailer has 2 many layers ba dum tss oh look another horror game where youre walking down a hallway in the trailer theres been like 15 of these since the pt silent hill demo in 2014 first a tortured artist now a tortured actor i love this series now to get more nightmares in this sequel cool i was thinking about replaying this for some reason what happened to the game visage that was supposed to come out this year is it coming out next year that game was way creepier than this jacksepticeye and mark will play this soon what what hell yes i was literally just thinking about getting the dlc for the first game im early layers of fear 1 was a pt spin off that became an indie standalone in my eyes thisll either make or break it ghost on a ship ive never played the first one it was scary enough now we have another one well time to die from fear awesome the first was an underrated horror game not first unmooring means it slipped anchor and is floating away love u wade i feel no fear this is rather oldtimey looking right character watches things on projectors with fullsized reels character has a phograph on his bedside table character receives a telegram what era do you guys assume this is 70s 80s maybe it is more recent i dont know how oldfashioned do you imagine the 80s were wade xd i suffered from epilepsy in the past flashing lights dont bother if not i thrive on the feeling of it now bright lights bother my eyes quite a bit especially those bright led lights nowadays just an fyi wade the voice actor is tony todd i would recognize that voice anywhere he has an amazing voice for games and is a really good actor and he is an uber nice person too got to meet him at a con once i was never the same when i watched beetlejuice as a child this looks about the 20s or 50s cause they used projectors to promote the first animations plus as an actor they had to make sure they stayed on character got scared because of the jump scare but the 70s made me laugh i know this is late as heck but i think this game is supposed to take place either in the 20s or 30s wade turned into pewds sutter kane vice president oh no tell us wade do you read sutter kane untrustworthy barrels 1432 uh wadei think those donuts look odd to you because theyre actually bagels 1125 so the guy hes describing is an onion 237 its mark trying to bring prop hunt to layers of fear look out for a fish thatll be bob fish barrel man u wasted so much time trying to be clever and inspect every fucking thing pointlessly looking for easter eggs who do u think u r matt patt ur not so just play the damn game 3verything u can interact with has the swirling arrows which r easy to see across the room so stop checking every single thing plus ur camera is way to jerking its headache inducing seriously mooring is the place where the boat or ship is moored like ropes chains anchors unmooring is release of the moorings of a vessel wade we do care what you see and say never think we dont sorry for getting this out late its been a crazy month but this is published on the first of june wade my dude if your month is already crazy then i want to know what secret agent double life you lead xd xd just joking with you really enjoying your lets plays keep on rocking you and your epic personality i got sniped by 110 and had to look it up this is a very old model of fire extinguisher from as early as world war 1 made by a company named minimax who though theyve been acquired and reacquired since then still makes fire extinguishers this type was filled with soda water and striking the knob shattered a vial of sulphuric acid which in turn rapidly brought the carbon dioxide gas out of solution a little like diet coke and mentos and producing a similar jet of water out of the business end 153 the goldfish face 235 dundundun untrustworthy barrel xd 857 i havent watched it yet i guess i should go do that 1436 were you just dabbing ingame 3110 sigh of defeat lol i saw this game on steam and it looked interesting so thanks for playing after binging mark and jacks gmod videos with you and others and it then led me to believe that i too should watch your videos and now i am 3 i believe this era is similar to the titanic the beauty full sound of children laughing i love how you take your time with this game and the last one whereas a lot of other people just rush through and highly edit them and it loses almost all of its atmosphere thanks wade people still use projectors in theaters just not those kind of projectors xd i think right now that this game takes place in the 1930s at the latest but i could be wrong is it just the video or is that water effect in the beginning really badold like bioshock oldbad you and the salty bois are my favorite youtubers keep it up bro mark needs to play this we do care wade thats why we watch your videos also try character on the board so does anyone else think wade tries to be like mark sometimes with his jokes or humor oh boy here we go i know nothing of this game so im just gonna watch this and probably get scared definitely early 1900s wade is the best a real gem you guys dont wanna hear me talk and saying the bouquet he got for molly was nicer looking forward to this new horror series c with what i looked up fire cones where used in the 1900s to the 1920s and i looked up the name of the ship that was on the flyer there was a real ship named the ss ulysses that was a passengercargo ship from 1913 to 1942 and it was sunk by a german uboat so i think the ship in the game is based off the real one lordminion mentions a barrel im like no its a borral we love you wade you are very good person i love your video love from india i just subscribed your channel play the rake again wade please for old times sake please flowers wade youre not as pretty as the ones i got molly im just sad that the dark souls series stopped i really loved it docking a boat to a pier is mooring it so unmooring is undocking the boat endgame spoiler thanos steps on a lego wade that was awesome please keep this one up theres always a lower level in horror games basement lower deck etc one facet ive always loved about wade as compared with other lets players is that hes really observant in horror or his other single lets plays were all human and we cant catch everything but wade is very good at catching a lot of important details ive been waiting to see you andor any of the bois play this so glad you are really playing it wade not that its a big deal but youve missed a couple of things explore and look at everything if you want to get all the details 700 i think the correct word on the board is character wade please play more witch hunt also the gang needs to play crawl 640 710 is a prime example of why i love wade i immediately thought oh its character and then watched as he struggled until he reached his own plausible conclusion detracted what to me had seemed supersimple was flipped on its head by wades lateral thinking and thats awesome o wade i love the playthrough so far but you did miss a note there close to the end so be careful about that also for collectibles just look for small cylinder reels posters and small rectangular uh i dont even know what to call it its like a little photo card watching out the highlighted circle can be a little tricky because sometimes its hard to see but be careful also we love hearing what you have to say dont put yourself down like that im so happy to see you playing these types of games again i dont like watching anyone else certain horror themes is why i never finished watching anyone play the first game i hope i can make it through this one i loved this part as well as your original layers of fear like thanks for the laughs shaggy impression wade in witch huntfuck this shit im out me in witch huntbow down to your king mother fuckers hahahahahahahaaa thats would be me if i had the pc and the game love it that you take your time to look around and actually see things icarus transatlantic that doesnt bode well also ss ulysses sounds familiar which also isnt a good thing and agreed with the others i watch lets plays to see your reactions and thoughts yes we got the intro and the outro yes yes yes and i want to hear what you have to say speak damn you speak xd love you man when wade got scared of the reflection in the hand mirror and freaked out i died laughing layers of fear has never been scary to me and has always been borderline cheesey i love his facial expression at 155 i was just thinking about how much i missed you playing quality horror games i originally started following this channel because of your horror gameplays so this feels really nostalgic i love how youre so careful and throughout and even if this series is going to be 60 parts or if you decide to upload longer episodes because the game is kinda long i would watch it till the end doing well i only noticed one thing missed for sure and one possibly missed im sure i wouldnt do as well if i was dividing my attention between game and camera did no one else get the reference to sutter cane from the sam neill movie in the mouth of madness im an actor on a boat so youre playing as leonardo dicaprio sweet also wade of course i care about what you have to say thats why i watch you playing this instead of someone else i watched you play the first one way back when so i wouldnt watch anyone else 70s or 80s i sincerely hope that was a joke lol the game appears to take place around the turn of the century i did a little research and apparently there is an area with a newspaper article that mentions wilson taking office which took place in 1913 so yes and yes i am older than you wade but only by a couple years or so the skeleton head kind of looks like a pteradactyl skull is the first game better you are the best its distracted wade im sorry i shouldnt be mean like this to you but youre the second youtuber to not know what the word is on the chalkboard hes an effing actor the word is effing character especially since the note in all caps at the beginning is him or someone else telling him to find his character again apologies that gotheated can you play desolate again please so glad youre playing this the voice talking to you sounds like the actor tony todd i remember him most in the movies candyman hey wade you gotta play this game called barotrauma with pat gar and jp its been said by other people in the comments already but ill add my voice anyway wade your commentary is part of the experience and why were here if we didnt care about what you specifically had to say and about your specific personality then we wouldnt watch your videos youre awesome keep it up looks like this could be the 30s or 40s hi wade you did a wonderful job on this game and you are a pretty smart man this looks like the titanic movie in a way have a nice weekend you missed a photo slide nice to see you again wade only have seen diction play this so far but will enjoy seeing your playthrough tfw when you havent done a solo vid in forever so you forgot how to do an outro xd there should be a game called layers of wade id play it was that tony todd happy pride month wadesalt777 and everyone can you please do more gmod horror maps just got back from tour be prepared for running wade also you missed a note on the nice table set in that one room good stuff dude your community is not as big as it used to be but i bet its a lot more supportive long time since you played solo this is giving me more of a titanic kinda vibe maybe like post apocalyptic titanic the voice saying stay awake is candyman yes the scary videos are back unmooring release the moorings of a vessel the ship was ready to be unmoored cause to feel insecure confused or disconnected the loss of his wife has unmoored him ulysses is what the greeks called odysseus i believe he was the guy who in homers odyssey journeyed back home to ithaca after he survived the trojan war but his journey was a difficult one his identity changes so much throughout the odyssey because he had to adapt himself for all the obstacles he had to face on his return home maybe this is what the maker of this game was getting at they also hint at a classical influence with icarus transatlantic and setting the game on a boat could hint at odysseus again who was hounded by poseidon god of the sea perhaps the character changed himself his actual identity with each role and has done this so many times that he doesnt know who he is anymore dude your missing important notes to read like crazy makin my nerves grate lol wadeohms are electrical resistanceits a common thing for electric equipment compatability standardization lol 2200 does anyone else remember a similar setting in the first game so been looking forward to wade playing this stop being so twitchy while looking around you are missing things that are obvious yehey ive been waiting for you to play this wade everybody cares about what you say and see man its why we watch your videos bro im playing this myself and its so awesome horror its been sometime goose bumps long pause were on a boat arent we thank you so much for being considerate of those suffering with photosensitive epilepsy i often point out that so much distress and pain can be avoided with a simple warning the 70s or 80s wade really the name icarus transatlantic does not give me faith in their safety seeing that icarus died from flying too close to the sun yas ive been waiting for more wade horror i cant wait to see a confused wade trying to make sense of what happens i havent yet hey there mr mime hope to see you at rtx layers of fear 1 already gives me enough heart attacks but idk if i wanna try layers of fear 2 i miss the videos of you with mark and bob love your channel wade and im happy that i finally managed to see one of your videos fresh on the channel i always care wat ya gotta say wade long it aint an hour or 4 hour speach hope everything is going well for you wader a mooring is basically something to keep a boat secure like an anchor or tieing a rope on the dock bring bake rake please you guys dont care what i have to say wade this channel is literally about you talking at us i have not looked into your vids for a long time likely years especially back when you did drunk minecraft with markiplier rip hair a mans curse hope youre happy though wade watch number 10 on yutube hello me first 20 comments picks up popcorn and gets ready for future jump scares hey early almost first hey first to comment 1st yes love u wady i never clicked so fuckin fast edit love ya wade person above me o o f candy man voice thanks for giving me an idea for my drama project for school it must be a 10 minute long video spoiler warning layers of fear is my alltime favorite game but layers of fear 2 is just too much for me i keep wanting to finish it but the part where youre being chased by a demon and have to open and close doors is so stressful i kept putting it off because i was dreading it so much i love how the end purposely stalls to make u think there will be a jumpscare is that frank welker narrating o i love how much it makes you think this is a psychological horror game nice little metropolis nod in there the voice acting in intro seems like viper from dota that seems to be moreee scary than a previous game layers of fear 1 is so fking scary and awesomelet see this one tho walking simulator of fear 2 maybe some actual gameplay this time edition i hope soon with the 2 the 1 and the dlc in a disc in box 014 024034 gives me the creeps time for walking simulator 2 zoom is behind all of this final layer is gonna be shrek i hope that compositor will be arkadiusz reikowski as in a previous part layers of fear 2 titanic boogaloo i hope they also do the observer 2 when did the psychological horror game layers of fear become part of the gore shock horror saw franchise even has jigsaw as the narrator what it this is no fear 2 layers of boring is that the same voice actor for nightstalker in dota 2 is there a titanic on the top of the dummies 3rd game twtwoalready so this was the game gun media was working on i love it like friday the 13th ever existed but i do want them to make a game like friday the 13th without getting fricking sued i love this game and sad story cried everytime cant buy it i refuse to support gun media well another game for me to watch in phone and hide in comments thanks skidrow d i love the reference of metropolis vr support instant deathstroke looking forward to it i was already a layers of fear fan hopefully gun media doesnt ruin this bruh its already out like why the trailer just came out now this game would be amazing in psvr day one finally tony todd the candyman im in why is this trailer out now if h20 delirious already made 2 videos of him playing the game what up everybody this is cr1tikal not interested not really into the supernatural side of horror games does anyone know if there will be threats in this one or is this game another haunted mansion like the layers of fear 1 i thought candyman was about to pop out of nowhere candyman is back i didnt know this was even a thing till today layers of doors lul it looks quite funny common guys for once try to make the game a horror gamenot funny that was supposed to be scary its clich at best anyone thinking of fears sequel horror games are usually okay or mediocre this game is not similar like layers of fear 1 how much this game cost yoo i want obscure for ps4 it was one of the best horror game ever i miss playing it resident evil revelations copy lol lame i didnt want to sleep anyway but its not vr tho 029 for a second i thought they gonna play the mortal kombat theme my pants are sticky now psvr adaptation please this game exist pewdipietime to flashback no physical copy all i want is for there to not be a monster chasing me not a fan of that is it on the titanic i dont even remember a layers of fear 1 layers of fear was amazing and this just improves upon it mudja idi na diskord is the european union now making games ah man here we go again scary close to the sun and layers of fear 2 both take place in a ship i hope we can actually fight back in this game because im sick and tired of these horror games just being walking simulators and not being able to fight back in any sense of the word another walking simulator physical format pls didnt know this was getting a sequel i watched some gameplay of this this is a mildy spooky walking simulator with hardly any scares pass i said is that tony todds voice yes love how he was credited on this trailer yesss i loved layers of fear so glad there is a second game out why do we have to pay for psn pluss im sure its censored thanks sony theres no chungus im disappointed dayz tomorrow right waitgun media the ones who made f13 where is june ps plus games the hype is real vr please i need the last of us trailer evey time i see a game like layers of fear or outlast i think of how epic silent hills couldve been and begin to cry early bird gets the shoot this kinda scary yup i was before 200 views early i dont understand the story the first old film reminds me of jhin from league of legends what is this game all about you missed a puzzle incomplete walkthrough for the record this video was the number 3 who else is in the 3 squad i dont get this game seems like all walking at least 1st hour im gonna battle thru till end thanks for the upload fck yeah my heart stopped beating so many times but i have to ask something the lady at the end is the portrait lady in the first layers of fear hi rabidretrospectgames love ur vids keep up the good work btw can someone sub me i sub back brilliant work 3 edu vai continuar com life is strange nem acredito layers of fear 2 a ss heim eduardo edu ainda vai continuar com a gameplay de ghost of a tale quando vai ter outra live de the forager 142 cago aeee finalmente jogo de terror layers of bilada 2 faz gameplay com games edu ahhhhhh ta muito top edu layers camadas a cebola tem camadas how did you close the door so quickly in 1730 wow it was just a play q the actors face reminds me of elizabeth from bioshock burial at sea but much older and hotter uwu just a note the endings are called brother sister and madness d i would watch this with a grain of salt i thought the name suggested that you were actually aiming for a speed run but there were particularly a lot of mistakes that cost a lot of time it was interesting to say the least but maybe the name should be changed to my fastest run it would have been nice if you had included the locations of the collectibles did they include a platinum this time this game gives me a heart attack scary 00000 act 1 01750 act 2 04336 act 3 10858 act 4 12821 act 5 co funded by the euwhat i remember gt in its glory days best gaming site of all time first one to comment how to end the game on the brother how come in the description it says this game is fear 2 but this is layers of fear that is more spooky than the endings 922 the shining anybody knows that 2250 soundtrack name please would really appreciate it i disagree with the whole player has to interact with viewer mentality some people have yes what i think of as real games are intended to be played but that doesnt mean everyone has to play them these things may be real and exist but i usually dont consider these type of things games like devs and other people do and this is actually on my short list of walking simulators that i actually like and i havent even played it yet and probably never will even though i like it did it never occur to you that maybe some people prefer no commentary lp over idiotic screaming lp and blind lp with annoying people who talk or yell over the games voice acting music and sound effects there is nothing wrong with not wanting to play a game but being interested or curious enough about it to enjoy prefer to watch videos watching others play helps me form an opinion on games i may not have time space and money for some times i want to know what the game is like befo the final speech at the endings of the sister and brother sounds very poetic i wonder is it real poetry a real author or is it specially written for the game if there is an author i would like to know his name and if not in any case the work is beautiful she could easily have fit through those fallen timbers lmao is the boy the character you play as the whole game game is kind of boring to be honest these endings are creepy and i love them i would love to go through this game but it just seems boring to sit through when youre watching it thanks for the uploads mk this game is fire go follow the twitch here

poiised i can as soon as u posted this video hello random person scrolling through comments reply to this comment i love your videos almost first dang it im early pls notice me broo ohhhhh yeahhh lets get it sup bro of course godfearing and decent arent synonyms at least not nowadays people should stop looking through their present glasses at the past and shouldnt judge norms and values which were normal decades ago it just doesnt work like that when you want to understand certain events that occured in the past if you want to understand the past at all that is huh i always thought what you hear in a shell like that is your own blood rushing and pumping being amplified the elevator down was awesome sooo you guys work on this floor too you think you are funny with the commentary but you aint lmao legit like only 40 of the visuals and gameplay elements seem to actually have a thematic connection to the story being told but the games confusing because the other 60 seems to just be things done in the service of looking cool and padding out the run time it feels less like a mystery slowly being uncovered over the course of a frightening experience but rather a staccato smattering of story info in between long segments of what amounts to a haunted house set up by enthusiastic and creative but unfocused easilydistracted high school seniors games like love sam faith stifled feel so much more rewarding because of how singular and focused they are nothing is superfluous overwrought or protracted beyond where the point is made and thus they rarely feel like they drag in the same way lof 2 feels like hell there are a wealth of rpg maker horror games priced for less but more satisfying story and scare wise what are these scenes and elements in service of is question yo does anyone else understand the man in the moon reference john the dad was a piece of shit thats the twist me idk they were running away from home and were stowaways on a ship i think that was a clear sign of a bad home life idk im probably saying this as someone who had a shit step dad but like two kids running away from their abusive alcholic father and being stowaways on a ship just to get away from him valid really wizard of oz reference xd hahahaha that ace up my sleeve poker scene was so hilariously incessant i was crying lololol i also like how the voice saying it would get more and more desperate each time it literally went from aggressive to pleading in about a minute so many references your commentary is annoying i dont think ive seen john die this many times in a single video before is that a cyclops moon really dude you desperately need to go to a film history class 1214 look like a type of hell yall when he makes the voice while reading the chief security officers letter he sounds like soos from gravity falls the voice sounded familiar so i looked it up 1046 either im incredibly stubborn or johns witty banter is sufficiently entertaining to keep me watching all this time because holy shit this game is boring that gun fearing analogy explains why religions fail nice one john 3128 this fucking game and its instadeaths im not too ashamed to admit that i died an embarrassing amount of times at this sequence fear of the lord means you carry his laws with weight you take them seriously what you surrender to god and what you do for others in this life matters those who bring glory to god fear the lord you know i am frankly glad that i was raised by a single mother because it at least didnt make me have fucking daddy issues like all of these game developers apparently have edit also this seems to be a bloober thing actually layers of fear 1 and 2 have daddy issues and observer delves into it from the opposite end by playing a dad who has son issues again this is clearly a thing with the studio to the point that now we know what bloober teams blair witch game is gonna be about everyone childhood wonderment is beautiful pure and should be protected john wolfe ignorance its called ignorance being a child means you are in a constant state of ignorance this game is far way from word better than the 1st one boring but gladly john save it the perfect game for john to roast keep up the good work john these long uploads are a blessing for my stressful finals days whats better an ace up my sleeve or breakfast toast cornflakes if you look closely the house during the beginning of act 3 looks like the house from the first game in terms of layout edit wow it is almost exactly like the house from the first game the office was a real giveaway um i would want your autograph youre amazing jon the reference is metropolis fritz lang 1927 a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need a little spark is all it takes well okay satan 3324 fbi open up when it comes to jokes like these blame the times not the game 10015 i get it its the wizard of oz scarecrows brain tin mans heart and lions paw finally a fucking meme that can top red means scary its just a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need this game is so boring its basically just a walking simulator i dont know if anyone said it but i am pretty sure 14215 is a reference to the hills have eyes also im usually good at deep meaning and deep things but fuck i didnt have a bloody clue about half of this main thing i got was that there is a lot of focus about death starving kids kid shut up possible doggo getting hurt i didnt like that sound it sounded like a dog getting hurt 5727 john did you just pull a guys on us xd i got some metropolis feels during the boiler room sequence with all the mannequins edit i posted this before getting to that point john realizes it a lucky sleeve an ace up my brake thats all i need consume the ace sleeve it well game should be called no rhyme or reason scum bag dad horror new band name john you are right john a decent person does those good things because they love god and their neighbor those who give a gift grudgingly because of fear rather than love it is accounted to them as if they never gave the gift so decent does not go along with god fearing by your understanding description but it most certainly applies to god loving people one title card in particular for act 3 bloody roots is a callout to the cabinet of dr caligari which is still an amazing silent horror film its the beginning of set design and german expressionism a modern version of ge is beetlejuice c highly recommend seeing caligari if you enjoy silent films choose the jazzy soundtrack if possible tho 14222 is that an aphex twin reference looks like rubber johnny 2100 i have to agree danger is so absent from the game and weird artistic events are so common that when a death sequence starts its too mundane to even care theres no feeling of urgency in this game and im struggling to maintain interest in watching 43 49 john chill bosun is the phonetic spelling of boatswain boatswain was probably originally fully pronounced boatswain but because swain is the unemphasized syllable over time the swain part was reduced similarly english counties or places that end in shire do not fully pronounce the word shire yorkshire for instance is pronounced yorksher death doesnt always come quickly sometimes it comes in inches continue i usually love johns videosbut his commentary ruined the experience this time i couldnt enjoy the story at all due to his constant belittling ofwell everything maybe dads should stop abusing their kids so that people stop making scary games about it that bullet in the moon as you called it is just a reference to george mlis a trip to the moon thats literally all it was and it was a rocket landing on the face of the moon also the branches closing in on you at the end was a reference to harry potter and the goblet of fire and the weird whiney bighead dude in the wheelchair was a reference to aphex twins music video little johnny wasnt expecting a rubber johnny reference neat this seems more like an artistic piece than it does a horror game in all honesty i hate the way this game is confusing and boring because of the game itself trying to hard to tell the details of the events just dont do too to fill in unnecessary details haha at around 1200 the boiler room scene is a ref to metropolis a silent movie driven by its music from 1927 at 1120 i was reminded of the well from the ring 4113 lily appears to be taking the character she is playing to a delusional level using captain baynes to abuse her younger sibling the stolen flame that burns quickly is most likely the superficial character created by a person who doesnt have a sense of self and the temporarily assumed reason to live or passions and beliefs thereof effectively the torch that a person bears which the actor does not have so he must pretend to bear those of others this would tie into the earlier commentary between the pirate kids where the elder asked if the youngers heart was drenched in doubt or a flame burning brightly the growling narrator is tony todd who indeed played the candyman in all three films he also voices the fallen in transformers revenge of the fallen and plays the funeral owner in final destination 1 2 and 5 oh and worfs brother kurn in star trek the next generation this game so far is so fucking bad i felt the same about this game and then when he said honestly i think i completely lost track of whats happening i lost it because same i was just listening to him ramble about the manakins working factually there is a smartest and strongest however since time ages people and other variables factor there is always going to be someone stronger and smarter than the previous its ever changing i absolutely could not watch anyone else play this game i cant believe they used the same trope and methods from the same game and didnt improve based on any criticisms i feel this game doesnt want to be a real horror game but instead more like a interactive installation art show lol they sure are very successful on creating art and set pieces for this series story of this part hey what is this thing death 102 what is this willy wonkas chocolate factory i was cracking up with laughter as im so glad you also realised a certain youtubers ballsup shadethrown hahaha turkish langue support john explaining rat kings was more creepy than anything ive seen in this game so far 1730 am i the only one who got this dark souls 2 vibes flame dear flame with the voice of blacksmith mcduff d the voice actor for the candy man that older horror movie in the 90s or so i think starring nicholas cage or did they do a remake more recently jeez this game its all very pretty and atmospheric great production value yes but it just seems so boring the death quotes are pretentious as hell i dunno its still early i think but if this is them setting a precedent for how the rest of of the game will be like i feel sorry for you john its just another buckandaquarter psychological horror game with pt segments even but with a slightly higher budget great now ill have to watch layers of fear again thanks layers of fear 2 i get metropolis thats super old and niche but how come nobody gets the wizard of oz reference i love how the dad turns into a ripoff of the monster from home sweet home man i am not enjoying this game its boring the story is not keeping my attention and its not scary in the slightest hesitated to even watch this second video shame i think this is a film reference good luck finding something that isnt a reference in this game this game is pretentious and boring just like the first one god this game sucks well this is boring and predictible but you lp is a bomb as always no one literally no one tortured ghost dude an ace up my sleeeeeeeeeve plotter vs pantser id always heard of it as architect or gardener same premise but thankfully avoids the concept of pantsing 12944 the movie its referencing is called a trip to the moon its a french movie from 1902 that was incredibly fascinating and visually stunning for its time it was referenced in the smashing pumpkins album mellon collie and the a infinite sadness both in album art and in the music video tonight tonight it was a very short movie but an amazing use of imagination for its time and a great film history class for those whore into the arts thank you for making the decent person refrences i agree completely and once had to try and explain that to a lady who once told me id burn in hell we had literally just met a few minutes prior because i didnt believe religiously the same ways she did and told her after a comment that she made that just because someone doesnt believe in something the same way you do or at all it doesnt mean that theyre a bad person their actions mind set and intentions determine that beliefs come from somewhere for everyone but not everyone lets fear doubt or uncertainty of that drive them to do what they do in life some people live the ways they do because its how they truly feel not to use how they treat others as an excuse to say that theyre better stronger or higher than anyone else or what they deserve after death some people genuinely have empathy consideration and want to reason with others through their own free will not out of fear or dependence towards what maybe its just me but this game feels so tedious it doesnt even seem fun or all that compelling was the bit with the stew meant to be the wizard of ozish i wonder why the music stops when youre hiding in the bushes its weird seeing all these references never thought id see a game with this reputation meme so hard the person who is saying the quote must think heshe is a poet edit a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need that look at 3347 im done with life 1916 radio gaga couldnt resist it might be just me but i really didnt think the first layers of fear was scary it was fun to play but not scary that old mans voice is sooo dope so nice to hearso dramatic never see candyman right now unsubscribe ahhhh nah im joking seee it people equate the morals that most religion espouses as being god fearing when its really just being taught morals and boundaries that society accepts metropolisqueenradio gaga music video references within act 2 im here for john just being done with most horror games john wolfes name in different languages spanish juan lopez french jean lupe german johann wulf icelandic jn ulfsson japanese let me know if there are any more act 2 is quite hard to understand however thought the thing as no abused father he just went out to visit his wife grave and cos of the war continued he dead from bombs when he arrived left behind the kids who are hidding and starving at the home the little boy is the actor who building the character by remember his past otherwise does anyone noticed as sometimes james the boy called jimmy also didn t watch any theory vid jusy own created thoughts gone throw my mind i like this game from the studio do so the first was way more jumpscary and more into nightmare segments looping halway is a style and with this build the storytelling here also the notes we all know this style comes from pt as it isn t exist the loop segment is a style and i like it so much awe i love you john id whitney houston run to you at a convention dear god im so fucking tired of the abusivescumbag dad trope also what a great way to encourage men to wanna be fathers shit on the concept of the father figure of atomic family entirely in every single piece of media and we wonder why theres so many mothers that and encouragement of the irresponsible hookup culture instead of meaningful relationships and if all that wasnt bad enough we have this new falsehood being pushed that apparently 50 more of all men have toxic masculinity which is factuallystatistically proven to be untrue and it must be either unlearned or taught out of boys straight from birth even though weve already been doing that for generations so whats being used now to do that is dogmatic and sexist fuck this shit pisses me off that background music loop that keeps playing is really familiar does it sound like the earth temple music from wind waker or maybe a track from silent hill shattered memories i cant tell where ive heard that before watches this with basically the whole video covered up by my hands not out of fear but out of the fact that its 2019 and devs are still using flashing lights known to cause serious health problems in a large group of people as their main fear factor even though it hasnt been considered actually scary by people who arent going to literally die from it in ages love johns commentary though there is im scared because jump scares and then there is im scared because i dont know what is going on this is im scared because john might ruin kids day by saying santa dont exist a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need not gonna lie im impressed they recorded so many takes it got funnier and funnier hey john i was wondering if you are going to be at akon this year in dallas damn what happened act 1 was pretty interesting and act 2 is such a step back act 3 seems to be a return to the interesting story aspects again wheres part 4 john guys are waiting are you holding out on us just came here for the cool commentary this game sucks compared to the original its nowhere near as good this game is extremely boring john is the only reason im still watching 748 john dunking on my boy oscar wilde what if the father suffering from ptsd comes back and kills his wife what if the wife cheated on him while he was at war reedit never mind she died at child birth then who was shot is that sanza from got a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need fear controls a person to an extent i feared spanking and belts for doing wrong stuff until i learned right and wrong now i love my step dad this anti punishment john cant brain game devs need to understand if i have to think reaaaally hard in order to be scared the game is not scary as a fan of the first layers of fear i was really excited for this i really dug that mysterious somaish rusty lake kinda vibe from the first game as an artist i can get down with artsiness in my games heck im a fan of off a game some people would consider strange and confusing unfortunately im only sticking around for this one because i could hear that voice actor talk all day really oh and johns sarcasm lots of that please 14335 you breathe every second like breathe in breathe out in every second or something else 1 like 1 piece of food for the poor kiddos i love how john got the wizard of oz reference from the poster in the chest but he didnt get the same exact reference from the yellow brick road clearly leading towards the emerald city near the beginning of the act this game baits so much its creepy af gasp theres fish in the bathtub its eleven to twelve theres fish in the bath oh wait whoops wrong horror thing you guys dont understand this game is clearly symbolic the kids starving of hunger is a metaphor for the player we search the ship for anything scary or of substance or significance and we never find it layers of fear 2 true ending the main character walks into a narrow dimly lit hallway he opens a door bright light pours in and he can make out silhouettes of his family so how was that asks his wife eh answers main character he walks out of the haunted house attraction probably rides a better ride later and forgets all about this boring tripe what is forever if not merely a prolonging of misery what is a man a miserable little pile of secrets love the a trip to the moon by george lemelies reference at 12900 iconic scene where the spaceship lands in the moons eye damn thats great why mads from hannibal tho if this game doesnt pull some sort of crazy ass pull at the end like lily secretly is pretending to be a manhenrywhoever or something just as ridiculous this games ending is gonna be trashy generic shit isnt it well at least i dont need to play it myself now i just finished act 2 and its interesting to me how in the notes it never refers to the actor as a he or she it just says the star or the talent im wondering if thatll actually matter since the writers are definitely trying to hide that 33 minutes in fbi open up dying man it really feels the first game unlike it the first act was sort of interesting and then its slowly lost it over time i suppose the background lobby sounding music well sounds nice lol yeah the dad was the monster all along is getting really old in fact the first layers of fear had the exact same twist a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need is the new consume the flesh spice it well layer 1 oh its probably like the last game layer 2 its on a boat okay that could be scary layer 3 i have no idea whats going on and its not remotely scary or horrible layer 4 kids are kids scary when they dont seem to interact with the player character at all layer 5 was that the ending are they going to make us replay the game that wasnt fun or horrible or easy to follow at all layer 6 replay game watched in 2x speed john is entertaining but game is booting seriously this game is confusing and boring but johns voice makes it better i love how you reference the game to movies and other games amazing rooooots bloody rooooots anyone else heard that 5040 edit ok ma bad he said it after xd i love tony todd he has that natural growly spooky voice that voice actor is the voice of the candyman and so many other things its utterly ridiculous httpswwwimdbcomnamenm0865302refttclt2 i mean just look at that damn list its like hes on a mission to do everything in every genre those 21 people did not like john calling out the seashell fact xd so you said you like this less than layers of fear but in a recentish video you said you didnt really like layers of fear damn this game must suck a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need the song around 12824 i cant take seriously because its the same melody as this fucking video where this flying doll flies into this fireplace and i lose my shit every single time i see that fucking video did john make a choice when he gave away the ace jeesh this game is so incredibly boring i swear im only here for your commentary john p this game is dull repetitive confusing and just down right disappointing only thing good about it is being able to watch you play it john 12940 its a movie reference xd le voyage dans la lun a trip to the moon by georges mlis 1902 for anyone wondering what movie the first part is referencing its fritz langs metropolis 1927 german expressionism at its finest ill he honest this game isnt doing anything for me i didnt like the first game for its cliched and predictable plot but being vague and abstract isnt that much more interesting i think the main issue i have with games like this is that they dont do a decent job in getting you invested in whats happening i mean the visuals are pretty interesting but they dont really inspire fear at least not for me so we left off at some dialogue we had to walk to then we continue onward to trigger more dialogue that involves a puzzle to activate 5900 its a pirate film shouldnt that actually mean more arrrrses in the seats d no regrets the kids being called james and lily and the cup chalice on top of the giant pile of fish are harry potter references the whirlpool with the two ships is a pirates of the caribbean reference i really like this game i like figuring out the story i dont mind the pretentious quotes i love the different gameplay mechanics the art the only thing i dont like is the instakills that are dubious john is just harshly critical his name is tony todd has been in star trek tng and in the movie candyman those were real bees not much cgi just bees he had a mouth guard so they would go down his throat im surprised you havent seen that movie yet the person who narrates the film reels sounds a bit like david attenborough i wonder if that was intentional or not also im kind of disappointed in this game so far i rather liked layers of fear it was a cool little trippy psychological horror but this one im finding a little boring and confusing im hoping it all clicks for me in the final act the funny thing about dad horror is yes dads are scary when theyre drunken monsters but a shitty mother is far more scarring almost 2 hours of gameplay and no ads protect john at all costs 4955 you watching tv oh whatd you think of season 5 oh he didnt like it haha nice timing was hoping itd be like the first one i sadly cant get into this one i dont think i could watch anyone else play this game theres so much bs and john doesnt give any of it a free pass a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need consume the flesh spice it well woe to the bloody city my favorite thing about watching any of johns videos is seeing that mini angry john on his chair peeking out from time to time very ominous anybody else notice that john has been saying foreboding a lot recently or is that just me i couldnt stop laughing at the ace up my sleeve bit the house in the sequence where you found the old camera and had to dodge the fire through the windows mimics the layout of the house from the first game i think the boat their on represent the titanic i think i do appreciate that every time the guy said the ace up my sleeve line it was a different take any item even remotely resembling the first game john is this a reference an actual tribute to the first game in the form of the actual house john walks right through it several times without noticing can we just appreciate that john did a 2 hours video for us love your john you spoil us is that hermione video summary john nitpicking for an 15114 straight i dont know whether to be amused bc i love him or exasperated bc i love this game dang it the boy sounds like the child from star wars that says master skywalker there are too many of them what are going to dooo ugghh 10234 is a reference to the wizard of oz youre following a yellow brick road to what looks like emerald city somebody had some recreational time john wolfe that should be the quote when you die starting around 1219 onwards this scene is more or less similiar to metropolis 1927 film very nice these developers are paying a little hommage to this classic film my god i actually have an old flame who works at ihop me thinking that lily this whole time was a boy you can tell im on a whole type of lost watching this that no man is an island guy who keeps chiming in reminds me of the doctor from vivisector hi john i enjoyed watching your game play video of layers of fear keep posting the first part was really interesting this part just felt very repetitive boring and uninteresting i hate when games do this lol it starts off good then it starts to die down and by the end of it im just staring at the screen in annoyance perhaps they couldve cut out some of the repetitive stuff and added some gameplay or tweaked some of the earlier mechanics like the stage part i think as soon as the looping hallways came into play and revisiting similar places with nothing new coming from visiting said places it started to become dull no sense of progression the only new information that came from this hour and something minute video was that the mother died during childbirth and the father was a douchebag it doesnt require and hour to get those two facts across oh that looks like moloch the machine from metropolis at the 1208 part or the music video radio gaga by queen lol jk very cool and nice symbolism especially with moloch this game is awful normal people hides from the shadow john shadow wait for me i really like the layers of fear games but i gotta say the parts where they try to be scary are the weakest part of both of them like the story isnt that compelling either but at least you wanna keep going with it to find out what happens next yknow with the avoidrun away from the monster scenes its just like ok cool when does this end idk i just wish theyd stop relying on jumpscares for spooks and just stick with atmosphere they do atmosphere pretty well i think the act title cards and the little snippets before each act remind me of lars von trier films rate the a new game similar to outlast a video can be viewed on indiegogo look for the name of the game chernobyl inferno the killing joke step into the light that reference was so bad i understood it and didnt like it your the best john layers of boredom the first game wasnt all that scary to me this one is fairly interesting but i dont know stopped feeling it the first hour in id still be down to see more 14212 anyone still familiar with aphex twin these days its freaking rubber johnny spot on honestly i lost any interest i had in this game after act 1 but your playthroughs always make up for that im definitely watching this for john because this game is super boring what is it with games these days walk around story being told in notes and iffy voice acting and its wrapped in pretty environments these games would be a lot better if they were shorter too i hate how they stretch it out as much as they can so they can go look at all the cool things we can do filler everywhere to cover up the shitty story johnwolfe its referencing one of the first movies every the moon man with a rocket in his eye httpsiytimgcomvizz85sjovwmkhqdefaultjpg tony todd is the guy who played the candyman he was also the mortician who kept showing up in the final destination franchise i met him back in 2015 hes a pretty cool dude 5620 was totally singing it the heart brain and arm thing has to be the wizard of oz surely the hills have eyes at least thats what the thing begging for death looked like hold on 2120 far from completing the video high thinking did the boy become some kind of vampire or wendigo by eating his sister 4400 john turning into rust cohle you should check candyman out its a great horror noir the backstory is quite sad horror movies havent ever excited or scared me either actually but im mildly obsessed with them anyway i think theyre usually entertaining in one way or another even if its just me making fun of it lol a thousand props for name dropping sepultura the song bloody roots was the first song i heard by them and was also the first thing that came to mind when i saw the title for chapter 3 yeah was curious what youd think on this and how theyd change the game in the sequel i know youre not a big fan of the first game neither am i but yeah it kinda looks like i dunno a rehash in a lot of ways but with new settings and more scenery porn to be fair to them they do design pretty decent visuals but not really what my focus is in a horror game its just weird cause didnt this same studio make observer i really felt like that game was a big step in the right direction even though a lot of it was still walking simish it was still captivating and interesting guess well see if this turns around though the bullet in the moon was from the silent film a trip to the moon interesting thought john but you can be god fearing and a genuinely good person they do sort of coincide in that if youre an already decent person you might be motivated to do even better if you have the proper respect and desire to please your creator its not the gods going to kill me fear that should move ppl it should be the i dont want him to be disappointed in me fear like with a parent all for arguments sake just have a think on it first horror game to literally put me to sleep impressive john can you please play dont escape 4 i understand what the game is getting at it tackles themes of existentialism and identity by exploring someones past and how it contributes to self worth and self purpose the thing is its filtered through the lens of pretentious theatrekid try hard verbiage and edgy metaphors to where it waters down some of the actual value i think a game like this could do much better by showing rather than explaining since theres a lot more artistic and interpretive value through that medium rather than some wanna be stage performer beating you over the head with ramblings i thought the 3rd act was particularly good for that at least by comparison with the others to this day i think the best execution of these themes in art thus far has been pink floyds the wall i cant believe in the year of our lord 2019 horror game devs are still making looping hallway segments girl move yourself john just stands there johnmakes face and complains me no she said move yourself no complaining mister you seem to get anoyed by the game at times do you need a lucky break an ace up your sleeve 4018 hes playing a vampire you dungus at 1350 is that the voiceactor from hatred ever thought of playing dollhouse 5744 john wolfe isnt it fun being a literalist someone invite me to a party lol this had me laughing i love you john rooooots bloody rooooots roooots bloo what no sepultura anyone 10235 i felt more of a wizard of oz vibe heres a link to a guide for the endings in case anyone wants it httpsgameranxcomfeaturesid174516articlelayersoffear2howtounlockall3endingsformlessflameforeverendingsguide 5044 best reaction i love how the narrator said move yourself when the monster appeared and he just stood still and then got mad when he died lmfao being a literalist can be amusing at times but i believe one can derive more fun from being a semanticist for a guy who plays horror games all of the time you really dont know your clues to run creepy demon comes out of mannequin move yourself dies blames game this voice actor tony todd also voices night stalker in dota 2 same growly dangerous voice oh boythis game sure thinks its something special doesnt it 2238 finally color again 2350 motherfucker i get theyre using a lot of black and white for that old school film look but this game is way easier on the eyes when theyre using color in interesting ways rather than just making already dark scenes harder to see by making it monochrome i enjoyed act 1 but watching through act 2 i feel like my opinion is starting to slip a bit you gave that chest an awful lot of head john this game seems like a slog i definitely had trouble watching it but johns commentary makes it a lot better but oof awww yeah when i hear bloody roots i think rusty lake lol the bullet in the eye of the moon was the rocket you were on and that sequence is a reference to an old french film called le voyage dans la lune i personally know it from the 2011 movie called hugo other players faced with some creepy shadow oh shit john wait for me a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need lol no comment on actually due to the low mortality rates births werent announced until the child was one year old so theres no way the birth announcement and obituary could appear on the same page a lucky breakan ace up my sleevethats all i need made me crack the fuck up lmaao i knew if anyone else would get a metropolis vibe it would be you i loved what bloober did with observer but really do not understand the appeal of this game or its predecessor they are massively overpriced walking simulators with mediocre spooks incoherent narratives and thoroughly unearned pretentiousness the voice acting is decent the visual design vaguely interesting and thats about it observer on the other hand was a wonderful game with a terrific narrative that fully earned its price tag voice actor of candyman is tony todd im sure this was said already but didnt wanna go hunting for the comment but all of the candyman movies are worth the watch the story isnt a clear as in the first one i like the first game more as well i thought about buying the new one but meh there isnt enough horror for me not even the chasing seems to be scary if you play mobile games then you should check our forgotten memories alternate realities its a really amazing mobile horror game love that the scandalous newspaper article basically describesan actor practicing in a room by himself what a sucky life for this guy though mom dies in childbirth their father kills himself they go stowaway on a ship and then they accidentally cause deaths on a ship then he kills his sister subscribe for more rat king facts this game is rather boring this game is a mess the first was far betternot saying much tho was the well scene from the ring again i reiterate did stefano valentini direct this movie the true horror in this game is arithmetic wooks wike the wats ghot to iht befwoe us the most annoying kid voice ever since the babadook kid the more i listened to these kids the more i didnt give a shit about them and just want them to die and holy shit do the jumpscares in this just not work at all having played it for 5 hours this game is agony levels of bad gameplay you probably dont care but after you enter the big mouth door you can turn around and see 2 people holding hands and looking at you from the other side of the door why is it always that in horror games the mother dies in childbirth and then the father blames the kid and gets abusive meh the picture you looked at is called the eclypse i think this game is more nauseating than scary but youre bringing life to it with your jokes john thankyu if only this game has some invisible health bar where the enemies have to give you multiple hits before you die that wouldve made the game overs more justified because now they just seem cheap frustrating and notinagoodway surprising 14205 also that looks like one big hill have eyes reference hi i like hoe you play games but you need to learn to play right please play right and if you die in the game remember it is just a game so way are you mad do you get what i am saying mr john wolf let me answer your question with another question johndoes good and evil really exist or are we just taught to believe there is good and evil in the world and not justthings being there because of being therei mean who decides what is good or evil religion did that for usif i stomp youyou obviously do not liek that but who created evil and decided me stomping you because i feel liek is evil and not just just because things cant be proven to be truth or falsedoes that mean it doesnt exist maybe once less actual dads are scumbags this trope will fade but as of now i know approximately 20 dads personally and only two are no douchebags also heard that the sound of seashells are the sound of blood flowing through your ears etc apparently most of the bloodflowing gets filtered out by your brains though and every psychological horror game evil parents the first layers of fear applies the game where you play the baby some silent hill games too the moon with a bullet in the eye is also a movie reference for a trip to the moon 15114 i deadass watch all the ads 4 you lmao horror movies just dont get me as excited as horror games continues to make fun of the game and not take any of the scares even the tiniest bit serious for real though im sorry john but i don think im gonna continue watching this series from you i love your lets plays and im usually not one to rant but it feels like youre not taking this game serious not even giving it a bit of a chance just because its a layers of fear and you didnt like the first one and especially since i think they actually took the qualms people had with the first one and improved on it quite a bit adding chase sequences puzzles and the likes its just not really fun watching if i get the feeling youre not really into it and seeing it as just another walking simulator sorry im actually really enjoying the storytelling in this game so far sure theres plenty of tired horror tropes but it feels like theres a lot more to it than what we normally see i also like that its not as cryptic as other games like this so people like me can pick up on the symbolism without struggling too much what is this willy wonkas chocolate factory no wizard of oz ok thats enough from me lol oh he didnt like it perfect comedic timing since the announcement ive had a feeling that this is going to be average and was disappointed they decided to come back to this after observer why does this game get more upsetting every episode so dull and repetitive just like the first objectively this one is better so far had some cool moments and a cooler monster but i was hoping the devs had improved more john sometimes youre pretentious and surface level 8 thousand views what is happening this game shouldnt have been called layers of fear this should have been its own game as to not sully the original with its mediocrity spoiler break for vid i guesssss kinda torn because as hardoverdone as the dad was abusive trope is the mother died in childbirth so the father hates the child and blames them for her death even though it literally isnt their fault one is pretty close behind as soon as he called the boy a mistake i knew but i didnt catch the cyclops symbolism as meaning the dad had lost an eye that one was good i can kinda respect this depiction of coping with childhood trauma through escapismroleplaying my running theory is that assuming the mc is james he played pirates or whatever with his sister for so long that all he knew how to do was act insert some kind of tragedy where shethe fatherboth of them died and he drifted through life as an actor not knowing who he ever really was idk how that ties into this movie thats supposedly being made though obligatory komaeda lucky break joke thanks ill be here forever i wasnt sure about layers of fear 2 at first but this far in i think i can safely say its a massive step down from observer ok so since the beginning of the game it told you that if you had to run there will usually be a prompt or something telling you to run so there is no reason why you shouldve waited when you pulled that handmonster out of the mannequin that was your choice though since you decided to ignore the little girl prompted you to move yourself after making your decision to pull out the monster i dont get it though pretentious quotes careful john we dont want to ruffle up some pseudointellectual feathers now do we a decent gun fearing man lmao i loved that tangent u went on i not trying too be mean john but if i seen a fucking shadow i will run like hell and i know you was doing it for fun too and you have guts too but me i wouldnt last 10 minutes on this game i probably would have die on chapter 1 instead of finding about who is the character and what did he do i would have run away of something that was trying too get me instead john if it wasnt for you i would have closed this video and never clicked on a title that says layers of fear ever again this should be called layers of boredom layers of lard layers of doing anything else would be better than watching this crap liked the first one but the second is just pure darksoulsflamelore crap you can beat this game in an hour ending is a bit meh i think this a film reference misca musca mickey mouse i just finished this game yesterday knowing how many scenes and secret collectibles john missed kind of makes me frustrated lol 5726 nice one whats next santa doesnt exist the dad interrupting you with the an ace up my sleeeeve bit was hilarious xd xd i think i really like the colorful areas more than the black n white areas but im still curious to see where this goes i remember the first layers of fear confusing me as well until i saw more and more of it so i feel like a similar slower paced storytelling vibe is happening here too i still really wanna know who the director is and like is this the movie hes trying to film or is this more of a visual representation of what the character building process was like so many questions lol 12942 refers to georges mlis seminal 1902 silent film a trip to the moon is it just me or is this game even more boring than the first one candyman made me afraid of public bathrooms you need to watch it im confused but nice play john 12943 seemed to me like a reference to georges mlis a trip to the moon i nominate john for the worst buzzkill of the year for 2019 there are still many months left but i do believe he has won already you really should watch candyman this game is bringing back my high school cringe of hanging out with the drama club kids that took their one act plays waaaaay too seriously john the moon is a reference to le voyage dans la lune a trip to the moon a classic silent film maybe this game should steal more ideas from classic films at least then itd have ideas tony todd is in this game wow 5620 holy shit is that a motherfucking brazil reference love your vids john god fearing just means in awe of the power of god not necessarily being afraid of god im not even religious so dont me i was curious too an ace up my sleeve thats all in need love it love the layers of fear 2 series this feels like outlast 2 all over again now i think layers of fear 2 is much worse than outlast 2 was but the resemblance is sorta the same which is a shame because i thought observer was such a step in the right direction for bloober team so i had higher hopes for this in this episode john ruins everything for everyone and makes the children cry never change yes finally another video layers of fear devs hmm people called lof 1 boring because it was basically impossible to die and lose progresswell lets create every opprotunity to die die by monsters die by jumpscare die by cutscene die while reading lore die die die this game seems very layers of fear remembers what game this is again 1400 is a reference to the movie metropolis please see httpsmmediaamazoncomimagesmmv5bmjm2mtk1nze5ml5bml5banbnxkftztgwodg4oduxmzev1jpg the men move in the same pattern in the movie as presented in the game while the machine is known as moloch which in semitic cultures referred to the god who eats children this is specifically not a horror film but rather a very old seminal work in science fiction i feel like this game is pointing a finger at robert downey jr hes played tony stark so much that he is tony stark in real life im going to say that this whole thing is just a dream that the main character is having and i dont like it so far only thing i liked was the shining easter egg i wasnt a fan of the first game and had low expectations for this one but thank god they actually added an enemysense of danger in this one still feels like a walking simulator though wow thanks for the long video especially because the game could be frustrating at times d e a r g o d ive watched the whole thing i was his 299 like and his 2683 view and ive have watched the whole god damned thing please help im so tired its so late xd that furnace section looks very similar to scenes from metropolis definitely heavily influenced by it 359 but john the immersionthe immersion just finished the video it was great id invite you to a font sharing party john this game is confusing i know that the guy is having an identity crisis but its hard to follow pretty sure the room with the clock puzzle and mannequins is referring to metropolis you are a tough man to please john your lighting is different john what have you done i love how he walks right past the creepy kid in the well area without noticing him oh gosh i was so glad to see you were continuing this normally with your first hour of videos thats all you have cough cough recent zombie game but im glad youre still going with this one the beginning of act 2 feels like the silent movie metropolis a two hour episode on a

mouse club house warning watching johns video while eating is not recommended results may be a belly chuckle choking on your food or spitting on your monitor johnthis is a horror channelyou havent seen candy man drop everything and watch it now that scene of the mannequin s all operating parts of the big machine reminds me of a classic piece of vintage cinema known as metropolis 1927 please

layers of fear 2 time of course me yayyy oh im so excited for your update cant wait to watch it through i guess we could say we peeled off the second and third layer of fear ngl yall the first five minutes of pt 1 bored me should i just go back and watch it first or just watch this one thanks for the upload john reeee first clicked right away james ending is the real ending this is probably the most confusing game ive ever played but then again the level design was absolutely top class i know this is going to be buried and there are a lot of interpretations of the game but to summarize it in a nutshell after lots of discussion over it the things that are happening to the actor are supernatural and thats evident because of the mysterious items you can find over the course of the game plus a paper describing them found in act 2 the being that circles you in the formless ending is the rat queen whose portrait is seen in the first game that means she visited the painter as well no matter what ending you get lily died on the ship as a child james was the survivor he took her soul into himself and this resulted in a messed up development as he grew up resulting in the formless man he created the formless man as a clay doll as a child he eats it in his ending because hes finally ridding himself of the unsure aspects of his being he is becoming fully whole in the lily ending he shoots the doll and recoils as if he injured himself this proves that god damnit i got that voldemort ending most time i wasnt even knowing what im doing i have a theory this is a case of multiple personalities james survived that night and grew up to be a great actor however that night continued to haunt him to the point of creating another personality which is lily hence why she seemed confused at her adult appearance in one of the endings and why it seemed something attacked her in the end whenever they switched places the lily persona wanted to remain in control repeatedly forcing james in a cage to relive his horrible experience as a way to keep him at bay he eventually sets himself setting himself free and takes back his place as represent ed by lily seemingly attacked by something that came out of the chest behind her and based on what the creature said the struggle for who should control the body has been a constant struggle one always trapped in a prison of its own making the creature is a perfect representation of how james perceives himself thats why it speaks with two distinct voices thats how hi gamersprey im making a video for lof2 detail explaining but i lost the forever ending after reinstalled window may i borrow the forever ending from your video that would be great many thanks how to end the game on the brother my understanding of the endings in a tldr style flame james accepted his past and let it mold him into who he is symbolized by eating the clay doll you are what you eat forever james could not accept his past and killed himself shortly after being rescued symbolized by him repeatedly shooting the clay doll formless james could not fully accept his past and it caused him to be a miserable actor he couldnt find the fire or the spark that would bring his character to life random theory the rat queen created a formless clay doll to ensure the story of the shipwreck would be told in this theory everyone died while trying to capture the last flame of james the formless will either succeed find lilys through james or not be able to distinguish between the two when the formless fails the rat queen sends it back to try again she could possibly create a new one what does the rat queen need the story to be told for that is for us to wait and see sh check out my play through of the first game if youre interested the game is about the psychological struggles of a transgender person the director is society if you obey the director all the time you are revealed to be james caving to societies expectations you have suppressed your true self to be what society expects you to be if you mix obeying and disobeying the director you get the formless end you are not sure what you are you are formless without conviction the rat lady even says you dont even know what you are if you disobey the director at every turn you are revealed to be lily your true self going against the mold of what society expects of you to embrace your true self careful long and detailed explanation ill explain the ending of the game for those who didnt understand it i feel like a lot of people in the comments think lily is the protagonist but that isnt the case you play this game as james inside his own mind being the main protagonist of the film as lilys flame her soul within him and james flame his own the director fight to see who gets to keep his body what you go through is an artistic fucked up and hard to understand interpretation of various memories of james life while in each act except the fifth you get to make an important choice you either kill off lily and move on from james painful memories and guilt of the past or fulfill the promise he made to lily of getting her back so she can always be with him forever without going into too much unnecessary detail james mother died giving birth to him while his father was an war veteran who lost an eye lily was james older sister and the two were very layers of fear games are usually into the topics of dealing with the past im guessing lily and james ending are both real but cannot exist at the same time ofc it is possible that only one survived the accident by playing the game we are molding what really happened in there it is possible that the neutral ending is about how the real author of the story the story of lily and james got angery over you not giving a proper answer she is mad because you wasted your time by making a 50 obedience 50disobedience result its like a developer telling you that you missed the point of this game goddamnittttttttt you after getting that ending aw shizz here we go again restarts game as you are told to do so anyway they just want you to play the game either you get lily or james ending youll find yourself looking for an alternate ending choosing the game dev getting mad at you ending is pretty much not meant as an ending for you to oooh i see just 3 ending in this game thankss i love how the kids went from being british to being being american i got the secret ending without even trying lol weird game james and lily is potter unfortunately emboldened by the praise of their first games artistic interpretation the developers decided for their second game to make the game so ambiguously artistic in an attempt to mimic that same praise instead they ruined their chance of telling a coherent story and the resulting mess has come ashore as a shipwreck the basic ordinary ending is so disappointing but the cheesy nursery rhymes for playing it the right way arent much better wait isnt this old or am i missing something halo rek this plot and what happened and happening is so confusing the 1st game while you dont know everything you find stuff like notes and as it goes on u find out more and actually get what happened by the end at least more then this one or maybe im just not smart enough to put the pieces together lol what does the chest at the end with the brother or sister mean like theyre facing their past and it scary like pops opening up with scary sounds cause their past like childhood was really bad and dark lets we call this ending to james lily and formless ending i still dont know who shot jr take a bangai to fight so i still dont understand the ending of this game i think the director is james the tapes we get is someone interviewing james and hes outside and free from their father he was disfigured in the war and no one has seen his face since he desperately wants our character to realize their true potential but i also think he wants her to realize who he is which is why during the acts theres lots of pirate parts theres scenes around their home life and their room no one else would know that stuff except for lily and james he wants her to be the greatest actress and because of how she raised him because lets be honest their father is useless and hates his son he believes that method acting is the only way and that his sister is a better actress then she is at first i thought we were the daughter of the artist in the first one because of how we react when we get to the room with the easel and the beer bottles but it makes more sense that were lily to me that moment when you get the secret one first time playing d 836 this is actually the secret ending i thought it was the normal ending wtf i did not understand the game why james sound like hugo in plague tale innocence what does the blast boom of chest mean at the end of james or lily endings so who you are is depentend on the choices youve made right the youtuber ive watched the gameplay from got the third ending i didnt understand at first but he explained it and it really is a great story so it appears the lily has died on the ship his theory is that we are lily whos in some kind of porgatory she must find out what happend and who she truly is and she has to accept herself its quite unfair tho i mean she hasnt done anthing bad has she sowhich one is the good ending i did a detailed review and broke down a lot of the easter eggs to tons of horror movies that are found in this game httpswwwamandablaincomamplayersoffear2reviewyoutube can anyone tell me the name of these beautiful soundtrack 0407 i was wondering if you shoot at the lady in the 955 and then what happens i got the third ending does that mean i got the shitty one whats past is past whats gone is gone the door is shut and the curtains drawn the lands that are no longer there the dreams we did not get to share when all we love is stripped away a boy must leave a man must stay and yet there is still hope you see for you are still a part of me although the boy has ceased to be where there was i and there shall be we the holy flame it burns away it shows us theres another way let us be together forever and ever and ever i somehow managed to get the canongood ending first go i knew disobeying the narrator was the best choice what who is inside the box at the end whose poen is this i mean the first one spoilers actually heres my explanation of the endin read i didnt understand everything since only genius people can do so but as i get it the true ending is lily ending because our main character is lily update its not 100 like that another theory is that our main character is james but there are nuances lily theory the director wanted us to change the character because we can easily believe everything is real and accept any role as real thats why movie seemed scary to us our imagination is great he wanted us to wear another mask so when we were obeying him we were destroyin lily lilys part and taking role of james thus we our character accepted the part of the boy and believed hes james thats why in the final while sittingstayin in front of table main character said to jamesboy im your part or something like that i dont remember exactly but i kept the sense its not really good ending because while looking throug xd fear not guys whether its first or second your ending the the game are still irrelevant whether u seek for the first or the third u will always get what u dont want this game is so surreal u cant decide but there is one thing tht u have to fight so obey ending is the james ending and disobey ending is lillys ending so waitif you shot the girlyou would have killed lilly and played as james the whole time and got the james ending if sowowa minor choiceyet so game changing until then action holy shit you start over layers of fear 1 is my favorite horror game of all time but part 2 was a let down damn i got the 3rd ending which i assume is the bad ending where can i get the game soundtrack its so good i dont get the story can someone explain that was really fast always confuse me what is going to be in end get the popcorn and drop a like d this is like among the sleep do you remember that game delirious 3 endings 1 i dint understand cos the person was nether of them omg that is the candyman sweets for the sweet and biters for the biter are actually what he says im guessing no one realized that the rat puzzle where you release them is all the victims from the movie se7en im guessing everyone realized the shining reference in chapter 5 among the sleep vibes 1718 ok tht actually almost made me tear up n cry i feel so bad for the young lad i wish i couldve given him a hug n reassured him thts how sorry i feel for him can we get more like this please i really love these videos okay finally got around to watching this series enjoy it 2311 if u go to playback speed and press the slowest option its a creepy ass sun lot of mind fucking happened herei feel violatedgood why is he playing the rest of the chapters all at once i think the mom died when the boy was born and his father started blaming him for the mom dying and the sister was protecting him then she stood up for him and they ran away to a cruise boat and while staying on it they kept having to escape the people and when his sister went on her own and told him to stay in their secret place she was taking long and he started having thought that his sister decided to leave him there because of years of mental abuse from his father so he went on to venture by himself and all those times you hear the sister talking about hating him it was himself thinking that and repeating that and it scared him he was part of the ship going down because he left where his sister told him to stay so she couldnt find him when things started to happen 1722 delirious is so cute adorable when he tries to comfort little james this is like watching a movie i love the first layers of fear cuz its scary something and talking about art and im into art but the layers of fear 2 was a great story i mean we have a choice to do to reach the end lily or james both still a good game but i like more the 2nd 3 omg i think its the longest videos i ever seen my poor little james layers of fear 3 a musician in a school 4125 no delirious xd the wife died in childbirth thats is why father hates james because giving birth to james killed his wife i also think that lily is dead the hours on this video this was 2 hours and 37 minutes well spent james sounds like the young paddlewan that anakin killed the mom died after james was born so i guess shes mad at him for killing their mother so you start the game as the actor whos born to play this role aboard a ship the game then takes you through their past into the events that made them become this person who was born to play this role as you say the way you played determines which of the two siblings survived so yeah it wasnt all part of the play you just end the game at the play having relived your past a sad story indeed got me right in the feels what were all of the movie references in this game im sure there are some a few of us missed 15033 james she lied to me h2o its fine h2o turns to the right and discovers a box on the ground with a light overhead illuminating it h2o whats in the box james she lied to me h2o james whats in the box james she lied to me h2o whats in the box james she lied to me h2o james whats in the box h2o exacerbated inhail whats in the box come on for those who dont already know the movie hes refering to is se7en this video is super short great video that was some good gameplay im only starting to remember that james and lily are the names of harry potters parents i dont know why i thought this was relevant wow that was a perfect twist ending like the note said of who even you were playing him or she also all the jumpscares of the game and delirious screamings i got the whole story and my heart couldnt be more broken and they kept going to the theater to watch a movie and going back to the house and lily is trying to hide james from their father until they saw the ad for the ship and decided to go to the ship so what i think is that the father was working at the theater then a fire accident happen and the mother ms burns is in danger if she gives another child which is james and she died givng birth like in the paper when the death and birth are the same and his father hated james but her sister lily wanted her to be strobg to prove that he is something thats why her mother gave birth to him oh cool i like when delirious saying cassie 22239 he wants his arms back so much guys i dont know if anyone notice but from 3821 to 3827 is actually a reference to the movie a trip to the moon which was made in 1902pretty wild i would say lol idle hands are the devils playground randy jack noseworthy idle hands there are at least three separate endings and you actually are the first ive seen to get lilys ending did you ever find out the plot for this game delirious the kind sir looks like bubble buddy from spongebob took me 4 days to watch this and delirious like u i was soooooooooooo confused knew you were lillie though you shot james i think lol also liked the 1st one better as u said enjoyed it xd 019 markiplier should play that game bars 22320 i think the mom died giving birth to james so his birthday is on her death daygive birth at 13530 i was screaming delirious the playing cards prolly got the combination lmao and then he realized i was like yessss love that candy man reference if the mom dies on his birthday it probably means that she dies on childbirth also love the whats in the box part awesome video ending to an awesome series delirious this game was awesome to watch and youre awesome too i love you dude keep up with the awesome videos delirious you always make great videos that make my day awesome delirious mother died deering birth i watched the entire video for 2 hourwhile playing game on my phone i dont even know what is going on at this point xd im confused as shit 12515 my life summed up candy man this way delirious ignores him also delirious ooo a rat follows rat the scream at 2400 that scream on 2403 i enjoy not being spooked by horror games for once delirious makes it easy to enjoy ans not get spooped this was the ost confjsing story in the world the 1st one is so much better i really appreciate the efforts of delirious to make these vids as entertaining as possible but he had an uphill battle with this one nowhere near as good as the first game this one was just fucking awful mannequin hoe and teddy bear british b0y gets attacked by mind so the man you call candy man that says things creepily throughout your choices he sounds kind of like the sand tiger from aladdin where he gets the lamp i wonder if deliriouss scared laugh is the same as his laugh when a girl tells him spitters are quitters whats in the box so i feel like father hates james because when their mother was giving birth to lily she almost died and when she had james she probably died thats probably why father hates him so much just a thought 1035610402 something was shinning you missed it it was awesome totally good storyb watching this from 6pm to 1amincluding the act 1 n 2 rn in my countryits like double twists mah mannn its was worth it to watch this i love this game so much n i love ur gameplay delirious keep up the great work i think this video is over 10 minutes hopefully he got monitized is candy man you have you been to a red light district delirious lol i honestly dont get y his scary games dont get more likes cause this right here is wholesome man that

multiple endings in the game 11500 epilepsy warning would of been nice but its ok heres a warning for anyonewho is sensitive like me had to skip this part did i miss anything important here would you sit and watch the shining for over 25 hours or would you watch delirious for over 25 hours delirious can you check out the horror game visage anyone who wondered what the dragon and kraken really was in the fathers film room those are the greek monsters scylla and charybdis truly and amazing experience loved the horror in the first but the depth of theirlily and james story was well done they

delirious 14555 just realized that all these sins that youre discovering are from the movie se7en w morgan freeman and brad pitt its im like getting annoyed that delirious isnt getting the hints or story in order its making me scream at my screen as if he can hear me 5406 we have to start the whole thing over are you cereal 10420 this man always sings this song i dont understand anything when i think i got it i freaking dont insert obligatory at 10707 he missed something comment omg thus is so dark you guys were acting in a theater 2502 ive never heard delirious scream like that 2929 h2o i

sins no like from the movie se7enmaybee my husband loves games like this and i really enjoy watching him play he puts up w me talking the whole time haha hes away with the military so its nice hanging with you for a while oh i understand in the beginning he choose to kill the women and so become the women and would he have shot the man he would be the man at the end most funny part of the vid when he says james u little shit 1st one way better james and lily potter they were throwing in so many of these thanks for playing this it wasnt as scary as lofear but it was still interesting more art than a game in my eyes cheers if is titanic seriously what the hell were they thinking when making this game h20 i want to see you play jump force movie references noticed 1984 wizard of oz titanic the shining anything else ppls noticed i cant be the only one who thoroughly enjoyed deliriouss singing uh my head who touched my ass am i right in thinking the kids mum died shortly after giving birth to james is this why the dad is a fucking pyscho 5442 think skinny thots play dollhouse soon 034 idk peppa pig was in this junk thanks for a great movie delirious youre the best ever alright this is fine this is instant fucking regret perfectly fine that news paper article was definitely heavily based off of the titanic it made me think this was a titanic horror story this game full with confusion and quotes lol there is two endings and a secret ending just love it watch all the videos looove it yo non of tht was real is man a joke to u love dis series man love it all god damn long but funny and scary i love it keep up ur good work h2o great video delirious cant wait to see what you decide to play next i dont now what is going on but i love it awsome stuff dood pinche mexicano pirates in space lol treasure planet reference i love how this game references movies wizard of oz and se7en the 1st part is delirious the boy he feels shorter holy shit that scream at 2404 jesus christ delirious that scared me more than the monster 4925 you might say thats the apple of your eye d dang i though this was 2500 minutes but dang let me get some popcorn thats fucked up the ending act could it be that the deciding character is when you shoot either the boy or the girl mannequin idk its just me or someone else do im laughing so hard when delirious singing in the end whatch lt lick me h20this is a short gamecontinuse to make a 2 hour vid wait wtf is going on lolim so confused this was such an amazing game to watch hope to see you play more games like this thank you h20 for the amazing experience the story is about an actor in the early stages of cinema that is told to embody the character but in doing so looses touch with reality and self identity by digging deeper into the character so at the end she figured out the real character shes playing by living the life of the character mentally and in the end succeeded in truly becoming that character i love layers of fear at first you are thinking what the hell is happening and at the end my god plottwist i love it true fan watches the hole video you build one character you destroy the other that quote makes a lot of sense with the finale you build lily so james was destroyed fucken had to watch candyman after this super interesting movie aye i watch your videos when im eating thx i think the story was about being in james and lillys perspective but by the choices you made it ended up being lilly and so when the explosion happened she flew off the boat and landed in the water which is why she survived the ending with the play i think she took her traumatic experience and turned it into a play i dont know its just a thought i had lol the story was based on both lily and james it allowed u to play as both u decide and it gives u a character based on your choices it give u the problems of the charecter this was awesome but i feel like the first one was much scarier with laughing kid the sobbing wife and the creaky floors and rats i hope they keep making more maybe next one could be in an abandoned factory or insane asylum am i the only one who laughed when james shot his self i think the monster is the sister here i am talking to myself on how this is no game and more of a retelling of the past and why we are how we are now in the present corrupted by darkness and selfishness start of episode while h20 does his breakdown of previous vid and i say because there is more to this game than eyeballs can see your minds eye will see it all plain as day if its open so i say to myself i get it game we need to learn more from our past this is our greatest mistake we have not we are not created equal but have the ability to see all as equal and treat all as equal only we choose to ignore that and be selfish and greedy instead what we need to be doing is working together to pave the way cos once its paved its paved the path is there to see and if we light it up with our light like the yellow fucking brick road and love noone should get lost or stray off the correct life path because we figured out our past mistakes and rectified it showing all the working out and all lik love the vids man but i feel like your missing out on a lot of the story aspect the movie represents what the monster looks like think skinny thots something is wrong with me werent lily and james the names of harry potters parents does delirious not know who the kraken is wait wait wait those are the se7en murders weve had a shining easter egg and now se7en what there are 2 main endings 1 secret ending as well also the director is not candy man its a woman actually the woman from the beginning of the game that you see take the little boys head off you find that out in the secret ending 1900 holy fuck thats the same house from the first game depending onnyour chouce delirious one survives or both im not going to lie the ending is confusing as hell and it bothers me was it all a play was it the hoops the director made you jump through and it caused memories to surface what was in the chest at the end ive seen all the endings after i googled what the ending meant and they all make little to no sense as to what really happened throughout the game since the game was so vague on just about every other plot point it makes it harder to make a stable connection to said character i know that whoever you are determines what the posters look like at the end but the whole it was just a play really isnt clear what was a play and what really happened i dont mind when the ending is what you make of it but usually there are things that will let you know this could have happened but this could have too this has nothing like that and it bothers me but it could just be me 15756 who tells your story dang wish i had popcorn 20700 how his oh no starts compassionate to oh hell no run away lol was one of the best moments ive seen lol love the movie seven easter eggs in this game the longest video youve made is four hours mad max are you cereal i am so lost loved the video delirious thinking of skinny thoughts 5442 who else wants some background music dols whant to reap you i love when he calmly apologizes to things trying to kill him lol that one messed up play when you saw them eyes i was holding teddy tight h20delirious your the best youtuber you should get 1000000000000 subs now i live to please you delirious listen i dont want to be pleased like that yeah we love you james and i love how delirious reacted to what james was saying so caring lol youre the best delirious the devs were obviously fans of the movie seven i liked the little nod to the movie with 7 deadly sins but interpreted in their own waynice touch love the content h2o awwww its over was able to pause it was actually a demon dragon looking thing the screams are real imagine a layers of fear vr game it would he kinda hard but they could make it work just so you know the candyman is actually the director and there are 3 endings purely obey the director purely disobey the director and switching between the obeying and disobeying flame forever and formless the key scenes are in chapter 1 choosing to shoot the man or woman chapter 2 taking the meat chapter 3 shoot the girl or puppets and chapter 4 with the flooded hallway maybe worth checking those out 3 if possible please upvote so delirious can see this thanks loved the playthrough u i think this story is about lily and james when they were kidsamazing video by the way ok so explaining time lily and james were children lily being the oldest james mother died in birth according to the paper james father hated him for it blaming him for his mothers death you play as an actress who was called upon for a famous director todd thomas he is candyman who directs lily and tells her what to do you the player chooses whether to listen to the director or get absorbed in your part and listen to james soo candyman is the director trying to get you into the roll im not too sure exactly where the story takes place whether on a boat or a directing studio 2 hours of delirious how awesome keep up the great work3 think of skinny thoughts think of skinny thoughts gets out of the tight forest moans oh i love skinny thots try this game h2o its called days gone im sure this takes a lot of work but more 2hrs of videos would be pretty amazing to see p but again i know thats a lot of work so i really dont blame delirious if he doesnt 2537 thats the first jumpscare ive seen in this game that really got me good yup its about wizard of oz there was the tin man the cat arm was the lion and the brain was the scarecrow 5940 if delirious is coming for me im opening up the doors making a meal and buying balloons its gonna be a party so if im right the mother died giving birth to james on the news paper the burns family welcomed a son on february 4th at 2am but the mother died that same time which is confirmed when lily is talking to her dad about it being the day and james birthday as far as which character you get if you fight against what mrcandyman says you get lily because she was also strong and took charge doing what he says would be james because he followed what he was told so depending on what you pick its either james or lily dying in the game i bet if you shot the girl in the once scene it wouldve been james in the end i think what really determine who you are is when you shot the guy manikin two hours and now freakin five mid rolls delirious i paused the video and the thing that rushed by was a weird demon thing with tentacles think skinny thoughts think skinny thoughs i do i do every day loved watching you play this i thought it was so good x deliriouswhat will be the next horror game on your list the way i see it it jamess birth killed their mother so jamess father resents him for it basically it sounds like hes become a drunken poor broken man remembers the beginning where he shot the tied up guy in the chair instead of the girl i wonder if that made a differencelike you set your fate when you did that idk either way love these longer videos xd my favorite part of your scary vidoes is when something creepy or weird happens you go silent sometimes look around then chuckle nervously lol the mother died while giving birth to james thats why the father doesnt like james because he misses the mother deliriose why you coming for lil jimmy he didnt ddo nothing wrong me candy man told you to do something and you did the oppositewhich you called apound this thing its like a movie and a clown main character so what if the other ghost we have seen were other passengers haunting the wreck so lily james is running as a ghost and other spirits shehe sees that are haunting herhimare also spirits running through a similar endless hell sounds like mother died during child labour the mother died giving birth to james i think all the posters you collected were moviesplays that lily stared in james looked to be trapped in the end while lily survived i love this series but more tabs i like how delirious completely passed by the lever oh my wow what a game what a story anyone know the story im so confused thought i grasped it and now the ending as boggled my brain the mother died giving birth to james anyone else screaming this holy shit the ending that one hell of twist oo me when i play hide and seek and i get caught 2537 this has to be one of my favorite play throughs cant wait for more well this seems to have a silent hill vibe to it i think it was about lilly getting lost in all the roles she had and confronting her tragic life that made her a movie star the death of her mother when her brother was born her fathers accident and subsequent drinkingdrug habit running away aboard the ship only to lose her brother when the ship sunk this whole thing is just her trying to prosses it all in the back of her mind while trying to answer who is the real lilly delirious play in steam animal royale the mother die while giving birth to james lmaooo 2402 is the most girlish scream h2o has ever done delirious did you notice that the 3rd act is all the rooms that are in layers of fear 1 because the first layer is on the kitchen then bedroom then basement child room office and bathroom and the last door you went in is the artists painting room where u painted the wife i do 3 hour plus vids nearly everyday p great vid didnt know there was a second layers love the first one this game is freaking hurt my brain who else thinks delirious should do vr the mother died because she fave birth to james and the father hates james for it every time h20delirious screams its so funny this is so much like the first game in that as youre playing its hard to tell fantasy from reality there is so much going on with hints at a demonic deal made with james or possibly james causing the crash i think so far the truth is james and lily burns are siblings that lived with their father their mom died when she gave birth to james their father was in a serious accident that disfigured him their father became an abusive alcoholic james and lily ran away to escape their father aboard a ship when they were going to be found by the crew the ship sank one of them managed to survive and your choices decide the rest o best play through for this game wow what a ending the game referenced afilm called seven you play as james lilys younger brother jamess mother died during his birth and his father abused him and his sister lily protected him from their father and they escaped to the ship where they were eventually found and lily died somehow james became an actor only at 3618 he is saying skinny thots my dude 2h and 30min im so confused someone please explain me the ending love these game plays when you sit back and play a game like metro and all the other scary game like this its brilliant love the videos keep it up delirious id love to watch him play the exorcist legion vr bet that be funny scariest game ive played you not the only one confused delirious that ending violin music is so beautiful chapter 5 gave me a lot of vibes from seven more scary games plz instead of popcorn ima get some dip cans can you play madden 19 in the next video 5453 think skinny thots love that u put out another single player game no offense to ur friends but i love having u to myself at some point where hes solving puzzles and then a jumpscare fml i cracked my screen or what if lilly started killing people layer of fears 1 artist layer of fears 2 actor layer of fears 3 unknown 4108 its showing that mrs burns died at 2am deaths while giving birth to her son at that time births i believe that was james i dont think lilly was just killed i think someone found her and saw a defenceless young girl to take advantage of and james witnessed it or something like that vr layers of fear 2 yall can see it coming the watch time h20delirious will make so much money gate the a litte do you get nithgtare bro theres 3 endingsyour choices made yoi become lilly and james diedother choices and your james they both ran away from their abusive father and one of which died in a ship fire theres also a bad ending where you dont know who you arr from doing things randomly good job deliriousthis was a fun watch the story so far at some point there was an accident with father where lost his eye then the wife dies giving birth to james so his father resents him father abused james lilly was the only one there for james she liked to play pretend and they would often sneak out of the house to see the stars or to watch the movies she stands up to father when he is abusing james then one day they ran away to start lillys pirate stowaway story on the boat where they are getting hungry the crew finds out that they are on the ship lilly goes out looking for food she never came back james starts talking to an acient being who says lilly is dead james finds her and they run from the flames but she gets traped being rubble james dies and lilly flees from the boat as it burns she grows up to be an actor and became very popular until one day she is told she has to play a part in a cruise ship which brings up memories of james and of her father that was the play pretty sure if you shoot the girl in the first act the ending will be that you are the boy thank you k that was a long but the best creepy vid delirious awsome lets have more long vids please and keep it up delirious can you play more friday the 13th or dead by daylight these episodes deserve more likes the hell intro to layers of fear 2 delirious style this is what scared me the most literally a second and a half later shut up grandpa shut the hell up h2o delirious more like h2o hilarious no no one ok ill stop to quote my man patrick the starfish if were underwater how can there be a fire when delirious say go play it yourself i was like hek yea then i realised i have a core 2 duo laptop processor with little to no graphic card crying from inside guys crying from inside love these long vids this is a like freaking movie yayy 4251 and 4929 are the same maze honestly speakingi cant remember of a single horror game where teddy bear was not there we seriously need to have an investigation on the teddy man i am confuzzled that was good now time to rewatch the first one the candyman sounds like sweet tooth from twisted metal man in every game delirious always finds his teddy bear anyone get the story of the game im confused like delirious liked it a lot also im pretty sure that whenever you walked out the recording door outside of the ship lily was talking about the choices you made thought that was pretty neat at 3830 is the moon from one of the first movies ever made its pretty cool i believe you can still find the film on youtube somewhere its called the man on the moon one of the best highlights is at 2536 when he opens the wooden chest only delirious would go this far for his family only delirious you should do another scum video you should made a movie im only an hour in watching but so far i think that lily and james father was in the war and there was an accident and he survived and the mother died while giving birth to james and the father has resentment and hatred towards james update the father lost his eye in the accident i think the display should be mini player mode lilly was a litte girl afraid of the bif wide world he sounds so close holy shit that was a long video no complaints 7 deadly sins her head was in a box hay delirious for 759 i this making the brew it is the wizard of oz the brain was for the scarecrow arm for the lion heart for the tin man and each of them like you found out stand for sorrow sadness and well for each of them together you get a ether depression or a monster of the mastermind after this 2 12 hours video i just lost idk what to do next 10710 did he see the brain this game really reminds me of the conjuring house i have exams to study for mahn reee youve gotta play murder mystery like the game where youre on the yacht and playing your friends i think this game is not only for entertaining just like what demonic pug said but it has a code a meaning and its very nice and i think that is very deep its the way that always founds you maybe h20 didnt notice all of them but he certainly found some in the second video about the fish and the gold and he tried to be funny but h20 makes it the way that he sees it the funny way dont get the wrong idea i love him but this the only thing he must opens is eyes for we watch this video because he is funny but didnt laugh the 2 videos normally i laugh a lot yhea thats all pls dont say things about me its my persinol opinion this is more longer than the avengers infinity war aww men i just remembered i you 3000 so heartbreaking a way out is sad as hell wow mind blowing ending has anyone actually seen the movie the crooked man that shit is legit scary madness sin within from pacific rim holy shit 2 hrs of content thank you for playing this game and taking the time to upload delirious and im looking forward to the release of the plushie you posted on insta leave a like if you care for james comment below me if you think delirious screams are manly great great stuff as usual you make the game h20 yes confused is the right word shout outs from saskatchewan i think the moment that you choose who you gonna kill the man or woman is the moment who to live james or lily because you kill the man then james died and lily is your ending scene just a theory im not sure tho i thought that it was james grown up who acquired multiple personalities from the trauma of his life that the journey was him shedding the masks he has worn to hide from the pain to find his true self that it was lily was disconcerting because there were little to no clues to lead one in that direction by the way i believe his father was wounded in some war ww1 and that he blamed james for the mothers death she died in child birth sorry to bother you delirious but who draws your thumb nails they look lit can u play tabs mod factions i suggest the exotic tribe mod first i think jamess birth killed his mother deliroous nother tabs wtf that was all a show my brain is splodin hey delirious have you try all secret untis vs all normal untis 12144 people who watched or played batim will recognized this but i bet this scene were also from other movies and games did we all forget that h20 has a sister you should do a video with sister lirous lof1 was way more terrifying layers of fear 1 was terrifying but layers of fear 2 had the saddest timeline love your vids h2o other than that your vids are the best ever you can make anything funny keep up the good work h20 delirious has the scariest laugh ever i am more afraid of him than anything else jesus christ tap dancing on a chinese whiskey bar on a full moon 2 and a half hours i didnt think you had it in you delirious creator we just made a new layer of fear number 2 delirious ah shit here we go again i was soo sad then felt so stupid 23135 are you serio that killed me d 5442 think skinny thots think of skinny thots think of skinny thots oh i love skinny thots delirious 2019 like if u made it this far into the video i was up on tial 40clock each this ran bed because i hade werk in morning but i think yeh you liesing to candy man you will get a dithint ending does anyone think that young lily sounds and looks like emma watson delirious i must say you knowledge of cinematic arts is actually astounding keep up the awesome content i gots the popcorn the way the father treated the son made it seem like the mother died from birth the whole time what happens to lilly its easy to know if u are him or her just check under your pants what if it was james all along and he was playing the parts as lily the whole game is about creating ur character if u had listened to the candyman u could have become james instead of jameswell it was decided on the first part where u shot the boy manequen instead of the girl nice game though nice to see some horror game in the hot summer u know getting the chills on ur spine really cools u down lol i knew that was the ending with all that poetry great seven reference whats in the box delerious is literally the most underrated lets player delirious this game is really awesomehope you play more games like this love long vids like this still my fav is home sweet home how da fuck 2 hours feels so

that again couldnt stop laughing about the whats in the box reference lol maybe later of fear would do that next 7 deadly sins anyone else getting a vibe this game has a lot of areas that are from the movie seven love delirous but this game has a lot going on the story isnt as easy to follow as the first one i dont know why but james looks like one of the children from the 60s movie village of the damed r u still cursing ive been not watching ur vids for 4 years 21223 its like delirious and cartoonz play mortal combat d popcorn check teddybearcheck planketcheck soundboard of me snoring so my parent think im still sleepingcheck light off uncheck i think im ready h20delirious can you shout my youtube out at king savage lowkey missed these play through videos 2403 that scream theres so many crows screaming in this movie i wasted 2hrs with a shit ending lol h2o back in movie he is a good actor too damn the wizard and the oz took a dark turn 2 and a half hours of h2o delirious grabs popcorn watching all the videos at once took a break went to the bathroom got some soda im ready i dont understand any thing but it was a good game are making a movie why the hell do i have the feeling that i seen this somewhere before but where already got popcorn now i need a nightlight and a little amount of courage to go fullscreen we want him gone and we dont love that boy and tell to him to leave now dellirious please make a little nightmares video anyone else love the reference part to the first lofdamn more block and load more more more think of skiny thots 5430 me checks for new episode also me sees title and screams from joy this one was good but very confusing if it was all just a play and yes the first one was definitely way scarier going to watch that one again this in vr i would shit myself hi delirious can you play days gone made it through this long video like if you did too delirious army this is why we love delirious vanoss already posted a video of granny simulator with you but ill still watch yours instead of his i am confused could u maybe play battle block theater again 1728 omg delirious is being soo nice to james i cried cause it was a beautiful moment for white noise wene u r the killer where am i where are you i may be right behind you this is possibly one of the best stories that i have ever seen thank you for posting this amazing game deliriousmy longest video ever menow i can enjoy your videos longer 3 delirious you should play edge of nowhere its like a third person vr horror game i think you would love it 1400 scared the shit out of me no lie i felt the shivers and crawls down my spine i shook and widened my eyes i couldve ran 2403 he screams like a girl i wonder why he did it all in one video woke up to this beauty 2 half hours delirious you are a mad man thank you omg i made it was fun im so thrilled to see another upload thank you and keep up the great workmuch love all these movie references are making my inner geek go crazy those seven movie references though dont stop doing what you love nice love it oh yes i love watching these videos always will be here 3 2000 another blues clues reference i think james developed a split personality of his sister after her death and was fighting to put himself back together telling himself as the candyman that its all meaningless and the person we see at the end is james dress as his sister pretty much failing to be himself like his sister would have wanted or igniting the flame although he keeps trying why the box opened although james gave up a long time ago that why he killed in the fire oh dang get da snacks and drop a like weve found our movie power is out for the neighborhood and what better way to pass the time than this your timing is perfect delirious thank you battery life dont fail us now father so cool im waiting all day wtf are you playing i dont have time to sit and watch this long ass vid delirious this is starting to look like a really great story the symbolism of the warped house with an abusive father and all its just awesome 2404 he screamed like a girl wtf the ending it was a play and i thought it was real i cried those sons of bitches but it was funny how delirious reacted never ever has my heart and feelings been played with that ending got me all messed up now at 4050 it shows that mr and mrs burns had a son and that mrs burns died the same day and time the son was born so i think it was showing that their mom died giving birth to the son assuming its james and thats probably why the dad was so hard on him hahahaha 5445 think skinny thoughts delirious can be so slow lol he couldnt put the clues together that the mom died giving birth to james and because of it the dad resents him its funny lol delirious will you ever revisit the sos game i loved watching you play delirious im scared but not as much because of your comentary you scream to much delirious get a bird xd 2404 what is that kind of scream lol the crooked man step forth as he rain the crooked bell and hes crooked soul spiralled into a crooked hell murdered his crooked flannels and laugh a cook it laugh 406 13225 push harder give birth h20 hehe love your vids keep up the good work oh long johnson here we go lilly said during the rocket ride that james is gifted by setting thousands of souls on fire the fire of the ship killed nearly thousands love this video thanks for being the best youtube ever getting my popcorn now you make your viewers feel as if they are there with you i love that about you good job man delirious this series is absolutely amazing keep up the good work i am so confused that ending gave me goosebumps and then went away after that reveal 2 hours pin this or die is anyone else watching this in double speed awesome its twisted its sad its awesome im still at work but im here just to listen to you going to have headphones on you can make me laugh the creators of this game clearly got their inspiration from movies i wonder if delirious is excited for it chapter 2 just realized im at an hour and 50 mins omg h20 this is so interesting since i forgot this was over 2 hours long that shinning reference was surprising redrum thank you for another playthrough del i love you omg yess a long h20 scary video i solved it james becomes a film director no one literally no one me and delirious at same time we just found a letter we just found a letter we just found a letter wonder who its from between you and a horror movie i choose you watching this at nightfoik i probably gonna get nightmares one day you should finish far cry 5 my absolute fav thing about delirious is when he screams and sounds like a crow the near ending was so hard for me to watch i have a phobia of the ocean and the ocean depths other then that amazing as always delirious i love you h20 delirious these videos are insane and funny thanks for uploading them the storys done at what cost the cost was was time but not a loss the ending was strange with the unlocked box was the child truly lost we peeled back the layers actually more of a tear until next time when we peel back another layer of fear i am not crying there is something in my contacts bro i love all you video tho very brave to post such a long video i like when you post this type of game to watch and follow the resident evil posts were awesome and left me wanting i aint sleeping tonight yaaasssssssssss i didnt think this was that scary the first one was better at 2312 the thing is some cat thing i feel like it all depends on who you shoot from the two manikins from the first video then the story builds on from there since you killed the boy james you ended up being lilly im curious to see if you kill lilly would you be james at the end congrats on the 1st long video delirious you make me laugh bro where are the screaming crows i just watch a 13 hour vid before movie time and by the way h20 delirious thanks for giving us this long bless video xd have a great dayyyy can you please play block n load i loved this series eekk everytime delirious whispers it gives me chills 14700 20038 intro this is what scared me 1 second later delirious shut up grandpa i think you were inside the head of a method actor for this game expects the video to be like 40 minutes sees its 2hrs and 40 min long i uhhhjesus thank you delirious for using your time to make this 2 hour video for your subscribers h20 delirious play last year game bro last episode lily said she battled cyclopses and killed beasts so did she fight her dad who is

keep up the good work this is the longest video ever thanks h20delirious another great video and time for a another beginning i left a like for your bravery to actually play this scary game from 2403 to 2406 was i the only one who heard him scream like a girl but bounce back to his scream xd so the kid at the last cutscene was lilys son and if maybe he build jamess character it would be his daughter that would represent lily welp just abit curious who spot the movie seven im already dropping a like because i already know you worked hard on this video at least 13713 is a reference to the movie se7en with brad pitt and morgan freeman 4803 my mind roll out if you know you know i love when he plays the horror games he gets so into it and it is still funny while being terrifying did you guysknow delirious is a movie himself my phone died before i can finish the video 5020 reminds me of the horror game that delirious used to played befire call the home sweet home wow delirious has be like a pro u love skinny thots keep up the great work delirious love you and all of your vids wow what a twist i love skinny thots longest video for this year we loved any story ideas out there i believe you are playing james the entire time and he is the one with the eternal flame and through his tragedy becomes an actor himself with the line about a thousand souls being the people who watch his films and this entire game is his recollections of his life a burdensome task he endures to cleanse himself before he takes on a role heavily distorted by his broken psyche from a hateful father and sometimes painful memories of a sister he so loved i get the fact his mother died when birthing him and his father laments him for it but i believe the evil lily voices were some sort of negative view of himself brought on by his shameful past as for her fall i honestly dont get that i originally thought she left him behind to get food suffered a deathly fall and he never knew the outcome and could only rationalize it as an accident he could have stopped but then it showed them running on the burningsinking ship id love to hear your idea wow this vid is so long im just as lost as delirious great game but i agree the first one was a bit more scary but this one got me a few times awesome content i love that i just spent 5 hours of my day watching and catching up play more horror games i

ill be needing some popcorn cuz this is not just a game this is a movie bruh make a delirious scared compilation from this series 5449 i love skinny thots also the reason the childs birthday is on the

dont understand what this game is about wasnt the moon part was a reference to georges mlis thank you h20 delirious cause i want to watch more of layers of fears 2 thank you the one thing about

broken or something hey h2o your the best hi everyone first make this blue if youre thankful for four parents im gifting subs early af first first dose this take place on the rms titanic you did a great playthrough i briefly watched someone else and he didnt even do half the exploring as you did maybe he wanted to just get through as fast as possible and not pay attention to the actual story so happy to have found your channel you have such an enjoyment when you play a game that i do feel we as views can feel that were playing it with you thats not the candyman although it probably is thats philosophical venom also those portholes are the scariest part of the game youre my favorite gaming youtuber and this is one of my favorite horror game series so this is an absolute dream have a wonderful day to you and anyone else that sees this so in that light sequence your literally an actor trying to avoid the spotlight if this is touched on later in the video than sorry for the redundancy but i liked that little touch dang my man youre skinny now love your vids man im a trump supporter and dont care if youre gay keep it up man thats a great point about the common villainplayer trope in these games is bad father says a lot about us as writers and as a species great playthrough kravin it was hella enjoyable anyone else see similarities between observer and lof2 the enemy looks very similar to that cyborg wolf creature lol walks into a room filled with a canvas on an easel more canvases paint brushes and booze bottles i wonder if this is a reference to layers of fear 1 umm im going to go with yes i love those types of game but i cant play or even watch without feeling motion sick it sucks ahh layers of fear the first one was the video that brought me to your channel love it that fucking voice i believe in you scared the shit outta me redbull sponsor this man the absolute glee that beams from your face when a spooky thing happens i feel that lol yay tony todd hes the best tony todd did narrate this game btw ah man i really really want to love this and i hate to be this person but for now at least i really think that the first one was better dont get me wrong this one is still gorgeous and the use of colorlight is amazing but eh the first one had something so special about it and i dont know if this one gets me in the same way hey mrkravin apparently all the music in this game was recorded live with real violinists and instruments no computers or fake music pieces at all the producer says it adds a new layer of depth for the immersion compared to the first game does anyone know the name of the song at 3014 and at 4406 loving this game play a lot haha also your reaction at 10445 lolxd had to watch your playthrough first before i watch johns i know he didnt like the first layers of fear and i didnt want his attitude to get me down if he didnt like this one either thank you for all your hard work watch out for icebergs yeah i just looked it up to confirm that is tony todd im really digging this one to me it seems like the girl in the story was protecting her brother maybe they were being abused so she would act in her real life to keep her mind and james off of what was going on with them or similarly they are escaping their abuse and the girl is acting so she calms down her scared brother yes thats tony todd first thing i noticed about his game love ur vids layers of fear was the video game that intruduced me to you back in the days with the cool hat actually miss that one hope you have a great day good sir feel like this game might be a metaphor for method acting omg kravin i just saw this on sale on steam and was like oh cool i wonder if anyone has played it and lo and behold you came through my man haha 3 love your content 10140 i think those are deck plans for the queen mary mmmh guess im not the right audience and i admit i havent played or seen the first one but this just doesnt do it for me and i failed to feel any slight interest in the game all i could think all along was oh scary mannequins oh a tortured artist oh random cryptic dialogue whenever you pick up an item thats supposed to piece out a story that sure is new add a few sudden and super loud jumpscary sounds and that almost becomes a annoyance really sorry if that sounds mean im not trying to be hateful or negative im just genuinely curious as i feel like im missing something oh well you were the one playing the game so it still was a blast to watch in any case o not gonna lie the glitch monster was scary af the little girl sounds exactly like the older sister in one of the fable games lol the one where she calls you little sparrow layers of fear led me to your channel so excited to be watching the sequel so my lengthy story theory so far aside from the obvious youre dead or having a breakdown is this the protagonist the actor is the boy among the two kids who escaped an abusive father the harsh captain in his story because his sister grabbed him and left they stowed away on a ship without sails because modern probably heading for the united states i think the sister may have died during that trip either by illness killed or possibly by fire something definitely happened there that made the trip turn incredibly traumatic instead of a journey to a better life that his sister planned it to be that is why our protagonist hates the sea as his american agent says when he books the gig for him his sister probably had this game of pretend either as her own coping mechanism or as a way to try and protect her brother if she died on that journey it would have been highly traumatic for a young boy he adopted her coping mechanism himself denying reality every step maybe the actor is the little boy who shot his sister by accident not finished the video yet epilepsy warning those flashing lights are mad bright i have a feeling that this might be one of those instances of how the actor goes too far to be the part kind of like black swan and such i am 100 convinced that is tony todd the actor who played candyman too what i like about this sequel is that when the creatures kill you its not just a move forward of the story this time when you die you start from the last checkpoint and thats better i hated the last game because the horror part was just a jump scare fest but i did like the story their next game the observer is my favorite and just seemed they improved imo and it seems they improved again with game and im excited to play this layers of fear is how i found you i loved both you and the game hmmm maybe you arent the actor but rather the director thats what its starting to seem like from the smoke room and the kids memories eek just been watching queen mary haunted ship spooky vids ahhhh i loved watching you play the first layers of fear im super exciteddd for this theres a sequel yes are you gonna finish a plague tale i got super hooked on the story and would really like to see you finish it love it love it love it love it love it love it i havent watched a mrkravin video in a long time you look different like if you thought it was going to be a plague tale ttbut i am watching this one too xd room is smokey cause its a smoking room on a boat they had them on luxury cruises 2430 ok so is this game spooky maybe its spoopy droopy or anything elseoooopy pl tell me i gasped so deeply i almost choked when i saw this was uploaded i was pretty much entirely uninterested in lets players until i found you via layers of fear wading through the sea of over reactors made me believe there was no hope until i found you a few years ago haha you remain my eternal favorite you did bring me to a handful of your buddies who eventually grew on me as well i should have gone to bed thirty minutes ago but instead im watching this i both regret and have no regrets great video keep it up i never knew they had made a second game also the sound youre looking for is a pair of wet rubber gloves like for cleaning being wrung together hey that fans a old emerson 77 series desk fan will u play it again where u shoot the other figure i love and enjoy and like your videos that you make for us to watch on youtube mrkravin so excited for this i love this game so much its almost painful how close you were to actually doing sos on that morse code thing its tony todd by the way he played the candyman in the original movie i love his voice he can make any character seem mysterious and menacing when he wants to good ear it is tony todd voice you noticed your first layers of fear gameplay was the first playthrough of yours i watched and instantly made me a fan super excited for this i loved the first layers of fear u look so great i havent watched u in a while but i love this style of games last layers of fear wasnt scary i thought it was sad and depressing yay i didnt even know this was coming out i have bedazzled the shit out of my rock though prettiest rock to live under ever dont tell bob that giant magpie bitch 1548 nononono good god no i have an intense fear of the deep ocean soseeing that hallway where everything is saying were going down caused genuine panic just fuck the ocean blah this one is gonna be hard for me isnt it excellent yes so glad its here let me just grab a cup of tea oh my good i started following you because of your gameplay of the first one and now this hello im woo hoo omg all the peeps playing it i am so happy i could fart first youre lucky i love you kravin because i just preordered this game but will spoil the first hour because i love you no give me the boss fight lol really enjoying the storytelling of the game i havent watched the whole way through yet but im wondering if the monster is the father sometimes im not sure if youre lily or james most of it points to being james but then you have sequences where its lilys inner monologue so confusing apparently you grew some kind of lovecraftian horror in that flower pot some of the scenes look like harry potter movie and the scene in the room with three doors looks super like mario game oh no chris please you cant do this to me i need to see the end implore you oo it might be too late for this depending on how much more youve recorded and i cant remember if youve come across this in the other episodes but i believe if you try to leave the hub before playing the movie there is a cut scene that appears lily sounds a lot like the young haley mills whoever it is doing a wonderful job as is the young boygreat voice acting i like the non black and white better toostill engrossing this part was more fun i think that the color density is reflecting the increased memoryit is more real as you regain yourself through memorythat was probably clear as mud this chapter really reminds me what remains of edith finch beautiful surrealistic and melancholic i wonder if the lack of connection to the main character in the first act is deliberate instead of the result of poor story creation because an actor should be a tabula rasa a blank canvas when it comes to adopting a role the character hes supposed to portray is foreign to him outside of him he is not supposed to carry his experiencesburdens to a character but rather adopt the mannerisms of the character onto himself in a sense the character shapes the actor and not viceversa at least thats the idealized version of acting i feel this dichotomy between being a blank canvas for the art and carrying your own colors into it to tie it more into the first lof game is what the two paths represent the path of the director is to be the blank canvas let go of the past in a destructive and absolute manner make the role shape the actor the path of the sister is to remember your past and let it shape your art the actor shapes the role on a personal note rather than j chirs please play the dark pictures its really good i noticed the brain is on the scarecrow the tin heart mannequin had an axe in its back and the mannequin for the lion was feral these ingredients are scarecrow tin man and the cowardly lion then they lead to the emerald city i realise this game isnt everyones cup of tea judging by your recent poll and im prepared to wait for the ending but i really want to know what happens im enjoying it cant wait for the next one always enjoy your vids as i quite like the format you edit them in the dad reminds me of one piece like he ate a devil fruit can u shut the fuck up 2 seconds put down that crack pipe 4717 that sound wanna watch godzilla 2 again this game is confusion its not like layers of fear 1 its not that horrific my theory is the boy suvive after lily died and become a actor now here needs to pretend to be the main character in one pirate movie that his sister loves but to build that persona his memories from his childhood are come back the second actor looks like the moment they escape from the house and needs to go to the ship for some reason they have a lot of problem in the path because of foodmaybe is scarse because of the war the poster the movies and the designer of the cinema suggests this happened in the ages of 304050 and the accent of the kids are from imply they are from england if this is true that moment in the elevator with the manequim probably represent the work class on the factory that they have to pass to arrive on the ship and my last point is the last slide probabily they father loses his eye on the war i think its a great game but it become harsh to know where to go without loses some collectible like pages slides posters you are doing a great gam this is one of the better games ive watched in a while is the ship just a metaphor for the escape mechanism the children needed to survive the trauma and tragedy of their childhood a fantasy world in which they had some measure of control and after lily i assume died jimmy simply carried on pretending and assuming other personas his dissociation was eventually sanctioned by the world when he became an actorthe actorwho is the protagonist i dunnoim lost lol while the environment is lush and the gameplay is interesting at times i just find the story and the characters flat i cant seem to develop empathy for them its a good thing that youre so entertaining chris this game is very interesting but a little confusing on plot the bw sequence was a little too much but still good thanks for your play through subbed to see its end layers of fear got pretty metal good stuff i appreciate creativity and uniqueness in games that was an amazing act the huge oneeyed skull looked so fantastic and all those little details like the paperboats on the ground during the chasejust great im still thinking about the mannequins are we also some sort of a lifeless empty person when were not playing a role or is that how we see other people the story is very interesting you missed something at the end of the hedge maze it was sitting on the slab that was tilted overanbody know what it was my current theory is that one of the kids died horrifically as a child i go back and forth on which one i think is more likely and the player character is the surviving sibling who becomes anyone they want to be by pretending to be the dead one and using that persona for their acting this game is boring af lol nothing against you cju 1734 you made me laugh the lord of the rings with the mouths this chapter is much better then the other two boring ones as many mannequins in this game as dark fall 3 also im reminded when you use the electric plugs of observerplugging in the tvs and yeahandross battlelike a trip through ol times this episodecept were way beyond mode7 here bro act 1 was a bit of a slow intro to the game then 2 nearly put me to sleep but act 3 was brilliant hope they continue like this one act 3 bloody roots also known as the tim burton inspired act i think one thing that i liked about this act is how some of the mannequins are animated in a way to look stopmotion in one of my horror game ideas i had this thought that the enemies would move like there in stopmotion but wasnt sure about how ill be able to do and whether it looks like so seeing this act was good at giving me an example of a stopmotion look in a video game my thought your the same person as the first character buy when u were young could be way wrong i played the first two acts myself and honestly i was bored as all hell decided to watch the rest of the game here lets hope this game is more enjoyable to watch than to play ayeee love the videos thought saying actually after every couple of words is you know gword checked yep the narrator sounds like vin diesel alannah good reason to see the vid layers of fear one did have a monster which was the manifestation say of your wife and the one here is a manifestation say of your own unshaped charachter awful gameloved the first one but this one is a total disaster resident evil 2 remake which is exactly that had a better chance at goty i hated the chase sequences i wanted to get lost in the world around me like the first game the instant deaths and chase sequences just ended up annoying the hell out of me also you dont need any collectibles for the good ending it only depends on your choices with the director this audio mix is rough im looking forward to hearing from you about subtitle english i like you but cant understand 100 what r u saying the first one was an overrated walking simulator how is this one different the writing in this game is phenomenal layers of audio 21 i didnt catch what you said that child crawling scene feels extremely disturbing for some reasons cant quite explain still get chills its hard to take yall seriously lately haha you mentioned the room games that earns an automatic like and favorite furboy has returned on act iv love the game so far act iii was awesome does this one also have the baby man painting more like layers of nope the room i love those games totally agree with this being the best game ive played so far this year if i hadnt had technical issues in re2 that may have taken it but dat sound design tho i also love that era of film and music so this was perfect for me great review 910 layers i wish rather than a hand icon they animated an actual arm and hand for me it breaks immersion its fucking boring sadly the first layers of fear was boring not scary at all just really slow not for me watched 2 hours of gameplay and was bored out of my mind omg that music is soo irritating that table had more pixels on it than a japanese adult film what really draw me out of the firts game is the fact that you cant die at all which makes the game pointeless it becomes a really numb experience knowing no matter what you do theres no penalization woah a good horror game not bad more reviews please dont feel like you have to review every game just a little criticism its probably just because i have hearing loss but when the dialoge is overlapping it can make it really difficult to hear the review must be a newbie who edited this video the blonde dude on the left looks really bored a trans person on inside gaming fuck yeah love the vid but audio qual is lacking imo the overlapping audio makes it hard to hear and enjoy the video love the reviews love this review and all the other ones the game audio was way too loud at certain parts i couldnt hear lawrences insightful musings one of the first things out of her mouth is a spoiler nothing scary happens at the first part of the game imagine this in vr i like how funny this review is i honestly think you guys are blowing this game way way out of proportion to the realms of parody i love you guys at funhaus but this game is in no way goty material its still enough good for what is which is a walking simulator good but not perfect the atmosphere and story it wouldnt have been so bad if only the abusive parent trope in this one hasnt been done to death already by literally every psychological horror game ever may be the only redeemable qualities of lof2 but gameplay wise its not for everyone and its definitely not for me ie walking around picking up stuff and watching jumpscare with loud noise happen cause loud noises are scary right everything that im talking about here is better explained by youtuber john wolfe and i feel the exact same way he does about the game go watch his gameplay videos on lof2 youll like his honesty and the fact that he doesnt ham out a fake reaction for views like literally love the review game audio is a bit too loud when you guys are talking though loved the first layers of fear and currently playing through observer right niw and seen layers of fear 2 on the xbox dashboard and was super hyped and cant wait to play it i refuse to entertain the idea that a walking simulator is contender for goty is this video sponsored okay you guys can fire alannah now better than sekiro she still hasnt even passed senpou temple how would she even know this is boring your boring me thats some high praise coming from the quintessential gamer nice review i wasnt going to play it but this was such a glowing review i own but have never played the original so i guess a doublebill is in order alannah layers of changing doors sounds exciting games like this are hard to not spoilpsychological thrillers can rely on the gravitas of small pieces of info because nearly everything is presented in an ambiguous way im not upset but just conscious that knowing the main character is an artist or that theres a chase element may spoil some of that self driven fearanticipation seeing inside gaming videos makes me wanna be a gaming journalist so what do i have to look forward to i think id one of those who would not enjoy this game because im not really for this scary stuff maybe aside from resident evil nothing happens but its scary lmao get real wtf kind of name is kdin gtfo youre talking nonstop way too much guys without necessarily saying anything useful tone it down the music in the background the whole time is rough fam i dont have any friends though i played layers of fear 1 right after i finished soma and oh boy was i disappointed not scary at all gonna pass on this one background game audio is overpowering especially around 1415 onwards ironically during the game audio discussion not a fan of walking simulators i did play the first one but wasnt that scary im excited about the until dawn sequel which is also on a boat dang the first ever goty that you can get a better experience watching instead of playing it yourself another walking sim lol well maybe not the puzzles look a bit more in depth with these ig reviews maybe use the ig music i noticed with this review and the last one too using the game music is more distracting than immersive cant wait to watch someone else play this an artist going crazy vincent van gogh playthrough i love that background music sound mix is a bit rough imo id appreciate a lower game mix going into the future not as bad as rage was but still not to my taste the scariest thing for a pc gamer is dropped frames and the game made that into a monster fucking hell im sad there wasnt a furboy reference rage 2 review original upload music flashbacks i think that observer definitely helped the team to make layers of fear 2 something more than the first one lemme see what this click bait thumbnail is about this time musiclevel guy is back woo there is no collectible ending my friend 100 this game already haha nice to see christine chan on the show lmao with death stranding and modern warfare launching this year this game can fuck off to the trash bin fear much like ogres have many layers its your job to peel them back oooooo scary wary hallway is now a spooky wooky evelavator oh god no is that another empty dresser drawer how will i ever survive jesus christ is that lamp facing a difftent way then it was before man this game is way too scary for me gonna be a pass and a hard one for me sorry death stranding is the winner for goty geoff will be sure of that it will be a goty only if adam play it 1418 game audio is a bit loud here okay who edited this you put scenes with characters in the game talking over lawrence talking and he gets really hard to make out at times man is layers of fear 2 is distressingly scary based on the gameplay video thats a hard no for me it looks great though walking simulators games without gameplay i really dont understand the horror genre why would i actively try to scare myself being scared is not pleasant at all also if we remove the horror thing from the game most become escape the room games or walking simulators do people experience being scared differently like do you feel anything else besides i wanna teleport outta here yesterday someone pls explain game looks great also there really outta be a law against starting a reply with so i have to play thisnuff said lawrence and alanah most beautiful hosts i love the first layers of fear but this game didnt do anything for me i didnt find it scary and the chase scenes just made things frustrating to the point of altf4 im currently at act 3 and im giving it 35 so far lawrence where do u get the anime shirts scary corridor the game 2 this would be amazing in vr also traumatizing best game so far this year give me a break i love these ig reviews you guys dont review every single game and you really go hard when you do review a game keep this up your review dont count because it was not made in vr the music is a little loudrepetitive in this video especially near the star otherwise good first was soo much better imo everyone writing comments now havent watched the video i didnt play it myself but based off the stream i watched of this game a lot of the scares didnt really hit home for me but some of the visuals in this game are stunning i can appreciate the slow pacing but the usually slow pacing has some kind of payoff and it didnt really in this game im sure if i actually played it i wouldve been terrified at certain parts but it seemed pretty lackluster to me is furboy in this one turn the background music down for gods sake its named background for a reason can we have alanah costreamplay with adam for spooky games moving forward my report card in high school was a lot scarier than this game htown in dis hoe first dont panic just a bonus video streamed a horror game for a laugh and thought youd enjoy seeing me get spooked by mr squiggles spoilers beginning of game youre an actor end of game surprise youre an actor love seeing you play scary games hope to see more in the future fave magic boy gets to be a scaredy boy too top shit right there dont feel like youre disappointing your audience by uploading something besides magic this was a good video and itd be great to see you play other stuff and branch out merchant such a polite boy closing all the doors behind him how can you play this with the lights off d intended to commend just for the engagement algorithm but this is legit entertaining video i think merchant can pull off most nonaction heavy games pretty well judging by octopath rpg and this adventure wonder if he likes platform games metroidvania or strategy this is great the occasional variety playthroughs always spice things up 13908 nothings ever just a wiggly dude my mercantile friend i know i might be late to say this but you might wanna put an epilepsy warning on this in the future because of that blinking strobing light i got this game for free during a free twitch prime event never got around to playing because of the twitch client never works well with my internet so glad to see the game finally there i have you youre completely ditched dont you know that in the service one must always choose the lesser of two weevils he who would pun would pick a pocket weevils really your accent is amazing out the way squigglyy imagine this game in vr this was a fucking nightmare to watch last night it scared me more than it did you fucking living dolls fuck me up i swear so we reached the walking simulator eh welp good luck to you merchant and i hope that this whole youtube thing pays off for you im out thanks for the entertainment nice to see you take your rightfull place as the heir to pewdiepie this was a great change of pace from the normal magic content hope you decide to do more in the future this game feels less like horror and more like edgy slam poetry when will devs go back to real horror hahaha i thought he was just a wiggly dude merchant 2019 i think this is the first full game video so far i could be wrong idk but either way i loved it i liked this you should play more games sweet video my dude merchant the movie top tier really enjoying this this video was super super awesome i still gotta watch most of the middle part since homework calls but damn id like more of this more often as its a nice change of pace you got me into stander all over again i heard that if you like this video it will really help merchy out and get him more subs is this a new format wow wizards went all out for the new update these new arena updates are pretty cool i heard that if you like this video merchant will officially become a variety streamer first looks cool sweets to the sweet quote from candy man who is also the spirit voice in the game noice i love scary movies but scary games are too scary for me so i let chu play them for me hehehe the visuals in the first game were sooo cool and so scary the sequences so unique i would like to know how the game would go now if you had made other decisions this game was garbage you dont have to be modest idk layers of fear will always be special to me this here is okay i guess enjoyed the last act i tenderly call biosoma though good game overall dont feel like it beats the first one though some portions of the game were okay while others reminded a lot of the first game in terms of the weirdness and awesome transitions definitely enjoyed your playthrough keep up the good work cju i think the issue with this game as opposed to the first lof is that the first one wrote the story and made the visuals fit the story here it appears that the visuals were made first then the story the problem with that is that even though its visually stunning it ends up being thematically and narratively confusing and all over the place not really allowing you to become immersed in the game chapters 14 determine what ending youre going to get im not sure if the main portion of chapter 5 changes based on your ending i would think not since i do believe theres an item to find in chapter 5 on a ng file flame ending do what the director wants at least 3 times forever do the opposite of what the director wants at least 3 times formless do what the director wants twice do the opposite of what the director wants twice great game to be honest the story is rather disappointing and you cannot have a disappointing story in a story driven game right directors narration started to be annoying around act 3 and around then i was sure that the ending was not going to be satisfying because it seems that whoever wrote this didnt really know what kind of a story they want it to be overall 610 maybe i got bored of this i think the best suggestions i see so far are the silent hill downpour suggestions its widely considered the best game from the series after 3 id also like to see you play re4 i agree with the others cj please do silent hill downpour please do silent hill downpour it was a wonderful visual experience just lilys death was not very satisfying for me i expected so bad things and then it was just boom dead that was way too undramatic but everything else was very well made i cant decide which lof is better i like both very much thanks for playing this cool game it was just great you should play draugen being as the game designer i ambeen in school since i was 17 im 26 now i have seen many many flaws with this one stillnone the less not a bad story i quite enjoyed it actually that was one long walking simulator with 50 black and white screen and darkness to be honest this game have no added value please play a plague tale please dont worry you just got finger banged essentially that commentary is why im always here so when can we expect the full documentary life of the migrating apples when it comes to seeing a new game for the first time i do think you give the most enjoyable experience commentary good and witty reactions are genuin all in all enjoyable ride will you play death stranding i will not be able to buy it and you are the only youtuber id want to watch the gameplay from i watched another youtuber play this n u got a different ending d cool 1853 you are hereby informed that the iwf has blacklisted this video expect to hear from our solicitor lol im glad the ending clarified some of the story for me lof2 was much more a gorgeous visual experience with nice mechanics than a gutwrenching horror gameand thats okay the story was unfocused and had lots of extraneous bits and i was never able to feel much empathy for the characters of course i am a coldhearted biotch your joy in playing chris always makes watching worthwhile now i want to play migration of the apples the game of the movie i think the fairest way to describe this game is that it fell rather flat it muddled through the beginning failing to really set up anything struggled through the middle part with precious little to work with and finally tossed the big reveal onto the center stage in front of a crowd which had mostly either left already or fallen asleep out of sheer boredom this compared to layers of fear which featured a strong beginning where it set up this broad canvas an amazing center part where its beginning to dawn on the player what horrors must have unfolded filtered through the eyes of this madman then finally the shrill crescendo where the nightmare becomes all too real you got the flame ending which is when you mostly obey the directors wishes my theory about the protagonist that mightve been lily instead is actually still valid in another ending forever the person who steps on stage and who looks in the mirror is her so the vagueness about the protagonist and whether it is james or lily during the game is purposeful what is your favorite movie or genre it is lost hopeless just like you have you thought that its perhaps because spark is underwater cheeky af hahahah very good series as always i like how in all the poster at the end the woman is missing very interesting keep up the great job lily and jamesaww poor souls i did get attached to their story and i loved the voice acting the game is not bad overall its good however comparing it to layers of fear 1 i think 1 was better layers of fear 2 is completely abstract even the endings is confusing but i think thats the magic of this game its confusion and abstract way of telling a story like the game said you are formless and you are whatever they want you to be props to the game for sticking to its main topic from beginning to end talk about taking method acting to a whole new level aw cju you got one of the bad endings i think its like you expected the vital point is where you kill the man or the woman you chose to kill the woman which leads to this ending thats all im saying the migration of the apples your legendary run lock the door lock the fing door wow i never knew sinks could be musical instruments i was shocked to see that there was a sequel to the first game and needless to say im not disappointed i love the idea that they delved into the role of acting as the theme this time it does fall short in some aspects as compared to the artist from the first game but it excels in the story of losing ones self and the psychosis behind it i say bravo i agree with you chris i thought the first layers of fear was better although i did like watching you play this game thanks for playing this game how do you listen to the 6th cylinder though if the game ends there my favorite moment in this entire playthrough i am one of those people who is not a fan of this game but i do love the first one is when you said in the previous part how much for the chain seat it makes me chuckle every time i remember you saying it at 2115 i think those are words inspired by tools forty six and two and then later when the director says how many times have i tried to put the pieces back together it reminded me of tools schism i mean i could be reaching but its so similar and i think those songs are about self awareness and transformation into something better finally it is over been waiting for this whoa i didnt expect this thank you papi time to either confirm or prove wrong my theories finish it i want to see the game finished please finish this game u cant just not finish a game like this 3 hours in sean come on first time leaving a dislike on a video of yours your subscribers were waiting like hell and the shining reference also really with the galileo reference jack just called the wizard of oz a willy wonka reference bro im dead wheres the last part im eagerly awaiting the last part of this game please im eagerly awaiting the last part of this game please im eagerly awaiting the last part of this game please im eagerly awaiting the last part of this game please im eagerly awaiting the last part of this game please im eagerly awaiting the last part of this game please im eagerly awaiting the last part of this game please why didnt you finish the game will you ever finish this game i want to see the end why u no play the rest finish the game jacky boi were the next part what it was in may and now is january where is the end omg guys the house that jacks in in the beguiner of the video is the house from the fist game layeres of fear 1 its the end of 2019 is this series going to be completed i reaaalllyyy want to know what happens at the end of the game pleeaaasseee i want him to play the brand new vr version of this game what happens wheres the rest please record the rest of the game jack please finish the series jack wheres the next part at jack u hasnt uploaded the next part for 6 months why u dont finish the series vvv its sad he never finished this considering all the hype the community had over it but i mean if he wasnt having fun with it then i understand i know its been a few months so im not getting my hopes up terribly high but i do hope you finish thus game it didnt seem like there was much left still lots of love even if you dont 3 real question here so do the people still begging for him to keep playing this game not understand that its very possible he dropped the game because he didnt yknow enjoy playing it the fact jack didnt realise the parts of the stew was like a wizard of oz reference pains me the brain for the scarecrow the arm was the lion and the heart for the tin man maybe im wrong but thats how i see it it might be the wizard of oz play i know by now he probably wont finish this game but still wish he would jack we are begging you pleeeeaaasseee finish the game our irish potato i wasted 30 bucks this game blows does anybody know what if he even knows this series was abandoned like outer wilds jack why you didnt uploaded the next part its been months end the series why your voice is louder than the game just one last video on this pretty please anyone know where i can find a finished series much sad very irate tears and longing this part of the game is so confusing for jack because hes not taking his time to look around and find the letters that piece the story together hes just running from one room to the next could you finish this eventually unless you dont want to then play the games you want his last top in the morning next part please better late then never jack finish the game please the plot she doth thicken like a fine soup though im not a big fan of soup thats not true at all you shouldnt talk about yourself like that i know thats easier for me to say than it is for you to do but still who lilly i dont know who you are talking about where tfs the next one i have to say after a very disappointing act 2 i was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed act 3 even though jack didnt continue the series im hoping as i play now act 4 it will continue to get better jack pls finish the game please finishhh never finished the game 4341 ohh i get what happened to their mom she died while giving birth to james thats why the dad resents him please continue the game anyway i think the mum may have died giving birth to james so the father is holding a grudge and cant stand his son he may also be a little mentally unstable because of his job perhaps having to pretend to be someone else is driving him insane or maybe he played roles of characters doing dangerous things and theyre represented by all the mannequins being all weird and hurtdead so he doesnt really care for his children and when something bad happens on the ship and they run out of food the kids are on their own and have to survive and the sister may be turning it into a play the mr hardy etc thing to entertain her little brother so he wont be scared i doubt that were playing as james tho because weve seen him around the ship right i think the ending wont be 100 clear just like in the first game but its fun anyway i really hope hell keep playing part 4 please oh its dorothy the brain the heart the lion wow im dumb please continue this i was really enjoying this playthrough so far much better than the first layers of fear i was waiting to watch this when the playlist was finished but now i guess it wont be this game is really interesting yet i feel like jacks not that into it anyone else feel that 3929 i literally did the same thing with that hiding spot in my lets play lol i guess we wont be finishing this one i dont care if there is a next part i didnt like it anyway the first layers of fear was so much better this just ing sucks where is part 4 finish the game please im excited for the next part please finish the game its so good just throwing out ideas but i think that you play as james grown up the way i see it lily was saying how her brother would be a great actorin her ramble saying he could set hearts on fire and make thousands cry and i think in the beginning your character said he doesnt like ships in a letter but he couldnt give up the part and seeing young lily and james are memories of when they were stowaways but thats just a theory jack starts talking about stew my stomach growls what about part 4 will this be finished finish this please come on man this was such an awesome game for the love of all things sacred keep going its driving me crazy when is going to be the next part v id love a part 4 please sweet baby jack i didnt watch part 1 and 2 since i have a rule of making sure i get a full series before i start i am just here to check out whether this is the last episode or not but apparently i was mistaken judging from not seeing any end credits when i forwarded the video at the very end deathnt when is the next paaaarrtt please sean we need it3 i mean unless you dont wanna lmao have a nice day do you know de we the music in this game kinda reminds me of sally facekinda i love this game please play more jackaboy 3 i think jack may have forgotten about this game like he did when he played the first layers of fear if thats the case then its kind of funny in a way yeah do another soon jack im watching this in the dark you can see part 4 right here plz plz plz jack we would ever so nicely like a part 4 are you going to finish the game 2446 is it just me or does the hanging guy look like gluttony from fma finish the game hey jaaack when is the next episode d be pretty cool if you finished this please finish this game this was a great story ads really ruin the flow of the videobig time sir please make another part i was actually so into this please you cant leave us hanging jack where is part four boy its the wizard of oz not charlie and the chocolate factory you saw the emerald spire with the yellow brick road wow this series did not get many views 0 318 jack how dare you i didnt wanna know jack has the french flag behind him do you think that the father is is the character in the first one jack like due to he lost his wife and he painted a picture of her and so these are like his kids so he may reminisce of his kids now or maybe your playing as lily part 4 please dont leave us hanging sean ok so i know this video has been out for a while now but did anyone else notice that the house in this episode the one where the player keeps going back with different keys isis very alike the house where the first game takes place i hope you finish this game it seems so interesting and looked forward to part 4 he never finished this game we need more layers of fear 2 jackaboy we must know more please 3 please to finish the game no body better say that stupid do you know the way meme or so help me god i will hunt you down and murder you will we see the next chapterwondering wheres part 4 where is the end of this damnit so in this act you are the boy james we learn the mother died while giving birth to james and the father treated him badly out of hatred of killing his wife tries to forget the wife as well im presuming and the other acts you are playing as what i can only presume is older james who is an actor to get away from his true self or how he viewed himself worthless ans such so kids go on boat as stowaways and start to starve and it showed the actor struggling with the dog for food but james was the onw who was saying he let it go and gave up perhaps the older sister died on the boat and is bringing the actor through all the memories please finish this unlike the observer i like thw story telling of this game i want to know who is who and what is what please its a good different kind of game but still good the rocket segment is a reference to one of the first films ever i think it was called the man in the moon or something of that sort please jack part 4 dont leave us hanging 4427 i think its the monster man from the movie the hills have eyes i cant wait to see you play more when you have time d i hope youll play more of this theres not that much left and i think its a good game jack wtf finish thisssss lol i bet he wont upload the last episode even past a month i know that views and likes have dropped but we want more please a end this please when is the next part oooo its been about 3 weeks now i the deformed guy in the wheelchair is a reference to rubber johnny the original video is old af but has resurfaced recently its pretty creepy and weird like this game theory i think the player has always been james sounds like mom died giving birth to him and dad turned into an abusive asshole so lily took care of him so far so obvious i think they stowed away to get away from dad boy obv things went wrong and i think lily is going to die james survived and drowned himself in acting in becoming other people since he appears to have no real sense of selfidentity i guess he becomes lost in his roles and james just ceases to exist wheres part 4 i really hope you finish this series jack though i understand if you dont have time at the moment or just lost interest it just seems like a long way to go through the game to just leave it at the end i also understand the pressure of views and such kind of has to drive what you choose to video which is an unfortunate truth to entertainment jobs i think this really isnt as fun and unique as the first one someone tell candyman to calm down 3833 when jackie boy saw his septic eye conveniently placed on a rock sooo is he not finishing this or are we having a repeat from the first layers of fear game where he just forgets he hasnt done another episode for a while 3140 easter egg reference to the films called trip to the moon and the impossible voyage silent films from early 20th century creepy as fuck wheres part 4 lol yo jacka boy whats sup man why isnt there a part 4 where all curious part 4 pleaseeeee ive been waiting for weeks waiting for your p4 i want to know the full story pls heres to hoping for a part 4 more please i understand a bit more now in part 2 of this series i thought lily and james were friends who ran away from an orphanage because of the poverty that seemed to be plaguing the area but this episode showed that it was their father who they ran away from probably to pull them out of poverty the father gambled but normally he worked at a movie theater the kids would sneak into his work place to watch the movies he played hiding in the balcony that was in poor condition the mother died giving birth to james and while lily saw that as their mom giving everything she had for james their father on the other hand resented him for it one particularly bad moment was what i guess caused lily to take her brother and stow away on a ship to run away from their dad i still think that you play as james as an adult going through his memories as a child im guessing that james became an actor because of his sisters imagination and her belief that he could become anyone he wanted and i the fact youve left this series for over two weeks makes me extremely uncomfortable we need a part 4 please thats not a dog thats a deer finish it omg been enjoying the series hope to see more i cant stand his voice what the fuck happened to the audio they ruined this game fuckin its not scary am i the only one that heard root vag i feel like the boy james is the one youre playing grown up that all the stuff lily said was about him becoming an actor just as i get invested in this game you abandon it really hope you finish it sometime soon please do a part 4 before i dye your hair orange this was low key mental coping mechanism for melife is hard rn and welli love when you play ganes especially horror please finish it wheres the fourth part story driven games that are cut off right before the conclusion are the best when is the 4th part coming out hello jack have you forgotten this game it has been 2 months since the last factory vid can you pls make more jack that series whas chearing me up when i had sad days part 4 please jacka boy im in love with this game so far i didnt like the first one cause i thought it started strong and then it got really obvious and full of random jumpscares this one takes longer to piece the whole story together i have my theories but im gonna wait till the end to see if i like how it ends sometimes games movies books and stories in general can have great beginnings and middles but terrible endings doesnt make the whole thing bad but its really disappointing when it happens im cheering for this ending to be coherent with the rest of the game so far i know jack said he was confused a lot but i guess when youre playing you pay less attention to certain things and it can get confusing as a viewer i think the story seems relatively sound so far but told through numerous metaphors symbols and perspectives which even as a viewer can feel unrelated sometimes anyway cant wait for the next episode ouch the little boy calling himself weak useless and better if he was never there hurts poor kid dont want any child to ever feel that way i have a bad feeling he stopped this like he did with another horror game i love your fanf vove gams you can do more please where is part 4 im dying inside lol whens part 4 going to appear hope we get to see the end are we getting a part 4 when is the next part coming cuz this is one of my fav series please give us part 4 please finish the game dude is this gonna be like layers of fear 1 where he forgot about it and didnt play the next episode for like a month where is part foir oh come on finish this game plsss let the water flow like the shit in my britches bahahah finish the game maybe you do switch roles between characters maybe youre the man at first the girl second and the boy last maybe thats why you shorten over time the girl is shorter than the man and the boy is a child but thats just a theory a game theory why i have the feeling is he gonna back i almost missed the wizard of oz reference thanks comments i love the wizard of oz is it just me or does some of the sounds and music remind you of fran bow theres a section where the subtitles drop out whats being said there team i think that the dad was abusive and neglected the kids so like they couldnt leave the house to get food or else theyd get beat the dad never fed them and the part where you shot lilly i think the dad killed her and shes just a ghost that jimmy sees to make him feel better i dont know dropped the game like observer series for not having enough views nice i love the poetry in all this this part was annoying having to repeat sections constantly hope you finish the game jacksepticeye how long do you think it took to realize that the brain heart abd claw are all related to the wizard of oz if i only had a brain a heart a home the newrve the kids are dorothy without a home they stay without a home is my guess the stew is like a witches brew amirite maybe its an alternate reality where tywin hates cersi and jamie they caused the death of their mother out the womb instead of tyrion i love you you always cheer me up when i am down thanks sean i guess well need to watch another youtuber so we can find out wtf is going on jack its air making the sound not blood in your ears layers of fear part 4 somewhere wheres the rest of the playthrough where the next video to this w so sad jack doesnt continue this serie plz play more jack you play as the actor the director is rumoured to be broken and to put the actors in his films through weird stuff to make them go method and get into their role he spoke about his finest work a story about a broken soul that needs a new soul to be broken in order to portray it the dad was congratulated for being in the war he was sent home with injuries the girl called him one eyed that dummy was groaning as if in chronic pain the director and the father seem to be the same person it seems like his new film may be about his own story or the story of his children lily and james and hes preparing you the actor for the role lily and james harry potter reference were stowaways on a ship security is hunting them because the captain did not want any stowaways the children were forced to hide and steal food but this resulted in more security to guard food meaning it was harder for the kids to find food not sure what happened there anyway the directors w excited for the next part jack where is the next p a r t i feel like its not gonna get another part just look at the views please do part 4 jack we need to see how this plays out 210 he spoke and scared the hell out of me cause it was so quiet jacksepticeye makes scary games funny why didnt you check for the peep hole in your room from part two id like to see you finish this game d i really enjoy and am interested in this game series please continue it 300 isnt it captured its freedom kind of an oxymoron im not complaining just sayin okay but i need you to finish this seriesplease and thank you i hate fake fans that pick and choose what to watch if you truly supported jack you would watch every video look at the views on this video the fake fans are strong but me and everyone who had viewed this video are true fans so thank you for supporting jack no matter the content please sean finish this game i think the kids mother and father are the actors on the movie poster and the mother died and they think that the father killed her so they wanted to follow him on the ship in secret and set the whole ship on fire as revenge cause she talks about how she thought her brother could burn a thousand souls cause he felt so little so she let him set the fire and in the beginning the letters and stuff show that people gossip about the actor killing the other actrice from the movie he played in jack you missed so much this chapter where is the last couple episodesss oml i noticed that the mannequin that was gambling with the father was the one that sean didnt shoot when he was given the choice between two maybe something else couldve happened if he had chosen the other one to shoot instead jackson please finish this series did anyone else expect anti to appear in any of these videos or was that just me xd uhhhhhh part 4 2344 is that an amnesia reference this game reminds me of resident evil 7 maybe its the protagonist we never get shown the face of or all the documentsobjects to pick up or the monsters appearing out of nowhere chasing you or having to crawl around under things and in the walls or the shadowplay or the general grossness of the environment idk kind of kingdom hospital music at around 19min wheres the ending where is the end 535 splish splash i was taking a bath do do do part four please as much as i dont want jack to discontinue this series i dont blame him the story doesnt make much sense to me whatsoever and appears all over the place ive read comments to help me understand what the acts were ie the black and white section the wizard of oz so i know these are all from movies which fits with the theme but its just not intriguing unless you know these movies which i do not its not very scary besides a couple of moments and besides that im left more confused unlike the first layers of fear which i began to understand as the game went on kind of a shame but i can understand if jake doesnt want to complete the game because he didnt seem very immersed in it as the game went on i also understand vaguely what happened with james and lily but im curious as to if she died of starvation or if she died by getting shot with a stage prop which turned out to be real explained in one of the notes thats found are you going to have another episode soon took me a second to realize the roots bloody roots reference great taste in music jack its barenstain not barenstien is it me looking forward to the next part wheres the next episode jack please dont give up on the series that man on the moon reference its funny he thought willy wonka my thought before he said anything was emerald city in the wizard of oz lets see catlike claw a lion a tin heart and a brain thats a wizard of oz reference i should think i just realized lily james layers of fear 2 lily james harry potter when he said then your stomach hurts why does my stomach hurt i was messing with my stomach 858 thats the emerald city when he said john locke i remembered lost dude its been all most a week please dont quit on a good series like you you quit on the observer he hasnt mentioned this but the gravelly voice tony flippin todd candy man night of the living dead 89 soooooo many small but memorable roles over the years crossing many genres bruh wheres part 4 056 its the berenstain bears notices lights jack the po po they coming please dont stop playing this game sees a yellow road scarecrow and a brain me its the scarecrow from the wizard of oz jack straw jesus sees a mannequin crawling like a lion with a cats paw in front of it me its the cowardly lion from the wizard of oz jack bear sees a metal man with an axe and a heart me the tinman from wizard of oz jack oh you got killed who killed ya sees the emerald city me jack its willy wonka me im out im done so my theory for the game is lily and james father was a good father and husband until james was born because his mother died in childbirth james father was unable to deal with it and blamed james and lily became his protector at some point they ran away lily saying it was a game to get james to go along with it and they stowed away on a ship james accidentally lost the food they had and lily stole food for them but after the food got locked up they slowly started starving and lily gave james any food they found until finally she succumbed and died fastforward james grew up and became an actor because it was easier to play other people acting then to be himself and now the memories are creeping back in and hes unable to escape them i appreciate that sepultura reference oneeyed freak sounds like the dad lost an eye maybe at war perhaps thats what lily meant when she said she defeatedprotect james from the cyclopse im really sad he isnt finishing the game right now could you please tbh i still prefer the first layer of fear than this 2nd one i dont really like the storyline of this one and the place looks way to dark for me to watch the gameplay 858 dont you mean emerald city from the wizard of oz the witch brew for the wicked witch yellow path for the yellow brick road scarecrowstraw jesus lions clawnot bearand the robot scarecrow wanted a heart lion wanted couragegoing up to the beast to get the lion claw is the courage and the tin manrobot wanted a heart really you havent even finished observer where do you get off from playing layers of fear 2 im sure the video on the reel is artistic and all but im also not denying that it looks like a student only had four clips of stock footage mannequin deer moon flower and had to come up with meaning for them three hours before their media final was due so many references to moviesmovie makingfilm history in general its absolutely amazing gun shotshooting shooting a film fun fact that first camera ever made looked like a gunwas held like a gun lol last episode in the steamed up room with the flickering lights where the monster chases sean that flickering is like an old movie projector flickering from image to imagemaking the wall come alive this episode the shell that sean picks up and the 2 kids voices pop up lily says the shell captured the seas spirit having it live on forever just like a photograph of a moment or a movie movies became increasingly popular during the world warsdark times of the world it was a way of escapism hollywood was like a dreamland for many theory on story so far maybe your the actor as a little boy and your having flashbacks with your sister playing maybe she gave you the idea to take up acting reason being why you keep switching perspectives dunno play more please get your shit together and post part 4please i cant find part 2 help the fact that jack knows sepultura is fucking amazing he makes all his metal fans proud come on jack upload last episode you lazy big boy please finish this game at the age of 22 i find out that shells do not contain the sea and its just the blood in ur ears so sad looks like that one older film from hugo just creepy me hoppfull of the spirit of the sea jack 311 spirs tea me my soul is destroyed ive been really disappointed by this sequel it has none of the tension and fear of the first and the story was a lot more cohesive where is the next part jack jack i wish lf1 had more gameplay elements and monsters that could kill you also jack complains about dying from said monsters and having actual gameplay jack i hate games where u have to go back through the same areas round and round also jack i love pt ok 126 anyone else see remmy the rat in that circle the girl to me sounds like hermione granger lily james creepy hedge maze that closes in on you when you try to leave coincidence i think not 1829 when the glass broke the bulb in my room blew and i almost had a heart attack and then there was le voyage dans la lun 1902 wooooah wait the father has been on this ship and he dont even know that his two kids are on the ship gathering scraps these kids are starving to death does this game use rtx when will you be finishing the game its clash of the titans on the screen those two giant stone men come to life as well as the hydra come on jack know your movies come on jack its just one episode left you can at least finish the game i aint ever seen wizard of oz so i dont get the refrences like everyone else does lol 1120 wtf dude just breathed in my right ear hole lmao can you not the voice acting is pretty atrocious jesus the weird house is a deformed version of the original opening room the like button has been punched less than 3 minutes in for a berenstain bears reference immediately followed by a sepultura reference this is why i stay subscribed me turns volume up because i cant hear the game very well sean no you fucking idiots its science me ahahhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaahghhhhhhh jaaaaack i need part 4 o and then layers of fear joined the list of games jack never finished rip im waiting for episode 4 its sad my great grandmother died on my birthday kinda like james 210 confirmed jack likes groove metal it has been 4 days since the last part and im still waiting jack turn on all the taps jack later is in a flooded hall me you see what you did jack you sunk the ship from the inside on 2400 they are angry because they have nobody to be with internet is down so my lights wont turn on ah yes the future why did he change his hair color from green to brown he said a blackened heart ace of spades been two years then since i havent seen jacks face 2344 isnt that amnesia monster convoluted and boring devs needed to find better writers its obvious isnt it the farther started drinking after the mother died giving birth to james lilly said something like she gave up everything for you and the monster is just their dad abusing them and how james coped with it i mean you complain about going through that repeating carousel when pt does it then its better you fing idiots its science now jacky just because really smart people make really reasonable explanations that the whole world believes it doesnt make them true asks for more interaction from game whines whenever creepy ghost man chases him jack i dont know if youre giant or im really small methats just the same my current theory is the director is james he makes all his actors relive his sisters and his nightmarish childhood to test if they are good enough for the role in his movie which he is filming aboard the same ship he and his sister stowed away on when they were children to get away from their abusive probably alcoholic father who is represented by the monster kind of like the game among the sleep jus gonna put it out there the kids voice sounds like peppa pig 3852 what was that title of the movie why so few views and comments girl you cut away the strings me jameson jackson how did you get here 003 me and the boys at 2am looking for beans sorry i had to aight is this a theory about the whole playing with a different perspective deal which might be a whole bunch of bs but the progress from picking up thugs and hearing the kids voices to hearing their voices to playing as one of the kids might be because the actor is becoming the characters the kids yall probably already thought of this but i havent seen any comments about it but i also havent watched the rest so this may be all wrong being the idiot i am i just now realized there are limbs being added to the mannequin for each chapter he does probably illustrating the building of the character you are playing a girl in this game because of the dresses in her room and the kids are a boy and a girl the older one is a girl and you younger one is a boy super stoked for the rest of this game i bet he would get evicted if he didnt have the padding on his wallsyou knowcuz hes so loud but great did anyone else notice the reason he was so small was because he kept himself crouching from the beginning just me dont you love when you so into the story and a youtube ad pops up and you just lost all feelings 900 looks more like the emerald city come to think of it that whole section seems to be a giant wizard of oz reference or at least full of em 3127 3148 i think that those faces with you in a ship could be considered a reference to the movie man on the moon i think that is the name of the movie i have seen this like 5 times ooo a dog the music that was playing in the rocket kind of reminds of the one in the movie interstellar dont you think guys first world problems 101 my internets down so my lights wont turn on i thought that was a real gun and like that last shot had an actual bullet in it so the little boy had shot his sister and was afraid to ever act again ahhhh 225 that lost reference made my day lord of the rings fellow ship lol thought that too xd me feels the heaviness of a mans words about a process of change transformation and possibly infliction self or otherwise youtubie boy he spends a lot of time and words saying nothing aww did anybody notice that the one guy doing voiceovers was a vortigaunt from halflife 2 cant believe jack didnt realize he was in the house from the first game i think the boy died as well 2257 this is america 33 confirmed ok so heres my take on it you are james the director this whole process has been his ptsd how he as a director has come to understand what building a character means because he himself has gone through a traumatic childhood experience he and his sister came from a hard home where his father was also a movie director and while he was overseas filming a documentary on the waterfront lost an eye his mother mustve died in childbirth with james which is why lily says to her father its jamess day too did you buy anything for him even as a child james had an advanced mind and with his father calling him useless his sister would brighten his imagination by playing pretend hi jacka sean switching thoughts for a min my cousin took me to see the aladdin movie it has its goodfunny parts except it made me miss robin williams genie and today watched some yt vids that threw a ref vid of him in it made me feel a little better ok back to the regularly schedule jump scare thoughts for me anyway im not alive im deathnt im waiting for anti 20mil subs and only 245k views wtf jack u r really stupid how did u not get the wizard of oz references a brain surrounded by straw the metal or tin hair and that was a lions paw and the doorway u call willy wonkas factory is obviously the emerald city and yes idiot u r shorter plan to see u r playing the little boy wow u need to pay better attention nice vid i liked it hey jack where is episode 2 oh this game is about the life of georges mlis his fathers factory burned down and he developed most of the strange cinematic effects that expanded what was possible in movies i think 3136 is a reference to a trip to the moon 800 my internet is down so my lights wont turn on first world probs man lol i get it now one of the characters was an actor who was filming black wanderer on a ship maybe the kids snuck on which would explain why they were hiding a lot the ship itself was having problems the food and the captain storing and barely rationing the food im guessing something happened and the children died on the ship which was a tipping point for the actor making him lose his mind i cant get over the fact that the background music sounds just like the one from the game alice madness returns oh no i cant watch u play it i need to watch daz black play it divert eyes there is a full 5 minutes of jack not understanding the wizard of oz references come on man i wonder why these longer scary game lets plays arent getting more views i love this stuff keep up the good work jackaboy right before you said the voice actor who voices lily sounds like sophie turner i was thinking it can you say creepy dont reallly like this vid but it it still really goood im going down in a hatch this time john locke would be proud cue me having to pause the video with laughter youtube shows game in description also youtube shows fear project origin thonking jack definitely doesnt read comments gg willy wonkas chocolate factory yall know the movie the wizard of oz right the robot who wanted a heart the lion who didnt want to be named a coward the legarm thing the brain for the scarecrow and the giant green gem palace with the lights in the background and how pasty white jack is he looks like the french flag that rocket in the moon thats from one of the early silent movies isnt it ghidoraaaaaaaahhhhhh but in this case daddoraaaaaaaahhhhh the boss fight bloody roots is a song by cannibal corpse wow really the blood rushing in your ears no conch shells resonate the surrounding sounds jack you need to find it and bring it back didnt you know simply oblivious 328 my thought exactly the music so reminds me of silent hill ost by akira yamaoka my interpretation of what ive seen so far you play as james whose mother died during childbirth the father resented james for it and all he had was his sister lily who created stories as escapism for them both their characters in the stories were pirates and captains who went exploring after some time the father got ill and died lily said theres nothing left for us here its only the beginning after you saw the mannequin sitting in the chair with the bottle of pills they stowed away on a boat to fulfil their dreams of being captains and lily looked after him at 4832 i think that the movie you watch is showing that the boat they stowed away on caught fire and sank theres a lot of references to boats sinking throughout this game so far lily died which is why her voice is playing during the movie as you get closer to the end of the deck but james survived and became a successful director inspired by the stories his sister used to tell him i think he has it was simulating the wizard of oz the brain of a scare crow the paw of the cowardly lion and the heart of the tin man he is not going to finish this the views are terrible and i understand it the game is really dragging it out so of you wanna see the rest you should get to another channel but i recommened that ou play the game in private or somehting beacuse it has a really intresesting ending many of the questions you have asked are answerd jack in 2018 man i would love some pizza right now jack in 2019 i could kill for some root veggie stew jack turns on water taps all game just to be ornery 3530 game paybacks a bitch why are people not seeing this game i dont think he is going to make another video on this and i hate that what happened to fnaf vr im sticking this game out till the end but its really not that good sadly i miss the green hair hey jack you should play life is strange2 watching this while showering 2344 is an easter egg for amesia i think you are james hes grown up to be an actor and is filming on a ship it is bringing up the memories of him and his sister lily when they were stowaways on a ship to escape their abusive father the dad was cruel to james maybe blaming him for the mothers death and lily tries to keep james happy on the ship by pretending to be a pirate who defeated the cyclopes the dad who lost his eye in the war i think i get itthis is the same family as 1 i think its a cade of after layers of fear 1 or sometime before it fot all we know hes in purgatory living all this again hence why its so freaky and were learning that he neglected and abused his children aftet his wifes deaththis chapter is you playing as the kids trying to piece together what remains meanwhile the father is furthet spiraling the creature is perhaps the father when he gets angry and hence why it chased him when you used him in the first two chapters no ones proud of their anger okay the boy sounds like lumpy from the heffalump movie such a cute lil voice i feel like the main character witnessed his sister die from the father when they were young or they both saw their mother die he is having trouble living with it maybe is the deformed dude in the wheelchair that thing in the rubber johnny video 800 omfg what has the world come to the internet is down so your lights dont work lol when everything is connected you know at my house we have a magical little box that sits on the wall it controls the lights we call it a lightswitch xd jkjk you do you sean i am enjoying this story its not all that scary but still i am loving the music the atmosphere and the story its almost like watching a decent movie keep it going jack walks into set of emerald city from wizard of oz jack looks like im walking into willy wonka the chocolate factory my inner child ok i understand nothing except for the reference at 3146 to the 1902 silent film a trip to the moon the art for the film was a moon illustrated with a face on its surface with a rocket lodged in its left eye so did the mother doe giving birth to the little boy the sister seems to referenc this when she tells him to prove he was worth it big fan man keep up the good work you actually inspired me to create my one youtube chanel its fox games if any one wants to subscribe thanks man keep up the good work fox is it gonna chase m its fucking chasing me screaming at him to please realize that the 3 items were from the wizard of oz the clawcourage to the lion the brain to the scare crow the heart to the tin man anyone else catch this pleaseeee finish this on your youtube love you 859 calling the emerald city in the wizard of oz the chocolate factory this game is so confusing first he was playing an actor working for a crazy director then it showed two stowaway orphan kids running from a scary monster now hes playing as the boy interacting with his sister and they have a father meanwhile theres no more mention of the actor or director and what the hell is going on with the monster outtro music a bit loud this time could barely hear your beautiful voice jackaboy it seems we play as james both as a child and as an adult this game feel like sucker punch i love this i really wanna play this myswlf but my laptop that had steam on it is broken and my wallet is suffering from starvation i have a question why isnt this series getting more views im very confused jackaboy if you i find you and say hit to you jack i dont know who i am in this game the game every five minutes before this point hi james whats up james james james james james jack maybe im the dad of the girls the game her name is lily his name is james jack yep sounds like two girls to me i know lots of girls named james wait is the childrens father like a pervert and thats why they run around and hide from him and then they play to act like theyre lives are different and they try to ignore what theyre father is doing and it causes them to have more fear everyday so hence the name of the game layers of fear if half of your faves is dark during the video im fine by that it sets the atmosphere just right makes it look like you have a completely other side to you oh how have i forgotten theres antisepticeye is that how its pronounced didnt see the wizard of oz reference jack it was the wizard of oz you dumb boy the brain of the scarecrow the arm of the lion and the heart of the tinman when jack doesnt realise hes in the house of the first game after playing though layers of fear and seeing gameplay of both layers of fear 2 and observer i honestly think they just come up with a bunch of tropes and and filler ideas to make games it doesnt seem like they put a lot of effort into a logical story jack willy wonkas chocolate factory the obvious wizard of oz theme am i a joke to you anyone remember when jack hid his accent so she died giving birth to him and i think he grew up to be either the actor or the director wow i always regarded jack as the youtuber with higher iq especially that hes good at evaluating and reviewing games and stuff but man even delirious whom i did not regard to have a higher iq was the one who understood the game more and its story im kinda disappointed that sean is not understanding anything or much well i guess it takes a second try to truly understand more but deym am i the only one that thinks the player character and the boy james hardy are the same person i thought that was being pretty heavily implied sees thumbnail jack has the it comes at night virus jesus am i the only one who has noticed that jacks views have been tanking recently the recurring hallways remind me a bit of pt i think the game is set during ww1 cause one of the notes said something about the eastern or western front i forget but both of those events happened during ww1 1 is for love 2 is for thoughts 3 is for a helping hand at 3138 is a reference of the movie le voyage dans la lune many may know it from the movie hugo the narrator is tony todd aka candyman i so excited to see the rest lets go all the way you know something is off with you when you get jumped scared by jack saying bloody roots during the rather pleasant intro film and not by the actual game i think i need a mental examination great vid jack loved it little girl creepy pome jack i wonder what creature this belongs tona na na so i was almost right the character your playing is the young boy grown up i cant be anybody else but i can play anyone i want stands to reason why hed want to be an actor but the reason for his remembering is unknown at the minute either way what i got so far is the children lived with their dad in what seemed like a cinema the mother died the dad went crazy i guess so the kids ran away by stowing away on a ship or the kids werent stowaways at all but hiding from their dad in the ship the rest we already know so far thats where my heads at jack just totally ignoring the blatant wizard of oz setreferences in the beginning is bugging the shit out of me generally i think the player has been going through old movie sets as the environments the machinery set from the last part eg felt super familiar although i couldnt fully put a name to it hedges close in me its like the end of harry potter and the goblet of fire sean its like the end of harry potter 4 surprised pikachu face yoooooo is this the first games painter that house is almost the exact same layout this is his childhood she said he will have the power to make a thousand people weep or be different he became a painter and did portraits as well and he turned out like his dad anyways just like his daughter being stowaways on a ship going mad with hunger yeah he developed his fear of rats then my theory woah the rooms where you get the ingredients for the stew is like the wizard of oz is it just me or is this game trying to do too much like i get it its supposed to be deep and unnerving but it just comes across as a kind of convoluted mess of jumpscares and random flashbacks that are choppy and a little all over the place i got the storyline of the first game loved it and im not saying this game isnt good it just seems heavy jacks commentary keeps me going though you run but do you know de wae there was the guy in the hat who you didnt shoot so maybe if you shot him you might see the woman how eles dosent have socks on does anyone else see the connection to the wizard of oz with the brain metal heart and lion claw and the yellow path that weird clay doll that was found in the vents the one with the warped mouth kinda really looks like a monster from amnesia the dark descend every time he says treasure i think of uncharted life death jack deathnt no 1 noticed that doll he found looks like the monster from amnesia i mean the first 1 with the open mouth willy wonka and the chocolate factory c getting your movies crossed that was totally wizard of ozs yellow brick road and the emerald city love watching these play throughs though especially horror keep up the good work i love the old film references in this game screen blacked out at 44 minutes anyone else i think those kids are stowaways because theyre searching for food and running away from different voices the older sister is trying to protect the younger sibling from knowing their actual situation so instead she turned it into a little game with pirates where the officers are the enemy pirates trying to take their gold and capture them and theyre searching for more food acting like its a mission treasure hunt running from there father but soemthing happened to him to make him change it sounded like he was the man in the chairedit i think youre playing at the younger sibling edit 2 im guessing as i watch the video but maybe the mother died giving birth to the younger sibling and the dad has hatred blaming him for her death jack i feel like i am about to head into willy wonka and the chocolate factory me i was thinking more wizard of oz but ok the little boy sounds like hugo off of a plague tale innocence you should definitely do a video of you playing it 003 just so you know the original quote was a house is built of walls and beams a home is built of love and dreams they replaced the word love with the word fear which may be a hint of some sort how did jack not notice the house he was in was the room from the first game 4417 its rubber johnny each episode is someone else in the family the first one is the mom the second is the father the third was the boy and im assuming the fourth is the girl damn im really not into it i used to like layers of fear but now im just so uninterested in the characters and the story man even the voices sound like a pepa pig episode am i the only one hey jack why did you rip out your pubic hair for a human cake the upper half of your face in the thumbnail reminded me of messi a little next gameplay let jack play this game in the darkness instead and small light on his face maybe then it will be more creepier for him xd thumbs up so he can see it 2228 sora disagrees with that statement deeper into the rabbit hole alice went brain scarecrow animal arm courage lion heart tin man then youre on the yellow brick road going into the emerald city palace i knew this was giving me wizard of oz vibes hope someday they will make layers of fear into horror movie from first one then this one part 2 the rocket in the moons eye is reference to le voyage dans la lune a trip to the moon game breeeaathe sean breathes me o the developers of this game need to make a pirates of the carribean game lily and james huh harry potter much game children should write allegory stories based off of this kids have the advanced knowledge of saying one thing and meaning another subscribe to dahl studios love the references to a trip to the moon so is anyone understanding the story of this game at all im totally lost am i the only one who has no idea what the shit is going on im off to re watch the first episode that was wizard of oz i think jack that is a new update for kerble space program the sound you hear in a seashell is not your blood rushing its the echoing of the air around you ok jacksepticeye how are you doing i was wondering i saw your god war 4 videos and i thought it was amazing can you fry the slade original go awards at terry what you think of them and make thank you do that ill be so happy honestly this game is repetitive and boring gets scared of ad at 403 its the house from the first game a lot of time and words saying nothing yeah that is poetry jack sees door youre locked arent you you should play wildcraft have you noticed that you are actually very small and so could be playing as one of the little children i really like this game its so interesting to watch just thought the voice of the shadow in the mirror sounded like the voice of bo in pinstripe thumbnailmrbeast eating edible gold 3204 is like that one old horror game caddicarus played where youre a detective and one level is in a department store with bad guys dressed like mannequins when you escape you can look up and see them all t posing around the hole tony todds voice just makes the game jack can u play two acts in one video pls like if u agree the girls voice when he picked up the shell was peppa pig go go gadget nightmare didnt know that about seashells thought that was jon bernthal on the cover for a sec this is so based on hugo how the fuck did he not notice it has the wizard of motherfucking oz and how the fuck he doesnt know his playing as the perception of jamesjimmy burns the child im scared of everything i havent been here in a long time and i was so worried jack had stopped his outro playing pretend with what they thought was a prop a note he found earlier points out theyre using live ammo thia game looks extremely interesting and the graphics are amazing me seeing colorful entrance ooh cool tie together the items wizard of oz nice touch sen seeing colorful entrance i feel like im about to head into willy wonkas chocolate factory me okay i ugh guess that works too lol also did anyone else catch the a trip to the moon reference when the rocket crashed into the moon its one of the oldest movies so its really cool that they added a nice touch like that can you for once dont scream on introplease i am not sure if jack knows but i am going to say it anyway that the character he is building is the mannequin in the filmsi am sure he knows this but i am still going to write it down has anyone else found this not even the least bit scary so far its been pretty disappointing jack i like your vids but you are straight up running past or ignoring fucking everything in a walking simulator game thats a capital offense 1 the house is a slightly changed version of the house from the firsr layers of fear 2 everyone was yelling at you about the wizard of oz thing so ill just leave it 3 quit running everywhere without looking around dammit that house was filled with notes and other objects that spawn and despawn between each room you just skipped a fuckton of stuff i dont think it was anything too major central to the plot but please stop so you dont accidentally whiff a vital clue in later portions of the game and one last bit be very very sure of your choice next chapter that will make or break then ending you get for reference there are 3 endings you get 1 ending for following the directors commands in the majority if the 4 choice scenes another for ignoring or disobeying the majority of scenes and the last for splitting dead even 2 for 2 thaaats my boy bitch is you tryna make me sob nobody jack my internet is down so the lights wont turn on everyone else wizard of oz the impossible voyage me a potterhead lily and james chalice on top of a pile of treasure triwizard maze plus jack screaming thats my boy reminds me of cedric me increases the volume to hear the narrator narrator roots jack rooooootttttssss current hypothesis james and lily were stowaways on a ship and lily got caught and consequently killed possibly by his actions he grows up and becomes an actor taking lilys words as a guide to his method when the director chose to shoot on a ship james began to slowly lose his shit remember the note from the director referring that the pc doesnt like ships since being on a ship is forcing him to relive the hellish experience of being a stow away and losing his sister 209 scared the jeezus out of no wherejdncnjnsvo has anyone mentioned to jack that the deep male voice in this game that he likes is the same person who played candy man in the horror movie of the same name least i believe the movie was called candy man i could be wrong on the movie title but it is the same actor of that i am sure rooooots i wasnt expecting a sepultura reference fuck yeah did you see steve vai playing that with them it was badass gosh dangit he keeps missing things jaaack youre not supposed to rush these types of games love the content still also you missed about 80 of the readable items in this chapter i highly recommend you do the new game afterwards and get all the stuff otherwise youll be left with just half the experience and story jackaboy that be a wizard of oz reference scarecrows brain tinmans heart and lions courage cant believe you said youre going to willy wonkas factory while youre literally walking down a yellow brick road into an emerald framed door i got a lot of coraline vibes from this act is that just me is it just me or are jacks thumbnails getting darker again more antiish omg every time you mention lotr i always get so giddy because i was named after the princess of rohan 4035 where the men can see it all how did sean not get the immensely obvious wizard of oz ref with the tin mans heart the scarecrows brain and the lions limb with the mannequin acting like a shy lion with the front door of emerald city and everything cmon sean i know youre smarter than this i bet you didnt notice because ya didnt have your dirty bean water this mornin to pick up your senses how did sean not get the immensely obvious wizard of oz ref with the tin mans heart the scarecrows brain and the lions limb with the mannequin acting like a shy lion with the front door of emerald city and everything cmon sean i know youre smarter than this i bet you didnt notice because ya didnt have your dirty bean water this mornin to pick up your senses a metal heart a lion claw and a brain anyone else see a connection to the wizard of oz not that youd want to resort to cannibalism in the first place but isnt it a bad idea to eat a human brain kids god is real and makes everyone happy jack but ill have you know the mirror kids hits way too close to home for me edit the dynamic of the kids hits way tooclose to home overall i can get where both thier actions are coming fromits kinda hard watching this and hearing the exact words i used to tell myself yes she does sound like her sophie turner i kept thinking the same thing from the start my goodness i like how jack just kept missing the wizard of oz theme during the first part 2730 am i dumb or did this part happen in the beginning of the game 030 sees chicken ooh theres a dog just lost my aunt today thanks for being one of the few people that can make me smile today your content means more to some of us then you will ever know thanks for always being there to cheer me up ohhh the stew bit references the wizard of oz you found a brain with a figure made of straw scarecrow you found the claw of an animal lion and a silver metallic heart tinman and then you head down the yellow brick road towards emerald city and that hedge maze is from the shining with all the little stone benches in it i love all these movie references i can spoil the ending wizard of oz and he didnt even notice well there where a lot of segments of movies that he didnt notice youtube compression suckssssss the really dark sections look ugly bc of it the mind seasoned by sadness burned from within ravaged by madness rotten with sin the claw torn up by conflict ravaged by war flawed on its surface warped to its core the heart hollowed by longing hardened by loss once slick and polished has lost all its gloss i really like pirate filims 433 omg thay was a jump scare 5000 ok then you guys wanted it heres the jumpscare list 622 monster glitches and groans 653 monster throws it arms up 717 screen glitches 1327 mannequin glitches on wall 1829 bang 2123 loud noise 2148 noise and light flashes on creature 3749 scream then change of environment tell me if i missed any down below i like the wizard of oz reference in the game holy feces dude hey i love your videos but when you were in the rocket ship the sun had one eye the girl also explained how his dad was mean and the dialogue between lily and the dad showed he was a dream crusher long story short the oneeyed sun represented the dad and the ship was the adventures of the two children hope that helps isnt the deformed person in the chair in a different video act 3 was my favorite to play and sitting down just to watch it now im realizing its because it reminds me a bit of what remains of edith finch one of my favorite games the ceremony is being held on my birthday the 5th of january youre playing as one of the siblings and you relive the memories with your now ded sibling just like the painter in the first layers of fear her voice sounds like the scholastic voice actor for the eye spy game wait a minute the rocket reminded me of the ouijia board event that happened in the first game where if you put in the word rocket a rocket shot up into the air wellkinda but you get the point so what if its that same rocket crashed into the moon eh this is a convoluted thought i had 1825 when he was talking about perfectly timed thunder there was thunder outside lmao dat thumbnail doh the moon with the face and a rocket in it thats a reference woah act 3 was awful 537 jack splishsplash me splishsplash i was taking a bath lily sounds like emma watson fair turkey legs are thicc cant believe sean missed that whole section of wizard of oz reference funny how he mentioned the bushes reminded him of harry potter when the kids are british and names lily and james the story and ambiance of this game is so good i cant wait to see what happens next sees thumbnailaw shit here we go again youre playing from the perspective of a child thats why everything is outlandish and almost fantasy like its why the ending monster is a cyclops their father has one eye the binoural audio is ticking my ear pls play slime rancher my theory we play as james now grown up and a successful actor reliving his childhood trauma his sister lily encouraged his creativity while he father bashed it not wanting him to chase and get hurt like he did in the war james and lilys mother died while giving birth to james which is why their father despises him so and why she would be dead in the first place obviously the dad was probably abusive so lily grabbed james and smuggled them onto a ship as stowaways to hopefully go to a new land and get away from their trauma and father only problem it never leaves james forcing him into a downward spiral of i shouldnt exist and reliving memories that he would rather suppress no not willy wonka wizard of oz you silly irish lad keep up that intro feels good revisiting your channel me and my brother have a youtube channel were making people watch your videos and plz say are youtube channel to other people in your next video plzzz i rilly enjoy watching this game at 429 i think that this environment is where the kids come from the back that the girl mentioned previously i beat this game already is this just creepy no jumpscares jack thought fricking wizard of oz references were fricking willy wonka im disappointed but overall i love this game dont you just hate that when youre turning on taps and then a shadow pops out of the ground and kills you and then your stomach hurtswait why does my stomach hurt meseriouslythats what you have a problem with okay but why is two face constantly talking to jack where sally face jack slaps forhead oh jackyes you have been the kid the whole time either as an adult or flashback but yo u are one of the kids voices this whole time 4116 part of a great quote 233 i appreciate the lost reference the fathers treatment toward james may have been caused by something happening to the mom sometimes its good to be wrong on a theory im always surprised jack those arent deaths those are recaps of the entire story banging noises jack the fck is making that noise jack looks to the side jack calm af oh its that thing the whole seashell thing was symbolic of the kids freedom both mentally and physically from their abusive father not just a thing some kid says because they dont understand science the house is in the same layout as the house in layers of fears opening prologue the kitchen segment was a reference to the wizard of oz with the brownish tint color the paw for courage the heart for compassion and the brains for intelligence the green winnie wonka factory was the green emerald city and was in color with the yellow brick road as according to the movie when it added color the rocket ship segment was based on one of the first ever moving image films in cinema called a trip to the moon made in 1902 youll notice that lilly was a very imaginative girl that likely used pirates setting sail into the open ocean as an escape from the insanity of the childrens living situation her love for pirates and the ocean found them risking a stowaway escort on what i believe is the current theory dad was a drunk and a gambler he had two kids you play the youngest youd sneak around the ships with your older sister so that youll have actual food and things to do one day dad found out and killed your sister and you hid from this you survived got older and became an actor as a coping mechanism and to try to drone out your actual and normal thoughts youd force yourself to think as your character one day something snapped and the character you play starts drinking and talking to himself and what you play are the resurfacing memories told through the eyes of a child the music kinda reminds me of the music from soma by frictional games you should play the forest they changed the game tiny bit im first to watch please reply jse oh shit i figured it out james the little boy is the actor the man from the beginning youre flashing back to his childhood with his sister and father its time set sail to a pirate space cue cowboy bebop theme song 800 the internet is down so my lights arent working welcome to the future of the internet of things shoddy router toilet wont flush i might be wrong but i think this story is meant to be about child abuse from the father so in turn the kids become someone else in a make believe world to get away from the abuse and heartache from losing their mum also i think their mum died during james birth which is why he was calling himself a mistake in the mirror before plus maybe all this came about from the lack of food on the ship leading to starvation leading to insanity butthen again this games pretty messed up so it could literally be anything at this point d when youre being chased by the monster and yet trying to look in the detailed environments of the game me someone should make a compilation of every time jack talks about how great some food would be rn really enjoying this sean thanks for playing how did jack not catch the stew was parts of the characters from wizard of oz brain scarecrow claw cowardly lion heart tin man one eye willy shorts fire in the maze run jack run its fire so far i think the actor we heard about is james and he and his sister fled their abusive father who couldnt forgive the boy for killing his mother i have no idea who is the player yet maybe james ended up completely loosing himself and killed his sister i am pretty sure they jump around the timeline f you jack i believe in the ocean spirits does no one notice that the house in the beginning is the painters house from the first game that moon thing with the spaceship in it 3146 reminds me of one of george melies first short films a trip to the moon maybe he is the like the director anyone hear david attenborough in the movies i do finally i am all caught up i think youre playing james and you are possibly in purgatory the mom most likely died a year or two before the house act the dad was a photographer for maybe one of the great wars which is how he lost his eye the dad possibly had an illness which killed him and the children are running away to a safer place which would explain the last movie scene the previous act was about the journey as stowaways with lily possibly dying or going insane james could have been found after the ship had landed or the doorway scene that we see is possibly the fate of the ship the posters might have been the stories that lily and james had played as the poster called the pirate and the cyclops king is a reference to either james or lily and the dad jacksepticeye ruining childrens dreams i hated it from the beginning everyoneits a wizard of oz reference me what the hell is the wizard of oz is in a grave thats so cool 615 big thing flies up 1117 spooky noises 1326 mannequins 1827 flashes and darkness 2027 not necessarily a spook but it got jack 2122 spooky sounds 2147 flashes 2210 noises 2455 thing poops up 2844 spoopy noises 3718 lights flash 3748 light bulb breaks and screams jack runs around in a maze for a bit 4213 short storm 4532 idk what to call this please play red dead redemption 2 oof the creepy doll on the bed in the end jack pirate filum also my internet is down so i cant turn on my light gotta love 1st world woes sa good love ya jack i think you should play days gone its a long game but its really good my idea of a good horror game has to have an element of mystery survivalhorror no combat no cliche spooky girls set in a school give yours wizard of oz stew a brain for the scarecrow a lions paw and a mechanical heart for the tinman willy wonker and the chocolate factory looks more like willy wonker and the bong factory is it just me or does the little boy sound like peppa pig i missed you sen blame twitch now quickly before anyone else i follow starts streaming goddamn it just kidding i love you and i love this community 207 we literally shouted bloody roots back at the same time jack ah yes brigadier general unintelligible signature he was quite the hero himself in the battle of unintelligible place the tempest poster near the end has the same play title as the one in life is strange before the storm on the rocket ride scene the moon that they showed with the rocket in its eye is actually what was in one of the very first films ever what headphones is jack using in this video sincerely greggory the irish gladiator is never scared thanks about that shell thing at the start because i didnt actually know that i i wondered what it was science 2236 uh what are james and lily really up to who pays for the electricity for the house so the lights would work has anyone seen ripd the thumbnail reminded me of that that and another movie legion idk why so my theory is the children ran away from their father on the boat to america and the young boy was bullied and hated by his father for killing his wife in childbirth the young boy after playing with his sister a lot met an american man who became his mentor and the kid grew up to become a famous actor and director who was haunted by his past i havent played the game im just guessing find it bring it back sounds like emma watsons voice a little and im living for it this was for sure the best act so far havent seen you in a while now you look like your a proper man like the beard and that lol the voice over guy reminds me of david attenborough i wonder if the claw brain and heart are a reference to the wizard of oz edit the scene around 3145 seems like it is based on a part from the 1902 french movie a trip to the moon also the scene of the guy in the wheelchair around 4420 reminds me of the guy in the wheelchair from the hills have eyes i like how jack did not even bother to turn is light back on manually this lamp abuse is getting out of hand 250 ehhh fucckkkkk i dont hear the ocean i just hear a fookin bee beside me sksk the haircut looks good there jack what pray tell is rootveg who else noticed that the placement of the rooms matches the layout of the house from the first layers of fear makes me wonder if the two stories or at least the people in them will be related somehow 3145 jack really this is the most famous movie from melies a trip to the moon the picture of the moon is iconic make them feel alive make them live forever a thousand lives but never mine never mine wtf does that mean you need a dentist on that thumbnail lots of scenes from classic black and white movies and stage plays peppered through out this game nobody jack this music is very nice i usually get the things jack doesnt get or call bs and when jack gets something im like whaat what did you get i dont get it just shows how different you can be haha hey jacksepticeye just a quick game i think should check out in vr its called zero calliber vr i love all the subtle movie references scattered throughout the game and how they incorporate it into the story that first section had wizard of oz overtones whoa views suck on this game but i still really want to see the end pls alright lily and james are two kids whose father runs or is employed at some sort of theatre hes in charge of putting the movies in the projector the kids like to sneak out and watch the movies hes playing thats where they get their vivid imaginations and all their pirate stories the kids mother died giving birth to james and now his father hates him and calls him useless because he thinks james took his wife away and only brought him misery lily is protective of her brother but she tells him he needs to show his worth because she thinks her mother gave up her life for him james feels an immense amount of pressure because of what his father and sister tell him he sometimes feels it would have been better if he wasnt born lily is into acting and shes taken on the role of the captain thanks to one of the movies her father played she has james playing mr hardy they were both big dreamers and dreamed of escaping to a better life lily thinks her brother has a 655 jack i just wanted to see if i could pet the dog my relationship with animals so what ive gathered here the guy is an actor with troubled past an abusive father caused by the passing of the mother back in his childhood he used to play with his sister acting as a pirate first mate inspired by the movie his father played as he was a cinema employee and he later become a real actor forgetting and blocking his past and whatnot which came back to him as he agreed to do acting in a ship is there something wrong or missing from this edit just watched the video so her mother died giving birth to him but its not like the father hated him for it right away the war came along with the despair and loss that comes with it the father joined the military and lost his eye and his sanity after the economy fell into ruins thats when the father started to hate him he started to gamble and lost thats what i can get then he finally lost it and maybe killed his sister holy shit that game was scary but not for me i have no fear jack and the music is so me silent hill esc jack silent hill esc me surprised pikachu face jack top of the morning to you lad i like your videos keep up the good work lad that thing with killing a character to change it i used to do that while playing as a kid when i got angry or frustrated at the character bc it behavedacted in the wrong way out of character i killed it and then i started over still the same character tho with a reset mind sees thumbnail sfw you arent a true fan if you dont get it if you got it i am proud of you 3 the thumbnail is anti change my mind jack i dont think you realized the house was the house from the first game just a little different holy shit it didnt hit me until you got the metal heart those are wizard of oz references the brain was found by a pile of haythe claw was a lions pawand the metal heart was from a tin man struck by an axe wow ive been waiting for more fnaf since you usually dont upload the same series everyday but you are with this please play a plage tale innocence it is an amazing indie game robin played it and it didnt disappoint me sees a new video is up me moves laptop screen away from face in case of jumpscares im disappointed that he didnt notice the a trip to the moon reference from 1902 this game must be revolving around that jack later straw jesus my brain s t r e e z u s holywheres all the views if your reading this are you prepared for him how did you not realize that house was meant to be a replica of the house in the first game and it was different every time you went in you should have explored more good call listening to lily instead of the creepy voice though cant help but wonder how many secrets pass jack by or he passes by am i the only one that gets annoyed by the children voices i preferred the first layer of fear better this one feels weak but im still gonna watch it because you know its sean not sure why but this game makes me feel im watching coraline love the game play senl so james and lily were stowaways on a boat escaping from their abusive father who hates james for the death of his wife and who suffers from ptsd james becomes an actor so far i get it me just finished taking finals and woke up from a nap me takes out phone jack uploads as soon as i look at the notification me jumps the freak is that lily and james where the potterheads at jacks most favourite lines in this episode where my creepy mouth theres a creepy mouth can i have my creepy mouth back pls 016 ugandan knuckles looks wide eyed from the void ive had six ads now anyone else notice that the house part is the same house from the first layers of fear willy wonkas chocolate factory and the emerald city are two very different places at 729 i realized something the brain what seems like a lion arm and the tin heart must represent the scarecrow who wanted a brain the lion who wanted courage and the tin man who wanted a heart wow jack a sepultura fan what a man u know it was called the bernstain bears but there was a cross between dimensions so people remeber it as the bernstein bears but and some youtuber laurenzside specificity or gloom idk remebet it as bernstain bears hey jack i really like this series just wondering if u will play detroit become human the father could be both the denonic voice and the monster who chases us lily reminds me a lot of wendy from peter pan the film narator sounds like if morgan freeman was having an off day i think the brother and sister became actorsthey could be the people we see on the posters oh sean youve been effected by the mandela effect tooits berenstain not berenstein i havent played the game but i have some theories the wife died while the dad was gone for the war they fell in love when they played in different movies together after being too old for acting the father became a director he was obsessed w money and gambling this cruise excursion was his big break he had to take the chance he brings his children w him on the boat to film the incident where they run out of food something must be trying to kill everyone on the ship the father is abusive so the kids hide from him this something trying to kill everyone sets the boat on fire the fire crashes the ship and only a few of them survive the little boy does not make it the monster this whole time was the father so are we getting the anti or not u oof its been a while since ive watched a playthrough of a horror game and im shiting my pants right now 3930 jack am i safe loud roaring bones crunching fire jack nope apparently not i loved this episode it made so much more sense than the last 2 this is actually great the devs are using real film references to the tell the story 600900 uses wizard of oz characters scarecrow lion and tinman to maybe describe the dad dealing with war and loss at 3135 they used the famous scene from a trip to the moon a french film where the rocket hits the moon in the eye maybe again to reference the dad losing his eye in the war slow clap to the devs damn i dont like that demon creepy babies jacksepticeye 2019 4614 i just thought up something what if the first act youre the dad the next act youre the young girl and the third act youre the little boy 3147 holy shit thats a good reference a trip to the moon theory what if the box she was trying to put sam in was being dumped or taken somewhere and if the ghostly figure is the big girl trying to get rid of sam hat means your playing as sam a child idk its just a theory past jack the last game didnt have enough gameplay new game heres more gameplay jack but no 859 but the wizard of nevermind 346 meare we a kid 2 second later jack am i a kid serious its actually berenstain bears everybody gets that wrong i am loving the series and that thumbnail you go creepy projection shadows you teach jack waters not a thing to be wastin xd that first bit with the stew was a reference to the wizard of oz 1 the straw mans brain 2 beasts strengthcourage 3 the ax mans tin heart all references to the the scarecrow the lion and the tin man then then nest set piece was eerily familiar to emerald city do u know the way uganda knuckles is that you so the kids were running away from their abusive gambling father after their mother had passed away and they hopped aboard the ship and hid from the crew when he said sorry kids i got a notification from jacksepticeye called kids we live in a society also its not willy wonka its wizard of oz jack yellow brick round if i only had a brain a heart courage his day means death day he either died from starvation by his dad or illness he wasnt a baby the mum died years ago jack im happy for you that you are making these classic videos they are always the best ones the first section was a take on the wizard of oz brain scarecrow heart tin man beast arm lion the building you went through represented the emerald city that dorothy and her companions end up at a episode that isnt more than a hour throw it intow the void jack its like a weird tim burton house me a minute beforehand did you step into beetlejuice jack please react to this youtube civil war remastered voice over please like so jack can see xd hes spider man sees thumbnail ooohhh the gauges are in that mean anti lol i swear the stew section was the wizard of oz not fully done with video but my guess the monster is supose to be the father 2330 chace begin a dad 4325 chase being a dad my internet is down so the lights arent working i dont think thats how that works jackman game makes a wizard of oz reference jack i feel like im going into willy wonkas chocolate factory i say the brother is the actor person u play and he is somehow haunted by his sister or so this chapter is the whole backstory why they are on the ship we play as little james and seing his relationship with his sister and dad they hinted at their mother died in childbirth and thats why the dad is so rough with james he is drunk when we see him gamble and saying this nasty things to james and he is gambling the mothers necklace away i dont how but the the father became a cripple in a wheelchair and was in chronic pain and couldnt move thats when lily and james run away from home and on the ship its what i deduced from act 3 the chapter actually revealed who you are playing as if you pay attention to the dialogue man time flies so fast i used to remember back then when i was 7 and i used to enjoy your videos very much 3 you were the only youtuber that made goodfunnyloud content for me and i picked up english from your videos im 12 now thank you for your content and the hard work that you had put in the videos for us to enjoy my hopes and dreams is to become someone like you when im older im telling you this because you truly inspired me to become a youtuber hopefully if you see this

of cadavers in there ew play trover saves the universe did u realy use the black eyes from supernatural watching jacksepticeye layers of fear part 2 since i couldnt watch it when it first came out then find this video haha a brain a lion paw a metal heart wizard of oz reference also theres a yellow brick road and a door with crystals that looks like the emerald city where is antisepticeye jack jiggles if u spam the rewind button but layers of fear is my favorite and ive been here since the perfect wife vid keep up the great work maybe its just me whos noticing this because im a film buff but each act is referencing to a different genre of movie act 1 the holes in the wall that had the hotel from the shining in it referencing horror act 2 the mannequins and the machine referencing a movie called metropolis which is considered one if the very first scifi movies referencing scifi act 3 the emerald city walk through referencing the wizard of oz and the rocket ride and the moon that was referencing a trip to the moon an old fantasy film that broke boundaries during its time referencing fantasy also every time the colors change from black and white to color is how you can tell how old the movie the act is referring to is jacksepticeye is never afraid of anything hey jack you should play some stories untold it is really good dont overwork yourself jack ok jack i know you say that this is the most confusing act when it kinda makes the most sense and you missed the wizard of oz reference with the soup part deathnt let the water hit the flo let the water hit the flo oooo a a a a roots bloody roots is an amazing song he didnt get the wizard of oz reference you dont want to let us collect our thoughts u want to torture us by making us wait for the ending i dont watch ur

with good jacksepticeye cool guess whos back back again antis back jacks dead again getting better i felt like the first play through was like watching a game critic playing and giving their feedback not really enjoyable to watch but i really like jacks videos sorry im late can u play the rusty lake games theyre super cool sorry jackaman but this layers of fear isnt as good as the first one i didnt even get scared tbh it was rather boring 645 the creature is mannequin only 3 words anti is bacc me cool a rocket piece jack am i building a missile also jack puts piece on other rocket parts and says im building a rocket me i was right cool i think i get the timeline the kids are in the past while they where still making a movie one of the kids died so the other is angry and is haunting the place and now there is the security guard and he sees the ghost of one of the kids jack you couldve shot the 2 things next to you when on the boat instead of shooting lily off of the boat jack crouches for the first few minutes jack why am i so short why is everything so big happy wheels w jack in a nutshell screw you billy pma guys pls see jackaboy luv u just realized stew section is wizard of ozz loving that sepultura reference xd anyone down here that can give me any more recommendations btw the sound dying when you enter a side niche really ruined the fucking mood jack can you please go to happy wheels plzzzz you always make me laugh in those videos so plz go back to it layers of fear 1 gave me enough heart attacks not actual ones but scare the living shit out of me jack can you play red dead redemption 2 its an amazing game why does this creature on 4423 look like rubber johnny you know what else has layers parfaits 857 were off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of oz i think youve been playing james the whole time both as an adult and a child i think your big sister stood up to dad and he killed her maybe it set something on fire when he killed her james seems to be the actor that the director set up the ship for to remind him of what happened thats just my current theory the sepultura referance made this video 10x better jack had no clue you were into the same music as i he protecc he attacc but most importantly layers of fear is bacc im honestly expecting a guy to pop out wearing the hello neighbor outfit ive known he listens to metal for years we spoke about metal when i met him and yet i was still shook when i heard that sepultura shoutout that thumbnail is terrifying 136 dude sounds like yoda mixed with master roshi hello my name is ignat and i am from bulgaria can you make a video that you react to our music and our most famous songs in bulgaria please jack it was a wizard of oz reference the scarecrows brain the lions paw and the tinmans heart the door way was shaped and colored like the emerald city 209 mah roots mah roots run deep into the hollow itm jacks back protojack must have developed a glitch jack send the bitch out for repair hes cuttin into me pee time lol 2632 i can become something else jack they added wwii units in tabs so yeah edit its a mod i was clickbaited but they still will probably be adding wwii units i cringed how could he call the wizard of oz the chocolate factory brain for the scarecrow heart for the tin man strength for the lion and he went through the emerald city tt jackkkkkk play smile for me on steam i think you should play it it will be out tomorrow please play slime rancher bring back antisepticeye oh shit here we go again oh shit here we go again oh shit here we go again oh shit here we go again oh shit here we go again jack hates going back and forth still loves metal gear solid the thumbnail is so cool because you look like a demon he protecc he attacc but most importantly he needs to know if you have 90 minutes for the jse tour how did we get here 611 hears girl speak a creepy poem jack thats very poetic ok so i think the little boy jimmy is the actor and the character we play as he was silent and imaginative as a kid and because lily taught him to cope with trauma by destroying one character to make way for another it actually made him a great actor as an adult i think they either ran away from their abusive father or caused his death somehow and stowed away on a ship the game doubles down on the pirate imagery because its both the fantasy they played as children and the movie hes filming as an adult any other ideas im gonna say the n word i am groot are you going back to subnatica sub zero he protecc he attacc but most importantly anti is bacc everybody with me where is tabs where is tabs where is rodger where is steven this is a interesting game i like the concept where you start out not knowing anything about who you or whats going on you have to play the game to uncover the mystery the whole storyline to this chapter is wizard of oz and alice in wonderland well parts of it anti wherere you hiding we know youre here also sean im enjoying your videos so far theyre really interesting fun and a little spooky but also every title you used so far look as if theyre forming some sort of message im a bit concerned great thumbnails btw they really fit into the creep factor 315 sean ruins my love of seashells forever you have destroyed many memories my good sir anyway off to have a spot of tea jacksepticeye i just watched your subnautica video killing reaper leviathan with a knife and i did some research and i learned that the reaper has 5000 health points and it got me wondering how much health the sea dragon and the sea dragon also has 5000 hp although it cant be hurt by a thermo blade it can be harmed by the regular knife you know what you need to do now right take the sea dragon down if your not jacksepticeye like this comment so he will see it another creepy thumbnail heck yes the beginning do you know de wae are you gana play as the skrobriwer in hitman a good game to try after this one is a game called a hat in time i think you will like it i cant believe that jack didnt realize that the stew was a reference to the wizard of oz still havent figured out what the dummies and the weird noises representim terrible with symbolism in movies and stuff like that but i think this act is about how the kids got on the ship their dad was injured and disabled in ww1 and the only job he could get was to screen movies in his basement the kids would watch from the rafters because they werent allowed down there and they saw a pirate movie which led to them to pretending to be pirates the father hated the son james because his mother died giving birth to him and was abusive towards him and at some point the girl lily finally had enough and either started a fire or had some sort of a struggle with the father that led to a fire not sure which since there is a note about how much of a fire hazard the projecter in the basement is they left him to die in the fire and stowed away on the ocean liner to america also there are a bunch of homages to real life movies in this game and i think the disfigured thing in the wh youre the best home built out of beans eyy i just watched part 2 we set sail into the wild seas captain 505 is a reference to wizard of oz the scarecrows brain the robots heart and the lions courage somehow play bendy and the ink machine youll be a good voice actor on a record live stream irish potato stew it has many irish potatoes i think the thing of the game is jimmy is hiding from his abusive father that got rid of his older sister the voices he hears is the memories of his sisters its just a theory but it makes sense kinda jack your background looks like itali flag i think jack is bored from this game jack have you ever thought of creating a second channel just for anti me after watching this what if you see this have a great day 3 have some food ooo a like wait why is it blue the emo turtle glitch bitch is back in kratos voice the music is real good boy the films look like pirates of the caribbean movie scenes the character is a woman but i shouldnt assume their voice is more feminine when they get hurt guess whos back back again antis back tell a friend more satisfactory as soon as i saw the deformed living room i understood it was from the first part surprised that sean didnt notice i like watching you and your videos theyre all awesome and funny my personal favorite is the deing light version part three the one that has the different steps to kill the zombie with the tank on its back well we now know that the childrens father is the director theyre a poor family the boy probably isnt alive anymore their mom died when he was born or on his birthday later in his life the ship most likely caught on fire have i missed anything anymore that need to be added to the list i get it now im a smart man because i smash dat like button what if you played this as a vr game uh jack that section was a wizard of oz reference its all coming together is it tho i used to watch your videos and i came back after 2 years and your channel as gotten better and your equimpment is awsome and you always make me so happy my girlfriend broke up with me bc she with another person and your video made me so happy and this is not my account o im not really katherin pleas like my comment doarrhea u just ruined my childhood i still have a seashell form when i was 5 my hole life has been a lie i feel like im stepping inside willy wonkas chocolate factory me looking at green structure replica uh jack thats the emerald city of oz the scary voice is jackcan pls make a pubg video jack play residence evil revolutions 2 lets turn jacksepticeye saying fodder into a meme you should play this game called outer wilds wheres anti in the video todays fact the dark region on the north pole of plutos moon charon is called mordor i kept checking for this i just want this entire gameplay out at once its so g00d me when jack said that i am only hearing my blood rushing through my ear my entire life has been a lie sean i just wanna say thank you thank you for making these classic lets play type of videos i really love them youre the best me in the complete darkness cuz im in my closet puts video in full screen lets do this hell yeah creepy of oz i know its an old game but can u play alice madness returns 3 i love that game and i wanna hear ur comments on it jack u need to play ksp there is a new expansion coming soon something is incredibly wrong here theres someone else here no thats not possible theres no going back now play the part beasts in the dark uncover the secrets the titles of his recent horror games put together it seems like something is coming jack guess what its my birthday its about to go down anti is back when you realize the house at 403 is literally a warped version of the house from the first game meta thats thumbnail looks like jack is looking in to my soul jacky boyy do you want some jackeett booyyy pleaaseee you need thiss or i will give it to pewdiepies sen you totally didnt even notice the wizard of oz reference the green building where you said feel like im going to willy wonkas factory close you were off to see the wizard lol but that would mean this game is set in the 1930s at least according are you at the beginning caged more more acts completing act and it will reveal more more about the past just a little haeds up if i was watching anyone else i might be scared but i swear your comments just kill me im surprised you didnt mention it but the stew was consisting of the things the lion the tin man and the scarecrow wanted in the wizard of oz a brain a heart and courage which i guess is a cats arm cuz lion but also cuz you use your fists to fight just me or does the house layout in 400 look a lot like the one in layers of fear 1 so i was shocked by the blood vessel comment i didnt know if it was true so i did some research and just want to inform that its actually the sound of the environment bouncing around in the shell its pretty neat so i thought id share death is coming i remember playing the first one where you get books fall on u my friend shouted bible bashers sorry if anyone finds that offensive xd is the tim burton house not just the house from the first layers of fear noooooooo why the sea is not free you cant call this a scary game anymore of you are watching jacksepticeye jack why are your eyes black your creeping me out and scaring me i think the monster is the father you know what i am going to do like everybodies comments ooooooooh so spooky and a little creepy but i cant say i dont enjoy watching you play horror games because i do but any who i hope you have a great day until next time bye sorry for any miss spelling or wording roses are red violets are blue yayi got a like waitwhy is it blue so they took the same idea that stefano from tew2 how he lost his eye did he really didnt understand that it was the wizzard of oz jack you are handsome really didnt know about the seashell thing and now my day is ruined thanks jacksepticeye i was in a sad mood and you made me feel better jack have you played deceit jack doesnt upload yesterday im fourteen and thats deep did anyone else notice that the house in the beginning looked a lot like the layers of fear 1 housejust more small and narrow my theory is just a theory that you are playing as the actor but the actor is actually the sister and when her and her brother were younger to get away from their father after their mother died so they were stowaways on a ship during this time she might have gotten her brother killed because of starvation or whatever which led her to become the damaged actor and thats why the actor says they dont like the ocean because it makes her think of her brother and being on the ship and the method acting is making her relive the memories or the other way with the sister dying aaaah thank goodness you have good timing your videos are pretty much the only thing that makes me smile im relapsing again with anxiety always on the verge of a panic attack or crying any where i go even at home so being able to just escape for an hour is a real blessing im 13 and i did not know the actual science behind sea shells making sea sounds and proffesor jack taught me arigato sensei he protecc he attacc but most importantly keep up the video jacc jack and now i wake up sleepy me not everyone wakes up full of beans ya know my dog wakes up at 5am being a bouncy baby boy ooh a hatch john locke would be proud ah a man of refined taste the layout of this wierd house is similar to the house in the first game i love your videosnever stop what you love great video i loved it sometimes i try to make a funny comment to get a like by jacknever works but at least i chuckle at my own punny comments this whole game is still kinda confusing i mean it makes some sense but not enough and now people you know what depression is like you run but do u know da wae all hail the magic conch am i early yet nope i know i shouldnt be surprised that jack is a fan of roots bloody roots but somehow i am hey jack can u play a game called bitlife who else is noticing the manikin in the short movies being built limb by limb does it resemble someones character being built your videos are the best ever keep up the good work have a good day people scrolling through comments 3 anyone else notice that the strange house has the exact same layout as the one in the first game well before shit goes crazy lol anti is here we know we have to help him protective clover for you jack 2351 jimmy i thought the boys was james that whole freaky mouth segment really gave me the impression that the kids mum died giving birth to the younger child she gave everything for you prove it was worth it prove you werent a mistake edit a few clues in this video seem to point to this game taking place at some point after ww2 with the childrens story possibly taking place during ww2 clues i found at 3145 a torpedo hits the face of the something vicious lilly describes to me especially with the mention of it eclipsing the sun creates moon symbolism meaning a rockettorpedo hit the face of the moon this seems like a reference to the georges melies film a trip to the moon for anyone who doesnt know a rocket hits the eye of the man in the moon in this film and this especially fits with the film motif and yes im a huge nerd lilly mentioning darkness falling across town and seeing the stars as a thousand souls on fire could be a reference to blackouts and airr theres 163 views but 178 likes me sees thumbnail also me anti are you ever going back to mgs satisfactory this is so scary its actually bearstain i realized this after watching conspiracy theories for an hour it was wizard of oz but charlies chocolate factory is close enough wizard of oz how didnt he know the brain claw and heart aswell as the last door after you brewed the stew were all references to the wizard of oz the brain of the scarecrow the courage of the lion the heart of the tinman the gates of the emerald city me checks youtube and sees jacks new video noo im 28 minutes late i stayed up all night sleep is for the weak lol antis back back again antis back kill a friend jack in fnaf vr you are not done with parts and service you got to flip the switch that makes you high as balls and there are 4 more animatronics for you to fix like so jack can see plz please play oneshot just me or does lillys voice kinda sound like emma watson satisfactory pleeeaaaaase bring it baaaaaaaaack i loved iiiiiiitttt 649 im thinking this resembles the guy that was fighting over food with the dogs the arm looked like a dogs paw if anti isnt in this video then ill be disappointed did anyone else realize immediately after he fell through the hatch everything seemed bigger or he was smaller idk that is the worst thumbnail u have ever have 010 on efert u dont even do top to the morning to u lades or the hive five no more u changed i hate u now thumbnail was scary those thumbnails youve created for this game are freaking epic your work on layers of fear 2 is just amazing jacksepticeye keep up the amazing work you god among men high fives to you all day every day i punched the like button in the face like a boss wizard of oz reference lol the jakesepticeye movie that a great movie jack needs to relax cause his thumbnail releases things of idk love the boss why did u see this 5 times maybe you play as james just grown up and reliving his memories of when he and his sister were stowaways on a ship kidsitz the spirit of the seaits freedom jackno stupid its science kidsall around me r familiar faces blow jobs lmfao i said the exact same thing at the same time you did either ive been watching you to much or we think alike that door looked more like the emerald city science does not disprove the supernatural or the spiritual it physically cannot by the very definition of the word supernatural means beyond the ken or concept of the ordinary this means that science by itself cannot be used to prove or disprove the existence of metaphysical or supernatural instances entities or powers humans simply do not possess the mental faculty to quantify the existence of said things because thanks to the christian crusades 1000 years ago we were reduced in our spiritual and intellectual capacity by the same span of time due to the extensive and inflammatory nature of the crusades and the loss of knowledge and attempt to push out all religion or thought that was not centered on the judeochristian ideology our people as a species were influenced to believe that the supernatural did not exist our culture changed to reflect that shift in ideology and even though it wasnt a worldwide change as the continued existence of other theologies jack liking sepultura is a definite a this game isnt scaryat allwhat is this play plague inc again it has been one of my fave game series where is fnaf and tabs secret units can someone tell me how there are already dislikes 800 how the heck is your internet down in 2019 pay that bill already bruh p

like for no reason only og jack ubscribers can like this you can be an og of mine today make this blue if you luv ur mom i am gifting subs dam that scared me currently i am at 2915 i believe that one doll in the lift that was on the side might have been the disfigured person whether that is the player character or the director as some others suggested i am also thinking maybe the boy in desperation and starvation ate the girl not sure if he killed her or not but feeling that like an animal in need he did not think he just needed and he acted and ate her to survive just a hypothesis at the end now i do agree with the reviews you spoke of saying the game drags in places i feel like it drags a lot the director is disfigured not the actor i wonder if his sister died and hes not really taking to anyone i wonder if the part with the mannequins running the machines was a nod to metropolis homer simpson oh its just my f shadow lol it sounds like the game might have glitched when it said no it cant be but then cut to the other bit of dialogue hence why the game thought you didnt take it although i may be completely wrong maaan i could never play these games alone as i am thats not good thats not good either wah thats worse thats much worse now theres a mood if ever i saw one 2545 they look like the tin man from the wizard of oz that coffin jumpscare make me spill my coffee lol loving the long uploads chris the shadow does look like it could be a kids in this act maybe it is james and he did survive and became an actor and hes having some kind of mental breakdown being on that ship because of what happened to him and his sister i kind of assumed he was mr hardyjames in the last video could be completely wrong no clue at this point my theory is that they were actual stowaways on a ship and that the scary monsters chasing you are memories of a mix of the machinery engine on the ship frightening you with strange to the children noises and the crew of the ship trying to catch you them thank you for playing this has been really interesting storywise and loads of fun to watch and im really getting sick of the black and white stuff which i presume differentiates the past and present why we cant see the past in colour i dont know another hr video super cant have a game without a mannequin escort love your comments playing this rage 2 i like to come back watch your playthroughs after ive gotten so far in layers agree there should be more colour dont be too hard on yourself when it comes to collecting everything cause you are very thorough and there were many chase sequences kinda hard to look around when your being chased very excited story oh i nailed it it is tony todd narrating feels proud can you subcribe in my channel i am noticing framerate problems in this video maybe those two kids are just playing a game in the tree house a make believe story of running away and fighting and surviving attacks from a monster the protagonist is merely borrowing their light or their story and by the end perhaps something went wrong and innocence got lost and the protag and the director lured the kids in a real dangerous situation and one of them got killed because of the direct action of the protag i couldnt help but think of the 1998 godzilla line thats a lotta fish near the end of the act lol great vid as always by the way so this sounds like the voice of the man who narrates tomorrowland lol maybe he didnt ask the blue fairy to be a real boy my theory is that james may be the younger version of the actor it would explain why the actor hates the sea and boats now this game is so cool i really like it and the voice acting definitely takes it to another level after this nonsense week an excellent video the runtime is fantastic too much prefer watching your thorough organic playthroughs to a more scripted show these days yay i can finally relax and enjoy my date night with chrislol happy friday to me so the theme with this game is noir films maybe there really is a lot of flashing lights though im wondering if you eventually are choosing between someone like you against the crew or lily against james it would be nice if you are actually making a difference too many black and white sections the enjoyment is ruined so i gave the 2nd act a shot hoping it was better than the first but i cannot get into this game at all i am not into the story and something just seems like its missing gameplaywise its very predictable with the room changes and cheap jump scares and the mannequins are so played out and overdone its definitely a game thats more enjoyable to watch with your commentary rather than play imo i want to go back to fuck to seems like a swell place thanks for the video great nightmare fuel i have just a very morbid theory as we all know rats are just edible with ketchup but obviously we had none so lilly sacrificed her life for us andyes cannibalism and now she is always with us and will ever be but maybe i was just too long outside in the sun and my brain got toasted i dont knowbut i still love the game and the developers creativity einfach geil ur commentary is great xd some of these scenes are as if a machine for pigs was made by fritz lang 3146 not that it means anything at all but the first letters of each all caps word on that note when unscrambled spell famous phd i feel conflicted with this game i want to like it but the mannequins feel derivative the black and white is frustrating and its all so overly mysterious i get the kids starving on the ship thing but i dont feel connected to them or the main character or his struggle or anything ill watch the whole series because i love chriss commentary and the channel but i think the developers missed the mark on this one when something spontaneously appears in a horror game when you turn around ive started referring to it as janeting after the assistant who always appears out of nowhere on the good place it makes them a little less disturbing i think black and white is cool because im color blind your references are definitely making thishope your wknd is great i will have something to look forward to after the wknd hey everyone i saw on the last comment section that a few of us wanted to see chris on twitch and i feel conflicted on that so i figured i would list the pros and cons pros we get to see him live we get to subscribe to him again we get to make donations because he deserves all of our money cons he is live and sees our messagesgets donations i list them both as a pro and a con because although it would be cool a key appealing factor of chris is how he is able to take his time and concentrate on the game at hand often leading to valuable insights and commentary my fear is that by having us as distractions we may take away from that anyways let me know what you think and thank you cju you craft excellent work as always brilliant special effects no theories yet a very twisted tale actually i think the slides say 2311 23rd day eleventh month i love your videos thanks so much for posting such long videos so often you allow me to experience these games without me having to hide under my desk and thats very appreciated xd well i have the same theory but why the disfigured part also nice harry potter pun lovely job this game seems to have had a slow start overlyexplanatory perhaps with all the exposition crammed in the first act but it seems to have picked up the pace i think these horror games in general would have a more spooky feeling if they just stop adding sound effects whenever monsters pops out you are spoiling us with those long videos man thanks for sharing i do have a theory but might give the game story away only seen your lp so just as blind as you chris so be warned not to look further if my theory is correct anyway my theory is your actually a stowaway on the ship and you basically stole the identity of the famous actor aka your taking the role of the character i cannot stop thinking of skull island loving the series so far havent had good internet where im at in months so i behind on videos been switching between this and the conjuring house still trying to get caught up i was also thinking of titanic lmao mmhm this series is making me roundhouse kick my cat because he brings alive rats as a gift for me every

out whichever way you go you or her as long as you choose anything is better than this place its a cipher just starting the video cant wait as so many of the comments reference different horror movies 2444 the bdsm equivalent of a pillow cinema rotten cherries blood plucked flowers and pulled out flaming heartwhat do you think happened when the the girl was caught by the sailors 4403 look at me im da captain now another great walk through oh btw that one poster for the movie remember her is totally the actor tony curtisway before your time 2401 nah its ok chris youre talking to the mic we can hear ya thank you so much for the advertisement flashing lights i do really appreciate it yep the last chapter you needed to find the courage lions paw the brain and the heart to made soup in the magic of oz this chapter has more references in the terror gender like the shining hall with blood and seven great gameplay cju i just realize now that tony todd is narrating i must be getting old took me 4 episodes 4111 is less seven and more hellraiser for me this act made me nauseous watching but definitely got me with the scares lol 3843 there was an interaction icon on the chest dunno if it does anything except close it though great video the room in 3218 is a twin peaks reference minus the red color so apparently this game has three endings and they all relate to whether you obey or disobey the director the most the third one aptly named formless is the one where your decisions are balanced so two times you obey and two times you dont items that are missing in the top part of your room are found in a new game hey cju im a bit surprised you didnt check that empty chest thats right before the pirate shipcannon part a second time i dont know if anything is in it once youve set all the rats free but i wondered since that cloth appeared and the rope ladder did as well maybe something appeared in the chest something to try hey i dont what voice is whothe director or the narrator either way there are 3 male voices that speak 1 of them sounds like the guy who played the candyman in the original movie this chapter is fking awesome the last message when decoded reads you are so close to getting out whichever way you go you or her as long as you choose anything is better than this place family guy reference just a note based on what ive looked into seems like you cant get all the special items in the first play through the ones on pedestals with the book theres one thats in a ng the thing that should not be metallica lol i love all music lol is that the globe from the last game with rose is that the same ship makes you think starting to think our director is cthulhuor an elder god of some sortor it could all just be red herrings cju i love your commentary man keep it up i personally think your on of the best youtubers on here and you actually play video games pretty intellectually unlike most lol and your very good at spotting hidden things a majority of the time in games if i may i recommend playing until dawn i believe it is for pc as well which i think you play most your games on not sure what all of your consoles and such are but try to find a way to play that game it truly is a interesting game and i believe the horror in it is pretty top notch plus you basically direct how the end of the game will go based on choices you make and paths you choose and such other games i recommend are life is strange 1 and 2 there like the walking dead telltale series where they are episodic and you choose how the story ends and such personally i think the life is strange games have even better stories then the walking dead telltale series try to play them as well anyway keep up the good work 1751 hahaha youve gotta give props to a man who notices stubborn stains on the furniture in the middle of all that chaos and craziness as a visual experience this game is amazing as a story its too vague and obscure for me ill be interested to see if all the threads are tied up into a coherent meaningful package in the end im thinking maybe lilly never existed and you have two personalities one to protect the otherlilly to protect james and that is the one that had all the bad things happen to it well really enjoying the game and playthrough cju and another amazing act the reference to seven was absolutely fantastic but does that mean we are guilty of all those sins im still thinking we did something horrible to lily or we watched her dying without helping her im looking forward to the last act and very curious how this all ends glad you uploaded this game is kinda sxlxow but i do exnjxoy the gameplay thank youglad as are you that the color is more present and the bw fewer frames thank you your uh a piece of candyfamilyguy reference made my day keep the good stuff coming your videos are the highlights of my day m not sre if like is the right verb to define what i feel this game is quite disturbing more than outlast series on my opnion and i loved all 3 outlast games feels like a lot of movie inspirations appeared in this chapter references of psycho seven original suspiria and possibly the shining i loved the reference to suspiria around 1100 complete with the goblinesque musik taking a break from life right now so super glad you uploaded this game just makes me more excited for the candyman remake i personally feel this game should have a candyman easter egg or something yes u def are james in this it should come up in the story at some point prob one of the few facts that we can be 100 sure xd layers of fear 2 is a better game than its predecessor in both storytelling and horror mechanics add the above average visuals and the great voice acting and you got yourself a very good game heck yeah been waiting on this one yayy was waiting for it i kinda guessed the survivor is the sister when all the mirrors in game are smudged im embarrassed but the story was way too difficult for me to follow im pretty lost on it but the sound design in the game was superb i cannot compliment it enough the voice actors are incredible the music oh my gosh all of it was amazing the story is so confusing i dont know who i am or whats my mission you are an amazing youtuber truly i enjoy watching you play anything i hope you continue what you are doing sir when the little rat was on the hat soooo cute this game is so detailed and amazing i loved the first jump scare awww i adore how enamored you are with the handsome rat im confuseddo we play as lilly the whole game 4015 the face down in pasta dead guy is a reference to se7en hmm this would be great in color just if you had the sound of heels to hint your character you play as was a woman it was enjoyable watching you play this i love that you stop to appreciate the art and work put into a game thank you kravin 5816 im pretty sure the tree and the song the sister hums is a reference to pans labyrinth dr sleep is brilliant please read before the move comes out kravin love looking at your videos and thanks for showing your tattoo please continue making more here xo please play a plus game the game is outstanding your gameplay is one of the best absolutely love it and you have amazing tattoos 11058 jesus that hit me hard i would love to watch you stream this you are the only you tuber i watched who got this ending i really enjoy your play throughs because i feel like you really appreciate the games you play and take your time you notice things that others dont great job and thanks for playing this game was very cool it was mike flanagan who made hill house and geralds game as a movie freak im loving all the references and movie talk definitely yes to new game grammaphone oh wow i kinda half expected the twist to be something like youre actually the sister or youve taken to dressing like her or vice versa if only because there was womens clothing in the dressing room at the start of the game not to mention i think every single poster had a womans voice at least a lot of them did so we were the sister the whole time i didnt enjoy this game as much as the original layers of fear but i always love watching kravin play anything someone give kravin a cute rat the se7en reference is amazing you know thinking back for each poster you pick up i think you always hear a line from both a man and a woman i dont know if that makes anything make more sense tho if you end up exploring new game at all thatd be fun to see more plague tale please heres a game suggestion httpswwwlittlemisfortunecom i wonder if hes been living as his sister or something so that she can live forever but there was also that clip at the beginning where the radio man was talking about the lead actor and some clip about how she had been killing me all along hm stream please for sure hey i have the transmutation circle in a tattoo also im down for a stream of the game too i found you years ago because of the first lof you were one of the only youtubers that actually read the notes to us after watching your playthrough of soma and the cat ladyi was hooked on your channel ever since so its so surreal to be able to experience this one with you in real time so to speak hehehe thanks for making me smile on days when i wouldnt otherwise oh m gee me and my hubby have been waiting for this refreshing your page for the past days and finally buy now i cant wrap my head around the story maybe it wasnt the james that survived although those interview thingies were from james after surviving but his sister who killed him the scene with the curtains where she stabbed someone and said something like we cant be forever but i will and she killed him as to save him as he wasnt capable of surviving by himself or maybe james survived but lost his mind and so he became his sister as to honor her and like it was said you are too week to be someone else and something like that idk it leaves so many unanswered questions aghhh thank you so much i dont usually like these kind of things bit my husband does so watching this together with you makes it easier for me and definitely more fun a new game stream would be amazing i actually really enjoyed the different secrets and things hidden away in this game its something i wish the first one did great playthrough kravin i ended up getting pretty invested in this game which is unusual for me although i got invested enough in plague tale from episode 1 that i bought it myself lol but still you play lots of good games i had fun ive had that deftones song stuck in my head for about a week its the creepiest thing of this playthrough but loved watching it i really needed this kravin thank you that first jump scare on craven was priceless mike i love you so much i love the everyone take a timeout and stretch segment where you showed us your tattoos i really enjoy watching your videos and i would love to watch you replay this and look for more cluessecretsdifferent endings i like that the game directory says fear 2 yes please for a stream of a new game plus great game great videos thank you for sharing and yes i would watch you play it again on stream thanks for finishing it you got the same ending as me i liked the first one more and i agree with you on the dying part i get it why they added it but gets so frustrating sometimes and after a time it wasnt scary just annoying i also find the first one scarier still a nice game liked the story and i think i get most of it a bit confusing but interesting lol sos aint333 its click as many times as possible till one gets response great spoiler i somehow early through the play through figured out that youre playing as the sister due to the pirate thing fitting why would the brother be the person youre playing as when he was against acting out the pirate themes doesnt make sense but im guessing depending on who you shoot who you end as thats what im guessing so theres maybe a ending 2 where the brother survives i like games like this there so unique and the stories are mind killing i guess yes replay the game love the tattoos horror movies are my favorite i have a michael myers sticker on my car that says slay but no tattoos that honor them yet ok now im going to have to fabric if its anything like tire that movie was hysterical also surprised to find someone thats watched it besides me and my family gotta love those cheesy horror movies i would definitely love to see you replay this again as for the game i think the story if confusing in my opinion i thought it was about a director struggling to get over his sisters death and forever blames himself reliving those finally days with her but after seeing that ending i found myself saying what the hell was that lolxd i think the first game was perfect and i actually understand the plot more its actually the first came that gave me feelings for the monster and was cheering it on to kill the husband i would love to see you replay that one again sometime in the future but yeah this game was ok and im 100 supportive on seeing another play through ps sorry if some of the speech doesnt make sense im using my phone haha anyway take care and hope to see you soon in another game play love the friday the thirteen and halloweengreat art workwill there be more tattoo s in the further i wish to see all the different endings a good man would crawl over a thousand good censor for a sweet boys censor to call himself a man visually stunning but i feel the story in the first one is better yesss need you to stream it love your videos youre the best kravin confirmed as some sort of magic teleporter my bathroom light turns itself off automatically after a while and it happened to turn off around 6 min in the video when the dummy jumps out that really scared me lol i would totally watch you replay this game on stream i was totally about to go to sleep until i got the notification finally youre my favorite horror gamer i love and enjoy and like your videos that you make for us to watch on youtube mrkravin im here so early that i have literally nothing to say but hi so hey not first but close 5852 act cool 10604 the ring can someone plase give a timestamp of the s p o o n what if the manicans are actually people shes just perceiving as manicans davis a spoon the best part of this whole thing im crying xd the devs did a good job showing what actually on a ship like dogging the door 1505 and the search lights look like the ones we still use today when are we getting jirards empty drawers tshirts or drawers im glad at least one of them had a guidemade things go a lot smoother alright can we all agree to quit saying its just a mannequin we all know that mannequins are awful and terrifying is it just me or is that narrator the guy from eternal darkness you cant die in this game oh how i wish that were true one of the things that set the first one apart for me was the fact that you couldnt die took away frustration and left room for solid puzzles and atmosphere building honestly so far the escape parts of the game arent too bad and go pretty smooth once you know the trick for the encounter but i still wish those sections either didnt exist or failing them set you down a different route instead of just check pointing you fork exists davis gasp a spoon fork am i a joke to you i need an sgs spoon tshirt 1008 or onions feels like its easy to make a game look good when you are incapable of interacting with the world save from opening doors and picking up paragraphs of words i love 19131946 era sorry thats when the world started to develop more quickly its so much fun to learn about i love video games set during this time period god i want a time machine i missed this scart game squad so much thank you guys 2648 in case of fire strike the knob im so excited for this 3 i think the mounted thing is an alligator gar scary game squad is my favorite thing ever tbh ok im here wheres the good ending not a single person in comments are realizing that jesses talk about a ship more valuable than silver or gold is a reference to the time he talked to totalbiscuit about the same subject during their terraria lets play voice actor isnt littlefinger its tony todd game do you remember me the 21st night of september honestly that head on the wall looks like a goblin shark you guys get way too plastered when playing sgs you totally missed that there was a tape of morse code attached to the headphones at 2229 d also missed that there was something on the floor when the vase broke xd lol youtube thinks this game is fear 2 project origin i was think singing fantastic voyage but transatlantic voyage instead when jirard mentioned coolio that adobe caslon pro took me out quite early into the video 2414 anyone else notice as soon as look away from the door the was they go into that room was missin get ready for a jumpscare coxcon special guests davis at 2130 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2avqlzkze fuck that fucking mannequin scare jesus h christ jumped so much i bit my damn tongue the first sos signal was sent out from the titanic god i really want to enjoy watching this but that one bit of background music keeps repeating and it drives me nuts spoon and wheres the good ending i can tell im gonna love this series already you guys got stay alive which is a great movie with frankie but also gamer has butler in it stay alive is amazing one of my top favorite horror films jesse what ship is more valuable than one made of gold alex an internship oh im going to be disappointed arent i ive heard not good things about this one spoons are the new rubber ducks a spoon thats a fork hahaha look at that terrifying framerate you can almost count the layers the fucking shout at the steam got me crying laughing omg just saw this and noticed the next part already uploaded in the sidebar cant wait to dive in with yall microwaves doob smokes popcorn 4103 its not frankie muniz its logan lerman welp once again sgs is a giant disappointment stopped watching at 1319 because they arent even paying attention to the game good job sgs you have permanently lost another viewer ive got you with the trumpet music totally tracks with me a spoon lmao i cant believe they missed the note next to the radio before they made you who you are you were a kid tony todd is in this game ohhhhhh this is gonna be a good series even as a germanthat was definitely not a spoon nor a lffel d the f in the title screen looks kinda like a little man trying to hug the e i always knew it the secret to a good spoon is a fork clearly a fork davis a spoooooooon edit also everytime you guys say build the character i keep thinking of bioshock infinite when they say give up the girl wipe away the debt dammit jesse now i have to think of another title for my layers of fear video xd but great video nice to see the squad still keeping it awesome man i love you guys but after 10 the babble of voices is just too much xd ill be back tomorrow to watch i love watching these horror games mainly because of the funny comments you guys say this is amazing on acid you guys are fucking hilarious i remember when you guys used to get drunk and do these sad that they didnt notice it was freakin tony todd doing the va legend of horror movies come on layers everyone but alex of fear alex of what also spoon shirt when lof 1 painting lof 2 acting lof 3 writing lof 4 youtubing thank you scary game squad for giving me a reason to live 314 thank you please enjoy the movie slightly disappointed that none of them noted that the first film they watched was basically an inferior all the worlds a stage layers of fear was made my favorite game because of you guys im so excited for this i literally just kept rewatching the ah a spoon part over and over cackling all the while our boys are back and in fine form last year we gave davis ducks this year give him a spoon internship lmao layers of fear 2 wait did jesse mean odysseus instead of ulysses immediately realized they on a boat d the game voices are incredibly quiet compared to you guys its very hard to hear sees the video title just fuck me right up its funny im not sure if they are scared a game without consequences seems silly this day and age wow i didnt even know this game was coming out thanks sgs i was taking a drink at 3903 and bashed my fucking teeth on the can how did jesse resist joining the navy seaman cox reporting sir the tick spoon literally started watching layers of fear before i even knew this was coming and just finished all of it so excited you started this huh never thought id ever see a game use the name baynes before love it thanks guys i just realised that a jesse cox and or sgq series of danganronpa would be the best thing in the world 2 3s if the game volume could get turned up you can tell these dudes dont get out of la when they think deer are scary sgs from the start play the character layer of fear 2 from 2019 play the character ive been holding off on anything about this game to let sgs play it be still my heart so much sgs is it christmas its called a dinglehopper get your facts straight someone link me to a picture of ghost rider screaming yeeeessss when i heard that layers of fear 2 came out i expected this video and it was the only thing about this game i was excited for aye lets get scared happy upbeat music plays 4059 oh you most definitely can die in this game i learned that the hard way the mechanic in this game is more like outlast you can actually get hurt by things gasp a spooon almost as good if not better than ropes im going to love this series purely for the old timey voices youre going to dieeee baby thats up there with ropesnever change davis didnt realise the antagonist of the game was dr claw from inspector gadget so glad you guys play scary games im to much of a scardey cat to play them the squad is great as usual perfect opening gamewise i am not a fan of the jerky stick camera controls takes me right out of it 1625 was this a love actually joke i think you had the chance to actually put your signature on the paper for the fan on 2855 im so exited i loved the first layers of fear sgs spoon memes incoming im gonna take a wild guess and say the character you play is everyone on the ship and lost their mind because of how much they push themselves into their role what kind of ship is a more valuable ship made of gold or silver that ones easy jesse a bag of chips crendor 2012 2911 i remember jessie asking tb the same question in terraria give them an airship and he eats for the day teach a man with an internship and he has a job who remembers the rat from the first layers of fear im aweful with names but wasnt it something like wheels i love these guys and this series so much thats all davis shitting himself because of a legit scare everyone else been spendin most our lives livin in a ganstas pear that may have actually been a spoon ysgramors soup spoon to be exact i dig the narrators voice am i the only one who thinks theyre running through the game i spoiled myself for the spoon goof in the comments so i wasnt expecting it to still hit me like a fucking truck when it happened jesus christ that was good xd yes yes yes thank you jesse the level of confidence davis had when he called that fork a spoon is how confident i wish i was all the time i dont know if this counts but if they played deadly premonition itd make my life i dont know anything about this game but i have a theory it talks a lot about stowaways and about being an actor what if youre a person that idolizes this actor and you stowaway on this ship with them then you kill the actor and are beginning to become them you are building yourself to be that actor person a thumbs up for a s p o o n you guys really do spoil us frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally buried so close to the fountain of youth scary game squad is here again the directori assume is the voice we were hearing sounding like tony todd layers of fear was better 0 5 rubber duckies a twitch stream its a spoon the spoon is the new ropes from the company that brought you jirards empty drawers welcome to jirards empty rooms layers upon layers of an ogre is this being played on the ps4 looks nice frame rate seems low though can really notice it when turning and the water effects wait a minute the guy voicing the director thats tony todd holy shit i knew i recognized that voice you can bet your sweet ass i watched both ads in their entirety 355 guy speaking to the character me wait three dog is that you where you at you son of a bitch give me a hug i just screeched at a spoon for almost 10 minutes im so happy that sgs is so frequent these days d yes you guys are playing it i was waiting for you guys to do this guessing it now your an actor trying to get into the proper mindset to play the insane artist from lof1 in a film been waiting for this series yay so glad you guys are playing this when i saw it was out i was hoping youd get to ityour playthrough of lof1 is a favorite of mine side note you may have figured it out already but i think the fish on the wall is a brown sailfish its hard to say because it doesnt have the sword on its nose but i dont think that would be something people would want on a ship that could possibly toss theyre big with a wide mouth like that just a thought finally 152 little big planet not tearaway i love the candymanmortician as the director jesse you guys wouldnt understand theatre cox double majored in theatre and history you cant die in this game hehehehehe httpsenwikipediaorgwikithebounty1984film daniel daylewis boat movies for anyone actually curious ah a spoon shoutout to the first great quote of the playthrough may there be many more that sculpture that keeps showing up on the ship looks like one of the blind mutant penguins from mountains of madness my prayers have been answered thank yall for getting scared for our entertainment youre banter and screams definitely made my day much better 3 this game is ahmazeing i knew i recognised the narrators voice at 350 worfs brother kurn actor tony todd oh mah gahd im so glad you picked this up the slow decline of the sgs it happens to all scare oriented groups or gamers as they get bored of playing scary games and just start goofing off while they slog through the game i am guessing youre mental and hiding in an actor personality so you can be whoever and not remember whatever you did in the past here we go also you guys should make a compilation when yous done the first one was hilarious i really hope they play the second fatal frames at some point outro shouldnt have a loud scream in it nobody absolutely no one davis spooon pepega yesssssss thank you guys first jump scare and theyre too engrossed talking about pearsyep were in it now so ugly you broke the mirror dont worry man you may be horribly disfigured but youre still handsome to me jesse to quote another great weird manspooooooon i literally saw this games was released and was like sgs will ride again a lot sooner than normal 1727 dick knowledge yes this is the best scary game squad is absolutely my favourite series on the internet icarus was titanic too subtle yes yes yes yes my favourite spooky game company and my favourite spooky game players okay i was cutting my fingernails like an idiot while watching this and got jumpscared by that damn mannequin just about ripped one off and learned a valuable lesson in the process ooh a spoon better known as a fork xp gotta love davis that ah a spoon was great he sounded so pleased with himself as well i love how with the globe bit they went oh that wasnt so scary followed immediately by them getting spooked hell yeah been waiting to watch this with you sgs boys mostly hype to hear davis lose his shit lol i drank a lot of boss coffee in japan only because of the scary game squad xd im so

continuation this is my most favorite lets play by all the peeps in sgs and i am very very very excited thank you again the fact that i just made some boss coffee i dont know how to feel i love these boys so much scary game squad is best squad edit yeah that green carpeted dining room is definitely the most cozy comfortable beautifully rendered space ive seen in a game id relax in a vr app thats just that room and a music player edit 2 jeez even the belowdecks and luggage areas are gorgeously rendered if somewhat squalid each anothers audience outside the gilded cage awesome but dont pull a super best friends and spend way too much time together yessss ive avoided all other playthroughs to wait for this one love sgs d this game was meant for jesse because what does he always say when they play these games play the character what have i done to deserve such wonderfulness hell to the yeah 937 i think this narrator is from the no sleep podcast from the man who brought you ropes comes a spoon is that voice at 400 tony toddcandyman triggered my childhood fears act l in roman numerals would be act 50 no big deal cant wait to see how he responds to sporks yall really spoiling us in the past month hell yeah was waiting for this how many ducks will there be this time spooky that i had no idea this sequel was a thing but i was thinking about layers of fear today yes knew you would pick this up couldnt wait ohhhhhh its herrrrrrrre yes barely at the beginning and that voice you hear sounds exactly like snoke jesse cocks is a soy boy i really wish thered be less noise made on this show its just a nonstop noise show where you guys drown out all the ambient game sounds and even miss scares every playthrough gets more and more shitty singing and noisy 1523 that old town road reference killed me lmao i broke my wrist yesterday and the fact that this playthrough is happening helps more sgs so soon yes please something something something wendingos guys yes i was waiting for

playthrough to boot this gon be goooood so youre telling me that theres a second layer to all of this ill see myself out aw yeah time to crack open the boss coffee edit holy shit they brought it back for this episode a spoon thats a fork davis poor davis hope this doesnt kill him like the duck were in boys tom clancys unicorn enfilade 2740 i mean dont tell him its a different jane i think your nearest manaquin factory is in highams park that thing in doctor who you guys are awesome its a hellevator oh no why did my mind instantly get the kpop song stuck in my head the andy bit reminded me of a time i called out to binge tew2 and i forgot to put appear offline mode on and one of my supervisors saw that he didnt tattle on me but he did laugh at me next time i saw him is this the sequel to the book monster game i love how mike says breakpoint with that accent did jane hear the churro cause she sure as hell didnt see it with that camera angle im so confused by the intro how can jane see that andy has a churro if hes not holding his phone up to his face also andys phone isnt even in call mode xd if andy were there hed be frozen with fear surely you meant to say hed be frozen with layers of fear surprisingly still havent watched titanic irish people spoilers jane go to your local mannequin factory mike who has a local mannequin factory probably midsommer theyve got everything there especially murder you two had your lunch in the pub before this didnt you a couple more pints than expected mango ipa is irresistible after all ah yes the word pirates is an anagram of spider dont think about it too hard is it just me or is jane super attractive one advantage of having such a common name is being able to take credit for other peoples things for example i samantha smith have been an actress in tv shows such as friends and supernatural i am a retired tennis player turned commentator the itv weather woman and have had many different behind the scenes roles in films check the credits if you dont believe me pacman as a first person survival horror like resi 7 sorry to see that andy was out ill with disneyflu get well soon d so i have been a very big outside xboxxtra fan for a long time from the beginning of xbox and sceptical but immediately won over but xtra within 2 second of its launch im really happy and hope all 5 of my friends are making money from all their amazing hard work but i do find myself enjoying more what culture gaming as maybe a direct competitor or at least there is a lot more output i like games coming up per month on this channel but i feel like there is less journalism in your vids than there was i hope you pals are all ok and still enjoying it as much as you were personally i skip the dd although i know its super popular i assume thats where youre making money genuinely good for you you deserve it i understand you cant keep making vids about 10 best games throw paper at mikes head but what happened to some of the lets plays like gta online what do you think about all the announcements recently about the next gen consoles fingers crossed ab i appreciate how the only ride they actually shot from inside was its a small world because theres no way that experience could be any worse for the other riders as it is hey oxboxtra i noticed that whenever you talk about bandai namco you reverse the order of the words and say namco bandai why do you do that is it a british thing mostly this just made me sad because i thought all of oxboxtra was getting to go to galaxys edge and im bummed they didnt all get to go mikes love for christian bale valid when mike and jane realized they could do things andy would disapprove of they should have turned show of the week into show of the weekend acting like ellen and luke giving each other quizes drawing and singing challenges and some choose your own adventure adventures the scariest part of this was the thought of a fast and furious 9 man layers of fear 2 looks boring combining luke and andys favorite game tropes ships horror wasnt this done in little nightmares to riff on the pacman gritty reboot pacman but its an asymmetrical 4on1 multiplayer game in the style of evolve it slots right in im assuming everyone has a pub sweet shop local manikin shop and maybe a creepy cruise ship shop in the posh areas 1141 maybe in character youre not freaked out yet mikes not freaked out outofcharacter either so its still actually in character 1543 jane there are 1000 possibilities not 999 dont forget that 000 is a possibility too john fredrick thomas jane the author of janes fighting ships was british and it is still a british company its a well documented fact that churros have numerous medicinal properties i can only commend andy in taking the proper steps to combat his no doubt debilitating ailment can we get a morgan mondays soon pls i just started playing rdr 2 on my brother in laws ps4 less than 3 minutes in and we already have childrens heads coming off although i must protest childrens heads are not supposed to come off arent they though spoiler clyde would be the rat omg this game or rather this type of game bore me to tearsooh an overly pretentious clueoh no the light went out argh maybe an assailant oh it wasnt yawn cue ending of either it was all a dream or its your mind thats the real horror tom clancy is just ghost writing your brave pair you im sure mike is fine with this jane maybe less so but im sure she can handle it better than andy luke and ellen this better be done as a lets play at some point please mannequins are the real evil here really looking forward to e3 2019 already see you there people i hope i am more than willing to be your sea of thieves nerascus if you will have me of course gt is reddevildom for your info a 4 player coop game where you play as blinky inky pinky and clyde where you chase pacman around in a 3rdperson perspective through the corridors up until pacman flips the switch and then it turns into a horror game of avoiding pacman through the dark corridors as he chases you down hearing only wacka wacka wacka wacka wacka wacka wacka wacka seeing mike trying to mimic fear is like seeing a robot trying to mimic human emotions wait a minute avoiding the spotlight like some worthless extra a star of janes calibre didnt they see her starring role in ready player one andy has a fever and the only prescription is more churros mike referenced soulja boy and immediately earned my like hey ox crew can you guys please do lets plays for games that have been out for a while but have enough depth that you could keep doing lets plays moreover games that are new indies or older indies that you never played i only like watching oxboxoxtra lets plays but you guys seem to just focus on new releases these days this game is a good example but heres a few others void bastards outer wilds mordhau anthem yeah i know its hated rn but its still fun to watch and play shadow of the tr witcher 3 dlcs shadow of war dishonored 2 black ops 4 blackoutzombies bfv battle royale mode pubgfortniteapex smash bros switch below ashen dark souls remaster senua tacoma prey mooncrash deus mankind divided wtf happened you guys loved this series and never played it re 5 remastered state of decay 2 dlcs the evil within 2 ghost recon wildlands predator halo 5 soo much free dlc most of all destiny 2 you get the idea and i know youre super busy but i am i the only one instantly disappointed that it wasnt andy playing layers of fear 2 im so down for a series on sea of thieves childrens heads are not supposed to come off mike with the hard hitting facts its just not the same without andy saying shut up mike shut up mike d janejogging apathetically nicking everythings world invasion ghostsokand with the real stuff done now let me think of a game acronym layer of fear2 seem just as boring as the first out here in idaho there is a brewery that does a mango ipa im not a huge ipa fan but that one is quite good 0046 andy talking into phone jane looking into andys soul and see a churro also sea of thrives part are you sure andy wont mess himself because of pirates skeleton pirates the pac man talk whos been taking the pills ive never seen titanic but i know how it goes spoiler alert the ship sinks lets burn down the mannequin factory so this can never happen again screw layers of fear my mind is bending trying to decipher the layers to that into what r u trying to tell me mike enters into area where someone is talking to andy on the phone carrying an empty bowl with no spoon i heard andy was sick i made him some soup well credit where its due he tried ive never seen tiitanic i count myself lucky i was turned off by the the ads with billy zane brandishing a gun on titanic as a person with an irrational fear of mannequins janes comment about how every day the world contains more mannequins is the scariest thing ive ever heard there are 1000 possible combinations since 000 is a valid combination isnt sea of thieves nerascus just johnny chiodini that beardy boi loves sea of thieves where do i apply to be the sea of theives nerasucs i have no skill or natural talents but i have a can do attitude and will make you all look good in comparison are you sure this isnt the titanic couldnt you draft ellen or luke for your 4th crew spot whats the point of having underlings if you cant draft them to fill out hte party plus sea of thieves seems right up lukes alley mike ask for jump scare and then does not move even an inch this is what happens when andy take the dayoff and is not around to correct things mango does not help avoid scurvy vitamin c fruits do ive noticed that ive begun saying i have things for days or out the wazoo a great deal and im pretty sure jane is almost entirely to blame actually yes its definitely jane and on the subject of tshirts we really need a lol my dudes shirt with cartoon jane underneath make that and you can name your price oxbox surely sea of thieves nerascus would be johnny mushroom from eurogamer sure blame the skeletons but arent we all really skeletons deep down so we were the real monsters the entire time jane its not churroitis its churrosis and it can be very serious even worse its one of those conditions that you cant really cure you just manage it mostly with gym memberships oh i see andy went on the foreign language film dubbed into english ride 0047 mannequins cant be trusted its like people never heard of dr who autons speaking of nerascus will there ever be an oxventure npc named nerascus why is jane face timing andy when hes holding the phone to his ear basic technical fail have you guys thought of doing a borderlands1 2 or ps maybe even 3 when it comes out coop stream i heard andy was sick so i brought him some soup empty bowl ive clearly been spending too much money on soup im just here to upvote all the comments asking for egs johnny to join as the fourth member of your potential sot galleon crew when mike didnt turn off the taps in the sink part of me died inside no wonder the ship flooded actually i remember there being something of a gritty reboot of pacman that was really good and honestly pretty stressful i forget the name specifically but it was pacman 3d or something like that and was the old game but in first person made it a bit utterly terrifying pacman gritty reboot pacman is a drugaddled serial killer cannibal the ghosts are the sprirts of his victims trying to stop him from beyond the grave you play as the ghosts hmmm get me namco on the phone wait e3 is where death stranding is gonna be announced and jane and mike like horror hideo kojima and possibly norman reedus and death stranding has all of them so can we expect you guys to play death stranding 1542 sorry jane but there are actually 1000 combinations 000999 but otherwise love the look of the game will need to dig out my copy of layers of fear to play sometime mike and jane talk about the definition of breakpoint me remembering when jane was the lone survivor rip andy and mike 43 05 there is laughing in the background my guess is ellen while jane laments on the possibility of pirate revenge show of the week feat ellen ha johnny from eurogamer should join the crew for sea of thieves my worst fear is maniquins every day the world contains more mannequinswell that thoughts going to haunt me thanks jane sea of thieves oxcrew free for all or sea of thieves outsidexbox vs outsidextra wait theres stealth sections in a horror game mikes playing they truly know their audience i suspect that a stealth section in any game is a fear of mikes skeletons may be evil but they make a killer orphanage fast and furious 9 pt experience it was tragic and now they are ghosts is a universal ending to any story ever told mike with the emperors new soup there there are about 5830000 results results for mango ipa mike tom clancys ghost recon breakpoint good dirty fun mike channel 1543 jane 1031000 xd 000 is also a combination wow andy got through those rides really fast jane into camera thats a churro andy holding phone to ear where can i get a phone like it that can see through heads why is andy holding a facetime call up to his ear like my mom does okay i call mallarky theres no way andy got through that many disneyland lines that quickly play soma if you havent already watches gameplay this tall tales content from sea of thieves is getting pretty spooky andy the master of stealth puts the facetime call to his ear to disguise the fact that he was indeed at home sick and definitely not at disneyland most unrealistic thing in this whole video is how andy could get from one disney ride to another in the space of one phone call really like how far you guys go for a sick joke andy is most certainly avoiding layers of fear 2 this week i wonder why sees four separate leaks from the roof normal people ahh a leak mike im sure thats just a burst pipe now we know why mike is never the captain on sea of thieves possibly shindiggers mango unchained ipa mike get johnny from eurogamer as your 4th crew member no one else wants to play with him it might seem like the skeletons are antagonistic but they just see it as friendly ribbing i havent seen titanic and im definitely old enough to have seen it when it was in the cinemas or on tv elevator goes down jane were in the ocean now through the bottom of the ship out to the ocean floor andrew ryan i choserapture you know who would be the best choice for more sea of thieves none other than seas dad himself johnny chiodini i can confirm there are many people now who have not seen titanic in a level 2 uni class a guest lecturer asked whod seen it i sighed and put my hand up as it was all the rage when i was twelve no one else did oh my god tom clancypacman reboot squad based shooter with ghost protagonists but final boss is tom clancys ghost in the words of billie eilish im the bad guy how coolwould it beto be sea of thieves narcassus if only i were cool enough for it jane where are we mike the sea i dont believe it wheres your proof ngl i am lowkey jealous about andy ellen going to galaxys edge not only because i wanna go but because right now i work at walt disney world and our galaxys edge wont be open until augustish and theres blockout dates starting 10 days before the opening for hollywood studios that i dont know when theyll end which sucks because how am i supposed to do my monthly ride of tower of terror i respect andys priorities live the dream andy you have to wonder what the other people at disney thought was going on why is he being filmed on its a small world talking about singing children healing him were there any games you really got stumped on midrecording if they need a sea of thieves fourth how about sea dad johnny this video is clearly faked you cant possibly move between rides in disneyland that quickly mike no shadows the projectors physics arent right also mike it must be haunted and then mike alright im fine with haunted people turning on all the taps no wonder the ship is leaking jane what will calm you down after a terrifying experience like that mike the only balm for my soul are youtube comments me the comments are the most terrifying thing on youtube when jane gets nervous she starts rambling its so cute huh horror game wheres the sanity meter also want fear singing andy im fine with undead taking the blame looks like mike is really embracing the paladin lifestyle 4246 the inspiration for corazon the spidertiger andy is at home in his bed enjoying disney land lol i wonder if that person is a fan of oxbox and realized it was andys ship they scuttled sea of thieves nerascus is none other than sea dad johnny chiodinni i was in a room with a man who killed people but thats because i was working at a factory 3956 fun guy zombies jane theyre my favourite kind nb i am a dad and therefore jokes of this cringeworthy quality are expected of me please understand in that respect jane your breakpoint would be low to further confirm it is a colloquium in the us army other ground forces such as the us marines do not use terms like this because we are always combat effective as long as we have a heartbeat i could of gone to the star wars land and see the andy in person oh bother mike thats my level of puzzle jane thats not a puzzle need someone to play sea of thieves with you just ask seadadjohnny im sure hed be delighted churroitis is a serious condition i can only hope he doesnt succumb to creamcheesefilledpretzeluenza i too am ill and taking to my sick bed if it sounds like a ferris wheel or the ocean in the background rest assured its an illusion and i am not at ocean city eating boardwalk fries i am ill andor sick or both i do wonder if theres a disconnect between british and american audiences with a spooky cruise ship in that americans are expecting lovecraftian horror while us brits are expecting a horrible existence as a butlins redcoat i like how jane go into battle stance whenever theres a scare punch it eldritch blast it clearly mike is as good at making soup as he is at hitman because that bowl of soup was as empty as his score card at the end of a mission i love their looks at 103 d rainbow ghosts would be a randomly generated dungeon crawler where the ghosts hunt down pac man like the creature from evolve the strobing light you thought was morse code looked like sos to me on the subject of mango ipa stone brewery in san diego ca one of my favorites has several ipas with citrus and other stuffs definitely worth a try if you can get some and their gargoyle mascot is similar to my first mass effect themed tattoo so thats a bonus d play more with andy please well i know want to play a game called tom clancys ghost writers mike understands what being absolutely petrified means thought he was immune 3740 like in their live hitman stream when mike was looking for his axe literally in front of him on the table he kept going past it and looking in its direction now this might be normal if hes playing alone but none of the three saw it based on your pacman reboot idea i know what im naming my starting soldiers in every xcom game i start from here on out now when everyone dies im helping them realize their true destiny andys tolerance for scary experiences must have suddenly skyrocketed the small world ride is a freaking nightmare i personally associate icarus with bad parenting thats all i have to say at this point very much expecting show of the weekend to just be a sign hung over the couch that says disney are we sure hes not there ive seen him play stealth just saying give the skeletons a break guys under all that flesh meat youre a skeleton too funny how andy is on vacation the exact week theyre supposed to play layers of fear 2 4304 was that ellen laughing at your adventures in the background johnny loves sea of thieves he can be your sea dad for the tall tales thing sea of thieves narascus has got to be johnny right at 40 miniets and 36 sec jeane say lwt get 4 man team together who better to ask a surton person who had sea of thevise as they game of of the you they know johnny play sea of theives with johnny from eurogamer i love that intro since i live in florida i spend quite a bit of time at disneyworld i really want to go to disneyland though have a churro for me andy you guys are the best and thats coming from a sony fanboy cheers why was andy face timing jane with his ear by sea of thieves narascus do you mean johnny from eurogamer did andy leave the country just to avoid playing layers of fear 2 id probably do the same to be honest the first game made me think of the work of francis bacon now im suppose to think of daniel day lewis in work mode those are layers of fear i can do without call sea dad johnny from eurogamer there are tom clancy books not written by him tom clancy ghost writers it took me a long time to get into sea of thieves but even before i did i had to give the game this at least it actually let you do stuff unlike skull and bones which left you glued to your steering wheel while your armysized crew had all the fun the sea of thieves killer they called it ha get johnny from eurogamer on for a four man team he really loves the game so there will be some genuine enthusiasm mixed it with all the sarcasm and teasing also im never going to say no to a collaboration between your channels its always a good time i love the idea of the ghosts vs terrorists game sea of thieves nerasscus is johnny mike you are a famous method acting chipmunk and you store stuff in your cheeks 050 that dub was excellent the only balm for my soul would be some youtube comments is yet another amazing firsttimeever neverbeforesaid sentence from outside xbox you guys really deliver ive never seen titanic jane everyone tells me the ending never changes bummer when andy says press the like button i press the like button you can never know if hes right behind you quickly checks behind me must be vigilant now that hes actually on the same continent as me whered you get that dope top jane the other players pirate would have a skeleton inside of them so technically a skeleton would be to blame 1632 bop it pull it mike it was somewhat terrifying to be in a room with a man who has definitely definitely 100 killed people but enough about dob how about when you were at the presentation of the tom clancy game the sea of thieves nerascus equivalent is obviously johnny from eurogamer so it was a blood mango to end a blood feud i see what ya did there they watch an olde tyme the ring movie where after you get a telegram that says seven days stop we lost g4tv but at least we have this show not seen christian bale in the machinist then who here knows who nurascis is your breakpoint is low not short its usually a number like if there are less than 4 people this unit cannot complete its mission if you put pirates in queue they would kill each other so they dont need to wait next meet and greet everyone going take the oxbox crew a pint and a mango i wanted to watch the layers of fear section but had to skip it not due to the horror but because the backandforth movement of the camera made me nauseous i dont want to puke of motion sickness today thanks 2434 for those who doesnt want to take part in any of the layers of fear mike childrens heads are not supposed to come of so thats what i was doing wrong this explains my firing from the school jane opens a video call but andy looks like hes taking a regular call is jane just looking into andys ear layers of fear 1 paintings be evil layers of fear 2 movies be evil i think there is some really sour stemstudent behind this it isnt mango grog but it is from talk like a pirate day 34 oz mango schnapps 34 oz captain morgan dash of orange curacao splash of orange juice shake over ice strain into a chilled cocktail glass mango schnapps can be replaced with peach schnapps janes antimannequin speech has me inspired we must stop their reign of tyranny im off to google to find my local mannequin factory jane reacts to the idea of a rainbow rambo ghost the same way ellen does to the word cat was layers of fear 1 the ahh bookmonster game surely the static means pyramid head is near by get well soon andy the haunted house ride could scare you healthy personally i find these walking simulator games incredibly boring to be fair every evil act in the history of the world has been perpetrated by a skeleton plus some miscellaneous fleshy bits that dont really matter hey there been watching for a little while and i wanted to just say i love you all but that call out definitely warrants a punishment for andy cant wait to see what you guys come up with so i guess the discussion about mango grog means this video couldve been called layers of beer then i love jane and mike but this game was unbelievably boring 10 points to each of them for making it bearable to watch i think maniquins are so scary because they look like humans but dont have faces and stuff pirates dont queue they prefer to arr a sea of thieves nerascus so johnny then jane starts explaining sot mike 3407 andy fled the country to avoid this game it must be really spooky waits until the dead of night climbs a fence topped with razor wire dodges ferocious guard dogs disables burglar alarm breaks into house kicks over a bunch of fragile stuff uses dynamite to open safe pulls note out from warped metal innards i cannot believe this person doesnt like me although i really want to be your sea of thieves nerascus like really p you should ask johnny or just play with the 3 of you as there is a 3 man ship these days the brigantine cant wait to see more however 3 maybe tom clancys ghost is haunting the ship in layers of fear 2 yes this game is creepy but is there a book monster i love the idea that jane is looking at andys ear during that whole call i would honestly pay all the money for a jane douglas video gameor any other of the ox host video games because andy couldnt be here ahhh book monster in his honor when that lemon appeared i was waiting for the mandatory well when life gives you lemons although in this case i guess its when terrifying ghost ships give you lemons sea of thieves nerascus you mean someone like johnny chiodini he does have more expertise in that game than you do d pacman gritty reboot you say theres a band shirt i have that literally shows pacman beating up the ghosts with a bat theyre all crying and scrambling to get away from him its pretty badass im sure sea dad johnny from eurogamer would be more than willing to be your fourth shipmate in a sea of thieves egox crossover play sea of thrives with johnny he would be good jane asking if mike wants lunch is this a disney parallel universe is johnny the sea of thieves narascus can anyone else hear ellen laughing away in the background at 4303 speaking of close to the sun thats an interesting game as well also i havent done any tall tales after shroudbreaker but it would be fun to sail with yall i think the failure of wildlands kinda proves that the tom clancy name isnt really a brand anymore i wouldnt be surprised to see ubisoft drop it if the new one which ive already forgotten the name of also flops jane theres 1000 combinations for that lock because you can input 000 as well 222 childrens heads are not supposed to come off the mike channell school of parenting im sure johnny would happily be your fourth pirate that is until you ignore all his orders and decide to put him in the brig so were just not gonna talk about the bloody legs at 1030 hahawait a minutehow could jane see the churro if andy had the phone firmly on his ear but im a hollywood star my wages are massive i can afford it i can afford globes for days the luxurious life of a celebrity aww poor ellen was too short for the roller coaster there iswas a series of military guide books called janes jane douglas could have her ownremember that thing about the book of xbox lore if she asks the viewers nicely they might ghost write it for her 10 pages per day for 30 days is 300 pages acting surely creating a character is the first step of playing dd i wonder if andys sick day was sponsored by disney it says something about andys revolving bedroom door love life that when he phones in sick he has to explain exactly whos bed hes in that see of thieves clip where you showed andy seeing the ship it almost looks like andy did see it he starts to dip back down and say something then he pauses for a moment that may have been editing or maybe he just didnt want to interrupt janes thought with oh hey theres another ship it was good of the local children to sing to andy to make him feel better his house does look a bit like disney world world though must just be my imagination get johnny for sea of thieves cause he absolutely loves it but no one at eurogamer will play it with him jane calls andy me thats main street usa music and main street usa sidewalk bricks in the background jane andy are you at disneyland me yes andy no me you lie how did jane see the churro oo spiders are more afraid of you then you are of them can anyone else hear ellen screeching in the background if youre looking for a pirate deck hand on sea of thieves i volunteer as tribute inky blinky pinky stinky tinky winky which character is which oxboxoxtra host can we get an every day the world contains more mannequins protest you local mannequin factory tshirt please lol the next part is kinda difficult depending on how good you are at combat might want some help johnny from eg or luke johnny could captain the ship and try to corral oxbox as per usual or luke could provide his sea vessel expertise jane giving mike stealth 101 lessons at 2300ish is one of the most adorable things ive seen in a while the game severely lacks in vin diesels though janes multiplayer breakpoint is the moment she equips a grenade lol jane doing a videochat and andy just talking on the phone normally something doesnt add up more a random thought than related to the video but what about game commentaries andy im sure could talk endlessly for marvels spiderman ditto ellen for any tomb raider would be cool to hear a die hard fanatic and one less so into it talking over the main campaign comparing how the two enjoy it or not i keep commenting about jane douglas evil conglomerate jdec sooo jane if you interested you can contact me about royalties ill take brittish jane over american jane any day so when will the channel be renamed to jane douglass outsidexbox how about a live stream of just sea of thieves with the crew where mike does the shroudbreaker quest has mike had a new tshirt just wait until you have to pick up the hhammer then it will go run for youre life the gam e is just easy on you for now i still really want you guys to play more bendy someday my dreams of ellen and andy playing horror in an extended video will come true i try to be a good person things just dont always work out if they can still make tom clancy games they should make a new colin mcrae rally mike it must be somewhat terrifying being in a room with a man who has definitely definitely 100 killed people shouldnt he be accustomed to that seeing as he is sitting right next to such a person 00 lemon beer is delicious mango must then be tasty as well off to the bar relax jane andy was just having a disney themed orgy in his home bed i always request the room with a horror puzzle one of my favorite things about the oxbox and oxtra gang is their love of disney gotta admit that the jump scare got me my cat was very displeased at me jumping the mango of apology should become universal in gaming it would also make an excellent tshirt somebody mock that up for them will you you know i dont think andy is really sick man andys room is massive but i hope he feels better in time to make it to e3 i didnt bother watching titanic someone told me the ship sinks at the end thus ruining the whole film for me leaves all the taps on then wonders why the boat is sinking well youre letting all the water in for starters mango grog andy get back from disneyland quickly theres another cocktail to be made there were many more method actors you may have heard of like marlon brando dustin hoffman heath ledger robert de niro and possibly the most infamous method actor of our age the dreaded jared leto ah yes the pt lap simulator not to be confused with the other type on lap simulator in which a cat sleeps on your lap when you really need pee they do mango beer at the bavarian bier cafes in australia next time you come over i definitely recommend them the one in chatswood is really fun and very near a good karaoke place cant believe oxbox paid for andys trip to disney just for an opening couch jag always love your lets plays i look forward to hitman and now i can look forward to sea of thieves you know its a bad illness when you sound like space mountain jane and mike talking about playing sea of thieves online with andy but we will need a 4th expert johnny actually loves this game and knows alot about it and didnt get a second thought solved the ship is sinking because mike left all the taps open if you guys dont do the mango grog video ill be disappointed lol you could do a horror game bingo with this game self slamming doors check looping rooms check just walking and examining stuff check doors dont lead to the same place they did before check 308 working toilet that level of fame holy sht im famous mango monster is my fave drink of all time taste beaut andys suffering hyperchorroidism that lemon was clearly to prevent scurvy a bowl full of invisible soup looks delicious breakpoint is a military term for the oc showing up i was expecting andy to very sickly call you guys to correct you of you history inaccuracy anyway kind of sad andy is not on top of this atrocity god i hope andy recuperates quickly he seemed in a really bad condition tom clancy died in 2013 ask johnny if he wants to join in your adventures suggestion play sea of thieves with pirate dad i mean johnny chiodini unless theres a mr scooter cameo in layers of fear 2 its a no buy i love how every time they ask mike if he watched a video he wasnt in the answer is inevitably no most horrific thing ive seen there is no seat on that toilet so dutch wanted the mangoes to settle all his grudges i really misjudged that guy pirates are like spiders especially the ones who are disguised as spider tigers innis and gunn ipa probably there are a thousand jane 000 is one of them ok so andy went to disneyland purely just for the intro for sotw definitely no work being done on any other things at disneyland ill ghostwrite janes novels at a reasonable rate pitch a sophisticated youtuber uses her vast knowledge of physics to tinker with time stranding herself in the future she soon finds herself a wanted criminal for atrocities she has not yet committed and along with a plucky band of outlaws and a sexy nasa scientist embarks on the caper of the millennium to find her way home 723 moon over there and moonlight glittering on the water that way theres something wrong with this picture 424 we wish you a fulfilling journey respectfully icarus transatlantic 644 do we know this definitely isnt the titanic wikipedia rms titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and was the second of three olympicclass ocean liners operated by the white star line the use of the name icarus does suggest its going to go down hard during its maiden voyage but if its not operated by the white star line its not the titanic you guys are gonna feel terrible if andy really is sick and youve been misinterpreting those phone calls due to paranoia that said i would totally contribute to a churro kickstarter dont even test me jane tom clancy died on october 1 2013 wildlands was released on march 7 2017 i loved janes advancedtacticalfighters for my windows 95 all my pentium m sisters and brothers rep up also i still want to be a fighter pilot when i grow up from being 30 theres your next episode of video game mixology i recommend blending mango flesh placing it in a 2foot square of fine clean linen and slowly squeezing the juice out then mix that with rum and sparkling water andy never got used to facetime he was just so sure everybody wanted to see his beard the phone never left his face does anyone else feel that a pacman game as the ghosts would be terrifying running a maze while being chased by a sometimes invincible eating machine hes got the white pill run i think we need to arrange an 8 player ship to invade the next sea of thieves and protect andy or to just follow him around menacingly isnt anyone wondering why jane is facetiming andy and hes using his phone up to his ear i really dont think she wants to see whats in there the following places have mannequin factories harrison oh harrod oh cincinnati oh newark nj east rutherford nj irvington nj jersey city nj moonachie nj jacksonville fl pompano beach fl west palm beach fl maitland fl miami fl greenwood in oklahoma city ok

uk watford uk southampton uk carpi italy milan italy istanbul turkey xiamen c johnny from eurogamer is a very good player he can be your narascus skeletons may build orphanages out of orphans but they draw the line at scuttling ships i of course never get distracted and miss things right in front of me which is why i definitely dont have a massive bruise on my leg from walking into an end table im off to the mannequin factory i love jane doing a video chat while andy does a regular phone call andy sure does know how to spend a sick day jealous its sad how every horror game since pt is now held to the same standards of this amazing game because alot of people didnt play it and now people cant play it its really sad they wont be able to experience the game that is now influencing horror games also it wasnt even a full game which just goes to show how impactful it was to the community ubisoft are carrying on his spirit huh i guess its true you can no longer retire even after you die so are you telling me that janes fighting ships isnt a breakdown of vessels in the oxbox navy if your gonna open with a comedy bit work out whether the call is face time or just audio its not that hard and lets be honest the funny was hanging on by a thread during that whole bit kinda lost the immersion into your crazy whacky work environment lets get a pirate crew together and you dont want the expert boatman westaway get well soon andy horror lps here arent the same without your screams and fear singing janes catalog of military hardware is from another jane yeah right we believe you skeletons are always to blame example being im lazy but its my skeletons fault for having a lazy bone i am excited to play this mike could really do with a face right now im still not sure why that line made me laugh so hard i hurt speaking of nerascus whatever happened to gta online you all left us on a cliffhanger with that last heist the sea of thieves narascus is johnny surely triangle good little movie i was half expecting andy to apparate behind mike after the king charles spaniel comment an ocean is nothing when you have the opportunity to give a ted talk about the royal family and their dogs i need yall to know that that intro filled me with so much happiness and joy i just realized again how great yall are and how much effort and love yall put into this channel thank you so much for your work and your funny silly intros that wasnt a jump scare that was a jane scare mike doesnt jump ever i am surprised layers of fear is getting more the game felt resolved with the previous one and inheritance hopefully there is more gameplay to this one where are all the people on this ship jane rightfully points out the hubris of naming anything icarus and expecting success shortly thereafter she counsels only going up thats the start of an icarus right there see how easy it comes love this look into fast and furious 9 they are really thinking out of the box for this next movie janes such a youtube pro when she calls one person it has to be a group facetime call with someone filming andy and an audio call with andy himself surprised there wasnt a telephone cord graphic splitting the screen pauses wait theyre playing a game with flooding and the first thing they do in flashback is leave all the taps on mystery solved i guess more sea of thieves as a crew please with johnny pretty please childrens heads are not meant to come off not your best tshirt idea oxbox how can mike tell out of all rollercoasters the world over that andy is on space mountain mike is a car expert not a rollercoaster expert also curse you andy for getting its a small world stuck in my head again i absolutely believe that jane would know exactly how each section of disneyland sounds what a cliche when descending in a hellevator us irish are just above your destination a movie set on a ship im sure it will be rated arrrrr i love hearing adventures of corazon the pirate i cant wait to hear them again at the next dungeons and dragons episode pink slime from the taps diddid mike just make a ghostbusters 2 reference now we know how the ship got flooded mike left all the taps running murdered souls suspect that is a name i havent heard in a long long time it is a fantastic game how did jane see the churro if andy had the phone to his ear the ships possibly sinking wonder how flash back to earlier and mike turns on all the taps in the bathroom and leaves no connection surely i dont think mike knows how to make soup childrens heads are not supposed to come off adult heads on the other hand i love how jane facetimes andy and hes too sick to use his phone properly lul tgif nothing like a friday afternoon unrelated but have any of you played warhammerage of reckoning well search up warhammer return of reckoning for a fun time so as if layers of fear wasnt bad enough jane has to decide all the mannequins are actually weeping angels thanks jane did anybody else notice the bowl of soup mike had was in invisible soup all the bowls empty no it must have been invisible soup andy sick at home mike makes him soup apparently empty bowl or transparent soup andy should come back and do a full disney karaoke show of the week im sure his sickness will give him plenty of time to hear and familiarize himself with the disney songs also give andy a cowboy hat my favorite part of this video is jane videocalling andy who is voice calling patiently waiting for the oxventurers return d give andy the eyepatch he might like it and it might make him feel better the intro jane getting a great view of andys ear total war how can she see him on the screen when he has his phone on his ear guys about that shark i think it is a dolphin so ads come in pairs now whats the deal youtube 1200 am and im bravely watching the horrors as usual ps andy you couldve just said that what they are hearing is the noise from a disneyland video you are watching at full volume while resting not that ive used such an excuse before um 850 its a hellavator insert stray kids song here i mean tbf i do just assume that andy pays local children to sing to him when he is ill andy foresaw that there was a chance of encountering the werebaby once again to which he decided disneyworld it is wise choice mr farrant i like the idea that jane could only see a really intense close up of andys ear during that call and she somehow figured out he was holding a churro andy is sick at home mike makes him soup at the studio i went down into the comments to read some and it suddenly hit me that im early so many layers its like cake nonpainters painting is hard loving vincent am i a joke to you misread as lawyers of fear 2 now im intrigued by the idea 124 oh andy is going to kill mike for that one when he gets back to the studio finally some second coming of layers of fear and mikes reaction to the scares are priceless well i guess andys never coming back because by betraying jane hes painted a target on his back hello jane you look nice today when is the next oxventure being posted first hope you enjoy this video and want to watch the whole series as i play the game no crow edits in this but i plan on uploading a scare montage later on with them delirious doesnt shut the door behind him the game leme help you the shining of course deli can pinpoint tony todd in a horror game this doesnt seem scary at all cruise ship be shore good one if this is real then every single person in this picture probably passed away damn if that aint the truth when he kept saying deeper and deeper i kept thinking he was going to make a joke about going deeper and deeper into ohms asshole 4125 didnt get the shining reference try the game fear delirious something tells me grandpa was having a stroke 4116 come play with us delirious forever and ever and ever 4121 looks like that hallway from the shinning its a dolphan 4121 is that a shining reference 4202 looks like someone caught a fire right here looks like a beard makes me think of scoobydoo meets the globe trotters where get aboard the hunted island queen instead of picnic island queen delirious how the hell did i get here me do you have 90 minutes ah shit here we go again drinking soda and eating potato chips while watching this at 200 am best thing ever sooo scary hehe this video gave kawahi leonard the nba finals few words adorable funny wondeful great ps idk but did anyone notice the easter egg of the shining cuz like if you look at the carpet its the same as the one in the shining and there is the little bike the kid was riding in the hallway when he meet the twins god im honestly surprised i noticed that dam idk if its intended but i got a pretty sharp eye i think i might have to go back and watch the 1st series 4334 thats not scary or creepy delirious thats just deep and really edgy as a matter of fact im gonna need less edge on that 4120 is a reference to the shining delirious is that candyman me thinking the exact same thing i always plan to watch these at 23 in the morning and make myself scared to go to bed delirious broke his mirror from his magical beauty that will remain a mystery comment section

critic was saying a man loses himself thats what this is to him its all very real hes not just acting hes them i feel you connect at a personal level with the mask in this game and you where laughing at the start but all i could think is thats really you you connect to this man when delirious scream i scream with him wow you are not welcome not for long what if you shot her we will never know who else was like actually pissing themselves during the chase scene man your playthroughs are always fun the ending was hilarious cause there was a new delirious scream its probably the daughter not the painter the fears should be scared from h2os laugh schizophrenia gang where you at hes my inspiration hes made my life so much better who else i saw that shining reference scrolling through the comments lookin for the jump scare times one hour lets play delirious is back yes so happy to finally watch lof2 from my favorite youtuber oh come onnnn i miss the crowlirious multiple personality disorder anyone im loving the soundtrack i know it is time taking to put crows in that kid of videos some of the crows would be so hilarious but yeah it would drop the scary atmosphere tho the chricicle and flooring and music is all from the shineing 218 havent watched the rest of the video yet but is that tony todd awesome this is tarefing but i cant stop watching 00 when u picked up the mirror and flipped it u screaming scared me i didnt even see what it was and u just screamed and it scared the heck outta me says it sounds like candy man but sounds like zoom why did delirous make

for this 3150 the blood moon rises once again link only some people will understand that reference when was this being made i feel like this just came out of nowhere because ive never heard anything or thought of a layers of fear 2 i wonder why he dont show himself we have been waiting yers resident evil biohazard awesome videos the titanic had a twin british military hospital boat the britanic which also sank and could of been easily avoided theres a documentary on it on netflix dark and white delirious 2019 4030 thats a buck not a doe i think the mannequins that get crushed by debris and set on fire etc depicts how each of the people on the ship died now that gives me chills h20 delirious you lied to me you told us before to like farcry 5 to see the next one and it never came love youre videos btw holy shit i havent watched you in a long while coz ive been so busy with work and man did i miss your playthroughs really looking forward to this new awesome series of yours best youtuber ever i think this whole game of layers of fear 2 is actually the movie why does he laugh when something paranormal happens thats the first time heard u scream like that really scared what is that that aboviousky a whale why dont you try vr horror games h20 the white room with that black wall thing gave birth to a manikin 5717 when your mom busts in your room cause she sees your grades in math that is the first time i hear delirious scream like that why didnt you put the crows i like thous parts gotta love me a classic delirious video with him screaming and running i would do the same if i was playing 1810 plot twist the vase was the killer the whole time nobody delirious look at this painting what does it mean crow edits hmmm bruh for real h20 im your biggest fannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn please subcribe to him and why so many views but 29k likes h2oinside is beautiful it doesnt matter what the outside looks like i want more your my favorite youtuber been watching since the gta days im watching this at 135 in the morning and it is the biggest mistake i have ever made it is candyman tony todd nice say hi to deliriouss mannequin bro their friends the mannequin said so but dont screw all his mannequin hoes or else hell be your mannequin foe but its alright cause hes just a mannequin tho the mannequin got no bones or tissue to grow and the mannequins chill and just goes with the flow my wife enjoys your scary games and your laugh lmao happy gunting okay pretty much the whole episode is like set in the same universe as the first game but you experience insanity from a perspective of an actor who knows candyman might shift the plot but great vid by the way plus 4123 like dat shining reference its so funny because he sounds like a crazy man that would be lurking in the dark on the ship sometimes xd that person at the start sounds like noob sibot from mk11 so excited tbh scarylirious is my favorite lirious first there was mannequin hoe now now delirious brings us the mighty mannequin bro this is scary epilepsy warning just be careful guys theres some pretty intense image sensitive moments in this gameplay so if your likely to have issues with the vivid lights just be careful guys dark and white 3410 i very much enjoyed this i felt so creeped out by the game alot ok im all caught up ah hear we shit again love the scary games i think i shat my self h20 great

watch pretty sure you are the actor guy h20 but this is my first time watching your content in about a year happy to start catchup with a horror game im just so freaking mind blown by what i just went through talk about getting a good scare for your life blazing up before watching this was a mistake why delirious was so obsessed with the guy from the first game h20 delirious i have watched you for 6 years and all those years i have laughed ever upload u have finally lets all just imagine that the crows there when ever he screams did anyone found out at 41154122 is a easter egg scene from the shining of the hall way and the little tricycle and also the carpet too im surprise delirious didnt realize it scarylirious more like scaredylirious that was the titanic sister that you are on im going on a cruz in a week for summer vacation d i wish more people would get so emerged in the games like you do not just halfboredoutoftheirmindcommentary i mean when i play a game i am the character

seems to offer just as much looking forward to this series a lot please release episode 2 from its inprisonment keep the videos coming there amazing and great to watch does anyone know what the first game delirious is talking about i find it funny that when youre scared you laugh creepily and then be scared delirious play granny its on pc now hi clown i know why delirious is seeing all this weird

4121 is an easter egg related to the shining pull the lever for the hungry customers 045 scary corridor mei know this gonna be scary it would be a crazy twist if the person youre playing is the actor

statue head 2202 their was flowers in the wase and in 2209 they were gone i miss these solo games i have a theory that what the character is going through is actually the movie and either the player doesnt know that the character who is the actor is acting out the movie or that the character himself doesnt know that its the movie and at the end it will be revealed that he was being filmed the whole time the games are not the same however they are built on the same driven concept of a person driving themselves to insanity can you playthats you delirious pays attention to the story line and thinks about the game me damn thas a big ass ship give birth yes i am looking forward to this game you playing it makes it even better the guy at the start sounds like noob saibot or batman just what

watching delirious play scary games deliorous i want to see you play days gone i heard it is a good game and knowing u like games that ivolves zomibes you would like it i miss lee and clementine and kenny and omid and christa and the others hey delirious ive seen a lot of yer vids and i was wondering if you can cartoons could try out xv2 or even play dauntless again btw supporting you as a creator lm not even playing the game and lm getting paranoid i love this game so much i played the first one and feel in love with it it reminds me of bioshock wtf man stop screaming xd you make me scared i almost shit my pants the carpet tricycle and photograph are homages to the shining wait maybe layers of fear is a game where either the person you are playing as is delirious and seeing sh or maybe he just is a broken man but thats just a theory edit oh i get it your playing as an actor but you see from the childs pov of their journey it explains so much super scary i dont know what i should be more afraid of the game or delirious laugh at said game when creepy parts happen the word is character hell yes i love your layer of fear crowlirious intensifies 2635 nearly gave me a fucking heart attack that tricycle was a shining reference i know that carpet pattern its crowlirious lol whos the candy man btw a shining reference before 4125 leaving a comment to trick youtubes algarithm at 3339 the coat there legit scared me can we call the monster of this game movie monster finally i loved it and cant wait to see more x3 there was an eg to the shining that youre skiped yay another scary game i didnt mind tabs but i like variety and scary games are awsome love prop hunt too lol delirious can you do more hunt showdown i love those 1 hour episodes keep it up play supraland too 2051 do you remember me the 21st night of september when delirious looked at the mirror at 730 740 there was a dude behind him he looks familiar from the first game miss this content i just remembered this but delirious when will you finish farcry 5 i love how when something scary happens he does a evil laugh i love it yes i loved layers of fear 1 now heres no2 omg they actually made a layers of fear sequel i really hope it will make sense with what happened in the previous game scarylirious back at it again at 4121 is a reference to the shining this is why i dont sleep its a good thing i went to the bathroom i love this vids thx ur the best is it me or i just go in the bathroom turn of the lights cause its the darkest place in the house when i first saw this video i knew the word on the board was character leave a like if u love scary terry what happened to the flower in the vase when the girl said i believe you should h20 play bendy and the ink machine my personal theory so far the boy and sister were raised by a nutty mom the female figure in the beginning tearing the boys head off who wanted one or both of the kids to be actors but only the sister rebelled the little boys dialogue about his sister being his protector while the boy grew up forced to be an actor losing his identity in the process constant references to him to build the character forced to go on a boat despite hating the ocean all the mannequins literally the puppet you find with in five minutes of the game starting now that the main character making a movie on a cruise ship much like the one his sister and him attempted to runaway on the latter half of the video its bringing up all those bad memories and has to work through them and his identity crises which is bordering on a splitdissociative personality disorder the note mentioning only of them has to know and act or some such also shakespeares 12th night cant wait for the rest of this game keep up the awesome video scarylirious or scaredlirious delirious has a wonderful vocabulary but cant play scribbliolol how many acts are there if delirious was the director then yeah your dead bring back friday the 13th or

the center instead of shooting one of the manikin i love to be part of the delirious army we really enjoy your work and will always support you i felt like sharing that sorry guys just girly things i can flush the toilet this is the future lol meoh no deliriouswhats wrong mei pooped my pants deliriousme too oh god i wasnt mentally ready when you started playing layers of fear 1 its no difference this time wish me luck h20dilierious you are the best and i hope you never stop being a youtuber and if i had money i would give it to you i was just reading a fanfic about vanoss and delirious and decided to watch some clips of them but i saw this in my notifications 450 this is just a theory but at the bottom it referenced icarus transatlantie transatlantie probably means that the waters the ship floats over is the atlantic as the story of icarus son of daedalus tries to escape imprisonment by flying with artificial wings but the wings end up melting and icarus ends up falling into the ocean and drowning this could be a great part in the story when taking into account that the player is trapped and the game starts with the sinking ship i love how h2o laughs instead of screams in jump scares love your content your probably the actor sees the last of us part 2 demo me damn this is the best graphics i ever seen layers of fear 2 hold my beer delirious playing scary games is the best i love the crouch at 1010 wait i got to go to layers of fear 1 and see delirious play be back in maybe 4 hours you should play escape the ayuwoki everyone should look up the game days gone its a really fun game and yall should like this so h20 delirous can play that game for a fun series i think it will be cool its a fun zombie survival single player game this game is amazing i love it parts of it remind me of film noir the ring the shining and 2001 a space odyssey its so clever to incorporate movies into this game since one of the main storylines is about actinggetting into character hopefully this game is as good as the first it definitely looks like it so far ayyyy i finished the whole playlist like 23 months ago its finally here this is why i love delirious im hear scared and then i hear him and i cant stop myself from dying love seeing you upload horror games as you put some much energy into them which makes the experience better this video was so scary i love it delirious is like the best youtube ever ive been watching him for years and im not tired of him that means something my dude he played this game three years ago why dont yall play with lui anymore omg so we meet the characters we got the captain and the crew we got actors and a director making a movie on this ship and one of them might be sigtly crazy and we also have 2 kids who sneaked into the ship to play pirates and go somewhere the part where you see the fliesdont the carpet and tricycle look like the ones from the shining loved the first series i really want this to be like the first one stop with the crow noises are you johny cage he said actor my heart is pounding this is why i dont play horror games i either scream like a girl or i start crying that chase at the end was scary as hoo ha loved it more please i like how he thinks he is the director delirious talking about the first layers of fear its so funny if delirious screams i scream too haha either i missed something or bambis mom had antlers the whole time and i never noticed no no no no the first game already messed me up and now they make a second game thats the devil right there scarylirious is the best lirious imma enjoy layers of fear 2 played from screamylirious just like the first layers of fear very good game play more more lol 2635 i can hear delirious getting shooked so bad cant stop laughing for a second there the screem at 5112 tho is it me or is the game talking about delirious at 613 cool there is a reference to the shining great video delirious i think the best part about this video is the game was cinde of sexes for trying to making you shoot the girl i thought the tree house painting was a clown portrait you and daz games are playing this who do i watch noooooooo lmao the walls giving birth yes yes yes i been waiting for so long i love watching these because delirious make it not as scary as it would be if i played it myself btw tony todd is totally the narrator so hes right in saying candyman you start thinking you should be scared and then things like 5158 happen 1430 sos on morse code is omg why is there another one the first one scared the hell out of me but why another you broke a mirror 7 years of bad luck i think someone shot the mannequin i love how delirious is much more than a youtuber to us h20 keep up the daily videos im enjoying all the content you are giving us i feel so bad for delirious he forgot his popcorn the mannequin was naruto run lol waiting to watch this til its pitch black outside delirious always makes my day i have to watch the first

scary game play through thank you delirious i love these 1 hour of my life that i spent on a lot of fun thanks for the vid this episode wasnt too scary but maybe its because delirious is with us but hopefully the next episodes give us more scares love the vid very creepy cant wait for you to dive deeper and deeper into the game how did you miss that person behind you when you flipped that chalk board around i almost died yes this video is an hour like the spiderman series that you made i wasted all my time watching the series but it was totally worth it i i couldnt sleep for days at 4120 theres a reference to the shining shining 646 this game managed to sneak in some shapespear its the line from the merchant of venice every man must play a part and mine a sad one antonio lmao the plot thickens he says probably has no idea what the fuck is happening delirious has the most funniest laugh ever the painter the actor the director what will be next all things needed for a perfect story a puzzle being pieced togetherslowly but surely i love his laugh xd either a gun is this gonna be a nes sequel like it is goodbye glaze a field one are you gonna do that we have to so exciting i love to scare delirious 3 fun to watch delirious play horror games for once go on a cruise best vacation for the money youll love it especially if you dont drink much alcohol cant wait for crowlerious pretty sure that was a sturgeon head on the wall i love delirious british or australia accent mannequin bro and mannequin hoe 2238 this is why u dont touch mr hardys eye patch this is the best scary video i have ever watched play 2039 on the slowest playback speed your welcome i think the most scariest game he played is layers of fear im having flashbacks of delrious playing silent hill whos candy man 1809 watch that flick of that wrist damn he would be pretty good at csgo 00 something creepy happens delirious this is very creepy by the way 1936 so i never even know what is this game id this my theory is that a jumscare game plz correct me you are the number one when you play a horror game yeah love scary games deliriouss playthrough of the first layers of fear inspired me to buy the game holy shit this was awesome flushes the toilet its the future i dont understand this game xd oh hell ya delirious this was a game you jumped out of your seat a couple times and i laughed so hard but i liked this viedo its awesome to see you doing a horror game playthrough again its been a while when he didnt get the shining reference and that pic he found at 4325 is another reference i love 1 hour h2o delirious vids i almost shit my pants did this man just say this could be the titanic crow crow crow every 2 seconds love his screams i scream with him everytimea i can get way to scared so this was scary when even if it was nothing it said act as it is part of character who here tapped the hell out of the notifications to see this video i love scarylerious 3 my favorite kinds of videos but i love all the other videos too ive been subscribed to you since day one youre the best 823 bo3 refrence you always talk a lot when you get scared d 4120 the shining play more tabs play days gone delirious cool finally so i can eat my food and watch a movie thank you delirious lmfao that shining reference tho its always the indie games that amaze me finally a part two of a classic jump scare video game ive long waited to see him play a other great jump scare game i swear that is definitely candy man i like went you make 1 hour scary game watching this wants me to get this game n play it i havent played the first one i guess its time for me to get the first one thanx for giving me another game to play luv ya n take care man so this game has 2x the layers compared to the first game ive been waiting for my delirious notification of the day i love your videos so much this was great i have been waiting for another scary game play and i cant wait for the next lol those screams at 5717 tho play hunt please act 2 tho i remember him playing his first scary game ever scaryyyy leriousssss oh shit i forgot about this drop 0 as far as i have understanded i think theres a famous director that puts actors through tormenting activities and he slowly destroys that actors personality to make himher the person whom theyre playing and the character that we play in the game is one of these actors that is going to take a part in this directors new performance and this game takes us through this characters destruction also the girl that we hear when we pick up objects must be another actor that tried to escape but then got caught and probably murdered by the director i wonder how the painter plays a role in the actors life and the story that i can gather is a mysterious actor is going back through his past because the eccentric director wants him to remember who he was before i think the crowman strikes again you know what they deserve it mannequin bro should have never left mannequin hoe funniest part lol is this made by the creator of pt cause this looks like it horror games been waiting for this hes so good at this neve loved anything more then this video thats sos finally im in a army the delirious army finally finally finally scary series are back please make more the guy in the game sounds like scarecrow from batman h20 deleterious is in the game is this a

scary every time u get scared i start laughing first im first first firs first first first first first first bro i clicked so fast i dont know what i am first first first first first love you so excited for this series iexperienced jws pissy attitudethroughout thesecond videoof this game and i knew i would have to get drunk firstto watch this last one that really helped he spots radios like cryaotic spots clipping textures lol i think theyre tomatoes like how people throw them at bad performances i guess youre a product of your society you dont want games that challenge you with too much difficulty you get cranky if the enemies cant be beaten in a few attempts same goes with mental challenges and having to pay attention think and analyze things you want to feel smart without much effort you want instant rewards and gratification you dont want to have to actually use your brain or to meet a challenge you say you do but it seems to annoy you when youre actually challenged and things doesnt run smooth also it seems like your snark is a result of some emotional trauma youve experienced in childhood especially considering the cruel comments youve made about your childhood self children in general and what youve told about what your mother had said to you when you were a kid i dont think this game is my cup of tea either because of gameplay but you talk about things without understanding them a lot of the time you talk out of your ass some game n yeah these types of games doesnt seem to be your thing and i find you annoying when you play them you often miss a lot of references and clues and you really come of as an arrogant and flippant daft american white male it was not references to horror movies it was references to movie classics of different genres you hurry trough games and a lot of symbolism gets lost on you you have a shallow understanding of things many times you miss the point even in games you likeyour understanding is shallow and surface level you rant on about things that make no sense to you but would have if you had paid attention not this video but others you do best in mindless games that doesnt require analytical thinking i dont know if i like the gameplay in this one but the story etc does seem to be actually more well thought out and complex than you and your commentators give it credit for thought out analysis of the game httpswwwplaystationlifestylenet20190628layerso sweets to the sweet is a reference to the horror movie candyman at least this game got horror movie references right camara man for the blair witch bloober team will remember that and release it at the end of august layers of fear 1 is exelent but the second mmmmm the enlish in this game is so organized hh i love this games i dont know about you and i love john so its a combo for me hh this game would have been better if it was just acts 13 but with acts 245 it just seemed so long boring and dragged out there were multiple times where i legit fell asleep the first chase scene was cool but then it just got way over used this games overall for me in my personal opinion is a 6510 like john said and i agree with most of what he said because i do like element of danger type of horror games as well like an active ai it was just way to liner and wasnt meaty enough the story was good but it was explained enough i wasnt a fan of the first one either act 4 is when the game finally started feeling like layers of fear 437 some people wanted you to flail your arms and scream in terror apparently 4916 bless you dont know how you play this game it kinda bored me why do you add that noise at the end of your videos i always like your videos early on because i like your content and then at the end of your video your outro blows up my headphones and i immediately unlike the video i know that everybody knows that igns a joke but im still dumbfounded by the fact that it gave this game a 9 and called it one of the most stunning horror games of this generation like they must be playing a different game here unfortunately emboldened by the praise of their first games artistic interpretation the developers decided for their second game to make the game so ambiguously artistic in an attempt to mimic that same praise instead they ruined their chance of telling a coherent story and the resulting mess has come ashore as a shipwreck 2955 i swear to god i once spent most of a day in a hospital room with that exact ugly ass wallpaper oh my god sloppy storyline unnecessary chase scenes excellent art direction and audio design and yet i loved it its yiik 2 but without the tireless monologuing for 20mins straight dude im just trying to enjoy the game your constant sarcastic attitude really sucked the enjoyment out of everything edit just saying i enjoyed what i saw probably more than you did the developers seem to have had no idea what to do for the last hour of this game so just threw in a bunch of random hallways sequences and its extremely redundant and frankly horrible i watch your videos all the time love them this is not an insult toward you your performance or the quality but this game i just couldnt get into i watch all your play throughs all the way through but this one took me days to finish because i just couldnt get into it i dont know why so many people love this game or think its scary its too boring for me i also love the shining i just saw there is three endings to this game john youre pretty sharp i wasnt sure you recognized the movie seven references for the seven deadly sins until you said whats in the box its a shame that the layers of fear games have been so light on horror you can tell there is a lot of talent and effort put into these games their art direction sound direction complex storytelling voice acting and general atmosphere are simply superb but they lack much in the horror department as john mentioned the player feels sadly detached from the world because everything keeps changing constantly things changing subtlyblatantly can be a great trick for horror but if used too much could turn the game into a horror housewalking simulator of sorts where the player expects to only have the obligation to look around and witness things happening and sometimes collect a few items or solve simple puzzles maybe most of the players energy is spent on piecing together the storymeaning and taking in the scenery this can turn into utter confusion when nothing signals the player on what is an actual threat that can harm them and what is only a spooky change in enviro maybe the abusive father raped lily for which she shot him dead and eventually hung herself the flowerpicking sequence hinted at deflowering as in the father deflowered his own daughter i really liked the art direction environments were beautifully done and i would spend a couple minutes just admiring the rooms but yeah thats pretty much it the story was a bit engaging but it was way too convoluted the first game was better 256 move i gotta poop i gotta go to the bathroom if any of you remember the groundskeeper lol this game shouldnt have been called layers of fear 2 the first game id argue is good nothing amazing but memorable this game however had an extremely boring setting very ugly visuals confusing narrative etc doesnt feel like a sequel and it doesnt connect to this game at all this game was awful it really needed a lucky break an ace up its sleeve this game was so boring and pedantic i literally skipped the last video and just jumped to the end of this one to hear what you thought of it because i had already made up my mind if i had physically bought this i would have taken it back to the store and asked for credit or a refund layers of boredom perhaps its the constant change in tone but i feel as though the environment and atmosphere simply isnt up to the par of the first game and the storys much more cryptic as well the chase sequences are in theory a nice way to make the game seem less like a walking simulator but they didnt add much to the game because its never clear what is actually chasing you and what pertinence it has to the story also im tired of the constant scary noises in horror games nowadays it detracts from the experience and is often unwarranted you can only watch mannequin parts move so much before its just commonplace ive very much enjoyed watching you play this its just a shame that the game didnt hit nearly as well as they wanted it to theres a beauty in subtlety but not to the point of rendering the experience void of cohesion silly john thats the wrong game james and lily eh james potter lazy arrogant my father was a great man your father was a swine a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need five acts like in a play how fitting you got the madness ending so it really wouldnt explain much theres two other endings that could give you pretty much a better idea of it all 5210 blues traveler love that band but no idea why this symbolism is giving you the run around especially since it seems to slow you down this game implies so much but tells so little story i can think of 10 different things the story could mean but nothing is given conclusively bad storytelling in my opinion such a good cure for insomnia i just dont care for the layers of fear series so much potential yet just so lame you go so fast you miss things stupidly its a shame 4423 this place sickens me with its clutter and confusion that sums up my feelings to this game perfectly to much clutter and way to much confusion so about halfway through this video i started playing with my cat and when i came back 20 minutes later i dont think i missed anything important sorta how i feel about to whole game i havent played either of the layers games but i have watched full playthroughs of both games and i gotta say i found the first game to be much better then this one the scares were well executed the atmosphere was creepy oppressive the story was paced nicely this one just seemed boring poorly executed for a full grasp of the story you probably need all 3 endings but like john said im not going to do that i really have issues with horror games where the horror comes from the sick mind of the protagonist if it were a character that we get to know really and get attached to the horror element would be more interesting but in this case we have no idea who we are from the beginning the game didnt make me care about knowing and the sick mind of someone i dont know and dont care for is far from being scary yay weird shapes i get that too when i get up too fast psychological game perhaps as john said the artistic direction is the most interesting but the rest is really not interesting and damn the way this kid speaks is indeed so annoying it was okay i guess this game had so much potential in the first act but the latter half just gets up its own ass with pretentiousness wouldve been more interesting if the story and gameplay focused on the kids and was more grounded than shifting worlds 4917 bless you messyass game story explained james and lily are the children of a war veteran who ran a movie theatre out of his home due to his disfigurement in the war and the death of his wife giving birth to james the father is abusive especially to the son enchanted by the movies shown in the theatre and pulled in different directions by his father and sister james never developed a sense of self and became enchanted with the perfection and beauty of movie characters he began to see his father as a horror movie monster which recurs as a cyclopean horror throughout the games aesthetic the two eventually ran away from home leaving their deteriorating father to die and stowed away on an ocean liner where lily played pirates to try to keep jamess spirits high and told him stories of finding the flame the crew found them charming and disobeyed the captain refusing to capture them when they could the food rations began to run low and lily would occasionally le sweets to the sweet is a shakespeare quote referring to grieving for a beloved person the sweet and placing precious things sweets at their grave queen scattering flowers sweets to the sweet farewell i hopd thou shouldst have been my hamlets wife i thought thy bridebed to have deckd sweet maid and not have strewd thy grave shakespeare was very fond of these kinds of meaningful puns i enjoyed the black and white nature of layers of fear the artist struggling with his creativity but i couldnt follow the story in this one at all create destroy characters flame always with the flame pirates i dont know why but this make me feel like they grabbed hold of one part of what remains of edith finch made a whole twisted story out of it and stretched it to make a game its very much like the first game but this feels so much more abstract and almost aimless while being so specific and linear they have great visuals like the blood the halls horror film nods but it feels wasted on this whole interpret this as you will rorschach game ugh i dont know if it was the intention but as someone with osdd it totally feels like this is trying to be a split personality thing and it always feels so wrong to see that portrayed as some big reveal though i could be wrong it doesnt feel worth it to go looking for answers with a game like this the film history stuff was neat and the white walls red blood contrast was beautiful but otherwise ah cherriesthe tiniest of apples your criticisms pretty much nail down what bugs me about a lot of these sorts of games they dont feel real not impactful and it just feels like im being put on a treadmill to watch cool scenery while they tell me a story that i amounts to a poorly written choose your own adventure book its interesting to watch as far as the game itself i dont think its for me the story makes you want to continue to the end to figure out what is going on but even at the end its very vague the changing environments and sometimes poorly telegraphed rules would also make it a bit frustrating to try to play through i noticed most of the time there was no real danger but i didnt see the things that actually were dangerous being telegraphed very well i dont recall seeing if there were save points it seems like one thing that might boost replayability for those who want to see the other endings would be allowing saves just before decision points that would impact the ending otherwise just having to spend so much time walking through the story with little else to do would be a deterrent to trying different paths 3847 this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5b2ykhb8vjk a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need this game makes the first one look like a masterpiece which i didnt think was possible it was even worse visually since 23 of the game was black and white disappointed i miss harshly critical the real horror is that ign gave this a 910 i want to like this game because its clear so much work went into it but the symbolism is just so exceptionally heavyhanded that im really struggling im glad im not the only person to not get into this game i really enjoyed the first lof but just couldnt get into this one i tried but eh im sorry what was that ending who the fuck was that bald witch it feels like the creator just went if the game wasnt confusing enough for you heres a witch and she ends the game the end 3 hours of me going huh and wtf and i dont get it this game was really boring to me its too bad they felt the need to spell literally everything out for you the whole time a good game tells its story without having to hold the hand of the player and tell you what everything means through constant and grumbled narration i had such high hopes for this game after the pax demo but man was it ever boring i couldnt get into it at all and i have no idea what the plot was nothing made any friggin sense those are not apples my boy no matter how many times you said yeah those are apples lmao those are dark cherries and the vibe im getting is kinda gross 2648 is that a reference to se7en huhi dont know why but that seems kinda like an odd one out among the other movie references theyve been doing but i cant really put my finger on why it feels that way edit considering 3518yeah thats se7en and thats the beginning of tomb raider is anyone engaged by this by this melodramatic crap pretentious garbage weve seen again and again i loved the first one but the main thing that killed this game for me was the theme ships acting pirates gross the story was also quite bathetic more like layers of disappointment tony todds voiceover was wasted on this game thanks for slogging through it tho john im literally forcing myself to watch this there too much nothingness and bla bla going on and i keep spacing out its a shame because the graphics and symbolism especially in this last part under the sea is brilliant but thats all thats good about it those were literally the murder scenes from se7en gluttony lust pride and wrath at least edit something that bugs me john you stood in front of the shizo poster multiple times and you kept mentioning how insensitive it was to say schizo it says shizo not schizo john is a big mood being done with candyman yo but really this game is really not good i didnt understand anything from the start i swear 3048 alright yo my heart skipped a damn beat the first layers of fear had a boring predictable unoriginal story with little gameplay but great art and visuals this game had a boring long winded story little gameplay and the visuals are either ugly or average most of the time also this game is pretentious bullshit i find it werid everytime i open my cromebook and write i always watch a john wolfe video a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need i want you to die so i can see the quotes hahaha damn looks like im the only person who didnt dislike this game i think my interest lies mainly in the classic movie theme though i enjoyed the pretentiousness because it felt like an art film 3123 great se7en reference the pride scene youre weak youre worthless youre an anchor dragging me down geez game if i wanted to hear more of that line of talk id go visit my mother some more ick my name is james whats yours me looking at childs drawing what the is that the fookin babadook lol thats a funny name it was so boring and pretentious i just got irritated and wanted it to be over nothing i hate more than when gamesmovies use a bunch of flowery language to try and seem deep when theyre really just using a bunch of words that dont mean anything i had a lot of problems with the first layers of fear like i really did not like it but id take that any day over this geez game should be renamed layers of pretentious crap thanks for the gameplay john anyone else think lily sounds like young emilia clark aka mother of dragons why horror games are so repetitive these days its all about illusion and psychological effects nothing scary more than the reality this games title called layers of fear but where is the fear in this game i am excited for this game to be over to be honest not because of you but i dont like it lol whoever created the name for this game made mistake theres nothing bout this game to fear just long and boring misleading title customer thinking this horror game its more a mystery movie on a drug tripp not a huge fan of these videos lately its like trying to have fun going to a horrorhouse at an amusement park with friends and you have that one friend who turns around every corner explaining how not scared he is at everything and laughing as much as possible to prove that point to you not much fun i found the first game really boring but the beginning this one didnt grab me either couldt finish the first vid im just gonna watch the ending to see john and guys the ominous narrator voice just sounds like a vortigaunt zzzzzzzz what a boring game thanks for playing john hey john you should go to san japan this year cant wait for layers of fear 3 the musician the white and red part especially the curtain scene made me think of the timore dev with all the good feelings towards the timore dev id enjoy this game more if you were playing as a timore devlike dev playing through several shitty games each one act but the acts keep getting better or worse depending on how you choose to shape the games and the three endings are 1 you end up building nothing but red and black rooms with the same texture and the texture breathes then eats you 2 the last act is actually the first one but playing a bit better 3 the last act is a fucking gem of a short thrilling scary ride and you encounter a room full of giant busts like a council giving you approval in the scariest and most fun way also holy shit eu cofunded this yikes i am both glad and sad that the game did not end like i predicted james becoming a haunted vampire or wendigo by eating lily i like the comment section in your vids john youre blessed theyre interactive and mature and a neat community in general 0k so byeelove it hey john sweets to the sweet is from the movie candyman just another reference seems meaningless to the game this is a great playthrough to fall asleep through thanks for saving me 30 bucks john sorry you had to go through this borefest lol me the entire game im sorry what what did i miss what did you understand john cuz i understand nil xd 4545 ok the frankenstein referance is pretty clear but did someone saw the silence of the lambs at around 4644 5350 this room seems to reference the sixth sense i much preferred observer to this trying to push through to the end of this game so i can be sure of all my complaints john thankyou for washing the wounds i can t mention all the film references in this game but there was a lot of scenes from se7en in here and that was awesome to see a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i neeeedddd the layers of fear series feels like a horror funhouse a not so fun funhouse i love the movie references here and there its just so awesome to recognise the sets but besides that this game felt very very off i do like what they were trying to do like an actor going mad etc but as you said this felt far from real i suppose the game gives you the choice to become one or the other character in the other endings hey john you may not see this comment but scriptwelder made a dont escape 4 in full release recently id like you to play it but just a warning it is longer than the others so you may have to make multiple parts i only just saw that it released and i dont know anything yet so see for yourself rms odyssey i thought it was called the icarus or something like that yeah i dont like this game theres very little happening outside of scenery and weird setups that should scare you or make you think and i was just bored out of my mind plus the narrator was getting on my nerves maybe it wouldnt be so bad if he wasnt talking in such cheesy manner trying to be deep and poetic and coming off as plain annoyingappreciate you for playing john and for trying to get as much as possible out of this game i also hope as you move on to other games there will be a place for observation on that list of yours about every other youtuber aaaaaah john what are you gonna do now how you doin its like they were fine with just making a bunch of references and called it a day really disappointing they should of called james danny and lily wendy that would be pretty fitting i hate how current horror games are basically youre a shitty fatheryour shitty father died cry and get non euclidian ptsd about it i mean sheesh harry mason wasnt exactly a manly man but he went through silent hill to get his daughter back step it up weak men yeah nah this game didnt do it for me either what you said about it being without stakes since it feels like a big disjointed dream sequence is how i would summarize the experience of this also its clearly one of those philosophical artsy experiences similar to many david lynch films or black swan enemy etc a lot of interpretive symbolism where you can sort of sit and think about what it all meant and make theories what i said in the last video i think still is the baseline of how i would describe this game a sort of existential and absurdist possibly based on choices you can make kind of character journey its a game mapping out the identity of the character you play as based on distinct choices all the talk about the flame and build the character sounds like a lot symbolism for finding passion and purpose in life and being strong enough to be worthy to hold onto such burning power fire and carry it through life with confidence and selfrespect opposed to being afraid of living life and not worthy of that i assume were playing as james charles john starts off with i hope this is the last act vid 1 hour 15 minutes layers of fear 1 was a fucking boooring drag and so is this game its not scary and nor fun to watch like you and many in the comments i thought the first game was better the story was more compelling in the first and it only tried to be what it was it didnt need chase sequences and such also maybe this is just because im more used to horror games now but i found this game to be much less scary than the first the scares and even the shifting of the environment felt more creative and shocking in the first game overall i feel like they had the same issues they had in the first game like you said there isnt really much gameplay i know they tried to give you that with the choices as far as the story i feel like you are james who after the tragedy on the ship went on to be an actor so he could live others lives instead of his own maybe im not totally sure and that could be because of the choices like you said the game doesnt really put you as a character in the story well you do just feel like a rando trying to figure out what happened without getting any real proof sometimes that can be interesting in a show dont tell way but i dont feel like it was executed well the points of the story i want to know is if the dad was going on the ship and the kids snuck on overall i cant tell if you as the player is a part of this family or if youre just seeing what happened to them i dont think they tied in the directoractor storyline well other than if james was an actor after the traged sweets to the sweet candyman movie reference 10500 omg my first thought was of the queen of maggots this game is confusing as fucccccc i literally just listened to you talk and ignored the game love you john 3500 totally though the voice was the rat bloober team took 3 years and had the chance to make this game different than the first one bring in some new ideas make it something people will remember instead they made the same game again just more boring detached and confusing missed opportunity john talked about jump scares in this gamewhat jump scares there is only one decent jump scareand then everything is boring afthe first layers of fear was really goodthe atmospherethe soundsthe musicthe storythe jump scaresthe monsterall of it was really good but this onethe monster was st the story was so confusing to a point that half way in the gameyou dont give a fk anymoreto me it was more or less a walking simulator after act 2 i tuned out and just wanted to finish the game and be donethis game had so much potentialbutjust like amnesia a machine for pigsit was very disappointing but i enjoyed johns playthrough i loved the first one so much for the simple story and great visuals second one is just disappointing it not terrible but i was hoping for a step forward not a step back thanks for the lof2 video john not as engaging as the first game though for new games theres a horror game demo called adam lost memories thats been compared to silent hill and amnesia this game is so artsy fartsy it is anoying not everything has to be metaphorical your game play commentary is the only way i got through it blah game i dont dig those games where you have to do certain actions to progress without having any idea why youre doing them or what you are doing really really lacking in gameplay maybe the atmosphere makes up for it when youre playing it but here this game just seems hopelessly boring i didnt like the first game either so i guess its just not for me i always appreciate your input at the end of these kind of games maybe someone could make a mod for this that tries to salvage it boring ass game not john tho just the game kept thinking man this director guy sounds like night stalker from dota2 and then it is the same va haha nice yep whats in the boxxx sorry to the developer but i dont think this is a good game i can see a lot of effort was put into the graphics and whatnot but too many references for the sake of references it got heavy handed for sure am i one of the only ones who saw the heavy se7en references man face down at table person dead in white office red room with dead person in bed kek im only 30 mins into this video and im going to laugh if the ending has whats in the boxxxx i liked the part when voldemort appeared i think the scene with the doors opening up and all the red was for suspiria great horror film thats worth a watch if you like old style horror movies oh damn whats this a thoughtdump from someone who enjoyed the plotline oh god no turn away now run yeah though i really liked this game from a strictly storybased perspective theres a reason i enjoy watching horror games be played rather than playing them myself this looks like a horribly confusing gameseries to play and the addition of unpredictable sudden deaths wasnt a very good one imo but since i love surrealism and psychological horror that accurate shining prediction blew me out of the water lmao the general theme is both confusing as hell and kind of obvious at the same time like john said but heres my interpretation youve got james and lily children of an abusive parent and one of them becomes so absorbed in the escapism they used to act like everything is okay that when the other sibling diespresumably on the boat taking the stowawayfiresinking part as fact rather than even more symbolismthey lose sight of reality and who i wasnt expecting much of a surprising story but i am pretty dissapointed about the graphics the first game was as you said delicious looking here its mostly washed out foggy and downright headache inducing even outlast enviroments looked way more appealing john wolfe you arte such a dryassemotional story and everythign and you just sit there likeoo ok man they didnt learn nothing its the same thing all over again just too many cool moments and no clear direction lets just put everything in and most of this stuff is just soo overused everywhere it just doesnt work anymore its boring you go from one vision to another no time to break no time to think you just go through the game and want it just to end and the story who cares i didnt care about nobody in this game the person at the ending looks like voldermort i feel like the devs just wanted to make a bunch of references to horror films and then realized they had to build a game around it and we got this cliche story with bad mechanics walk around and trigger the spooks check abusive father check what was the oscar wilde quote all what you described at the end i still think pathologic 2 would be right up your alley lost of meaty gameplay tons of things at stake and a much much more compelling story and great characters 1245 weird flex but ok i want to watch this play through but i cant because i want this game i will watch after i beat it i hate this game it is pretentious hipstershit and pseudophilosophical pseudoiintellectual shit that tries to be obscure and mysterious when it is boring hipster pretentious game i still watched all of it just because of you because fuck you john also this reminds me of the buckethead song mannequins are my friends in the pikes shores of molokai those grabbing hands were probably repulsion 1965 reference personally i loved the first game the psychological horror and descent into insanity made sense and the story was really good thats what this game lacks imo the story is confusing the weird visions are very random and dont really make sense sadly dissapointing i just wish these kids would shut the fuck up already and the narrator and the other narrator silence is unappreciated in this game somehow less than in a cookie cutter jump scare fest because nobody shuts the fuck up i absolutely agree with your final thoughts on the game thats why i found it boring the detachment is real i like when there is a fixed map where you go back and forth to solve puzzles this game looked like going through a shape shifting tunnel its different for the eyes but its the same tunnel for the mind after all this was probably the most boring horror game of the decade i wanted to like this game i wanted to enjoy its beautiful atmosphere but it was so freaking pretentious and it stumbled over itself trying to be to clever the chase scenes were garbled the free will wasnt present the over all story was a bit done to death it had a beautiful setting it had good voice acting but it lacked mystery and genuine fear sometimes its the words that are unspoken that can be frightening so it was tony todd as the director i was thinking that it was someone else huh it keeps hammering that james is an actor but we never even saw his roles besides being lily i think thats what the photograph of the woman insinuates instead of throwing horror movie references left and right the game thinks we should get it wouldve helped build up his character if we saw the roles he actually played in life leading up to his identity crisis like maybe how those characters he played possibly bled into his everyday life that leads to people spotting inconsistencies in his personality and causing his life and relationships to falter that would have felt more compelling was that what the interaction with the photographer was saying or was it towards his dad i cant remember the one where the face was blurry and he looked different heck i dont think we know anything about james as he is besides hes an actor and he had a bad childhood which makes it difficult to connect with the him were playing since he lacks input in the story and hes head in the box seven deadly sins reference ghost girl being all dramatic and sht and sassy john goes you talkin to me layers of fear 2 was super boring but i watched youlisten to you because its you john you make everything funny sad thing is the game looks like it should be really fun visually very nice could have been turned into a fun world to explore but no i actually liked this story more although i agree with the chase sequences and kind of shifting environments they were never really effective for me i felt like the story was interesting in terms of trauma and some of the subjects they covered although its depicted with fantastical elements there was some great realism of the experience so much so that it was disconcerting how accurate it was in terms of the ambiguity of the characters personality and psychology however its a very specific experience so i can see how its not for everyone and how it might even seem nonsensical still for me the accuracy was remarkable and i enjoyed that about it im also a cinemaphile so the references were a nice touch especially the ones to se7en and the shining family guy makes a horror game i always think that this shifting rooms and hallways thing is cool but if the designers use it too much it would be just lazy game design theyre just like forcing the player to progress basically the whole game needs more horror and not a bunch of symbolism that only literature writers could figure out a good story and enough horror would be sufficient layers of pretentiousness this only scares people who think theyre deep this whole game felt like one big final stretch lol so quick plot summary of what i personally understood from it the director is either some demonic figment of james imagination or an actual demon he called based on the he called for her in the void but something else answered it really could be either theres this segment going into what the director is but atp it could also be this childs imagination building a backstory james was after lilys certain death just beating himself up with negativity she never really said or thought that he was useless or anything this is just him blaming himself for first the death of his mother and now his sister the director took over and whether he actually became famous irl or whether ever single person you listen talking or writing about him in the game is actually just a character he created himself is unknown fact is that he gives james different roles to play so he kinda copes with everything by being someone else a man must die many times is referring has anyone done a horror game where everything is bright and pretty sort of a suburban setting im so tired of edgy gritty darkness i watched all these vids john but i still have no idea what the story is and what the choices you made mean i am at lost i stayed for you john you made it another great vid thanks ahh the art was really gorgeous and that stop motion effect was really neat but yeah i think it didnt feel as cohesive as the first one thanks for playingposting this this isnt horror its a story and not a very scary one either personally i love this game especially as a film student easily one of my favorite games this year i found the story and atmosphere incredibly compelling and im definitely going for all achievements i do respect your opinion though the definition of wanting to watch one of your favorite youtubers but dont want to watch the game lol absolutely get where youre coming from my dude personally i enjoyed the first game to the point where i watched a lot of different people play it it was fun watching reactions in fact achievement hunters lets watch for it was fantastic highly recommend because its geoff playing it and i was super hyped for this game as you said looks and audio were outstanding and while i kinda like that theres such a questionable double meaning to quite literally everything i think the thing about this game that was its own weight was the length this is very strong in resemblance to general message and concept based around an art form previously a painter and now actordirecting to the first game as to be expected or it would be an entirely different title but i feel story telling may have been a bit more clean and concise had it been even an hourhour and a half shorter closer in length to the first game i dont know if they went in strongly wanting a longer game but i they are cherrys xd i dont get it the movie was real or just their delusion fabricated whilst building the characteri sill confused can somebody please explain the whole story to me pretty good story id say confusing and disorienting throughout but it becomes clear at the end couldnt play it myself too visually busy and would be hard on someone like myself with visual comprehension issues thanks for the lp john what the actual fuck is the story of this game tho like who is the woman creature at the end i am confused i hated this game boo an ace up my sleeve this game went up its own ass in a major way v the story was just too cluttered the first ones was much more precise and thus clear but this one got too wrapped up in its own message to remember that cohesion is important to remember that in the end expressing large ideals can get messy really quick if you dont have a story to act them out which is this games biggest problem hey john sweets to the sweet is a candy man reference btw i love u and ur game play sweets to the sweet is a candyman reference i liked the first game and i was hoping this one would be more to johns liking but once we got into act 2 it really lost me the imagery is stunning but the story is so vague at least the first game gave you enough to build something on after awhile creaking open doors and slamming them shut does nothing and the constant deaths caused by not knowing when you are in danger is annoying and not the least bit frightening theres not really a complete story they seem to just fill in the blanks with deep and meaningful sounding quotes as if that is enough very disappointing it really felt like they had a good concept but lacked in execution i agree with the synopsis of this game from john i have been playing it and found it so mundane and overplayed in parts that i find myself struggling to finish it just not enjoying it at all this game was boring to watch only thing i liked was the shining parts also nothing scary happened its like a fancy walking simulator then the candyman talks about linking the first flame because someone gave him darksouls lore to read for this game walking simulator glad youre done and the writing in this game its like a freshman english lit majors wannabe philosophical ramblings jotted down in a collegerule journal they say so much in this game without ever really saying anything at all lol also can we get a montage of john sneezing during games to the tune of hungarian rhapsody no 2 by franz liszt that would be epic maybe i wasnt paying enough attention but seems you completely missed the reference to se7en the dummy with the head in the bowl the sexually posed one and the one posed on the bed i think this game needs a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thanks for saving me 30 john that was a stunningly dull and not at all compelling game good lord doesnt seem like it could have been made by the same crew as the first there are freeware horror games better than this narratively muddled and artistically vacuous experience all of the seven references are really good i love that movie thanks for saving me 30 john that was a thoroughly dull and not at all compelling game shortly summed up for positives i like the environments sound design and music all of them are very nice and i enjoyed them a lot what i didnt enjoy on the other hand and john does make a good point by saying as a viewer theres even more disorientation to what were watching and im not sure if im the only one here but after act 2 or 3 i felt really lost with what was happening in the story despite johns attemptsguesses later on i dont know man i didnt once feel attached to the characters either maybe its because of me losing interest as the game went on im not sure i wouldve like the whole narrative more if it wasnt so both pretentious and somehow subversive the entire time too theres possibility for something interesting here and i feel like they keep missing the mark which sucks the narrator to this game is tony todd aka candyman himself and that sweets to the sweet reference you saw was a line from the candyman movie not sure if anyone noticed i didnt even like the first layers of fear aside from the visuals but this game makes it looks like a gem what happens when you find notes god john carried this one like usual 2631 john hi me my name is yolandi fuckin visser fight fight fight kick you in the teeth hit you on the head with the mic this game is terrible maybe im just too dumb for such a high brow title this game was a slog tbh i had to skip a bunch of parts bc it was so boring its just a long hallway simulator with a plot that isnt as interesting as the devs think it is tbh i didnt even know lof2 was coming out until a few weeks ago when i happened to find a preorder one day it didnt look promising and thats sadly the case really didnt like this one lol couldnt get absorbed into the story things would happen thatd make me go um okay lof was colourful angry and intense lof2 was blackwhite with monotonous monster chases and a confusing story i appreciate your playthrough though formless ugh i hate games that give you a dumb ending after a normal playthrough i had the same thing happen in silent hill homecoming when i accidentally got the ufo ending my first time at least the layers of fear 1 ending was reasonable and satisfying on a normal playthrough james im the captain now captain phillips am i a joke to you me when someone shows me their wallpaper on their phone 2956 more than anything i was looking forward to the visuals of this game given thats what i enjoyed most about the first layers of fear it wasnt scary per se but it was visually interesting in my opinion im a little disappointed with layers of fear 2 to say the least oh and it probably didnt help that the story wasnt told as well as it could have been they should just rename this layers of detachment hey john its subscriber you got the worst ending i love how excited you were when the looping hallways started to zoom in hahaha i quite liked these last few chapters a lot and i agree with you about the white and red contrast that was a real snazzy palette i think i would actually quite have enjoyed this type of game as i really like environmentalexploratory games im finding except for the monster bit that probably would have stressed me out a bit hahaha i think the only thing i wanted more of was the story of who the director was and whywhat movie they were trying to make like if that was all just a hallucination or james interpretation of whats happening im cool with that but i guess i was hoping for more clarification on like who the director was and how they related to james but anyways i still enjoyed this playthrough twas fun watching you play it why is he so calm while playing these kind of games man this game is resident snoozer but still watch cause of john butcan anyone tell me the story it seems i dont like this game i really like listening to you talk though sometimes i play your video in the background and play video games its one of those times my theory is that because james missed lily so much he got to find her back the only way lily told him is to looking into himself only if that she can live forever inside his mind so james started to act as lily dress like lily think like lily finally became lily and eventually james got an identity crisis he started to confuse which is him james or lily after james grew up his ability to play as someone else help him build up his career as actoror actress as being lily because of the identity crisis he struggled with every movie characters he played he is they and they are him the only way to move on is to kill those characters to the end when you hold the gun a man and a woman in front its time to decidewhich one to stay james or lily but hey its just a theory not my game but what the story says is that james survived this accident and grew some more personalities to deal with all this and i think lily was one of them so yea he is a sick actor which maybe adds up different roles different personalities to survive thats my theory so far always happy to see a new video from you damn i was so sure that we were actually playing lily the entire time sweets to the sweet is a candy man reference sorry but this game is good for now since noone else has brought out a horror game this good with details and everything and it is a time killer so i think this game is only good because of that john oh so more mcescher bullshit me wow john is so harsh and critical i feel that the quote a good artist copies a great artist steals applies to this game very well everything in this game was a copy of itself and others it is now just meaningless filler to attempt to make the player feel fulfilled and properly scared when all it does is show you images of overly used tropes and cliches this is just a very disappointing game layers of fear 2 just felt like more generic horror tropes combined with a bunch of movie references that lof2 didnt learn anything from oh boooy abuse caused mental illness also for being a game thats biggest strength is its visuals they just stuck with boring ship themes constant black and white and the game was just dark and impossible to see for the most part final note all i could think of with the spooky voice was spring traps goofy lines from freddys pizzeria simulator i just fastforwarded to the end to hear your thoughts on the game lol 15 minutes in and i was like yeahno thank you this genre of horror is dying and thats a good thing its just bland and repetitive were entering a new generation ugh got to about 33 minutes and was like please dont have it be that he was acting as her all those years that doesnt even make sense are they trying to imply they pulled a lindsey lohan parent trap for every movie they were both in with the movie posters because no way is that believable for that time and people thought he killed her because he stopped acting as her bleh so boring what i liked about the game is the movie references otherwise its a meeeeeeeeh it was just all over the place with the story the constant change of environment as you said you cannot really connect with the game it was too messy so well cant wait to see another lets play of yours will you try observation by the developers of stories untold 5217 anyone notice the waterphone hi john i am very excitedwatch the video game love you prepares for the satcasm i expect and love john your commentary and reactions were the only things that got me though this playthrough seriously this game was so bloated with heaps and heaps symbolism that it just got meaningless after a while didnt like it at all played through it prerelease not scary at all story was incoherent had more to say at the end of my playthrough video overall just disappointing and boring pretty bad overall even worse than the first there is something to be said about being so over the top so constantly and yet trying to be subversive in your plot it doesnt work and really just leaves me rolling my eyes more than anything 2407 best reference love the series i agree with you john and this is not my style of game enjoyed you but i didnt get drawn into the story hope you have a great week this game makes me want to get a lucky break an ace up my sleeeeeeeve i stopped watching the first game so i could go buy and play through it myself first stopped this time too but because i skipped to the ending to just watch the ending and conclusion oh well 737 it looks like small rotten grapes or small rotten cherry fruits to me actually from watching all the actsi do love how detailed each environment is the chase scenes were a bit much which i skipped a few of those overall i like each of the 3 endings for the game where you are trying to create a character that being the sister brother or formless just my guess great job tho john isnt that whispering effect at 5516 the same as the one for the runesbone charms in dishonored honestly the only thing this got going is that they got the actor who played the candyman to be in it aww s03the return wasnt that bad mulholland drive is such a tighter experience though its difficult to recommend tp before watching that lynch does sort of a dark souls promise whatever dark souls shows in the background is a place you can visit but its going to be a struggle similarly any big questionsmysteries tpmd generates and doesnt explicitly answer can always have answers found fitting with a reasonable interpretation but its going to be a struggle eg if you fiddle with your brightness settings youre more likely to notice the diner in the final driving sequence of the final episodes missing some important branding wait what layers of fear is polish game yasss these layers of fear episodes are keeping me entertained while im still off recovering from surgery thanks man its a shame this sequel was very dissapointing and far less creepy than the first game its the monster chases mostly that made it annoying to play the extremely pretentious dialogue and narration and the overuse of rather bland and uncreepy mannequins also john i swear to god the amount of movie references you didnt get in your playthrough videos made me nearly break my screen 1035 crank that souja boy intro lol sounds like it and im ashamed i heard it my reaction to everything that happens in this game 2001 2007 i like that seven reference tho d just cant get into it at all pretentious and cliche ridden storyline is messy i just didnt enjoy this one at all but i stuck with it to hear your commentary honestly tired of these walking simulator horror games thats a really good point regarding the feeling of detachment to the environment what makes reality warping eldritch locations scary for me is seeing an ordinary familiar environment youre comfortable with breaking down and becoming something hostile and disorienting thats why i got creeped out by the otherworld transitions in the early silent hill games the shifting labyrinth in the novel house of leaves the hotel room in the movie 1408 etc all of those examples established a location gave you time to feel familiar with it and then pulled the rug out from under you here were just constantly bombarded with crazy tricks and imagery without any setup and it doesnt phase me at all i didnt find the characters nor the story to be compelling so that didnt help much either nice blue tshirt john 925 we found it ladies and gentleman the definitive poofer as far as were concerned john if it doesnt happen on camera then it didnt exist you dont even exist until the video starts same ending i got i just wanted to get it over with i wasnt really enjoying playing this one i found this one to be a little too pretentious and symbolic for my liking i understand the story but the choices you have to make in this game dont make any sense in the moment completely agree with your opinions on this game i played the game myself and felt like i threw away money i actually loved the first one and found this one far too boring act i was the best and after that i felt the game continued to go downhill the chase sequences were annoying and by the time i got to the last act i just didnt care about anything anymore and wanted the entire thing to be over already a lucky break an ace up my sleeve thats all i need nahim done here john xd wheres the all endings are you holding out on us early hope he tries close to the sun watching it while in work cuz this will be so good this game ranks really low for me i tried to like it by watching john but i just couldnt do it i only watched half an hour of act 1 and your conclusion but couldnt agree more those games are just not my cup of tea graphics are awesome alright and story is alright but everything else a lucky break and ace up my sleeve is all i need who else is laying in bed scrolling through thanks john for inspiring me to create horror videos and hit 5k subs hey john its guys thank you for your work i love your gameplays i love your narration to the games time to finish fnaf vr im still waiting for days gone part 2 6 minutes never been so early d guess i have too much free time 1 h of johns humour incoming frick i need to wake up early in the morning but i wanna watch this im gonna watch this too important zzzz bed time here but currently suffering from tonsillitis hopefully this will be tomorrows self pity entertainment for me for the day 3 early bird gets the horror please please play pathologic 2 its not a popular game but a very creepy one with a thick thicc atmosphere that id love your cynical take on holy shit ive never been this early to anything hey john are you going to play more pamali they released all episodes cry of fear still scary dont know when i joined its been a pretty interesting game so far third ogers are like onions they have layers but they also have fears my pp small sub to my channel to make it big esse nome lily me faz lembrar do filme mama galera conheam meu canal de games tambem blz ucvtluflrap0kvmskdrtszcw 5543 cago by coronel fahur 100top opa mais um de terror bora seguir a srie topppp como senpre bom game play ta foda esse layers of fears max e macabro oloko trazendo logo o layers of fears 2 da hora max a primeira gameplay que acompanhei do seu canal foi layers of fears 1 this game pissed me off it was screaming for attention look how technically advanced and visually impressive i am look how many great works of cinema the creative team have seen but in the end none of it mattered this was a car wreck of three separate stories that mightve worked on their own a brother and sister escaping an abusive childhood an actor on a ship trying to make a film with a controlling director and a horror story about a protagonist losing their grip on reality but utterly fail to combine into a cohesive plot as a result im not enthralled with the narrative im bored and the game mechanics were so linear so unforgiving or so consequence free that it mainly came down to trial and error im not afraid im frustrated throughout it all i grew more and more impatient for the ending because the pretentiousness was killing me this game has nothing profound to say about acting identity or art it offers psuedophilosophizing about all three b i agree i play a lot of horror games im also incredibly easy to please with scary games since im such a fan but this game was pretty garbage i never once was scared in any way 410 is pretty generous i agree with you layers of fears was not scary i like layers of fear 1 better way more jumpscares layers of fear 1 and 2 seem like they had very similar problems without much improvement i hope they try to improve when it comes to the blair witch game i luv horror survival like this and the first lof played most silent hill re all outlast ect ect but a video game has never scared me this is as good as most decent storyand tough to get all achievements good game 710 way over your heads sorry this game is so hard for you to appreciate for those who have never played the game try the game create your own review for the game ive been spoiled by games like penumbra and amnesia i found this game to be boring a hallway crawling door opening simulator i honestly dont expect this game to be like other horror games thats why i like it so much its different bizarre and amusing to watch that what makes it good for me the fact that the first thing u did was to compare it to another game like outlast tells me u played it expecting it to be something that it never promised nevertheless love ur vida i agree with pretty much everything in this review what disappoints me most is that i loved the first game it scared the crap out of me its story was interesting on point reviewawful gameno horrorjust walking through hallways after hallways c r a p better than the first one thats for sure loved the first one best horror game ever this onenot at all im about 2 hours in and im just bored awful and boring the first one is the best dont buy this game agreed yet i had a semi opposite experience i knew something happened to the character when they were young but i couldnt for the life of me make it out it was so hidden for me i just didnt care i had no reason to relate to the character as to be honest there was never really one to begin with could have been handled so much better if they didnt make it a sequel the game didnt need to be a sequel the first game wasnt perfect but had a much stronger narrative and ending that i expected something greater from the second some devs need to think before making sequels jumpscares does not make a game scary lol this game shits on outlast sounds like you just want the game to be something its not you need to allow yourself to really get involved in the storytelling and interact with the gameworld in a steady slow pace i see these people buying horror games only to cheese their way trough it by not looking at the scarydisturbing images in game and just trying to sprint trough it allow yourself to try to get really involved and this game will be scary also play this alone and at night with a headset on and really turn down the brightness this game is great and i enjoyed every minute of it this my first time to dislike a gaming bolt video enjoy 1st game was amazing but the theme and gameplay for this was awful it went from the mystery discovery and unease of the first game to just pointless jumpscares there was next to no character development unlike the first game so you didnt care for anything that was happening dudes an actor cool why should i care i liked the first game and i acutally liked how the plot just nicely resolves itself in a horryifing manner but in herethis endings are just kinda off and stupid the endings make no sense like the only interpretation is just fucking stupid and what was the point of that cloaked womanmonster that just appeared out of nowherewtf its a psychological game not a blood horror game get this through your head the game is scary for the first time in my life ive seen a review that is worse than igns kudos to the reviewer who thought this was an outlast sequel i found my self squinting way to much in the 1st one the lighting and story were set well but in the 2nd it was to damn dark half i couldnt tell whether i was looking down a dark hallway or staring at a wall the most boring game i ever played playing for a few hours so far and im already getting bored for me the monster chase moments are great but everything else is meh i couldnt agree with anyone less then i do with this narrator ign loved it 9 out of 10 found the first one quite scary with some good jump scares and really nice graphics and easy achievements wtf whith black and white just cause you suck at games like this dont mean they suck i dunno why but its so boring same like lof 1 so all of a sudden ign is relevant again because they actually gave a high score for once anything less than a 90 and people are like ign sucks idk why game reviewers insist to compare games to other games i thought layers of fear was a really good game although it wasnt that scary it did some pretty cool things with the pt style environment shift mechanic layers of fear 2 is way scarier in my opinion than the first but it wasnt well segmented the acts 15 were long and it made it seem like there was no end the story in layers of fear 2 is more vague than the first even though it tries to shove it in your face instead of letting you find hidden objects i feel that the endings were extremely unsatisfying as they dont answer any questions but they just propose more but some of the cooler environments to play through were the bank set all of act 3 and some of the normal boat areas i still like this game but i just thought it could have been better this games actually really good this is just my opinion i dont like the fact that you kept looking at your phone instead of paying more attention to the game while i can understand that you were expecting the game to be something more to your taste the first game creatively shows us the vision of the artists sanity and how little he care for his injured wife as well as the abuse he showered on to his daughter pushing her to be like him an artist also with the mannequin thing mannequins are used for modeling character designing etc layers of fear2 in the beginning tells us of how one builds many characters but not one for himself the game does ask the playerdirector if we remember who we were while the first lof didnt seem to have any deaths this has some sort of death with that one distorted guy in all honesty the first dlc and second games of layers of fear brings us environmentally beautiful visuals good puzzles and a decent amount fear this game from my standpoint is a artistic horr review is just shit if u cant die then it takes away the intensity imagine playing outlast u cant die scary but not heart racing scary well layers of fear 1 had already the same problems just creating another game like that would def not solve the problems that were already existing lof 1 had the canceled pt bonus at the time which made it ok to play but it was def very lackluster and bad designed as a game so many games fail like this just simply boring and waste of time games should be somewhat fun or exciting to play if i play a good game i forget about my problems if i play games like this i have 1 problem more to think of this guys review is shitchalked full of his own personal negative perceptions i suggest if you like the first game the second game is worth having a go the first one was beautiful but you can tell all the work was put into the graphics just terrible game not even gonna bother with 2 alright now its really confusing ign review seemed to be just opposite of this right off the bat you comparing this game to outlast means you went into this game expecting something it never promised they only worked on the graphics sadly if youre checking your phone while playing layers of fear then im afraid youre playing it wrong forgive me if im wrong but does this reviewer even enjoy horror games i can picture him playing this in a brightly lit room with no headphones and the sound being low maybe im wrong like but thats what i got while listening to his review this review sucks oh my god im so happy im not the only one who feels this way about the game i think the first game was okay it was fun to play but this one made me so mad i just rage quit around act 3 and i dont rage quit that often at video games im just so disappointed act 1 was okay but it just kept getting worse and worse and i spent around 31 on this i guess different strokes for different folks i think lof 1 was one of the best horror games lof 2 is super good so far im on act 3 this game is quite a bit like the original people dont listen to retarded and shitty reviews like this one like i said this is my opinion i think this game is really good the mannequins were fine with me youre saying the mannequins are a bad thing but its kind of the games thing the game does more than create disturbing and distressing imagery you cant compare a game like this to outlast they arent anything alike 2 different games outlast is more intense with enemies at every corner and high paced chase scenes while this game does have some chase scenes theyre not as numerous and the game is more focused on other elements you seem like you like more intense games and you cant bash this game for not being as intense as outlast maybe if you were paying more attention and stayed at least a little bit more invested cut the crap i loved the first one so i think i am safe the reviews are making no sense for this game it literally feels like its either a masterpiece or trash ive only encountered two types of reviews either they call it dissapointing boring trash as in a 510 or an amazing immersive 910 horror game how the hell am i supossed to get something from reviews when they seem to be so divisive how can ign be praising it so much and gaming bolt do the exact opposite who the hell am i even supossed to trust anymore the first layers of fear may not have been the scariest game ive played but i found it intriguing enough to finish in one sitting it helped that it wasnt too long either i enjoyed the first one and will definitely being picking up the 2nd one too dont listen to this guy if u like creepy stuff this is your shit why does your video capture quality always look so shit walking sim for horror is a terrible idea the first layers of fear was known for not being very scary or having no real feeling of threat this review really sounds like a review for the first one all this being said i actually did enjoy the first lof it was just a nice game to get comfy with and while away the hours on a rainy day also had some interesting visuals that kept me wanting to play on think ill probably go ahead and purchase lof2 this guys an idiot this guy clearly never played the first game and if he did he didnt appreciate it id rather watch on pornhub rather than play and expect to be scared how does it differ from the original sounded like you were reviewing that not a big surprise considering that first layers of fear was a piece of putrid dog shit i bough and played both game and dlc and i really regret wasting my money on that snore fest of shitty walking simulator yknow what gaming bolt this is probably the third of your videos i watched in the past two years and i am disappointed sure you are entitled to your own opinion but my god does this fucking annoy me i remember back in 2017 i watched your review for the walking dead game season 3 and the reviewer pronounced the main characters name dead wrong its javi not fucking jayvee and this dumb fucking review is bringing me back to your 2017 retard moment not sure why youre surprised the first was trash too 410 not enough layers of fear i liked the first one but im unsure if i should get it or not im surprised you gave it a low score everyone is saying its one of the best horror games on this gen yet you gave just cause 4 a 9 which was a pile of shite keep all phones off when playing this game i really like this game personally from what i have seen deffo gonna buy it today honestly i am not surprised there is nothing that even come close to the raw brilliance of psychedelic horror like silent hill 12 those games had the brilliance of having quiet time to contextualize the insane parts better than any horror games have done it since great game maybe if u read pieces of information that the game gives you instead of checking your phone you would understand the plot i guess it is better to bash a game you dont understand go play more fortnight i wonder if ign was paid to make the game a 910 i would like to take a moment to acknowledge visuals of the game garbage game its 4 3 reviews back to back nice shame i somewhat liked the first as in 610 fair it want that good good video as always boys yes finally another gopher horror playthrough just what the doctor ordered brilliant ive mastered the art of using the bathroom lmao internet quote of the month i love the way that other than the creepy voice that says your toys are upstairs the first area looks like a nice place to be on holiday at least at first xd the vibe will probably not last so nice to hear ulysses again at the beginning there 814 spoiler no you give birth to it and it becomes a boss fight later its more of a sea serpentesk thing with tentacles it uses baby sound effects from unborn 2 which are edited and mixed with rattle snakes rattled and slaughter house pig squeals should be very entertaining 1455 hey be glad they didnt go for the clich so the first game the protagonist was a crazy painter now a crazy actor i love where this is going im really enjoying this its nice when my favourite youtubers play games i wouldnt play if someone paid me because im a chicken gopher not a fan of these open doors me as opposed to the closed ones that open suddenly and youre dead were in sync again wait that room with alcohol and painting referencing the first game kinda surprised gopher didnt realize that the room 3033 belonged to the painterfather from the original layers of fear have to say this game looks amazing i have you set for all notifications to be sent but never got this odd gday gopher just made me realise id picked up the first one but never bothered to install it installing i dont know but i feel like at 2615 its morse code larger ships are more resistant to rolling in gentle waves than your smaller boats partly because of their greater mass and partly because their size means multiple waves are in contact at once averaging out the ups and downs so the actor has become an ampty vessel to be filled with a character which has left him unstable the director has a cane and a mask and hardly anyone has ever met him people speak of his strange methods but the actors friend or maybe his agent thinks its worth taking the job anyway the film will be shot at sea far away from other people this will be a sad role so is it going to happen is it happening now or has it happened in the past oo cant wait for the next episode yay more gopher assemble the character i know what that means expect body parts probably fresh you could never get me on a cruise ship ive seen how those movies play out i love your horror playthroughs settling in for this series cant wait for next episode this game is good gopher i believe that fish on the wall is an alligator gar we have them in the southern usa they are very prehistoric fish left over from a long time ago they can grow to be 10 ft or 3 meters long 324 pornactor was my first thought yeah i have a beautiful mind i know 2017 also this is obviously a dolphin that has heard a really funny joke these kinds of letsplayer i favour the most a tiny bit of gophers un ease with climatic game hey gopher i know in the past you used to have like a glass of brandy or whiskey or whatever when playing horror games do you still do that im curious sorry if its a bit needlessly personal to ask is that the voice of tony todd candyman candyman candyman candyman been waiting for this one it looks like a model for sculptingdrawing poses used by artists at 549 too short give me more ps i do mean it the episode was over in no time the taps work the toilet flushes ign 1010 love this love this 2438 who else recognised hancock do i have radiation poisoning probably it seems to be a problem for your characters well thats another game gopher has gotten me to wishlist is that really the very start of the game should i start with this one or the original another game id never buy but im going to enjoy watching this sledgehammers follow gopher now take the sledgehammer with you just in case you never know when youll need one does it contain drugs or alcohol what mental breakdown doesnt also alcohol counts as a drug gopher scares himself pantless playing a horror game in the dark alone with headphones on season 42 great immersion and athmosphere as usual too bad the game is really crap d not an issue for me since i hstill have a lot of skyrim to watch but seriously layers of fear and game like these really suck for me you cant do anything you wander around clicking things for no apparent reason other than is pretty much the only thing you can do theres no room for play styles personalization you have no clue about the story and you are just dropped in the middle of it without knowing what to do or how to do it poor excuse for a game if you ask me and makes for boring repetitive and dull content but thats the game fault not yours if this is what the audience wants tho ill go back quietly into the night since i am probably the minority here d i always play with sync off i dont have that blur line gopher has when moving around because i cap the fps nvidia inspector or usercfg when not possible with ingame menu doing this its like full sync totally clean unless my framerate dropsi dont have a very powerful card gtx 970 i am wondering if he forgot to cap his framerate to his monitor hertz max capacity and the graphic card is sending much more images per sec than the monitor can handle this line is in every video its impossible not to notice unfortunately yessss thank you gopher layers of fear 2 this will be awesome you would make an awesome lead for phantom of the opera the mask reminded me of seeing that on broadway many many moons ago as long as you dont sing cause we dont really need another henry moment amusing that is how you sing in real life or maybe we do in a comedic version which would be awesome too i still hope to see you interact with carth onasi one day huzzah pop the popcorn nice to see you playing this awesome well thats one way to introduce the player to the game you have an excellent taste in games gopher the graphics and atmosphere on this game are insane oh and what a distinguished voice tony todd has perfect for this game shadow of the tomb raider 1end detroit become human 1end dmc 5 1end visage 1end skrng layers of fear 2 bru part1 hehehee berjelajah playlistnya kak regii 2019 pesan buat

cockroach this game is miserable boring yeah all those musical posters you know broadways smash musical hamlet or who could forget the show stopping numbers from twelfth night a for lindsay making all those hamlet references made my little shakespeare nerd heart so happy its a tool music video got me real good thanks lindsay the metropolis this old film about industry being evil from 1927 reference at like 1840 made my day this game is awesome lindsay is a real one i like how geoff either goes as slow as possible or headbutts right into it 1830 isnt this a metropolis reference i love comming to a video and seeing that fiona was replaced with lindsey so much better actually bummed fiona isnt in this cause she is so funny when they play horror games youtube has the wrong game up it has fear 2 not layers of fear obligatory comment quota met trevor literally killed fiona off just cos hes tired of her encouraging geoff to walk backwards smh lindsay with the dunk on hamlet made my day anyway xd alright so im listening to the beatles in the background of this video and im part 4 yellow submarine was on and said submarine at the same time as trevor said submarine in the video now in this part trevor said sky at the same time as they said sky in the song lucy in the sky with diamonds they keep breaking our lightbulbs those could be hue bulbs is the biggest first world problem ive ever heard thank you trevor for remembering the bravery hey fionas not here this series might be watchable after all why is the ring girl got an ad for flex seal right as a jumpscare happened please stop putting lindsay in vides the scene at 1820 is a reference to a movie from 1927 called metropolis i had to watch it my freshman year of college for english class cant believe that just came in handy thanks dr swain geoff i see the hesitation on the liquor bottle stay strong thank god fiona isnt here would much rather have lovely lindsay that tool reference by lindsay was really underrated i love how they completely missed the ghostly boy sitting on top of the wardrobe outside the well room even though their view caught his kicking legs more ark please i love lindsay but i prefer fiona in these scare throughs her reactions make me backtrack on the scares just to see her reactions hahaha ughhh giving geoff the controller gives me anxiety every time he plays games like these thank god ive been wanting to watch this so bad but cant with fiona she needs to stay gone when lindsay says starts playing schism while youre also practicing guitar at the same time me plays schism by tool wow an annoying trevor and an obnoxiously loud lindsay i dont think im gonna keep watching this series there is just no one from the cast that i enjoy other than goeff but hes always getting drowned out by the others they talk about siege but dont upload it reeeee does anyone else stop breathing when they watch this cause uh same 1715 actually gertrude said that not ophelia youtube marked this as fear 2 lmfao youtube compression was not kind lmao lindsey is the best with the music references its a tool video 101 its called tetris syndrome 813 aw they took my fruit the og boo crew wincing screaming andor flinching for everything lindsay unbothered hey guys thanks for havin me d just realized this is somewhat of a ripoff of amnesia a machine for pigs can we get geoff to play scp containment breach anyone else hear trevors casual reference to the bravery wow the nostalgia lol youtube thinks this is fear 2 did anyone else see gavin in the painting at 056 i miss fiona in this isnt this just a fanfic of the mannequins from fallout 4 or was that stolen too alfredo has the luigi fighting stance to fight n run lol til fiona sounds exactly like trevor watching everyone bollock geoff for the steam thing was so fucking satisfying said everything i wanted to say christ it was better than coke i like rewinding after a jump scare to really focus on fredos reaction watching geoff play this game is going to give me an aneurysm liking for replacing fiona with lindsay not really interested in the game like i was the first layers of fear but the reactions are enjoyable layers of fear one was fun i would love to watch this on your website if it didnt suck ass game fear 2 project origin almost youtube i rather lindsay than fiona nice tool reference from lindsay the video for schism was creepy as hell as a fellow pussy i 100 completely support the geoff method i dont wanna see shit and yknow what geoff respects that keep walkin backwards buddy ur doin the lords work finally these videos are watchable rip fiona im just wondering how that camera recorded audio seriously let trevor take the controller hey lets play layers of fear 2 6 jumpscares at 111 201 kinda i think trevor scared me more 518 856 948 1550 lol even when fiona isnt here people still bitch about her jesus christ people on the one hand geoff is endlessly entertaining to watch on the other he keeps freaking me out and im not even playing comment section is extra shitty today its a tool music video lindsay lindsey fiona lindsay with a tool reference at 1554 nice lindsay just got brownie points for making a tool reference love those tool references lindsay d 348 aka what everyone in the comments is yelling at geoff when hes hesitating to enter a spooky room jesus it looks like a larry the cable guy tour on that webcam yay lindsays here someone who actually contributes to the video unlike fiona just replace fiona already or let her work in a different area other than being on videos 020 no geoff its worse for content much worse slightly funny sometimes but usually annoying great videos still thanks to the funny people but sack up geoff alfredo gets scared you gotta make these longer youre trailing behind other youtubers maybe because i watch this during the day and im not playing and know nothing about this game but i have watched several hours of this game and have yet to be scared or even felt nervous is this supposed to be scary or just boring i think the scene 1820 is a metropolis reference 1555 lindsey with the tool references honestly it seems like they somehow listen to every band ever im honestly disappointed when fionas not around wow not even 1 minute in and they start talking about rainbow shit god i love this series oh thank god its not fiona now anyone wanna catch me up on the first 4 parts that i and others refuse to watch shook the walls with a burp and lindsay goes that was a noise thanks i know 1819 is a reference to metropolis i think 2018 i hate lindsay shes the worst ah member why did she have to replace one of the main few in this video 2019 im so glad lindsay is in this lets play im glad she replaced one of the main few in this episode its almost as if ah fans make wrong quick judgements on people and this has nothing to do with fiona just showing the hypocrisy with lindsay as people treated her like shit back in the day lindsay is a great fit for horror games and games in general tbh i wish they had space for all 5 of them to watch thatd be a really fun episode a fiona and lindsay series would be even better lindsay can be the bravery to her fear djgkdjvmf the brave and fearless and reckless lindsay joins in to push the trembling men along hes really geoffing it this playthrough i am almost 100 sure that last part of the game was a reference to the big machine in metropolis love lindsays tool reference that absolutely reminded me of something from their music videos i miss fiona but lindsay is brave as fuck im so glad yall are continuing with this its so good how the hell did they not see the foot at 1741 not having fiona around makes me realize how much more i like lindsay now with all the horror games geoff has played how has he not gotten over his fear of pretty much everything that blinks moves and everything in between there is a disappointing lack of samara morgan sadako yamamura in this video i love seeing lindsay in this i miss fiona would love to watch geoff or frado play alien isolation somethings rotten in the state of denmark i love how everyone jumped expect lindsay 856 they missed the boy sitting on the wardrobe kicking his legs against it that was what made the sound xd ignored the first 4 parts because of fiona time to try and figure out whats going on d its annoying how much geoff is a pussy but it makes great content i love the candyman narration lol for over thirty years i have compulsively checked every corner in every game i ever played geoffs method gives me palpitations thank god its not fiona lmao idk why but i dont watch anyone else play horror games but ah lol alfredo i like the way geoff plays not good for content but man geoff or some would argue better for content are those people named geoff andor ramsey because im pretty sure the majority of us are just annoyed by it aaaw i do like lindsay but fionas screams of terror are my drug ive done it again havent watched the last episodes and watching this one yes more layers of fear yes more layers of fear did someone say ring girl boss music intensifies the annoying girl is gone much better to watch now not first che twist sto gioco layer of fear 2 sempre bellissimo grande studio ok can we talk about why none of these people know how a vault door works that same carpet was not only referenced in the shining but it was also found in toy story 2 inside of sids house it supposedly represents having a split personality alfredo i can confirm it did make at least one hp fan smile obvious stealth section is apparently not obvious enough id be more frustrated with how the game is being played then scared lol i hate horror games but am trying to get over my fear geoff plays just like i would and i appreciate it so much what trevor said at the end shocked me i never expected him to say that ahhh hearing you guys talk about castle rock made my heart nearly explode they chose my home town to film there and its been such a great boost for our small town to have something so big and positive happen there they are actually working on season 2 right now we completely miss the reveal after geoff opens the blind would be nice to actually see the content of the game rather than geoff do it all backwards and no look at anything get michael in i do like how this is like father geoff making his kids watch him play the scary game honestly no point in watching these since they dont even look at the game fiona and fredo feel like 2 siblings just freaking each other out damn geoff and the frustrating gameplay id love to see trevor on the controls does geoff ever start pressing x for the documents listeni own so many mannequins this is not my game alfredo and fiona are slowly but surely cementing their place as the people we want to see be scared sorry but its fun to watch 3 parts in i cant take it anymore its a scary game and ive missed every scare thus far ive seen walking doors being opened and crouching thats what i call top notch entertainment i wonder what happens in this game i guess ill just have to play it myself if i actually want to see anything every time the screen turns gray get prepared to be chased give trevor the controller for the audiences sake trevor were in it spookedfiona were in the game 1441 shorty is unappealing in every way it can be frustrating watching geoff play but watching these people be scared is fantastic destroying pussy is an act of creationtrevor you absolute genius 1610 and at 5 fps no less they are currently filming the second season of castle rock now source i live in the the town they are filming in love these horror vids 1734 could also be a homage to the shining ballroom photograph the voice sounds like claw from inspector gadget but more like candyman from the movie candyman watch it its a treat hahahahahahahaa watching this at 330 and im crying the whole way literally nothing scary this entire time what the fuck you bunch of pussies this game is hella boring holy fuck she has gotten a lot better from when she first joined but it genuinely annoys me that fiona always seems to copy whatever someone else just said in almost every video shes in fiona you jumped first dont even ack like you didnt smh the deep voice is still tony todd does anything happen in this game alfredo and fiona sitting in the dark scaring each other till they shart 1611 the little jump scare you also see fiona jump way before everyone else but then she says alfredo jumped first and that scared her girl if you dont go somewhere damn it trevor i was literally thinking the same thing with the destroying that pussy comment literally every single part fiona and alfredo grab onto each other when they get scared its hilarious alfredo you scared me fiona no you scared me ive always loved watching yall play scarier games and this cast is amazing but im not quite a fan of such short videos and the abrupt endings to them i get that you can put out more of them in a shorter period of time by splitting up a longer video but i just really dont like the random cut offs at the end of each episode bet that the word on the chalk board says character god this game is shit as the boss trevor is very clearly aware that geoff walking backwards everywhere is not what the audience wants i thought geoff was some sort of a genius opening the vault i really dislike these chopped up videos would love more horror game lets plays watches with this crew alfredo and fionas reactions are gold why ya gada stap there i was getting really into it i even had my sabra hummus 1610 we checked the tapes fiona you are at fault 521 is that rap god this games not scary at all maybe ill see fiona and alfredo actually freak out by the end of this ffs geoff grow a pair and stop missing the jump scares honestly dont know why you play these games miss out in all the content material let trevor play this playthrough is dad and his kids play a horror game find the times for the spookiest below 232 304 geoff scare 323 small scare 855 small scare 1612 if geoff doesnt want to see anything then why is he playing trevor please play this instead of geoff nothinjg agasint him personally but id rather put my head in front of that canopn on the ship than watch him backwards crab crawl through another jump scare trevor oo we can be the captain me and i will draw the charts this is just the video of my four brain cells during a scary movie these are too short theyre like bad sex just as its getting good it comes to an abrupt end trevor stopping geoff from being a cowardly contentless piece of poop is a blessing i love you guys but i do actually want to see whats going on this game isnt half of what the original was how disappointing every time geoff turns around i tense up omf ok i love geoff but he is killing the content by avoiding the scares give the controller to trevor or better yet ryan i mean the summer is a hard time people want to call out for vacations its natural they served 3 portions over 7 sittings lol ive done the same when i had faymily coming over lets just call this the summer of other n i dont have a channel i dont have an digestions i dont say you unsubscribe just try something other do it while watching the next thing i eat mcdonalds all the time when im driving home but the mcrib only comes about sometimes they must have been like well trevor boi says smash that pussay at the 58 minute mark so naturally we need to cut these up into 20 min episodes so that episode 3 ends with him saying that the genuine fear in alfredos eyes is hilariously amazing i love this series so much oh my goodness thank you for putting alfredo and fiona and trevor and geoff in the scary game plays ahhhhh i love it so much i know geoff playing horror games is one of the classic ah memes and all but in all honesty geoff really does seem a lot braver now than the old days while playing this whether that be just from age or the possibility that he used to just put on an act and now feels he doesnt need to anymore since theyve got the real scaredycats alfredo and fiona who can say he really charges into some pretty sketchy situations now color me impressed jumpscares at 231 302 small 854 small 1611 yall the next part is terrifying i recommend watching it on the site even if my jumpscare list isnt there at what point does this become scary i was waiting for the flying dutchman to give us two gold doubloons i am really loving this series please do more horror games with this crew fiona is just kickin fredos asscall hr someone give trevor the controller please geoff has neither the spacial awareness nor the balls for this this game developer likes the creative types first a painter now an actor yet still a cowardly geoff next season of rob needs and ass first to danger easter egg for grif trevor said loop dee loop and pull that spongebobween reference just made my night trevor no you got to look geoff if i look im going to see it me yeah thats kinda the point so far nothing has happened the last two episodes fiona still sucks at this shit but this video was entertaining can we have trevor fiona or alfredo play alien isolation i think that would be greatly entertaining gotta say i am loving this new scare crew each one has a certain characteristic that balances out the party geoff the backwalker tries to avoid all scares by walking backwards fiona the fighter initially frightened but immediately puts hands in fighting position alfredo the dodger quickly backs up and bobs around trying to duck and weave through the fear trevor the pusher even though he jumps at the scares he is always first to chastise geoff for his backwalking and is always pushing to face scenes that are horrororiented keep this crew they are the mystery inc of rooster teeth ahh yes all this great content of a game being played off screen and all the points of interest ignored yeah destroying that pussy barbaras a lucky girl alfredo bringing up the grudge that is my childhood horror and im still afraid of her nobody trevor yeah destroying that pussy i just keep thinking about the first game and how the videos used to be longer if theyre just going to be this short from now on im going to watch someone else play through it theres plenty of youtubers who make longer videos and are doing just fine like jack septic eye not everyone wants to watch shorter videos some of us watch these videos to pass the time this game is not in the least bit scary so ive already watched this on the site but i still come watch it again here so they still get the views and so i can see at what points they choose to cut the parts i love that whoever edited this chose to cut right after trevors smashing that pussy their nerves must be absolutely shot play sometim scary this game baby stuff fiona is such a pussy lmfao that voice is candyman tony todd omfg another movie reference legit have no clue how geoff did that puzzle at 1120 lol did they play all of the first layers of fear unsure if theyll finish this game out for the channel condemned and condemned 2 are some of my favorite horror games you should play them on the channel pls get people that are funny in the video geoff is fine but every1 else is boring they should do a special play pals with trevor and alfredo playing horror games trevor being relatively calm and alfredo jumping at everything would be a good combination creeping assfirst into danger soo when did fredy and fiona become a thing geoff spent so long crouched that when he stood up i was confused as to how he got so tall jump scares time stamps and maybe spoilers idk 230 body flies up 320 light flashloud music 745 loud noise 851 loud noise 1610 chair falls 1830 minor geoff talking about gamerscore as if hes some sort of achievement hunter good job trevor if geoff missed that shining ref you guys would have never heard the end of it lol always loving geoff ass first into danger ramsey playing horror games can someone please tell fiona to sit there and shut the fuck up jesus this over acting cunt is more and more quickly ruining this companies content for me is this game going to get scary its had like 3 jump scares and nothing else at least the first game felt scary for a while until you start realizing nothing will actually happen to you freaking screw me a spider literally crawled on my arm at 1611 hey trevor long time fan love your work really miss game kids not really lol do you think we can get more longer form lets rolls on the rt site i understand youtube but i really love long form stuff like uno the movie i watch it once a week usually watch everything on rt first and then youtube the next day i wake up to an hour thief simulator and a new layers of fear god bless you guys i can almost die happy unless we get another gmodgune im actually terrified during this because i dont know whats coming next 445 trevor it just got colorblind so normal for him they didnt find the layers of fear 1 room im right there with the boo crew i hate horror games so ill wait for the comments with all the jumpscare timestamps love waking to geoff getting scared 231 nice job grif you broke the ladder uuuuuuh this is part 2 tho third comment send me a message and ill send you my resume there are a few ways i could be an asset for you all layers of fear was fantastic layers of fear 2 was fucking shit 430 i dont want to play this game anymore way hilarious xd no more walking simulators play a horror game like evil within 2 have you played observer what do you think about it can we also add that games that involve killing or harming animals in some way are not good i get so tired of games where you kill rats and dogs and other sweet critters is outlast 2 worth 20 what made amnesia work with the whole manually moving objects was that it was actually really fun throwing things around looking for loot it was one of the few respites in that game where you found a well lit room and could ransack the place looking for tinder oil and healing potions if looting the environment for resources is not going to be part of your game then do not bother with a system like this not only is this game incredibly boring incredibly pointless but the way its designed with small rooms and corridors is absolutely nauseating ive had to stop playing all two times i sat and played bc i was going to puke jim give me your top 5 top 10 if you feel like horror games to play in 2019 new or old for someone who is interested in the genre but hasnt really played any soma soma is amazing especially in harmless mode is boring same as first one did i just see a twist that amounts to uh spoilers i guess not that it matters it was fish the whole time midvideo alright then ill never understand the hype behind these pointless walking simulators absolutely loved this jimpression when are horror games going to learn that jump scares arent scary walking down a hallway trying every door isnt scary shit lighting isnt scary these types of things dont substitute for actual atmosphere and feeling unsettled like a truly good horror experience will give you and can we please stop having the i was the insane killer all along twist its never as much of a plot twist as developers think it is gotta love how youtube autocorrected the game title entry to fear 2 project origin d we need a kronberg pc game the player character is struggling and going mad with the fact that someone else is controlling his actions while the enemies break the 4th wall or friends get alienated by the strange behaviour of the pc while he struggles to gain his control back or tries to explain that he gets controlled indirect controls would be great too only he can hear you and you have to have him stop the apocalypse let him get ghastly body upgrades or we could get a comdemned 1 and 2 release in germany because we didnt yet but youtube says the game footage in this video is actually from fear 2 project origin from 2009 the fact that gun media had something to do with this cements ill never touch it there the most disgusting untalented game developers out there by miles look at that trash friday the 13th game they poisoned this industry with they need to go on a few development courses jim sterling supports censorship people that support censorship are the enemy of the youtube community the strength lof 2 lies in its brilliant introspective story and overall narrative if you were playing it for its deep gameplay mechanics then you re doing it wrong jimmy boy its probably like this because most of the team are working on blair witch which looks much more polished and superior than this chances are this is a reused version of the original layers of fear in order to acquire additional funding the first one was tedious and not scary i expected the second one to be similar and i expect blair witch to be as well however it might make sense for blair witch because the movie is also tedious and not scary massive zzz with layers of boo i agree with some of these points but disagree with others i can agree that it takes a couple of steps backwards like a few of the chase sequences being annoying the first few acts feeling a little overlong etc but i thought when this game did do well it did really well act iv for example as a whole i thought was great jim complains of this game beating the same drum over and over and thats true but at least it does it in various ways outlast for example although its a game i really like does all the same stuff throughout in exactly the same way so i thought that point definitely missed the mark layers of fear may not be for everyone but i quite like them wasnt a fan of layers of fear but absolutely loved bloobers scifi horror game observer i went and searched for the jimpressions vid on that only to find that there isnt one jim did you play it silent hill 2 is still the best horror game ever madethis shit isnt even a horror game its just boring game as you have a friend with gender dysphoria maybe you should have finished the game before calling the monster a formless pointless thing thats chases you now and again great review i really liked observer despite some issues that game had a cool story interesting characters good voice acting and unique visual styles so i know bloober team has talent but i thought layers 1 was boring and wont be playing this dear youtubersstop making all the videos 10 min an 2 seconds or near that to get more money its see through and greedy i loved amnesia at the time but come on this shit is so boring now not to mention no one has done it as well as amnesia did all those years ago its black and fucking white mate not the good god game black and white eitherand omfg the coins turned into fishruuuunnruuuuuuuuuunthe horror well some people like that style though i think having the ability to fight back but not wanting to because you have limited resources is a lot scarier than being forced to always run away games like this remove the added layer of fear of having to make a fightorflight decision and then having to deal with the consequences of it essentially how ive felt about horror games in a long while glad im not the only one as a fellow migraine sufferer i completely agree with not needing the game to give you one a lot of devs have forgotten that the player character doesnt have to be weak for horror to be effective you can have combat you can have platforming you can have rpg elements it doesnt have to be some idiot wandering around a house or somewhere looking for the next scare to happen just another layer of fear if you told me that blum house made this game i would believe you gd yeah gone home scared the crap outta me just on an environmental level at first more like slayers of fear because they killed the horror makes me wonder how the horror genre would have shifted if silent hills had been released so like playing a game with a hangover sort of a hangover simulator layers 3 will have zombies wont it lmao jim you said so much in the first 10 seconds of the video layers of slightly darker brown no thanks if you are actually looking for a good horror game just play darkwood though this was pretty fantastic but whatever formless pointless thing that chases you clearly didnt finish or at least understand the story which is excellent and if you read those pointless notes you might have actually got more out of it overdone is the laziest criticism ever the first game was such a bland experience once you realise theres no threat you no longer feel fear and thats a bit of a problem when your game is supposedly a horror and has fear in the title that ended very suddenly some people not me though really like this game and i hope we can all agree that its okay to like it and its also okay not to like it and maybe bloober team should continue making what they prefer instead of chasing trends the first game looked so nice which is why i watched the whole thing on youtube as a lets play this one just seems pretentious and hollow and now theyre doing the blair witch game yay jim has no taste in gaming more at 11 i enjoyed observer and layers of fear both from bloober team however i dont plan on getting layers of fear 2 just by calling it layers of fear 2 it shows the devs lack of imagination as from what i have seen it has nothing to do with the original game and they just couldnt come up with a name or wanted to play off from layers of fear good will i just hope they change it up and dont ruin the blair witch game they are working on damn jim why the hell are some reviewers calling it game of the year material cough pathologic 2 cough it baffles me that so many of these indie games try to do the pull open with the mouse thing even in amnesia it was pretty annoying at times why not just emulate how gothic 1 did it that was superb you hold a button to grab onto a chest then push upw wasd or arrow key to open simple and yet effective in representing a more effortful interaction and if you were able to play with a controller it might be something like hold rtr2 to grab the chest then use up on the left stick to open mouse interactive controls have always and probably always will feel completely awkward why because the mouse always controls the camera too so its janky and ends up fighting with the player why is this naught monet eyesd tis nut a inquisition dont expect any shakeups before frictional games next game thats the only company thats keeping this genre on life support ehhhh these fckn games pretty much the sum of game industry 20182019 i thought layers of fear was a pt ripoff even this video is boring i like the black and white look reminds me of episode 8 of twin peaks the return one of my favourite episodes of any tv show forget this garbo type of games silent hill needs to come back desperately dont take the wrong way but you cant play this kind of game with a controler seriusly km is the way and that goes for all the fph or for any fps for that matter agreed on the art choice clearly not for ppl that already has visual problems for my part im really happy with this game not the ending tou dammit jim we arent mainstreamers were gamers i other words fucking walk sim horrors hello all you putrid tulips growing in a field of broken dreams its a first person horror game on steam i actually like the visual art style quite a bit but all my other worries for the game based on what i didnt like in the first one seem to have happened again i really really really missed jim playing shitty games i had hojrs of entertainment having him play in the background while playing actual good games i am so sorry you did not like the game jim sterling by the way you totally forgot to mention that layers of fear 2 is an homage to literature and cinema it has all kind of nods to great movies such as seven twin peaks film noir the house that jack built metropolis wizard of ozetc this game is pretty much a tribute to film making you must not watch movies because you clearly did not notice anything or is that the cheap lip service you are referring to i felt the same way as you at the beginning however when i think about what i just saw joy crept in it is a masterful appreciation of film in the layers of fear 2 the layers refer to an actors character and not a painting you played the game again and still did not get it that jimmy carr laugh 3 im surprised you consider the first games lack of game over as a negative since them bringing a very clear game over is one of the things that i think makes this sequel so much worse in comparison the first one actually made chasing the monster and getting attacked not only part of the gameplay but part of the story that game banks on your instinct to run from the thing thats chasing you youre supposed to question why the monster doesnt give you a death screen in this one its just a hinderance everything on the channel has become so consistently negative its exhausting another video about crunch to follow shortly resident evil 2 came out earlier this year and was a fresh and original injection of life into the horror genre and it was a remake of a game more than twenty years old i remember when layers 1 came out and i was like oh this shows potential and could be real great if they expand on it in a sequel too bad they decided against the expanding part but jim black and white and brown are spooky and being chased by a spooky is spooky clearly this is true horror i was waiting for jim to show me the fear but seems like a boring walking simulator at least those usually have atmosphere this just feels boring what a shame i quite enjoyed the original id have said that it was a sequel that probably never needed to happen though id have rather the devs worked on a new idea entirely since we definitely need more horror games that stand on their own merit id seriously like to see this imaginary game that doesnt retread the same old horror tropes go onsomeone make it im fascinated or point me at one horror game since the first outlast thats done anything notably new with the genre i say this as a diehard horror fan im just tired of hearing about these nonexistent games that apparently discard all the tropes and do something genuinely new since i got a vr headset i only play horror games in vr now because it is just a way more better and intense experience i dont think they can make more horror games horror is very finite actually and weve been gradually used to anything at this point weve probably seen 95 of whats possible to make into horror most horror games today are just hard survival games that it unironically just the dark souls with a different ambience the only difference to minecraft is the visual presentation at best think about it the difference between resident evil and cod are quite small aside from rpg esque ressource conservation both are essentially action shooters except one startles you sometimes you can change the settings but its either gonna be a walking simulator with some puzzles or an action game its kinda sad that amnesia came out 9 years ago and penumbra came out 11 years ago and yet people still cant make a game in that style to at least that standard when your new and scary horror game is being outdone by something from almost a decade ago maybe consider trying a different genre what is there really left to innovate in the horror genre i dont exactly long for the good old days where a horror game just meant a moody shooter with jumpscares the only reason amnesia was innovative at all was because horror as a concept hadnt been treated with much competence up to that point the idea of a purely horror experience in a game was novel due to the scarcity of such games but what direction is left for the genre to take without devolving to retreads of previous ground and ground that takes us further from the horror experience at that paint by numbers horror game amirite you know i hate to be critical here but i guess the question im left with is fine its a retread its bog standard it does nothing to stand out the question still remains is it competent in its mediocrity i mean if you werent familiar with all the tropes would this be a good introduction to them many people dislike that mario platformers keep getting made since many of them retread very familiar and very wellworn territory but for the most part each one done very well they arent all classics but they also arent bad games now from your review im guessing the answer is no it doesnt look good in the footage but hearing you rail on it for being generic is a bit like railing on another plate of spaghetti ill take another plate of spaghetti as long as someone hasnt taken a shit in it i miss ur squirty plays and such boglinwatch 2019 do it will u be my friend when can we get some more squirty plays jimliscious dear lord bloober phoned this game the fuck in what a mess what in the name of shitfuck are those popup icons thank the gods for jim sterling i saw some lp of this and dear fucking god i was so bored there was literally nothing remotely scary there was literally nothing remotely interesting it was utterly dull tedious boring blandness yet the shitheels playing it kept screaming and jumping around as if they were on a rollercoaster it was so bad i couldnt watch more than like 30 minutes into the game before realizing i hated the people playing it and the game wasnt going to evolve more than just the same boring shit it was doing fear is like an onion the devs of this game made another game inbetween layers of fear 1 2 called observer and i thought it was fantastic a really awesome cyberpunk aesthetic and more to do than just walk around dark corridors waiting for things to scream at you while i feel like lof2 has some small modicum of merit to it i do feel like we need more horror games with measurable mechanical depth or at the very least if were gonna continue having games that emulate the frictionalspearheaded style they should at least emulate penumbra overture in that game you could actually fight back in a janky fashion you had an actual inventory and you had to manage your health and batteries basically we need fewer machines for pigs and more stuff like silent hill and resident evil bring survival back to horror maniquins have been overdone in horror games i wonder why lip service is something you might get at a truck stop nowadays and for some years now there are only two kinds of horror games third person action horror behind the shoulder re4 clones or first person stealth horror amnesia clones they need to make something different atmosphere is probably the most important aspect of a horror game if youre not immersed you cant be creeped out theres jumpscares but those dont actually scare you they startle you like if i snuck behind you and screamed in your ear its not scary its obnoxious waiting for something then a bit of running so basically this game is baseball football and arson gone home at first scared the hell out of me the idea of being in a house that seemed empty and threatening and this chick banging on like everything was ok when nothing indicated that was quite unnerving turns out it was a trite lesbian love story meh horror games need to learn that there are more types of fear and horror then forced helplessness i miss fatal frame and silent hill precisely because they were horror games that understood that and were legitimately terrifying sees title video begins with no commentary just gameplay dis gone b gud more than amnesia the dark descent starting the whole trend it also happens to be the actual best of the lot to this day soma is the only other truly worth a damn and that was made by the same people and more of an existential horror than the visceral game kind outlast had its moments but dropped the ball in too many respects do you remember that old internet browser game where you guide your mouse pointer through a labyrinth and then suddenly it just starts screaming and flashing pictures onto your screen yeah that is what modern horror games are every last one ah man i was looking forward to this coming out i loved the first one i love how so many horror games cant get horror right while a 2004s nonhorror game vampire the masquerade bloodlines got its own horror level amazingly spoton and yes i understand its technically easier to be spectacular at a short horror sequence rather than an entire game but im talking about the style bloodlines didnt use jumpscares instead relying on tension and underlying creeping sense of dread all over the sequence sad that many studios dont grasp that i dont even play horror games and even i can tell its just pt filtered through bendys ink machine crossed with insert boring walking simulator here good grief it feels like it went down the machine for pig route i want to love the game but i can not get into this game i am sad its also very unimaginative when companies just add the number 2 instead of thinking of a new title for a game ah controls thats one of the trends i really dont like in modern games having to hold a button when pressing it will do i think it came from the last of us but there was a reason for it then there was no true pause iirc you had to wait for the animation to play out so you couldnt craft in combat for example or stop and pick up an item if an enemy was coming for you somebody breaks the mold its successful so most people just copy it for years to come until someone else decides to try something new this is a tale as old as time with every single form of entertainment art think back the space shooter games of the atari age 3d platformers with animal mascots modern military shooters zombies indie puzzle platformers set in a dark world with a cute childlike character minecraft pokemon battle royale warcraft mobas diablo sandbox crafting survival thats never finished sandbox chaos games mobile games as a whole the list can go on on thats just games cant be disappointed when you expect mediocrity just have to wait for someone to do something different then get sick of that exactly what i thought about the first layers of fear i was surprised by positive reviews only to experience a dull coridor wanna be horror i guess reviews were written not by horror fans the game was so predictable and boring i had to slog through it just so i could delete it having experience it to the end devs clearly dont have any understanding of the genre their are making games in they should play soma and take some notes 16 times the jump scares another walking simulator just a reminder evil within is dead survival horror is pretty much dead jim you should start a band called audio visual nightmare think a more sexual judas priest im no expert lol but i kinda liked layers of fear loved how the rooms changed when you turned around it was a creepy house i never finished it always felt like i was having a heart attack trying to make it through the hallways gone home was scary because it didnt try a simple concept of being lonely is scary in itself layers seems to try to be scary it does things to scare you where not doing much and playing on a basic humananimal instinct would be enough im guessing the 73 dislikes were the devsassuming as many as 73 people worked on this boring as shit wasnt it dude seems more like this is a personal opinion rather than an objective one so glad someone said this all my fav youtubers are playing this rubbish excuse of a game clicked off so many videos because its art style is disgusting to watch not sure how it is when playing it yourself i really liked layers of fear but with the 2nd one its a real drab i 100 agree with you on this one jim chains of love layers of fear their last game observer was so much better sure chapters 810 were pretty cool but you have to go through some pretty dull fluff to get there theres no chapter select btw it just feels like a big step back coming off observer all in all its the 3rd game observer was also made from that studio and i must say i was nearly sleeping while playing observer while layers of fear was atleast somewhat interresting with the art and stuff falling out of the painting and so on but layers of fear 2 is a absolut horror and even more of a drag to play than observer and that is something i didnt thought would be possible also the story of layers of fear 2 was absolut useless the ending doesnt even give you a real ending only this or that or bad not a real or true ending wich confused the s out of me it is really the most boring horror game i have played the worthless flashlight with 30 seconds of battery is the worst overdone trope never figured out how game developers have no idea how flashlights work in real life it reminds me a lot of a machine for pigs lots of jump scares with out any teeth has it ever hit you that layers of fear 1 and 2 werent simply horror games but horror experiences kinda like haunted houses because i as someone who enjoys haunted houses in amusement parks i loved layers of fear 1 because when i played it i understood right away that this wasnt just simply another horror game like we play so often but more like a haunted house experience in which youre in for the atmosphere and the different creepy ideas on display jimpressions of deep rock galactic when 3 the game coloring give me enough of a headache that i decided to only listen to this video while looking at my desktop background i didnt like the first one either gonna give this a skip horror games need something new you could have gone with layers of oh dear what a missed opportunity jim jim sterling nice to hear your impressions did you play observer i have not found jimpressions for it i just started playing it and it is nice that is has some voice acting and a bits of a story as well as some dialog choices i played the first layer of fear i thought it was good just good it was hit and miss but i like the main theme lof2 im not really interested already with the observer the formula is a bit too familiar on the other hand some smaller studios want to figure out the magic formula and milk it like triiiiiple aaa industry often does bloober team is around 30 people they messed up with basement crawl but they reworked and relaunched the game free of charge for the basement crawl owners at least i give them credit for this i wish them well but i agree with you they should try to innovate a bit maybe instead of doing sequel try something new from what i heard the game is not selling that well has a pretty dumb name to boot honestly layers of fear who came up with that shit credit where its due those are really nice interaction icons would you say bloober team loves horror games the same way telltale games lovedkey word adventure games if only we knew what happen when devs release the same game over and over with no attempt to change anything so what other horror games you are looking forward to doesnt bode well for that blair witch game to me the biggest issue with layers of fear the first one anyway is that its title implies that its supposed to be frightening while its gameplay is weird walking simulator where things shift all the time i honestly dont think it is actually an horror game at all because it just works best when you go all hooo lookithat nice bizarre thing that just appeared this game is so bad there is nothing to do in it just walk around in a randomly changing environment you never know where you are what you need to do you just walk forward and sometimes you pick up items and solve a minimalist puzzle if you can even call combining 2 items together a puzzle and then you run away in an environment you never seen before not knowing where to run or when its over and then it just stop randomly because the room behind you changed with the monster in it i guess ill try and mention my horror game since it doesnt do the trope of you cant fight and you get a jump by loud noises every second i developed a game called frostbite deadly climate its basically re7 meets john carpenters the thing with a cold managing mechanic its completely free on steam and its coming to andriod very soon also im currently thinking and planning a sequel to the game psst enter the gungeon is free on the 3p1c store pssspssst you didnt hear this from me i thought layers of fear 1 was a decent game with an interesting narrative and a very solid atmosphere whether it conformed to tropes or not i just dont bitch about every single game to hear the sound of my own voice for a living so i suppose i give more games a chance yes i have layers of fear 1 on pc never beat it but it seemed quite good games like this are much cheaper and easier to make than re2 u just need some gay artists who make these boring levels and models and mybe and halfass programmer who makes those trigger based monster encounters more like scares appear 2 ill leave now snorror genre must die and be buried in an unmarked grave give me back my undying and silent hill 2 or at least dead space and blair witch or alone in the dark im so tired of ghosts in horror gamesmovies such a cheap way to get a jump scare since they have no logic they could be anywhere i really enjoyed the first layers of fear but it was the first horror game ive played through i have outlast and amnesia 1 2 in my backlog i should probably check out before this i know its no fun for you jim but man i so very much miss you playing being tortured by shitty games not that i like to see you tortured but man they are soo funny time to rewatch some old jimpressions and thank god for jim playing these shitty lackluster games so we shant waste our time jim you should play devotion its a much much better 1st person horror game compared to layers of fear 1 and 2 i think the re2 remake showed that you can have combat in a modern horror game and have it still be scary 756 i want to see a lets play with jim screaming at his television honestly i feel like horror games need to play around more with the idea of gameplay too many horror games try to scare you through intentionally awkwardhelpless characters who either cant fight back or fight back in a very awkward way like in resident evilsilent hill i want a horror game that has good engaging combat while still being scary its not like it cant happen just look at bloodborne excellent excellent excellent game with fantastic combat thats in essence at least part horror game i want more games like bloodborne i liked layers of fear 2 for its story and art design really incredible visuals some of my favorite in gaming in fact but it is not mechanically revolutionary in any respect but these are haunted houses and they dont try to sell themselves all that differently this game is kind of like jack sparrow in the later pirates of the caribbean movies creative risk and novel presentations are what makes things enjoyable not repeating something over and over again that was at one point a novel creative risk jim what would your ideal horror game be like you like bad games and hate good games lof1 wasnt scary lof2 isnt scary in a horror sense so if they arent horror theyre walking simulators walk sims are story based and imo both lof1 and 2 are average 610 walking sims just because the story is convoluted 250 what am i looking at is this zooscope animation odd i thought the art style was the one outstanding feature of the game but then i dont get migraine headaches the gameplay seems overall weak and the story stays nebulous for far too long and doesnt reach a particularly satisfying conclusion take away those and the art is about the only thing left i didnt play it myself but did watch a full playthrough of the steam version i wonder if theres a controller sensitivity issue with the ps4 since the footage here felt way more jarring and jerky than it ought to be either way my opinion on it is still thumbs down actually layerd of fear is one of the best games in the world httpsmyoutubecomwatchvb0fm2lrreg0 this is enough proof skip to 30 seconds mark for the magic to each his own i guess ive been waiting for this fad to die if you liked it i get it not taking trash on the trend but every horror game released was puking up this and only this i loved horror games but never liked this run and hide spin on it honestly if you want a fresh horror experience you need to play devotion by redcandlegames its so atmospheric and harrowing and the story is brilliant and brilliantly told this game has more movie horror references than actual horror not even kidding i am interested in observer from same company but have not credible info about so not yet alien isolation was infinitely scarier than amnesia and you got a fucking flamethrower i played layers of fear 1 the kind of horror is just so boring furniture moving cabinets opening turn around the room changed outlast now thats some fantastic horror which nearly killed me in real life i dont think it is completely accurate to compare layers of fear to amnesia and alienisolation it feels more like a narrative exploration or walking simulator if you like that term than a survival horror game theyre all just walking simulators anybody who actually says they enjoy them is a liar can you do more post mortems thanks alien isolation is still the king for me in these types of games and that is me being biased as i adore the alien franchise more than any normal person should lets be honest after playing prey very few games have jump scares that actually catch me off guard anymore i wonder what he thinks of the fact that these developers are working on the upcoming blair witch game xd speaking as someone who enjoys both games i think it has to do with two things mainly 1 that im simply able to meet the devs halfway conventional danger and death punishments arent there but that never bothered me its an interesting premise and im willing to get immersed enough to see where theyre going learning about the character and putting myself in their shoes allows me to understand the meaning and emotion behind whatever weirdness is going on mostly 2 i like slowly piecing together a narrative especially when the process has you constantly recontextualizing what youve seen and done before there are good story ideas in both games and i found it fun and interesting to figure them out i posted this as a response to a comment below but honestly i think i said it pretty well so i just copied and pasted waitwait wait i just thought of somethingare people hitting the dislike button cause they dont like the game or the video oo i love jims version of the jimmy carr laugh 929ish if your terrified of doing 180 and occasional 360 turns then this game may be to much for you maybe they were trying to avoid what i call the outlast effect where you die so many times trying to do shit that death loses all its meaning i dunno just a guess fear of the unknown is terryfying thats what layer of fear 2 is mustve played a diff game then me cos yeah grumbling noises and using shadows to play tricks on mind is way scarier than i can shoot this horrific looking thing and it wont die or oh look crazy people like most horror amnesia was only popular because of pewdiepie just like so many other shit games that got popular in the past nobody gave a shit about the penumbra series before either and that was exactly like amnesia that mechanic of rooms changing when you turn around was really bloody awesome in the first one that gave me like a strange split second of dizziness because it was trippy but they really overused it to the point where do a twirl solved like 810 obstacles you know what i think should make a comeback horror games with tank controls and fixed camera angles yeah everyone complains about them but only because most of the time theyre done terribly if remake being on just about everything and selling well is any indication i think we could stand to have a few new games where thats a thing it is the kind of game for me how did the first one ever get a sequel its so dull why isnt this video titled layers of sheer poo jim its a waste of a good pun at least i think it is i miss the good ol days of horror and by that i mean when steam memelight was still around and everyone thought horror involved key hunting and cheap jumpscares oh and by missing it i mean i loved jims realtime criticisms of said games because it made them far more entertaining than the games themselves could ever hope to me im a jackass after observer i thought they were gonna get a lot better because that game was great layers of fear was fun to play with friends but not much more than that so then observer surprised me and i was hoping the devs would just keep getting better but i guess not listens to jims monologue starts looking around room for a wheel a cheap jumpscare doesnt stick with you it startles you then you immediately get annoyed by it a good scare lingers with you it fits the atmosphere you feel tense like it is hiding around every corner waiting to come for you again i wonder if jim knows about observer i personally find it to be a far superior horror game than lof2 layers of jim alright alright ill see myself out they should make lawyers of fear next now that would be scary i liked the trippy visuals of the first game but thats about all i can say layers of meh i loved layers of fear 1 i enjoyed the crazy artist story it was scary at times but lof2 was soo boring i was disappointed they didnt take it in a different direction especially when you think you can hide behind a fence and then the fence blows up fucking hell this looks like a chore to play after playing layers of fear 2 i think it should be renamed to layers of feel because the game isnt that scary but i really liked the story i loved layers of fear it was interesting but this one bloody hell im watching scary game squad playing and its so boring its really disappointing because i adored observer and the first one feels like the constant need to reinvent the wheel for every game hurts many of them just look at the final fantasy series layers of fear continues to prove that it is still a mediocre amnesia ripoff its a shame the first one was quite a beautiful rollercoaster type game and i do agree with absolutely everything described here but if theres not even that i dont see the point either so i guess you could say layers of fear 2 is paint by numbers i hated and never finished the first one and i got it for free they did get observer right at least its one of my favorite games of this generation it really seems like these devs reached their peak with oserver and is gonna be hard for them to top it jim sterling if you like amnesia youll definitely like soma its by the same studiofrictional games and mixes scifi with horror another game you dont like eh jim colour me surprised i always treated the original game as more of a haunted house if this is more haunted house then im sure ill still enjoy it if something is chasing me in the haunted house and preventing me from absorbing and appreciation my surroundings then this may not fit its intended propose i have other games for that theres a point where it sounds like jim says laser fear and that sounds like a more interesting game i dont like layers of fear because its not even scary its just a walking simulator if you want to play a good game play soma still one of the best also the lore is amazing this game may very well replace ambien yeahnever found layers of fear to be engaging enoughfelt like a wannabe pt and you know there were dozens of games like that at the time observer was better it just lacked gameplay to make me wanna play through it againshame as i reckon these guys could make a epic game if they just concentrated on making their projects a bit more gameywith things to do and interact with opening doors and drawers isnt enough for me edit best horror like game ive played recently was 2darkhighly recommend for people wanting something adult the complaint about the controls is only because you were playing with a controller instead of mousekeyboard most of these horrorgames well they are actually scary storygames rather then traditional horror are designed for mousekeyboard first because its already such a niche thing that they dont even bother with good controller controls so if anything it has a shit support for that but the controls themselfs are perfectly fine at least thats how i see it the first layers of fear was a lot better and the story it told was clear again modern horror games like this are storygames with horrorelements not real horror so it didnt have to reinvent the wheal to stick out why is it literally everyone in horror games has an army of mannequins in their houses i cant recall a single horror game that didnt ya know its not even a horro game but ddlc was the last game the made my skin crawl was ddlc though if you havent checked out observation yet or stories untold yet then i would highly recommend that where the good skin crawly shit is goin on shit games like layers of fear get sequels and people praise them despite being boring buggy messes but great games like kholat just get lost in time and forgotten about by everyone personally i hated games like this where there is literally no combat alien isolation had some weaponry which made it into some fps amensia was just annoyingly hiding in corners which half the time i got fed up waiting generally i agree but soma was so great for me i happily take 10 other somas but this aint it isnt all horror the same though i mean they are the base of all games and media horror movies are easy to write same as horror games they rely on very little in the way of skill or craft i stand by the fact that horror is a trashy genre it is like science fiction those genres are way too pigeonholed very little transcends them why is this the only scifi games that transcend the genre are games that arent sciencefiction but a normal game set in a science fiction backdrop for example i dont like horror games so wont ever enjoy resident evil 7 i hate fantasy games yet love witcher 3 i hate magic fantasy see other genres can be transcended horror cannot as it isnt a setting but a feeling and a psychological place just wait for death stranding i am sure you will be all over that hot mess even though it has taken this long to get fuck all and that kojima is kinda showing why mgs got so dumb and fucking pathetic it also show tha didnt like any of the amnesia games layers of fear and of course not layers od fear 2 amnesia is terrible i found layers of fear way more interesting this genre is just sooo overdone by this point devs are experts in finding genres that are easy to make but still generates lot of sales and then that niche gets milked to oblivion its like with the br survival and moba genres why make something ambitious and innovative when you can just stick to something thats inexpensive straightforward to make and works its so extremely lazy and unimaginative just like the rest of this whole industry ive said this before but this industry is a massive bubble that will burst in like 5ish years the amount of games released that are literally filler rereleases and completely unnecessary must be at some sort of record high right now the oversaturation is insane when i started playing this game i turned every corner very carefully door locked deadly afraid to look behind me 3 hours in and i was just running around every corner because nothing this game did was scary it seems like they put you in a scary environment and then forgot to add any scary events the monster was piss poor as well it was slightly frightening the first time you saw it but i soon found out that getting a game over in a game like this is a failure of the game designer the only reason this game is scary is because its a fear of the unknown the moment you die and have to repeat the section every bit of fear is stripped away and it becomes an unfun semipuzzle game i miss the steam direct videos jim originality is precisely the point for me layers of fear 1 and 2 look and feel like one of the numerous games capitalizing on the vacuum pt left behind not saying these games are necessarily bad or uninspired but for that reason they dont appeal to me at all soma and observer on the other hand hooked me with unique premises and didnt fail to deliver ive also recently played through darkwood and that was a great ride with some memorable moments and a truely particular feel to it other than that my favorite and most intense moments of psychological horror that derives from atmosphere in recent memory were in hellblade senuas sacrifice also 756 youre welcome so glad to finally find someone who has some real criticism of this game and series as a whole i did not like the first lof great aesthetic but boring af and predictable and i could not get into lof2 either i was watching a playthrough of the second no way i was going to buy it based on the first and just couldnt get past the first half an hour i just do not like this kind of horror because its not horror whatever the story was i couldnt get into it i wish these games were better too its frustrating lof is fabricated horror trying to be but not i think lof would deeply benefit from nuanced horror it tries to accomplish but fails it feels like they are trying too hard a lot of the time of course this game lacks gameplay which hurts it too and its just a rehash of the first maybe if they make a third itll be what the first two couldve and shouldve where is jim from like the first one ill play it for the awesome aesthetics not expecting a good game its okay its fine i actually like the fact that the original layers of fear had no literal game over but had you instead constantly unsure of whether the monster getting you was actually setting you back or just pushing you somewhere else or actually progressing you of course thats a tricky ruse to pull off but needless to say i think just going ahhh oh no a monster have a really linear chase sequence to run away or else youll have to do it again is a definite downgrade amnesia jim it started out way before that with the penumbra series we need a new or remake of condemned to happen its been too long i hope the blair witch game is good lof i didnt like lof2 is supposedly bad observer was good at certain points but some of the dream sequences were pretty lame god why wasnt this observer 2 what a waste how did you feel about observer layers of fear was boring layers of fear 2 is just as boring makes me wonder how blair witch is gonna turn out im a huge fan of old horror films in black and white mostly because of how shadows are created with that medium this is horse shit compared to those films if youre going to make a game pretty much in black and white after i spend 750 usd on a graphics card make something about that tradeoff worth it i think its ironic how the only way to find these amnesia clones including amnesia 2 would be to have an actual amnesia and forget that amnesia ever existed cause its all the same at least resident evil clones were fun to play most of the time i did enjoy that old evil dead resident evil ripoff it sounds like youre saying laser fear which sounds like a better game bloober games arent scary theyre just flashing lights and loud noises theyre annoying these first person horror games would be better if they were in vr on a tv they are not scary loud noises always make me jump but it stops there all it does is cure hiccups its not scary its a natural reaction this game looks like itd give me really bad motion sickness which i guess might be their intention definitely avoiding this one d thanks jim visually the art direction of this game looks brilliant beautiful horror nightmare very artsy i would play it just to look at the weird esthetics it has going for it i gotta say i disagree a lot i loved the first layers of fear and i found outlast a bloody chore and a boring one at that not scared in any part of that game the thing i do agree on is that alien isolation is indeed absolutely great i guess horror might be a very subjective genre i agree with jim 100 and in before this review i always thought this was an overhyped overated and boring walking simulator 2019 i heard the devs from this game are making that blair witch game too just to pay lip service he said while collecting lips item this is how good editing works kinda reminds me of bendy and the ink machine im so startled right now layers of rear end yeah i tried to play layers of fear 2 i just couldnt finish it i got bored which is not a good thing in a game ever let alone in a horror game and it really is a shame because i feel that i kind of had an interesting premise but it failed to make anything of it the story was just all over the place there was no focus and the levels were too god damn long like the developers didnt trust the players to figure out the story and the symbolism from small amount of hints and decided to hammer it down so long that the player doesnt care anymore disappointment describes my feelings towards this as well i really wanted to like this i wanted to be spooked but no i got boredom and frustration the first one was an absolute dumpster fire of shitty horror tropes and zero story how and why the fuck did they make a second one we need a suspiria of horror games i always liked soma in this genre though it couldve used some more actual gameplay i wish silent hills hadnt died pt was incredible that would have shifted things from jump scares and bad door handles to something more interesting instead were stuck in a post outlast loop with nothing original happening in horror layers of fear is one of the most formulaic predictable boring non scary horror game ive ever seen that is made by an actual big studio its depressing that it got such high praise by children and now theres a second one that looks just as boring saw clips your latest bethesda video on angry joe nice crossover intentional or otherwisw i remember several years back there were this flash browser horror games they were basically your escape the room kind of games but you had to go around and trigger different spoooooooky scenes before you could progress the story they were fun 2040 minutes time wasters that had interesting stories and spooooooooky vibe to it they had some jumpscares but they didnt rely on them for you to be spooked the whole ambiance and feel of them was quite good and well written layers of fear since its first instance always felt like that idea but stretched out to the point where its not appealing to play it anymore the nature of a flash browser game made it so that the story was condensed trimmed of all unnecessary things everything had to be there for a reason because otherwise it would be bloated with stuff and it would not be a good flash browser game this series is just that bloated to the point where i dont really care about the mystery or the st layers of faeces nothing will ever touch resi evil 7 in vr now that is a fucking horrifying experience and honestly im over this whole its just in his head thing this whole this game is just his inner horrors i dont even know who started it the first one i remember was cry of fear but by now every horror game later turns out to have just been in your head and there was no real horror and all the monsters and everything was just his inner demons and all that bla yeah that was a suprising twist the first or second time but now i find myself pleasantly suprised when for once monsters in a game actually are monsters that try to kill you for real in a world with monsters who are not imaginary i miss that kind of horror game when it was just theres something trying to kill you now its all look what a edgy story i can tell and all the cool monsters that represent depressions i came up with i saw some people praising this game so i can only imagine its the first horror game theyve ever played best of this genre to me is still soma and alien isolation ive heard many times that its impossible to feel scaredintimidated if the game hands you a weapon and that might be true in some cases but i still cant play the first dead space to completion because the sheer tension and the presence of twitchers is too much there are people who scoff at dead space being scary because its just a bunch of squiggly monsters and there are people who scoff at the dark descent being scary but its all bloody subjective and the idea that only games where the protagonist is helpless can be scary is not the message devs should internalise how the tensiondreadhorror is presented and built up matters way more than if the player has a gun because they should feel uneasy even if they are armed if youre going to go by the books thats fine but then you have no excuse if the game is awful you had the book and you read it backwards layers of knob 2 layers of fear more like layers of queer ecksdee ill see myself out now alien isolation is my favourite horror game played it through4 times and still love it now excuse me while i continue punching the wall over alien blackout being a mobile game i adore the first layers of fear for its story disturbing imagery and then sense that the very fabric of reality is fucking with you this game however became my first ever steam refund the lack of good horror is simply terrifying yuk yuk 928 jimmy carr has arrived layers of fear 1 was a great game in my opinion it clicked with me the story the atmosphere even the lack of a threat worked on me because i kept expecting oh something is going to appear suddenly behind the next corner surely i didnt know it wouldnt when i first played it so it worked layers of fear 2 is just a disaster in every single way i played first two acts myself and got sooooo bored that i decided to watch the rest of the game on youtube because playing lof2 felt like a chore lucky for me my favorite youtube gamer played the game on his channel his videos are enjoyable even when the game is trash all thanks to his amazing commentary not for this game watching the last 3 chapters of the game felt like a huge chore even via that method i loved the first one one of the few horror games that was intense but also intense to exhaustion though the cyberpunkhorror observer from the same devs actually starring rutger hauer is very good though idk jim complains about the contextual interaction for objects that always feels awkward but i felt they were extremely well done in alien isolation turning torque bars and pulling twohanded switches using both sticks on the controller felt very natural i liked the first layers of fear a lot the atmosphere and sound was so good it was more an experience then a game but dude it gave me those old school re and silent hill creeps so i could only play like an hour at a time i totally immerse in a game like this pitch black room big sound sealing headphones damn it was a great game i am working on a horror game at the moment its not going to be finished for a while but i hope i can do a good job on it i dont have the resources of layers of fear or re2 but i hope i can make something that comes out well once its finished no microtransactions and a single player campaign by the way as it should be we need to make a free horror game history and theory class where we just slap them with a stick called creativity while showing a slide show of derivative tright shit games spoiler but who cares the blatant ripping off or homage as im sure the developers want it to be known of scenes from se7en is fucking embarassing i dont know if they completely ran out of ideas for how to pad this game for time or what but ive never been angriermore annoyed with imagery in a game and thats not even counting that nonsensical utterly obtuse dialogue all over the place these games are basically made just for preteens to laugh at youtubers reacting to them they seem to have no other real use it was a boring game i couldnt even watch lps ive completed layers 1 and 2 the first one was alright creepy mildly scary decent story with a few jumpscares but the sequel while still feeling creepy just fell flat in every other department the developers dropped the ball they had the ingredients from the first game to make a great horror sequel but blew it i think a 3rd layers game will happen but they really need to try harder next time around i always hit mute when that everyone is thinking bout me rolls check yourself im shifting from you to yon yea as my favorite critic idea to shake up the genre you start with a gun this gun can kill things trying to kill you then you run out of bullets now your fucked run and hide while hiding you find some bullets like 3 of them with 4 things chasing you idk just an idea its time to come back to janky japanese survival horror games i want weird tanky controls stilted badly translated dubs and things so fucked up i will never forget them fuck you konami we almost got the re 7 treatment for silent hill you greedy pricks alien isolation is my horror game of choice such an underrated game so its just meh oh well at least i can laugh at the people who still scream while playing these games im pretty sure thats why these games exist as lets play fodder for youtube i mean was anyone desperate for a sequel to the first one thank god for jim sterling i scared myself at 425 jesus bloober team are the same people working on blair witch lets hope thats better just to play devils advocate many indie films follow the horror themes as well and dont expect to be critical darlings but to make a film they like to make why should this be any different for indie game studios not everything needs to be a genredefining entry they most certainly built this series as an interactive horror walking sim it most certainly isnt for everybody but i dont think that is a case for it not to exist somebody probably will enjoy it layers of mediocrity i wonder if theres any real way to innovate the horror game genre anymore you can certainly still make very good ones of course but its all variations of what were all familiar with why is so much of it black and white somebody watched a certain episode of black mirror too many times the best horror game is clive barkers undying its so creepy and is original unreal engine but intense and a fun game it scared me a lot i havent played it in a while but its one of the best experiences ive had haha the loading doors also piss me off i loved the 1st one and id expect nothing more than more of the same it is the same series if you dont like the 1st one dont expect to like this one jim you should try and give a few good games a spotlight everybodys pointing out issues in the game industry but nobodys pointing out the good games in the industry and helping them rise above the mountain of shitty games edit almost forgot thank god for you jim 123 ffs sake jim im eating amnesia is the half life of horror games overrated beyond any reasonable measure on topic of the video not every game needs to reinvent the wheel layers of fear 2 is solid and its perfect in what it tries to be i knew exactly what i was getting into when i bought it namely a walking simulator that lives off its incredibly tight atmosphere i neither expected nor needed it to push the boundaries of horror games monstrums pretty good and im told monstrum 2 is on the way also pathologic 2 hype dont worry jim im in preproduction of a horror game of my own callback to this comment if i ever manage to go through with it layers of oh dear makes for a better title than layers of fear jump scares are to horror what fart jokes are to comedy lazy writing layers of im glad im playing anything other than this did you play ff7 remake at e3 i heard it was godlike sheriko comentocracy please jim im not angry just disappointed sterling the door only opens after youve walked away once is such a game design faux pas such a blatant way to break immersion by making it glaringly obvious for your player that they are playing a game designed around various triggers i loved layers of fearjumped in when it was in xbox game preview and have beaten it about 5 times across xbox n ps4 im just about to download it on xbox one x fuck you sterlingim still buying it lol if its shit ill just cry about wasting 25 the only versions of this recently that were worth playing were soma which made up for utterly formulaic gameplay with a genuinely compelling narrative and strong use of its setting and themes and observation for offering a major shakeup to the entire gameplay mechanics on top of a solid scifi spook bit near the end of the vid where you can move a mouth drawing to altr the world seems like it has some potential its one feeling to never have control its another to feel as if you do just to have it torn away or to be shown why it cant save you maybe even why it isnt so safe itself give players a bastion of hope a light out on the horizon and snuff it out or latch it to an angler fish rage 1 is truly forgettable pin me to the ground daddy jim is anyone else having trouble playing forza horizon 4 on xbox game pass for pc outlast didnt do anything well fight me vampire the masquerade bloodlines ocean hotel level is better than this i guess in the gaming industry playing it safe is the second worst option it is more of the same but i love the mystery of its surreal story and its gorgeous visuals id only like more gameplay variety and more choices and endings for the player to explore and as far as glitches and bugs i didnt experience any on the xbox one version thank god for you huh theres a second one of this the only thing i remember about the first one is the slomo baby crash into the wall part i never really understood why so many people raving about this game when the first one came out its so meh layers of fear has one trick and thats to make thing change behind you by the end of the game i was just spinning in circles to keep things moving seriously the developers seem to have a fetish for 180 horror spooks everybody ready for fallout 76 batteroyal play pathologic 2 you coward v the best horror game i played is darkwood best atmosphere and hopeless world ever and it just came out on the switch ps4 and xbone edit if i can convince anybody to try it im happy if you dont have the money the dev team acid wizards put out a torrent of version 10 that can be found easily just buy it then if you liked it more like layers of shite amirite good morning jim would you like to hear about st louis lord and savior jordan binnington i played about 10 mins when you know a game is shit in the first 10 min you know you just threw money in the toilet and flushed waitthere is a 2 of this all hail jim sterling son the saviour of the gaming industry edit oh and thank god for himlol i just watch your videos to hear you say triple aaaaaaay 2 comments it says no comments shown okay youtube your drunk go home its layers of something alright i dont know what but it is indeed something its what you were expecting and nothing else third c mi freak show command 3 appreciate you playing this like a human instead of the lets players who exaggerate and put an act on with screaming constantly for views i bet the thing that was chasing in the hunt is that doll you picked up after getting the key for the childrens room or maybe not im just guessing delerious didnt realize the fruit was from the first layers of fear it looks like the ghost at 2108 was going down the well

first first first first firs first yay frist hahaha omg my boyfriend and i say the same thing when we r hungieesss hungieeeee was that a new collectible poster at 11202 edit it sure was yeah that fear ladder jumpscare always get me bad xd its odd how an action game can be so goddamn scary ok the part with the dog was that the director was telling you to keep fighting instinct over reason giving in goes against the directors wishes so it resets you hoping that youll choose to fight rather than give up its similar to the situation where you either shot the guy or girl by the way that choice actually determines whether you play the rest of the game as lily or james and the part where your avoiding the flames is when james and lily were hiding in the boiler room when sailors came looking for stowaways haha the dog barking made all the dogs in my building bark too xd finally someone not rushing through this game you sir are a wondrous being aww seeing you and max kiss was so cute that ship with the kids drawing looks like the ship from little nightmares to me no one else has said that you and your husband are so adorable i just had to say it is it just me or does everyone expect to have the mannequins follow you when your back is turned aww you and your hubby are adorable this game is crazy lol but cool i like it am i the only one who thought how the hell is there mud on a boat the well looks more like its well with the ladder and ropes on it me and my wife guess the actor is the boy as a older guy he eat his sister and are now tormented could be wrong love your videos keep it up looking forward to the next are we not going to talk about that killing joke you and max are way too cute you and your husband are beautiful i love all of the movie references in this game like the alien one in this chapter with the monster coming out of the mannequins middle and the vent crawling please upload more of the plague of innocence 3730 stahhhp it kravintoo cuteee no please dont stop love watching your channel plus u r so god damn cute sorry max you and your husband warm my heart so cute hi max i am getting a lot of metropolis vibes you guys the cutest when max show up such a suprise relief and pause cause i spooked out ahah always glad to see a new upload from you my dude as a straight guy here for the gaming it always warms my heart when i see you and hubby take care toby oh haha just reached the end looking forward to tomorrows episode i think the mechanical scene that starts roughly at 24 minutes in is a reference to metropolis with the mannequins at the machines thank you for uploading this series ive been watching you for quite a while now and i just wanted to say you are hands down one of my favorite youtubers top 5 easily youre entertaining youre not a shouter youre smart i love how you really pay attention to storylines and try to piece stuff together as you go on you are kind enough to invite us into pieces of your real life and include wholesome content with your husband and youre absolutely my goto horror guy it baffles me that you dont have a larger following because you deserve it thank you for the content and thanks a million for being you love this game so far did you decide to finish a plague tale innocence off camera ah man been wanting for this all day hahaha im glad too max show uplong time no seehope one day you and husband play a game together or qathanks live game i was so excited after watching you play the first act i tried to watch a live stream play through with no commentary of the rest i was dying to know what happened next but the whole time i was just confused as to what was going on and why i just gave up watching it i will never skip ahead again watching this second video confirmed that for me your commentary and thoroughness makes it so much better and i now understand what happened in act 2 you are worth the wait kravin holy crap this game scares me shitless its soo good and i love your gameplay kravin youre the only one ill watch play this beautiful gem what if youre just on a movie set and the characters mind has gotten in character so much he believes its a real ship as his mind further warps omg please finish plague of innocence i cant wait any longer hi max we love you kravin you are a priceless treasure thank you for being you i should be sleeping but will watch this instead i absolutely refuse to watch anyone else play this game mr kravin you are my favorite youtube gamer period much love from germany thanks for uploading a new video im early are you going to finish plague of innocence youre awesome i love and enjoy and like your videos that you make for us to watch on youtube mrkravin tyler is a wimp grow some balls and play the game bitch screams are annoying as hell effin punk bro tyler1 wasnt even phased by the jump scare he just hated the door loltyler is an incredibly annoying being wasnt this video uploaded already tyler scream my ear bleed 056 that scream tho close the door yo i feel bad for teo since he played welcome to the game 2 xd i think its just a pretentious game that tries to make you think there is some deeper meaning to it but theres just confusion and bullsiht i love trippy stories but this just doesnt make any sense but not horror yo make more vids like this man theyre hella entertaining confusing meaningless hey man id like to discuss some business with you 5306 wow i made the same comment two months ago okay how did you guys even get this ending like seriously half of the time you ended up accidentally doing the opposite of what you wanted guys this is such a hard ending wtf honestly i this is probably my favorite game after that it is little nightmares you guys should do a gt live video of little nightmares you should do a theory now all i need is a play through of layers of fear 2 and im happy i see that you have redecorated i dont like it can you play nancy drew and the ghost of thorton mansion peepachoo he is fearless and there for powerful i keep choking on my grapes this houses remind me of luigis mansion dark moons treacherous mansion is it bad that i laughed at the baby with mat pat nah fam its not that he wanted to bring them back through his art really he wanted a second chance we saw in the first part of the game that he viewed her as a piece of art the most beautiful piece hed ever seen that was his way of saying that he was smitten by her that they ended up getting married fast forward a few years and he gets so engrossed in his work that he puts it before his family during another sleepless night working on a painting in his drowsed state he knocks over a candle setting the house on fire being so exhausted from pushing himself to hard the flames engulf the house and much of his wife desperate to get his beautiful art piece back he begs doctors time and time again to do the skin grafting procedure when none take the case the artist protagonist decides to attempt it himself his wife dies in the procedure then child protective services or the time period equivalent comes to try taking his daughter away he fights tooth and nail for the wait its j smiths safe joseph smith this game is blasphemous to the lds church i swam the 100 fly too it was my favorite event since i basically taught myself how to do the fly still can do it to this day 8 years later and no longer swimming competitively and i still love swimming it i once accidentally walked into the boys bedroom and it was cleaner than the girls um was i the only one who saw a fish at 4304 wow ive watched 4 other playthroughs with other major youtubers and these two were the only ones that understood the symbolism enough to get the good ending their first run thats awesome nice job pixar geris game you can talk to snakes all horror games are people trapped in purgatory have they played the og doom or duke nukem the game theory of minesweeper scary games resident evil 7 imscared system

koudelka enemy zero the thing nocturne alien vs predator 2 silent hill 3 doom 3 zombie vikings severed cursed cast 900th comment ik this 2 years old but watching that baby hit that wall at 10634 seriously made my day they missed so much and so many scares some of the best in the game the code for the safe was 40 i figured the code out before they did at 10633 i dont know whats funnier the bonk or their reaction i loved how pat made the baby doll die like 4 times thats only bc i hate dolls 10029 doesnt anyone see that little girl at the right bottom corner or is it just me every time they mention the stream talking about ratpat it makes me think of how theres a pokemon called patrat lol june 9th is from dhims i being a young person would not have know how to use that phone that jump scare around 12800 was so scary the video glitches ever second of the video i was wondering if you ever played the dlc for this game in the dlc you play as the daughter now an adult returning to the house to reflect on thoughts of her parents both this game and the dlc have three possible ending each also that wasnt a rat skin hanging on the wall it was just an ornate wallmounted sink and faucet that turns on when you interact with it just like the one you interacted with a little later and i cant help but wonder why you didnt have a reflection ive watched others play this and they had a blurry but clearly male reflection loved this game the atmosphere was great it definitely exceeded my first expectations of a haunted picture in a haunted house with random jump scares and follow the plot of dorian graybut this was so incredible by the way great job on the ocd achievement i wouldve done the same thing i loved the manuscripts everywhere with the paintings that pieced together the story almost wanted it to become a movie but that would take away the fun of exploring another incredible horror game ps i love it when you sing pss can someone please come clean this house and put all the books and papers on a shelf maybe i gotta be black i know what i want the japanese term for answering a phone or actually answering anything where you can not see the other person is mushi mushi which in modern terminology has no meaning but in traditional terminology literally meant roughly are you human the proper usage of the term was to literally call out to the caller mushi mushi and the other person would respond in kind mushi mushi back signifying that they were in fact human the reason why this happened is in traditional japanese culture it was believed that spirits oni and more so the kitsune trickster fox spirits could not actually properly pronounce or say the phrase mushi mushi oh you think thats scary well you try face your fears tickle me elmo is terrifying these flying checkerboards reminded me soo of tabletopsimulator i think after he saw what his wife did to his paintings he stabed his wife and idk about his daughter i love how theyre more mad at him critiquing his childs artwork than him actually murdering people its actually really sweet theyre going to be amazing parents 21200 its the guy from hannibal lector silence of the lambs 4000 funny how they forget the guy has a prosthetic leg hey matpat i think the character is in fact using his own blood to paint with when i played through this game i found out that he most likely had schizophrenia and had musophobia i will admit though i did spent at least 80 of my time reading every piece of paper or article i could get my hands on i realize that the game is very different for everyone who plays it what with the butterfly effect and all but the character displays many many of the symptoms of schizophrenia also there is a paper somewhere in the house that alludes to it i realized that is is not the story of a man who sold his soul to the devil for his wife but rather the story of a man who was pushed to insanity over time having to care for is wife a woman torn apart by the fact that she was disfigured by fire effectively killing her career but you know thats just a theory a very scary game theory thanks for reading ps this is an amazing play through and has gotten me through many all night stud cant understand play the dlc that scary games makes camera blue and black so scary i thought the teddy bears on her sweater were pieces of cheese like this at first and now i want a sweater just like that but with cheese considering all the hints you guys missed im surprised you got the good ending color me impressed the we just got a letter song they sang is basically the plot of silent hill 2 i should not be watching this at 1 am 949 stephs reaction to the door i love the fact that after while they just forgot the fact that june 9th was the wedding day oh no its fredbear hes here hes there hes everywhere lol hilarious no fairu got the best and hardest ending to get on your first try so clap and a half to you guys also that was the best ending and the ending that most people get is worse and involves not only burning the paintings like that one but instead of burning urself with it you try again and again reliving the nightmare of making the painting over and over until i guess u realize the mistakes u made and u cant bring them back a vile man obsessed with vanity his paintings do not love him a broken man filled with regret in vain suicide he wont join them when they walked into the area that said restless memories i thought it said wrestle mania i started reciting aloud to myself in my room wrestle mania hell in a cell cage match whatcha gonna do brother when the hulkamania runs wild on you yes ive had a little drinky drink i like how matthew laughed at the baby running into the cabinet hes going to be a great father he surely started the fire he burned his he ruined her whole life i had 3d glasses on hand and it kina worked xd they only found hlaf of the jumpscare parts in this game x today i learned matpat is bad at line puzzles lol sometimes steph could use a mute button i like her but gawwwddddd please stop talking for a bit steph stop jumpscare me mat pat you kinda deserve this hes here hes there hes everywhere who ya gonna call psychic friend fredbear yay you guys got the good ending the most satisfying ending the other one just puts you in an endless loop of trying to move on well done guys when you watch the video not live so you cant scream at them where things are ik im a couple years late but who are we dido my theory is that he says its a lie because his wife was burned almost beyond recognition yet he continued to paint her as she was he became obsessed with the painted version of her leading her to commit suicide peepachu is scared for life so he shows no emotionpoor peepachu 5230 upon second viewing of this scene i may have seen a child watching through that damn window ghost baby nooo 2713 abandon all hope ye who enter here according to dantes inferno thats the inscription above the gates of hell 10554 im lefthanded go left steph 2018 first protip btw oh my god im lefthanded as well not really important still pretty funny 3427 ocarina of time anyone tell me once you got it lololol it killed me when they didnt remember what june 9th was i feel like they made one huge assumption about this game at the beginning then everything that followed was a theory of that assumption rather then actually looking at what was actually happening and being said and piecing the story together that way just a thought this game gives me heart attack levels of anxiety yet i continue to torture myself lol i know im a year late but the bloober team came out with a new game called observer you guys should play it oh my god you learn in the inheritance dlc that the one that tortured the kid and put why pink on the daughters horse drawing was the mother 00 id seen the ending but i forgot the why pink one could say he was finger painting we didnt start the fire its been burnin since the rats been returning so as the fire rages and you feel like falling down ill burn you alive tonighhhhhhht we are dead so i used your blood as paint were gonna get haunted my burned wiiife im going to burn and use your bones as my brushes little demo of parody ill carry you home tonight i was crossing the street and a person didnt use his turn signal it was so close he hit my tire i walked into the girls bathroom at my school while texting someone showed me a jake paul video seeing my teacher with a hair cut as i kept watching it became less scary i was also pausing every minute and leaving for two thats not cheating is it im still waiting on this theory at least in a live stream c i understand its not gametheorist worthy but we should at least get some kind of closure i dont know if you have done a game theory on this but i feel like this whole thing takes place in his mind like thoughts go down dead ends obsessions are emphasised thoughts of your past lifeevents are warped mat patlets head into the darkness shall we me nope nope nope nope nope nope lets not head into the darkness how about we try to stay alive that sounds fun i got motion sickness from all the moving desperately hiding in the comments at 10922 3440 im hiding in the comments id love an actual theory on this game my favorite ending is the worst ending where its just the wife painting and he loses his mind and it just keeps going over and over again that idea scares me so much hey they got the good ending personally i like the bad ending best this is for those of you in archive land like me whats happens is the mans wife was his muse but in it all the rats were driving him mad so he tried to burn him when he burned them he also burned his house which killed his daughter and harmed his wife when he saw her face he lost his muse so he became depressed and never payed attention to her but only his art this lead his wife into burning his paintings and killing herself hope this helped have you guys played the dlc for this yet please doo i like the sound of the album pages flipping it just started pouring rain outside and i screamed thanks game 24109 i wonder why the screen was blue i love the concept of this game the mental horror it brings the player as we see each act does affect the ending the got sweet ending the concept of it i love you start out not knowing what this game is or the story we enter rooms that seemingly normal then one simple step changes the room entirely the creepiest thing i thought was the creepiest was the twists and turns the unknown properties of the rooms thank you for reading there are so many more endings and u guys got the best and most difficult one on the first try clap and a half to u guys i hope they play the dlc hmm maybe they both actually do have a little bit of ocd why am i even watching this when i know that starting today i will be home alone for like a week o i wont be able to sleep as a canadian i know that americas thanksgiving is in novemberhow do they not know ours is in october xd a three hour livestream wow o aswell as a mature stream warning there needs to be a warning headphone uses for every time stephanie screams im just watching this today and you guys should definitely play the dlc of this game the protagonist is the painters daughter uh oh uh oh what what slender man what remor what slender man what matpat tbh i was too busy eating ramen under my blanket to be scared 650 what is outside the window am i the only one who saw that thst shadow in the hall they saw btw if they had turned any earlier they would have died i would know because i got killed by it xd there once was a happy couple they married and had a baby a little girl one day there was a fire the wife was badly burned but didnt die she went home the husband couldnt bear to look at her he began finding comfort in the bottle booze and spent all his time in his workshop the wife was stressed and at first tried to make it work eventually she couldnt take it and committed suicide he used parts of her to try to recreate her prior beauty on canvas as well as her he sank further into insanity his daughter was taken away from him by child services he eventually went completely mad but he realized his mistake he couldnt bring them back to him he burnt his paintings and himself to death im from the future and this reminds me of hello neighbor closet scene watching this with a large window behind me and dont forget the clear door right next to me and a large space behind me 5750 was the worst jumpscare i think ive ever experienced i legit fucking yelped like a dog soooo whose body parts did he use his own this name should be changed to sneeze pat the oracle told me that jason is the wisest of the theorist for he knows he knows nothing them there is a recurring theme of rats me exits video the clock scared me more then the dead wife why have these guys not made a theory on this game yet ive watched this several times already just to listen to stephs scream at 950 xd im a terrible person its not over play inheritence june 9 you forgot its their anniversary i didnt see anyone comment on the babyface painting but from my understanding its the daughter of the real life beauty and the beast httpwwwrefinery29com201703143965beautyandthebeastrealcouplefrenchbook ouch yes we have thanksgiving we pretty much have the same holidays as you guys except for july fourth 24234 oh we got a bottle of medicine lmao its fran bow all over again xd this game was magnificent theee hours of entertainment freddos easter egg blanket lights off all good you got the true ending good job i feel like matpat has a fear of spiders he always says the wife looks like one so perhaps he has arachnophobia 4310 am i the only one who sees a fish with its mouth up and tail down anyone no okay i really appreciate the ace of base reference not sure why but i do i thought this stream was awesome then the dolls came i started laughing when they started singing dhmis when they said lets get creative i just thought it was a weird coincidence that scene in the childs room is by far my favorite its just perfect the piano from super mario 64 got me every freaking time honestly the crayon art effects are some of my favorite parts of this game thats so creatively terrifying anything scary drawn in crayon and childlike is much scarier because it gives the effect of a child being aware of terrifying things in this world at 1817 the house seems like that game that you go around in circles i think the name of the game is pt or something you guys know too much about what the blood is supposed to look like on a knife if you liked this game you should try the inheritance dlc those endings are wild 12900 they are just baby talking ratpat that kid really really enjoyed bashing her head into that doll house matpat wasnt even looking at her but she still did it again my dad misses a lot of my birthdays now because he travels i love how matpat rarely screams but stephanie screams like a yelling war hero arrrghhg hi concerning the painting of the lady in black i think its not a mistress its a painting of his wife after the fire she lost all her beauty and would never be the same but the painting would be an eternal reminder of what she once was this would also explain why she burned the painting the letter from the agent said as much she couldnt look at it anymore the letters you found around the house indicate that his wife was very depressed and angry who can blame her also i think that she killed herself in the end the bathroom is where she did it i dont think that his daughter has died though it seems she just doesnt stay with him anymore the court procedure was probably about his parental rights and the painter went crazy trying to recreate his wifes face in the end he simply understood that all his paintings are useless just an illusion thank you for showing me things ive never seen in any other playthroughs i am so thoroughly impressedi love this game and i have seen so many people play it yall are the first i have ever seen get the best and most amazing yet most difficult ending ever clap and a half to yall thank you for showing me the entire game play that leads up to this ending 20804 literal finger painting the ending i saw on something else i forget what the painting distorts after he finishes it and he throws it with the others all including the one he had just thrown i think symbolising that it was all in his head and angrily goes to start again so you guys did good imo haha 12831 ratpat almost was flatpat this game was full of scary chair art and trolling who watch this in 2017 you actually got the best ending this was streamed on my birthday can you please make a theroy pls this game is so interesting jumpscare times i hope these are all of them 029 509 950 1802 2003 2116 4706 5120 5401 5741 10145 10152 10159 10442 unnerving imagery 10634 11823 12631 12657 12732 14133 14507 22037 the concealer in the last part was probably to do with is wifes insecurities about her burned skin what 12732 did matpat curse maturestream guys you guys should play outlast and the whistleblower dlc does matpat actually know the show called son of a glitch chills go up my spine when i see those like dress up dolls that look odd i cannot stand dolls only monster highs ever after highs and barbies the 21g mass near the end is probably a reference to dr duncan macdougalls experiment where he weighed the human soul arriving at just that number you should definitely look it up should they play the dlc you guys are actually so far the only lpers ive seen to have gotten good ending on the first try everyone usually gets the bad end this in vr i would watch others do it with pleasure did he ever make a theory for this game he should rat is an anagram of art 2258 im watching this while painting i swear im not headed down this path when they says lets get creative that remind me to the nightmare of a puppet show dont hug me im scared i wish youtube had a button where before you livestream you have the choice to automatically upload it to youtube after its over makes things 10x easier for gtlive too you got the wifechild ending if you got the wife ending the painting is just her and than it turns into a demon zombiei dont know how else to describe it and then you lock it int a room with others and the credits are as you walk through the house if you get the painter ending you paint yourself and claim you have immortality in the end he burnt his hands so he could never paint again meaning he couldnt live in the lie anymore woah i never saw anyone get this ending first time and the daughter isnt dead shes the character you play as in the dlc 21030 we actually are running out of apples wowie theres a window jump through it and escape 1025 you got the good ending congrats guys you actually managed to get then the good end the bad end is he finishes the painting but it just evolves into a monster painting and he starts all over again if were doing scary stories one time i was visiting my japanese godfather whose house is supposedly haunted he never had and paranormal events happen to him during a big dinner party by bowl of miso soup which was sitting far from the edge of the table was moved swiftly almost pulled onto my lap some soup was still in the bowl so i washed up and went back to eating i saw the bowl move again slower i put it back where it was and semijokingly told the ghost to stop it kept moving throughout the evening but i kept it from spilling again he recognized nothing would change cause of the painting so like it couldnt bring the family back to life so he burned it realizing this and killed him self hoping to see them in the afterlife i remember poop madonna that was weird oo thank my thinking is that the ending is telling us that to make a beautiful piece of art you have to care about something other than the art itself when you went with the family path the art was perfect because he actually cared about the thing he was painting and not the painting itself which led him to realize that and burn the paintings and himself when his art was going downhill and being critiqued harshly he had stopped loving his wife because she was no longer beautiful visually which may be why the art was lacking he wasnt putting his soul into it the character in this game was overobsessed with visual beauty and could not see that things could be beautiful in other ways like his childs drawings he wanted them to be perfectlooking and couldnt see the beauty in the childish innocence and imagination put into them matpat sings a lot when scared with the whole compact mirror and the wife saying youre the source of all my sorrows i think she was talking about her face like where it got burned but i honestly dont know 12839 ratpat is now flatpat play the dlc there has to be a better way 5706 that escalated quickly hes here hes there hes everywhere who ya gonna call its psychic friend fred bear this game is basically a fully developed pt but on a smaller budget stephanie be brave stephanie 1 second later screams 4749 thats actually a pretty good drawing of a horse for that childs age im sad now he could have at least said youre well on your way to becoming an artist youll draw like daddy soon hm how come the horse is pink is it magical from a dream 21030 not actually the best limerick rhyming passion with passion seriously rip headphone users ie me i have a scary story when i was fifteen me and my cousins were staying at my childhood home we stayed at my old room we were lying in my bed with our feet touching the wall we were drifting off to sleep when my cousin just screamed in pain we went out of the room and she checked her foot there was a bite mark on her foot and there were clear indentions of human teeth no way somebody alive could have bit her because there was only two of us in the room and our feet was facing the wall touching it even as the bed was small i knew that my childhood home was haunted but it was the first time that somebody actually got physically hurt 21 grams is the weight of a soul you should play amnesia 14214 whispers you cant fight the homestuckthough its weird and random its the greatest fandom can somebody tell me what the original song with the tune for that is because i dont actually know or was that the original im guessing not because we all know matpat and his musicals lols matpat just shat himself because of the rat aft he dragon breath was carrots delightfulfootmassagewentwrong one game i think you should do for scary games friday is eternal darkness sanitys requiem if you havent played it already youre in for a treat if you have than you know how awesome of a game it is why why this plz no can you guys please play the dlc matpat has such the baby face its adorable the child is fran bow when you were joking about the kids shoes there was a girl in the window and it made a quiet zelda secret discovery you should play the dlc inheritance i think u missed a checker piece should be the new u missed a totem its been good they got the good ending on the first try you guys should check all the endings o i mean i remember theres another one at least i keep wanting to yell you are missing stuff 20600 this isnt a horror game setting its a freaking zelda dungeon 12635 isnt that lisa you know from pt ratpat is rippat kinda wanna see a horror game where you trigger a jumpscare by turning a light on okay fnaf 4 but thats not quite what im looking for 1330 stolen straight from oot i didnt trigger any of the jumpscares if there was a jumpscare waiting just beyond that door right then i wouldve laughed so hard this is full of what i really love about first person horror games the paranormal forces screwing with the space around you rip headphone users xd 1800 the phone the phone is ringing 0 around 2810 matpat sounds like character from hellsing ultimate dont feel bad about your handwriting i thought at 15523 it was 563 burn of the burned is that a rockband i think that the guy said that it was all a lie because he seemed to not really love his family he only had the perfect wife before she got burnt and he started go to alcohol when his reviews of his painting came back genitive because he always concentrated on his art work his wife got upset with him but also herself for bringing a little girl into a family that was already a lie so he killed her baby and then herself the husband found them and probably didnt have much sorrow his sorrow was of the time her had a wife that did everything for him a baby that loved him and wasnt scared of him and his artwork that everyone loved so he wanted to paint the family that he missed so he tried to paint it and using human bodies as good luck charm like basketball players having luck socks and trying to bring back what he once had and then at the end he realizes that he is more fixated on his perfect fake family artwork that will sell more than the family he is painting and my favourite part of every live stream is the way steph covers the mic with her hair so the audio goes to garbage love it i am watching this past midnight in my bed and im already half way through i want to stop but i cant some of what they say should not be taken too seriously they joke my history teacher was called for jury duty during the school year last year and missed i think 4 days of school because of it maybe a whole school week he didnt expect it to be interesting but he ended up being apart of a jury for a murder trial and when he came back to school we spent an entire class period talking about it so basically another day without history class it was pretty interesting ranging from drug abuse to murder to forged alibis and attempted escapes into different states and he was all over it hes a history teacher though so him getting excited about talking about murder and death i mean thats basically all history is so xd dont kill and dont do things like that can anyone tell me the time for when the door opens by falling and stephanie gets really scared this reminds me of the story the telltale heart by edgar allan po insanity is such a wonderful thing also i thought it was cat because it was the only one that had the drawing the daughter is alive im pretty sure because in the dlc inheritance i think your playing with her 21g is a reference to the work of dr duncan macdougall he was trying to work out the mass of the human soul by weighing a person at the moment of death and taking note of the difference between the weight of an alive person and the weight of a dead person that difference would be the weight of the soul he theorised the first person apparently lost 34th of an ounce which was converted to 21 grams did it bug any one else that they didnt realize the painting code was obviously 563 not 363 i mean for god sake theres 3 of them looking at it this was at like allmost 2 hours in i think hard does anybody watch ones better than this caseomg that was good that was effective that was not what we expected matpat is a poet guys you should totally make a layers of fear theory 13800 well hello there lolpat the bluescreening near the end made me feel so unsafe this game reminds me of pt these two are marriage goals hes here hes there hes everywhere who you gonna call physic friend fredbear omg maybe i shouldnt eat and watch this why does everyone assume rat is the code when theres a picture of a dog or a cat at the top 10330 we danced to that song i was so happy when i heard it matpats smile after they see the monster in the beginning scene id kinda creepy theres a thought neverending nightmares is a sequel no ideas just a thought steph scares me more than the game if im ever a father im going to make it a point to be better than the painters father matpatooooooh weve summoned the devil meyou summoned me hey will yall be playing the dlc for layers of fear it looks really good and expands on the gameplay of the main game a lot they are really stuckobsessed with the idea of the protagonist painting with the souls of other people you guys should play alien isolation play the dlc 940 i think please play jazzpunk 3 3 rat pat didnt die i hope maybe just another rat died rip random rat its really weird because my mom is cutting onions and i have sensitive eyes so im crying while watching a horror game i love how when the kid runs into the wall steph gasped and looked horrified and matpat burst out laughing i was looking at another page and clicked back just in time for the piano jumpscare lol i feel like the game is almost over and then i look down and see theres two hours left who needs cardio i have horror games to get the heart pumping the sound a5 the 17 minute mark hurt my ears so bad i had to take my beloved headphones and didnt know what the letter said dog name popiel and all rats httpsenwikipediaorgwikipopiel nah bro i think you got the bad end my god it was so creepy when the camera shut down right watching this game for some reason gives me such flashbacks to one of my favorite computer games when i was a kid the 7th guest heck if it had been made today and not in the early 90s i imagine t7g would look a lot like this im pretty sure the rat skin was a fountain or sink when you went down those stairs i started singing past the point of no return so im hiding in the comments also this is so spoopy it is making me have nervous ticks they got the good ending that backwards ringing makes me want to vomit steps looks so nice like shes going out to dinner and then matpat looks like he just got back from the gym not that fat pat would be at the gym picturing mat dancing in the club to that song lol 23537 mat pat in the club the other ending he starts all over again and you get to see all the painting and all the deformities that they had and the reasons why he restarted cuz he couldnt remember what his wife looked like them rats be saying praise the sun at 3300 im pretty sure it is refrencing crystal meth right because a common thing is bugs crawling under your skin i dont know from personal experince mind you from reading thank you you guys are awesome ive seen many playthroughs of the game and while you missed a few fun scares you also found a lot of things ive never seen before you have great intuition and it was so much fun to watch you play 3 oh wowi didnt get this endingi got the one where the paintingokok not spoiling its interesting that the worse ending comes from collecting most items june 9th is my bday o couldnt sleep last night my phone went off when this phone did and i was so confused i could not sleep i cant stop hearing that darn phone love the sound tho lol wow that was such an interesting game and you guys actually got the good ending congartulations d isnt 21 grams what a soul was supposed to weigh 12441 omg thats my comment i can die happy now youve missed lotsa totems matpat should be using headphones and less distracting for this game to get them dont be such a woos you dont really need the headphones at a high volume 13714 hello what do we gaht hear it made me laugh so hard i almost died you need to play sara is missing you would love it guyss does anyone else wish they still did longer series like life is strange and franbow so she burned the painting of the black woman which is a painting he made for her and then she died in a fire hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm creepy oo hey matpat your in an undertale fangame called dont forget your in a house in the village i dont know if youve played it on this channel or not so there you go when the baby went creepy ghost at 10920 i was like its about to go super saiyan 2615 deerheaded spider thats what nightmares are made of steph talking about upside down paintings reminded me of when my art teacher glued my abstract piece upside down but i got 1st place anyway is it just me or does the first painting right at the beginning 330 look like a turkey or something similar hey gt love im new here and wanted you to now that i love the live streams but i got a new rpg horror game for you its call pocket mirror 5630 my name is ceana so hearing matt saying my name but as the colour i was surprised cayenne i think is the colour spelling nice ending definitely better than the other one ive seen i wonder how many there are i love stephs outfit omg there are teddy bears that beginning scream was the best hahaha noooooo not dont hug me im scared guys you got the best possible ending since theyre talking about fingers they forgot about salad fingers lol thx your not tell in the f word to children like me i am only 10 and i love you i dont think mat pat is ready for outlast heck even markiplier and some of the other youtubers had nightmares about heck it terrified me mid way so how about it do you accept this challenge to play outlast how did they not see the jump scare coming at 12704 matpat can you please play the game called sara is missing you guys got the best ending awesome why did enard kill the children how did enard get to no suit at all and who was possing enard balora funtime foxy and funtime freddy if you guys thought that this had some really visually cool moments then you guys should absolutely play the dlc for this next friday it is amazing i think youll think so too gratz on getting the good ending gtlive also pls play the dlc for layers of fear it is worth it you get to play as his daughter who is actually still alive it looks to me like he tried to do some kind of ritual to bring them back and that explains his eccentric choices in tools so when it didnt work he was mad and saw his work was pointless so he burned the painting that he mistakingly thought his family would had wanted because he was wrong and they hated how he focused on his work matpat the ending you got was actually the good ending the other ending she is in a black dress and then her face turns ugly and then you throw that one in with the rest and then the wife comes after you matpat is gonna do a theory on this and thats just a theorya game theory thanks for reading man they should play the steam game her story its a cool game where you type keywords into a database and get clips from police interviews and the entire point of the game is to figure out the story of what happened it seems perfect for these guys to do matpat i think a game you guys should definitely play is to the moon its really fantastic and i think you should see how everyone else feels about you doing it what do the wingdings say in the background because i can hardly see it you have got to play the dlc after this ps can you do a gotham theory i had to ask its my favorite show i didnt know anyone else had seen joseph and the amazing technicoloured dreamcoat im actuallu crying im prepared for a team war team valor more like team victor 10130 i was noticed3333 how do i get to the chat and wen do they live stream he is odveisly crazy and trying to pant his wife a new face in life but now his dead also his dead and trying to pass on i love how he says dalls and yet steff only made fun of him for it once do the stanley parable plz plz plz plz plz lolyou wont regret it lol i appreciate the joseph and the amazing technicolored dream coat reference hmmm is it possible watching this alone in the dark at night wasnt the wisest decision wouldnt the babydoll cupboard room be the wifes not the daughters the wheelchair showed up again at that part burn victims lose nerve control and she could have been confined to a wheelchair the writing was the daughters telling him to stop giving the mom dolls she isnt aware of why he would feel guilty towards the mom his treatment is status quo always been this way havent finished but thats my thoughts around 10300 to 10500 hey guys did you even see the child in the glass door httpsyoutubezvlwjjlqdyut3160 that blues clues reference at around the 13000 mark though xd at 5249 did anyone else see the baby standing in the window congrats on getting the mother ending its harder to get than the wife ending but i think you need all the collectibles for the painter ending will you be doing the daughters inheritance dlc a 3 hour live stream yes please matpat i got a fnaf theory i dunno if youd call it a theory but its worth noting the marionette doesnt have pupils in its eyesuntill its jumpscare this might be related to psycic friend fredbear but i doubt it 950 the scream nearly gave me a heart attack i swear if i get scared and end up choking on my twix i am not going to be happy there is no good or bad no right or wrong merely chaos hey matpat you should play this series of games called cube escape on scary game friday they might not seem freaky to begin with but they get really freaky the order of the games is 1 seasons 2 the lake 3 arles 4 harveys box 5 case 23 6 the mill 7 birthday 8 the theater and there is also rusty lakeroots and rusty lakemotel who is the guy in the background im 12 hours late you guys should play the beginners guide its a very emotional game but also funny in a lot of ways hey guys i dont know if you know about this or even care to explore more but just in case layers of fear has a dlc called layers of fear inheritance it might be fun to check out if youre interested i hope you will play the addon it is out of his daughters perspective just as well made and not very long the walls bleeding at 14237 makes me think of winter from the lunar chronicles this was on my birthday i think he just burned his hands in the end to be unable to paint anymore as much as his wife lost the ability to play the piano so they both would just have each other and the child in the end with nothing to disturb them anymore because i dont think they are dead since there happens to be a dlc with the daughter so maybe the wife got out of all this mess along with the child because who wouldnt do that with a drunkhead as husband u 21 grams is howm much souls are supposed to weigh after some experiments weighing dead people before and after dying scientists discovered a 21 gr diference between the living and the dead same personobviously and 21921 grams is 240multiple of10 june 9ths ma birthday d i had to leave half way on this stream so glad i can see the rest d angry joe voice three hours i really like the fact that matpat randomly sings songs i always start to sing too omg baby doll apocalypse at 10226 or some where around that time the dolls are like feminist always getting triggered you guys gotta find a way to play with headphones you are missing sound cues i see comments for you guys to play outlast and that would be fine but id really want to see you play the evil within its a bit more actiony though surprisingly somehow they got the good ending you got a different ending than what i usually see and this is better the other one i have not seen yet can be kind of considered the best but i like this one because he realizes his faults its definitely a lock of the daughters hair it can be tradition to cut off a lock of hair from when your baby is brand new my mom still has my lock of hair and i have my sons there is a documentary about the hairy child painting i cant remember the name im afraid in this documentary it tells about how those paintings were painted to send to people to advertise and to see if these royalimportant familys would like to owncare for one of these creatures if i remember correctly the documentary i watched had to do with midevil english royals when u miss the stream by 1 minute this game needs to be theorized play outlast 12 story it has the type of story you guys would love gameplay you know the usual type but with a twist horror over 9000 pixel perfect timing based the classic flying phone phone guy i think you got the most depressing ending oops the comments were not loaded i think you got the most depressing ending this game needs to be theorized i think you got the most depressing ending ther noyce friking sweet between the first and second layers of fear is a stab and a half where are the jumpscare times do a theroy on this game steph we did not laugh at your scared ness more at your wimpiness xd this game is so not scary xd please play outlast i think you guyswould probably get heart attacks but good heart attacks its a fun spoopy game i have to make a run across my pitch black yard because i forgot something wish me luck do a game theroy on this game jason before the marriage one or 2 words every 5 or 6 streams jason after the marriage tons of words in just the first 4 mins of one stream marriage can change things i guess xd could you guys play sara is missing please matpac you guys need to play slime rancher scariest part of the stream spoilers camera dying jk this game is terrifying yeay finally this is either the good ending or the early version ive seen a different ending and i think the two of you will enjoy that one more i dont know if it had a second meaning in the game but that 21 gram weight is essentially a soul a doctor named duncan macdougall theorized that he was able to prove the soul was a physical object in the body weighing the patient at the time of death after tests he discovered that the soul weighed 21 grams i say discovered because it was later found it only worked on one patient while the others proved different results discrediting the discovery 507 im canadian and im wondering what is canadian thanksgiving is it different from your thanksgiving in anyway if so how is it different 23937 i think your playing against your sanity 10632 best part of anything ever cool ive never seen that ending i actually know an art teacher who critiqued her child on her drawing but not as bad as this guy im terrified of horror games but lm giving it a try 3 play the static speaks my name a great horror game 10226 i still cant believe that my picture was pulled up i seriously never thought you guys would notice and i have to say what i said about you guys bringing joy to my life couldnt be more true and just thank you so much you guys are amazing and i really do hope that you did like the picture lemme try to interprete this gamethere was a painter he had a wife they had a child but he neglected his family for his work his family got angry he also got angry and eventually became insane he wanted to replicate his family in a painting he tried many times he failed many times eventually he used his familys bodys to recreate the painting then he realised it was impossible to recreate their soul so he burned it all away anyway the drugs kick in at 1 hour 40 minutes right after the piano moved i thought of the piano from mario 64 i was likeoh gosh the piano is back and then matpat said it reminded him of that 00 i hope they play the dlc congrats on getting the alternate ending am i the only one who thinks steph looks a little different in this video is on a different page clicks back onto video one of the very few jump scares happens seconds after back onto the video me argh ermahgerd blehhh my luck is so poor xd since i havent played the game im not sure if the elevator scene with the wifes spirit is avoidable but i do know that every other instance that you were attacked by her could have been avoided just as that one hallway said to ignore her if you ignore her spirit either by not choosing the path shes on chair art path listening to the game when it says dont turn back and going back the way you came when you see her down the hall you can avoid getting attacked they should play pokemon sun or moon who thinks that they should play stanley parable well that was a different ending than ive seen before i liked the one i saw first where he finished the painting and it turns into something horrible and in anger he discards it into a room of other corrupted paintings to begin again that painting is her before the accident shes jealous that the painting retains its beauty while she didnt started watching this while playing dark souls i died after having traveled a very long way through very annoying areas with very annoying enemies and got sent so far back quit dark souls thank gt for being here as comfort matpat please make a layers of fear theory after seeing the inheritance dlc endings i cant think i need answers the daughter isnt dead shes nice and safe the dlc is about her hey gtlive i am a new youtuber and was wondering if you could sponsor me bronana can this comment get at leat 5 likes because i have a broken leg sigh the notes are the cold notes his wife leaves him you guys know that you read one of her notes last time come on 254th comment yo can the next game you guys play be we happy few i think its cool with the new tory line added it also includes quests and puzzles this was an awesome game even just to watch tfw mat and steph thought a water fountain was rat skin p xd you guys should play among the sleep play dungeon nightmares 2 plox what a long stream like si te quedaste hasta el final 25611 im eating apple right now xd omg it kinda reminds me of hillarys spirit cooking emails 0 so happy just more info about the court thing we are trying to get our back from foster care i finally get it he tried to bring his dead wife and daughter back through a painting and even though it was in his eyes perfect it didnt bring them back obviously not literally so he decides to burn both the painting because its all wrong and himself because he decides life isnt worth living anymore the reason he kept living after their death was to try to bring them back after he realized how much he missed them but when he realized thatll never happen he burned himself with his desperate attempt to bring them back as you can see when he dies though he still cares about her but knows that hell never have her back all due to his failures its a tragic story man this is way i kinda dont like horror the bad endings they leave you hanging and disappointed besides im more into thrillertype stuff than horror and this is a major reason why still though at the same time i shouldnt try to run from tough andor challenging things because if i do i i love a good psychological horror game one thing i would like to correct you on matpat the wife wasnt burned to death she was left horribly scarred from the accident knowing that she would hurt her already obsessed husband decided to commit suicide in the tub of the bathroom with a kitchen knife this was explained in the dlc pack called inheritance the base game never once tells you that she died or even how if she did overall its a great dlc pack definitely worth the money so i am kinda new in the channel and at first i thought they had a great chemistry so i make my research and found they were maried uch a good couple they work perfectly together 3 this is my favorite ending after being so obsessed with art and beauty that he turned his back on his beautiful wife after her beauty burned away with a tragic fire he tried at first to recreate her lost beauty then after his wife and child dies in the second fire he tries to bring them back through his painting only to realize everything he had done wrong and regretting everything he realize he cannot be reunited with them through his painting so he burned all his attempts including the final work and burned himself alive with the pictures of his wife and child to finally be reunited with them its sad but at least he realized the truth and found peace and a way to finally return to his family do i smell a theory a game theory bringing finger painting to a whole other level gtlive you gotta play layers of fear inheritance so you can see the story for the childs perspective can you guys pls play the beholder waitwhen i heard mat say we r a man trying to make a face of my wife with human art and then she died but he still went on that sounded familiar 14506 see what happens when you act like a wuss and back up from everything in the top right it says dont look back thats because your wife spawns in behind you you backed up into her then you died and lost a secret because you werent paying attention 21153 its voldemort and what was once him in rat pat version thats pretty casual hey can u guys play dishonored 2 i love it and also could u try to do the low chaos route that mean trying to killed very few people each level if u read this love ur theories matpat nohomo and think u for reading or even considering it noooooooo i missed this again you got the good ending dont worry only matpat and step can make a horror game funny as hell who else is looking for jumbscare times id like to see bioshock or bioshock infinite sometime on here the paintings are goregeous badumtiss when do you guys stream on youtube gaming when i saw matpat in joeys video i fanboyed so much i threw my ipad at my door yeeaaahh anyone else really want them to play outlast especially

2 scary i 3 steph is left handed cool same here 3 really dont see the big hooplah about this game hi are you hiding in the comments too i tried to be brave but i just couldnt take it here is some food for you im from canada thx giving is before halloween 030032 stephs scream is what scared me there are two many babies bro why is this 3 hours cumberbatch in thumbnail i think you got the most depressing ending of the three endings you got the bad ending there are medium and good endings as well you guys got the good ending scary games friday and one thing led to another so tickle me elmo that door opening nearly have me a heart attack do you wanna burn a snowman any chance youre gonna play sara is missing this game needs to be theorized my theory is that he saw that he couldnt bring them backto him so i guesshe went to them im going to watch this full screen with headphones wish me luck between the first and second layers of fear is a stab and a half wow nice stuff might play this one on my channel soon as well i think wat really going on is they were expecting a baby and she was caught in the fire not actualy dead but just burned badly the husband not being able to look at her anymore ongly loving her for her beauty he stays lovked in his study all day and ongly speaks to her threw notes around the house and waits till shes asleep to leave the study and go to bed she get so upset with her aperance and the loss of her baby and her husband not loving her anymore she becomes angrey breaking mirrors and hating herself for wat happened shes up all night crying cause of her husbads naglect and he is killing beautiful women and skinning them and taking there blood so he can reconstuct his wifes deformed figure because the doctor refused to do it seeing that the damage was to much and they didnt have enough skin or blood for the proceedure so the husband being an artest took it apon hinself to get the needed suplys himself to fix his wife dear gt live please play south parkthe stick of truth it is such a funny game and people would love it happy belated bday matpat d you guys are amazing im sitting at my computer and these leaves are hitting the window and i keep thinking some creep is tapping at the window am i the only one that felt bad for the painter at the end theres nothing like scary games friday video games design and sweets foods that are not going to be able i am so impressed by the fact that they got the best and most difficult ending on their first try like there are forums and videos dedicated to pixel perfect timing based formulas to get this ending and matpat and steph just sort of stumbled into it xd clapandahalf to you guys first i was noticed 25440 gotta watch at x2 because i need to see this before school yesss i watched this live cant wait for them to go live again today fill in the blank games matpat should play on livestream no one ever notices mehhhhhh nooo just missed gt livee wow i dont think ive ever made it to a video this fast im sure its a great one and its a great thing to get to watch on a day that im home sick we love you mat and steph d so excited for this loved watching them play the game oops the comments were not loaded when u miss the stream by 1 minute that was a fun stream guys cant wait to see what youre streaming tonight you guys should play outlast first meme watched it live probably going to watch it again 13th early first first btw i love youre videos mat pat the game and webcam are about a second apart but i wasnt able to fix it because thats the way the stream was recorded sorry dogs 3 i play on xbox too and i gotta say that many times that ive been playing a horror game an achievement pops up thats the most horrifying jumpscare youll ever experience haha it gets me every time i hope funhaus does a halloween special i had an idea where they lock adam an alanah in the room while its really dark and there forced to play scary games alanah an adam would be competing against each other they both have 10 points every round if u get spooked you lose a point and if u look away for to long u lose a point as a penalty they cannot purposely scare one another the person who has the most points wins the round an they get to choose one of four options they can use anytime during the round 1 get to look away from the game 30 seconds without it counting as a penalty 2 try to scare the opponent one time on purpose 3 get anyone on funhaus to play for them for 5 minutes but if the person they called in gets spooked then the opponent gains a point back4 spend one of your options an gain 1 extra point for the next round when points are being tallied you cannot have more then two options each round the winner will get a nice group hug an gets to choose th i like how part of the spooky spooks is an asmr lady voice asking you if you slept well because yes that is very scary anyone else thinks she looks like avgn in the thumbnail where does she stream i love to see you again daryl prat where you at you lil cukk sob looks like youre on the titanic when spooky games are played the aussie accent comes out thick will there be a full game play video i love scary games i really do a survival horror game is my favorite but man am i a bitch lol watching this because of the inside gaming review watching this i kind of feel bad for laughing at your fear but its your favorite game so far this year so good on ya i would love to see you doing escape room it would be hilarious 211 for real im pretty sure even the first layers of fear had a piano you could play pt would have been so much scarier to bad it got cancelled why was this in my recommend fun stream but im confused aside from that mirror part at 152 how is this a horror game or am i missing something here hell metro is creepier than this after playing re7 on psvr this game is just a joke i love watching both alanah and adam both play scary game cause they are the biggest pussies when it comes to them and always have great reactions i loved this felt like i was playing for a moment great stuff great to see you back im a huge fan of the first game but this one just didnt do it for me the mannequins didnt feel scary the story didnt grip me and the chase sequences annoyed me to the point of quitting i really wanted to like it but its just not for me god its cool to see you back doing this hope all the adventures are incredible making this cairns kid proud when are funhaus guys playing this you have to try vr horror games glad to see that youre feeling well enough to get back to what you love where does she streams b is for brave welcome back alanahhope you are all okay now we have all missed you so much i need some games like this one in my switch what no link to your stream channel o hey alanah glad to see you have the strength to upload again but take it easy and make sure you have enough break in between vids hope your doing well alanah pearce do u stream on twitch i dont get itwhy was picking up a mirror scary did i miss something some jumps i understand even if they dont make me jump but i didnt get this one hahaa watched another person play this and he reacted the same its a freaky game in the face of terrifying uncertainty alanah this is fine in fact i like this cracks me up how you react to games like this very entertaining i need you and adam to guest star in an achievement haunter episode 0756 well then i want to watch horror movies with alanah i prefer it red and strobing if you ask me ocd the game close everything 615 what a crazy random happenstance its good to see you back and i wish you the best of the best take care what happened at 154 im so confused lol some pears that are kind of funny looking at the top otherwise known as apples lol omg that was a crazy game kingdom hearts sequel lol love this video havent seen a horror game like this on youtube in years you should do a vid with adam would love to see who screams louder hot damn this game is creepy af what did we do to deserve the uploads missed your vids alanah great vid great commentary always great to watch your gameplays stay well 756 as scary as possible yet such an adorable reaction some poos come out that dark room can eat a bag of dicks i watched my friend play the first layers of fear and theres a part where a baby runs into a wall smacks against it and then disappears turns out this event is tied to walking past a certain line as we walked backwards and forwards the baby slammed over and over and over and over really took the terror out of that sequence 154 handheld mirrors are evil i was gonna say that you talked alot but then i remembered you soo scared i loved your face when that dude lifted that seated girls head off lol great play through i need to check this one out hopefully this comes to console this game made me fell off of my chair but god damn its so freaking good i enjoyed every second of suffering the way you said spooky boat was hilarious to me for some reason glad to see youre back to making content keep it up youre reactions were genuinely entertaining i was laughing and jumping with you the whole time im the same way i like these kinds of games but man am i a wussy when i play them alone in the dark lol please do more horror games with adam as well you two make a perfect spooky combo 714 is me playing anything remotely scary lol alanah always on edge is the best alanah these are just images on screen you know how theyre made where does she stream alanah and adam is a fascinating combo playing horror games xd dang missed the stream but it seems like youre feeling better so thats great love the video im happy im not the only one who plays like that awesome video i like how you react to scary moments wonder how she would do playing some dead by daylightgame makes me jump about 20 times a matchlol i truly envy and respect people that plays horror games im fine watching horror movies but games i just try and try and just cant excellent commentary youre a trooper alanah haha see these videos are perfect alanah love your play through videos nothing crazy or elaborate even the long hallway in life is strange gave me chills this game has never been scary to me because my grandpas house looked like the first one and this one looks like my uncles hotel in washington man this was hilariousyoure great lol alanah plays this game like shes lagging moving 2 inches at a time lol can you do these horror gameplays with adam sometime love it love the video just like you i love horror games but more like watching it unless its a survival coop now im good p haha keep it up and most importantly take care young lady alanah has more guts than me i refuse to play horror games the odd water graphics kinda remind me of bioshock a whole lot of nothing going on i love watching you play horror games id love to see just alanah and adam go through a horror game together alanah getting excited about a room lol its just you alone on a ship just you nothing else anxiety abounds nonetheless 153 my reaction to alanah playing layers of fear welp time hide out in the comment section nobody mentions that this boat actually resembles the titanic many of the floors seem very early 1900s what happened at 154 that made her jump does anyone know if alanah or others at funhaus have set days or times that they stream during 154 they got you good there alanah lol your accent is very soothing made the horror aspect of the game totally bearable great video alanah i was thoroughly entertained was this from a youtube stream or a twitch stream wouldnt mind watching the whole stream if its archived or uploaded i was looking down at my phone checking reddit and the part at 152 scared me so bad i shook lol its even creepier being in 720p lol when she said she loved it when the radio room was red and strobing i took her at face value i thought her edm powers were making her immune to spooks please upload more of this such a great stream thanks for the upload i need more of this dog i literally just played this game for my girlfriend and she could not screaming love the uploads hope you keep them coming rule number one in 1st person horror games never turn around more stuff like this d the throatclearing and nervous laughter is exactly what im doing the whole time playing this game so far idk why i like to be scared but this is effective good stuff shes adorable inching forward 1 step at a time lol does she stream on youtube or twitch i never seem to see her streaming when she is how did you go editing it just as scary have you ever been so scared that you start crying like you feel so uneasy about something that yours eyes start tearing up commentary is great when people are scared 923 gold reaction more of horror games please haha does anyone know what her favorite survival horror game was its awesome your feeling good enough to make a video thank you bruh this shit scary af that my kink actually more of that please lmao that wasthat was the greatest ever this is fine a fine and dandy jump scare these games remind me so much of the suffering series on ps2 why am i watching this at 2am who does this to themselves c alanah jumping is the thing that scares me playing with headphones thats brave the reactions in this are so great love seeing the raw alanah very different experience watching this played by james and elyse in the middle of the day while constantly talking to chat vs just alanahs head with no room light and only conversation about the spook meter of the game watching 5 am in morning allanah nice seeing you back on the youtube radar loved the first layers of fear and dlc i love it when a beautiful lady jumps out of her chair doors moving on their own is also my kink small world holy shit i have never gotten to a video so quick to where it says no views yaaay love these videos alanah u kinda remind me of kait from gears4 not first but happy to be hear i love these atmospheric games if konami wasnt such a dumbass we would have gotten pt but at least we got death stranding out of it not to get off topic but what

someone was calling me xd my name is hctor 20814 breathing sounds 11540 i was right there with you teo i was so confused until you opened it and saw the safe one of my favorite moments lmao so your telling me that you dont live in a house that apartment is nice dude teo talks about poop me an individual in the middle of eating a cake an hour and a half into the video and i still have no idea whats this game is about you should play fnaf vr with a heart monitor that would be really funny i really admire you teo for what you said about drama and how everything should not be about drama ive dealt with too much drama in my life so i agree with you keep up the amazing work you and alex and thank you for being you also watching you play games has really kept my mind off all the drama that has been in my life and i want to thank you for that also i bought a tshirt with flashs story on it and i love it you are the only person i know who can put a story on a tshirt and sell it lol thanks to i was eating chocolate cake this made me say teo youre an idiot sometimes so many times much love to you though dude youll get there eventually teo i was fucking eating xd 500 4626 this assholehe has no idea what hes doing yet he drops the chair perfectly on the first try toilets are important also because some are weak asf and they clog easy lol 552 my phone went flying when he screamed 425 thank you teo i was eating xd 15345 ah this made me really sad i was just watching all the old mish mash videos and that really just hit me in the feels heart rate increases when he sees the two os heart rate also increases when talking about bad toilets the way teos hand flies up above his head when he gets spooked makes me giggle uncontrollably each time when teo said him and pata drifted away from eachother i literally cried im so sad because of that one sentence what is the music that started playing at 4520 it like give me a really interesting feeling and images this game is just jumpscares 12710 that burp caused the fire jesus cockrocking christ i fucking jumped at the dog i literaly hit the table at my workplace in pure horror that moment when teo is first scared from the sub noise and opens the door his expression slowly and slowly turning to an afraid face as he goes down the hallway 110 to 140 its awesome imagine this my sister walks in to the room at 12753 you cant know what will be the bad ending chooses the give up option half the vidteo working on locks 736 alex mouth fart jumpscare for your next drinking game you should all get some spirytus rektyfikowany for the shots watching his head shrink into his torso wondering what the heck is happening too damn funny love the content 3 15344 aww i liked pata he was cute thats a reference to one of teos older vids hes a very particular asshole xd 500 teo gets scared by literally everything i love it 32327 body drops teo hello friend d i know ive heard this voice before who is the narrator in this game edit just remembered he is the voice actor for viper and a few other heroes in dota 2 this voice is practically identical to viper 21300 the excuses of a puss puss ey paddy sammy and flash in before its revealed its david attenborough as the director anyone else think that the disembodied voice near the start sounds similar to ulyessus from fallout new vegas teo you know you can just buy a model keep track of the model ie the one in your current home and install that model when you mentioned pata and you growing apart really made me sad it reminds me of friends that i grew apart from but still cared about so is that teos heartbeat or the characters i feel like this series is just eerie and not necessarily scary it is 1am and raining where i live perfect furniture stores should have different model toilets that they have for sale in the bathrooms so you can try them can everyone in this comment section please like this so maybe teo can see i love when he plays horror games and i think emily wants to play too would be perfect its scary lots of jump scares its difficult it has puzzled etc i agree with the toilet thatll be cool if his subs can pick the sound effect that will play so it fits in way better dont know if you will read this teo but i got out of hosiptal from surgery and although im feeling very shit your videos are always a joy to watch gday from nz whenever i watch this i think to myself how unhealthy can you be teo mooring is to bury the dead unmooring is to uncover the dead can someone please list the timestamps of all the jumpscares please i need to be prepared 1803 two hit the nae nae 3228 should be a sub noise where did that even come from 5902 perfect timing xd yes i want spoppy things i was just about to see it on the purple site ahah what a weird nonscary game it has a few jumpscares but other than that it seems really boring only teo the best gaming youtube twitch sensation talks about poo on his stream like its part of the game lets enjoy teo being scared lots of love teo single player horror game just when i finished the alien stream my day just got a whole lot better elongated is the toilet you want first things i replace in my homes swedish man learns how to count for 10 minutes probably shouldnt be watching this at 12am yeah sorry gonna have to give this a 010 because you cut the 40 minutes of screentear you are my favourite youtuber teo watching this to keep me up to fix my sleeping schedule funny as but damn that character part hurt i was eating lol i thought it was the titanic at first lol hello loved this

classic teo never stop uploading uncut streams from this channel teo 3 love this and you not gay first ooooh i hope you guys do a proper lets play of this i will pretty please you till the apples fall off the floor dont talk while the playing the game i want to hear the game not you especially the girl is so annoying the synchronized ahhhhhhh at 1018 also i was wondering if you guys had played observer its the cyberpunk bladerunnerinspired horror game by this same developer might be good for a late to the party or even as a lets play series at some point 1200 of this i am not fond is the most british way of saying fuuuuuuck that maybe smashing the blood pears was a good idea johnny chiodini 2019 in the nicest possible way i really do enjoy watching you guys getting scared because im too scared to play myself halloween 2019 playthrough please more of you telling off the spirits whati have not heard any news of thisit has tony todd toobruuuuhhhhhhh wtf never expected this to come out the first game was so good and creepy layers of screen tear more like wow this looks so much better than the first and it creates a totally new sense of terror love how you guys were running scared great job great job creepy i initially read the title as lawyers of fear 2 both titles work great audio guyscommentary really adds so much i absolutely cannot wait to see you and ox play this around halloween i live for watching and playing scary games at halloween time you need nice doors nice hands and nice apples i decided to watch this alone at 11pm let me tell you that was very much a mistake all those apples im sure this lovecraftian ungodly process is how they make cidona taste like cider but without alcohol the game looks gorgeous but has about as much image tearing as a pair of early 2000s punk jeans the screen tearingi cant watchim sorry that went south soo fast like la de da chillin in my boat room to dark rum boom apple ghost mannequin mental bollocks kinda wanna play the first now but theres about three doors in the way the only thing frightening was the amount of screen tear already scared when i heard tony todd at the beginning such a good horror voice we need more johnny and aoiffe playing horror games together its hilarious i love how gradually throughout the video aoife starts turning into bernard black this is just to say i have eaten the apples that were in the corridor and which you were probably fermenting for cider save me they were horrific so disorienting and so cold the screen tear fairies have visitedi think that means theres a tenner under the pc saw the hall of grabby hands at c1125 and was immediately reminded of a wetherspoons on a friday night so yes this game is terrifying game looks promisingif you were to do a playthrough once its out im sure everyone would be delightedbrown in their trousers thanks johnny aoife glad to have seen you two thursday i hope you enjoy your presents the commitment to fruit in both these games is admirable game looks good and full of nopes in all the best way that was intense the screen tear almost seemed intentional ouch tell them to turn on vsync actors never have to put up with screen tearing that said the visual warping in this is great makes it feel like a rollercoaster 246 this is how we filthy inverters see every game can we see more of this once its released pretty please that screen tearing though i cant wait to play this playing a simulation within a simulated simulation is the life had no clue this was even happening awesome thats bad ending layers of fear 1 and 2 its weird and pays for nice graphics people wow such a great game best horror deep plot 1010 i dont like this game at all its all very dark there are no lights is shirrako never sleep or do something else always be the first give the ending on the game im so confused whats going on action gunshot gave me goosebumps first i m genius comment fiirssttttttt l ers off 4 2 act character layers of simon 2 layers of fear 2 mit simon ja klar hab ich bock drauf that moment when everyone realizes what green haired lobos would mean for the green screen no timestamps of where the big jumpscares are you let me down comment section now i just have to watch from behind my fingers lol why did i read the title as lobos player of the year xd i clicked immediatly to see what it was about now i gotta wait for the actual video for when he becomes player of the year the game is trying so hard to be deep and meaningful and artistic wow cazandra and dance220 together donated more than 50000 wow i cant believe a shiba inu dog was behind it all along did vin diesel as riddick do the narration for this game or what jumpscare galore with no substantial gameplay why wont indies just copy the golden ps2 era of horror and games like fatal frame siren silent hill instead they all chase amnesia and that hidenseek trend got boring like 5 years ago when chat backseats the whole time they cant all be new right can you turn down the jump scare sounds im trying to sleep joking aside its almost speaker breaking loud love what you do looby layers of meh if you ask me but thats just my own opinion very nicely produced looks great but i didnt feel any dread or panic at any point the plot felt a bit more involving but thats about it i faded off around mid act iii what theres a 2nd one runs off to find wallet hello lobos what time do you usually stream on twitch first game was great second is too except they sold out by adding monster chases and jump scares every few minutes fuck that shit brah frustrating as hell there is always a some part of story behind the recording room after each episode end and when you find yourself in this main room you missed them before while you were there how tf did you get through that door in the beginning when the perspective changed i really cant get through it if you gas to live in one game what would it be wow that was interesting this you have any issues with act 3 right after the maze section when you wake up again did the final room glitch out on you at all mines done it and no matter what i do i cant go further without fall through the map ich mag
